                        <para>- Apparently, the honorable member misunderstands the position regarding the quantity of textiles exported from this country. Exports are taking place on only a very limited scale; only about 2 per cent, of our production of textiles is sent abroad. Of course, a case may be propounded for continuing the export of textiles on a comparatively small scale in order to retain potential markets overseas. However, I shall have the question investigated, and if I find that too great a proportion of our textiles is being exported, corrective steps will be taken. </para>

Some of these were couched in terms which I regarded as somewhat uncivil. A demand was made that I should appear in Brisbane before the 12th March. I replied to the association stating that if it would furnish me with details of the matters which it wished to discuss with me, I would consider whether a visit to Brisbane for that  purpose  should be given priority over my many other ministerial activities. </para>

                        <para>- Recruiting was resumed on the 15th February last, and so far the response has been very satisfactory. The recruits attested number 2,400, including 250 ex-soldiers. These recruits have . been drafted to training camps. Those who have not had previous Army experience will be given three months##'## training prior to embarkation. Exsoldiers will be sent to their respective units, where they will be given a short refresher course and will then be drafted for garrison work in the islands. In addition, 4,000 members of the fighting services in base establishments in Australis with a low number of points have been removed from those positions and sent to training camps. It is estimated that 2,000 of them will be sent this month to Rabaul for garrison duty. The balance will be sent forward as soon as possible, because the Government realizes its great responsibility to return from the islands men who have not had leave for periods of from eighteen to twenty months, as well as many others who have been stationed there for between twelve and eighteen months. It is only reasonable that other men should be sent to the islands at the earliest possible date in order to relieve the men who have endured the heat and burden of the day in that tropical climate. </para>

Will he also indicate the original total value of military equipment which the Government has decided is to be destroyed or, dumped because it is considered to be economically valueless now that hostilities have ceased ? What types of equipment- have been included in the latter category? Will the Minister appoint a highly competent business man to investigate thoroughly Army dumping methods, and ensure the quick release of badly-needed supplies to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission? </para>

                        <para>- The question is rather lengthy and involved. I can, however, inform the honorable gentleman off-hand that representatives of the ##"## MasterGeneral of Ordnance and the Commonwealth Disposals Commission visited all areas in the islands to report upon the equipment, and to decide that which it would he economic to return to Australia and that which should be left to the jungle to devour, in order to relieve garrison troops who are maintaining and guarding the material. The task was rather a big one, but it is nearing, completion, if it has hot already been completed. I shall inquire as to. whether it is possible to obtain for the honorable gentleman information in regard to the original capital value of the material, its estimated second-hand value, the value of that which has been or is to be dumped,, and the value of that which is to bebrought .back to Australia. </para>

This factory was intended to meet war needs only, and as the productive capacity of the factory at Granville, operated by the Australian Aluminium Company, is far in excess of peace-time needs, it has been a matter of considerable doubt whether the Australian market for fabricated aluminium could also carry the Wangaratta factory. In any case, as Parliament has approved the establishment in Australia of the production of aluminium from bauxite, it is better that the aluminium should be fabricated close to the place where the aluminium is produced. This matter will receive the attention of the Government when the Aluminium Production Commission has completed its investigation as to the production of aluminium in Australia. </para>

                    <para>Meanwhile, an important Canadian firm, Bruck Silk Mills Limited, of Montreal. Canada, has been considering the establishment of rayon textiles production in Australia, and an Australian company is now to be formed with an authorized capital of ##Â£##1,000,000. The directorate will include important Australian manufacturing and marketing interests, and the majority of the shares will be subscribed by the Australian public. The introduction of the company##'##s operations into Australia was dependent upon the early availability of factory premises, and after prolonged negotiations it has been agreed that the Wangaratta factory is the most suitable for the purpose. </para>
                    <para>I am pleased to be able to announce to the House that a second large rayon textile industry is thus being established in Australia. It is probable that, in time, the development of the industry in Wangaratta will substantially increase employment in the town, leading to a corresponding increase of population, which will be in accord with the decentralization policy of the Commonwealth Government. It will also provide a use for more Australian wool, inasmuch as wool and rayon mixtures are to be produced in the factory. Finally, I invite the attention of honora.ble members to the fact that this is another example of the confidence of important overseas business concerns in the industrial future of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- General MacArthur has been good enough to make ships available to lift 22,300 Japanese from the islands. Some 11,000 have been removed from Wewak, 4,000 or 5,000 from the Solomons, and the balance from Australia. That will be a shuttle service, and it is hoped that additional ships will be made available. It is impossible to say when all the Japanese will be cleared from the islands, because on the cessation of hostilities, 340,000 Japanese came under the control of Australian servicemen, 140,000 in the New GuineaSolomons area, including 102,000 at Rabat##'## and 200,000 in the 8017180 area. Their removal will depend largely on the availability of ships, but the honorable member may rest assured that the Government will do everything possible to obtain extra shipping so as to expedite the return of those Japanese prisoners to their homeland and thus enable the release of Australian garrison troops in the islands. I am not aware of any mutiny of New Guinea natives attested in the forces, but I shall have inquiries made. </para>

                        <para>- I am not able at present to give any indication of when the decision on the Bretton Woods Agreement will be made by the Government. The agreement has been the  subject  of some consideration. An observer,  acting  on behalf of the Government, Professor Melville, is attending the first meeting associated with the Bretton  woods arrangements. At this stage I can only calculate what the minds of Ministers may .be on the subject, but I think it is hardly likely that further consideration will be given to it until a report lias been received from Professor Melville on his impressions formed at that conference. Just when that will be received I do not know. As the honorable member ##"##is aware, if the agreement is to be ratified by this country, ratification will be the responsibility of the Parliament, and the Government will naturally bring the agreement to Parliament if it decides that the agreement ought to be ratified. I cannot say- when that mar be. </para>

                </quote>
                <para>This protocol was signed in London by the representatives of the Governments of the Union of South Africa. Commonwealth of Australia, Belgium. Brazil, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Dominican##'## Republic, France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern IrelandHaiti, the Netherlands, Peru, Poland,. Portugal, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America,, including the Philippines, and Yugoslavia. This protocol is similar, in content to that signed on the 1st September. 1.944, and extends the International Sugar Agreement, which originally operated from 1937, for a further period of one year from the 1st September, 1945. In addition to the Governments which signed the last protocol, there are two new signatories, France and Yugoslavia. </para>
                <para>During the war, the operation of certain portions of the agreement, mainly those relating to the quota obligations, have been merely nominal, and the opportunity has been taken in this protocol todeclare such portions inoperative during the extended life of the agreement. Accordingly, the main purposes of the-  renewal of the agreement are to maintain the central machinery for the adjustment of international sugar supplies, and to gain time for the conclusion of a new scheme to meet the long-term problems of the industry. </para>

                            Maloney, the recently returned Australian Minister to Moscow, had addressed members of the New. South Wales Parliament, either as a group or as members of the Empire Parliamentary Association, and had given to them certain information concerning his stay in Russia. Will the Minister for External Affairs arrange for Mr. Maloney similarly to address the members of all parties in this House in order that they, too. may have the advantage of his intimate acquaintance with Russian conditions ?

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General stated yesterday that the postal revenue had increased from ##Â£##17,000,000 in 1939 to ##Â£##27,000,000 at the present time, and that the turnover had risen from ##Â£##185,000,000 to ##Â£##500,000,000. Will the Prime Minister, in the light of these facts, consider whether parcels sent from  Australia to the Ministry of Food in Great Britain may be sentpost free, and parcels sent by individuals in Australia to other individuals in Great Britain may be sent at a reduced rate instead of the high rate that now operates? </para>

                <para>At Potsdam in July last, it was decided by the three major powers to set up a council of five Foreign Ministers representing the United Kingdom, Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, United States of America, France and China. This council was to undertake the task of preparing the terms of peace with Italy and the satellite enemies in Europe. Part of the Potsdam decisions were worded with some degree of ambiguity. It gradually became clear, however, that there was no fixed intention on the part of the three major powers to call together a general peace conference representing all the smaller nations which had contributed substantially to the Allied victories in Europe. For a time it seemed likely that the conclusions or recommendations of the Council of Foreign Ministers would settle all basic issues affecting the general European peace settlement. </para>

                </subdebateinfo>
                <para>The Australian Government was unable to- acquiesce in this method of approach to the peace-making. Our policy with respect to Europe was and is founded on three basic principles which we are resolved to maintain - </para>
                <para>First, Australia as a belligerent in the European war was entitled to participate fully in decisions relating to the European peace settlements. I need only point to the fact that Australian fighting men have participated in two great European wars within a generation, and that ever since .1939 our nation and our fighting men have paid a heavy toll in the fight against Hitlerism and Fascism. The establishment of a  just and economic peace in Europe is essential to the security of Britain and all British dominions. In that sense  Ave  cannot contract out of Europe. </para>
                <para>Second, throughout the period of the war, we have accepted loyally the special position of the three major powers in the control and direction of  the war in Europe. We continue to recognize that these powers have a special responsibility for the maintenance of peace throughout the world. Therefore, they are entitled to exercise special rights. Their leadership is accepted. At the same time there was a duty to bring other directly interested belligerents into consultation on important peace arrangements, especially those affecting territorial adjustments. During the war, this principle was sometimes departed from. Notable examples are the Cairo declaration affecting the Pacific and the arrangements made at Yalta granting the Soviet Union territorial concessions in the Ear East in anticipation of its entering into the war against Japan. In neither case was there any prior consultation with belligerents outside the ##"##Big Three ##"##. I presume that no Australian can be found to justify such a procedure except upon the doubtful ground of urgent military necessity. </para>
                <para>Third, we consistently maintain the right of all active belligerents to a full share in the framing of the peace. Those who have contributed substantially to victory are entitled to make a corresponding contribution to the peace. This is the only fair and democratic method of making the peace; and a just method of making a peace settlement is as important as the settlement itself. </para>

                <para>Consequently, the proceedings of the Council of Foreign Ministers at London became of crucial importance in determining the procedure for the settlement of peace in Europe. The British Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attlee,</inline> fully recognized this. He stressed the need for constant and continuous personal consultation; between the United Kingdom Government and Australia, and invited our Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> to nominate a special representative to speak on behalf of Australia in. connexion with these great matters. </para>
                <para>The task having been entrusted to me, I arrived in London and remained there until late October. My main objective was to obtain support for the policy I have summarized and to suggest a practical procedure for achieving that policy,, either by enlarging the membership of the Council of Foreign Ministers so as to include other belligerents, or by having it expressly laid down that all thedeliberations of the Council were to beregarded as merely preparatory to a peace conference at which all active belligerents would be entitled to attend. </para>
                <para>Tho views and submissions of Australia were joined in by New Zealand and South Africa. They were publicly supported by Canada. As one consequence of the action of the four dominions, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa attended several small sessions of the Council dealing with the Italo- Yugoslav, frontier and with the problem of Trieste. So also did Yugoslavia and Italy. Opportunity was taken by me to submit to the Council the view? of. the British dominions to the##"## effect that the Council##'##s deliberations should be regarded as merely preliminary to a full peace conference for Europe, representing all the belligerents. </para>

This means that the Italian treaty will be drafted by the United Kingdom, the United States of America, the Soviet Union and France ; the treaties with Roumania, Bulgaria and Hungary by the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the Soviet Union; and the treaty with Finland will be drafted by. the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Secondly, the Peace Conference is to be hold at Paris during the month of May, 1946. It will be composed of the five members of the Council of Foreign Ministers, together with  all other members of the United Nations which actively waged war with substantial military forces against European enemy States. These nations comprise Australia, Belgium, Byelo-Russia, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia, Greece, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Yugoslavia and Ukraine. In all, twenty-one belligerents in the European war will be represented at the Paris Conference. </para>

                </para>
                <para>After completing my work in connexion with the Council of Foreign Ministers, I proceeded to Washington in order to attend the opening meeting of the Far-Eastern Commission. The general plan for the constitution of this Commission was agreed to previously in London, and the procedural suggestions which I made both to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Byrnes</inline> were provisionally adopted. Whilst I fully acknowledge the lead given by these two statesmen, Australia can justly claim to have taken a considerable share in the initiative which has resulted in the new Far Eastern armistice administration, and in the machinery for the planning of peace with Japan by more democratic and just procedures. </para>
                <para>From Australia##'##s point of view, the problem of a European settlement can never be regarded as so important or immediate as that of the settlement with Japan. The constant concern of the Australian Government must be to ensure that the treatment of Japan in defeat is such that it will not a second time rise as an aggressor by the methods perpetrated by Germany in 1939 after six years of almost open preparation for war. It is not that we seek revenge against Japan##'##s atrocious acts; wo seek justice, and we must strive for security against further aggression. </para>
                <para>In relation to Japan, we have held to the democratic principle we have invoked in relation to Europe; that is, that the nations which have made a substantial contribution to the defeat of enemy powers should also take a direct and active part in the armistice and the peace arrangements. After a preliminary skirmish, the proposal to exclude Australia and other belligerents from the armistice ceremony was promptly abandoned. Subsequently the Government has worked  unceasingly to ensure that, in the case of Japan, Australia will not only have a full opportunity to be heard and to participate in the peace making, but will play a principal part both in peace policy and armistice administration. </para>
                <para>Four years ago, at the request of the Australian and New Zealand Governments, a Pacific War Council was established in Washington so that the principal belligerents associated in the war against Japan would be. enabled, to consult at the highest level, not only on the question of war supplies for the Pacific theatres, including Australia, but also in preliminary considerations for the future peace settlement with Japan. The Pacific War Council well fulfilled its functions in relation to the provision of supplies for the South-west Pacific. In addition, Australia consistently pressed for the creation of an Allied body to continue the work of the Pacific partners in relation to the post-war period. Australia, therefore, warmly welcomed the willingness of the United States of America, expressed after V-J Day, to establish a . policy-making body for Japan, such a body being intended to include not only the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and China, but also Australia, New Zealand, and the other active belligerents against Japan.  Because of the importance of Far Eastern and Pacific policy to Australia, I attended all the meetings in the first session of the Commission at Washington. </para>

                <para>It was my belief that the early sittings of the Commission could demonstrate that final agreement could be reached if there was complete frankness, goodwill and untiring devotion by all representatives to the task in hand. The Commission began its work in an atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty. Members had no set terms of reference. The. proposed constitution and powers were vague. There was inadequate preparation. The Soviet Union refused to participate at all until the questions of the Control Council at Tokyo and that of the veto claimed by it were first settled. In spite of this, there were no less than ten nations represented on the Commission, including three major powers. The representatives settled down to hard work, and the heads of subjects upon which basic policy decisions were first required were agreed to. Ultimately, this determination to make the Commission work produced results. We established a basic policy committee which did me the honour of electing me as  chairman.  At the end of five weeks devoted almost entirely to consideration cf basic policy in relation to Japan in the light of the Potsdam Declaration, the Commission reached a stage where all ten representatives had unanimously agreed that the conclusions of the policy committee were fit for consideration and decision by the governments concerned. In the circumstances this was, I submit, a considerable achievement. It proved that in relation to the Japanese settlement international co-operation on a democratic basis could be effective. </para>

                <para>During the first phase of the Commission##'##s work the Australian delegation assumed much of the initiative. It made a large number of proposals on  basic  policy. The greater part of Australia##'##s proposed amendments received the general approval of the ten representatives. The basic document on which amendments were based was##'## the United States policy directive unilaterally declared in the form of an earlier instruction from the  President,  to the Supreme Commander. The main purposes of the Australian amendments to the directive were to emphasize the importance of bringing about the establishment of a truly democratic and peaceful government in Japan, to see that under the new regime individual liberties and civil rights would be protected without sham or pretence, and to secure the destruction of the economic bases of Japan##'##s military strength. </para>
                <para>We sought to stress the principle of the Potsdam Declaration requiring the total elimination of militarist influence and the removal from positions of influence in business as well as in the political life of Japan of all those who had led the people of Japan into aggressive warfare. In addition, we sought that the Potsdam  principle of punishing war criminals should be rigorously applied : we advocated that, as an important factor towards achieving real democracy, the right and freedom of association in workers##'## organizations should be a cardinal principle of Allied policy in Japan. We maintained that the large industrial and financial combines known as the Zaibatsu should be dissolved as incompatible with the achievement of democracy; and that industries which could be used for war purposes should be eliminated. </para>

                <para>Until such time as the Far Eastern Commission makes definite its policy for Japan, General MacArthur, as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, is controlling Japan within the framework of the existing post-surrender policy directive issued to him by the United States Government. That directive, as I have pointed out, was- the basic document of the Washington policy committee and a good deal of it is -contained in the policy document tentatively approved by the Commission at Washington in December last. This directive flows from the Potsdam Declaration which, it should be remarked, is an expression of Allied policy, and has not been made into an agreement with Japan. </para>
                <para>Since the first Washington sessions, the Far-Eastern Commission##'##s contribution has been revised by the three powers represented at Moscow in December last. The Far-Eastern Council has ceased to be purely an advisory body. It is now substantially an executive body. It was agreed at Moscow that the Commission, with head-quarters at Washington, will formulate and determine policy. The Allied Council for Japan with headquarters at Tokyo and under the chairmanship of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, will consult and advise General MacArthur on the implementation of the Commission##'##s policies. So, we have the policy-making body at Washington, which determines ##'##policy in principle; the implementation of policy is undertaken by the Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo. </para>

                </para>
                <para>The status which has been gradually accorded to Australia in these Pacific councils rs sufficiently proved by three important appointments of. distinguished Australians ; first, that of General Northcott as leader of all the British Commonwealth, occupational forces in Japan; secondly, that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Macmahon  Ball, representative on the Allied Council not only of Australia but also of the United Kingdom,##'## New Zealand and India; and, thirdly, that of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Webb, Australia##'##s War Crimes Commissioner, as  President  of the Allied Tribunal for the trial at Tokyo of Japanese major war criminals. </para>
                <para>The appointment of an Australian, on Australia##'##s nomination, to represent not only Australia but also other governments of the British Commonwealth, including the United Kingdom itself, is a development of great importance. At the time of the Balfour Declaration of 1926, equality of .status in international affairs between the United Kingdom and each of the self-governing dominions was asserted. But this principle was stated to be modified in practice by dissimilarity of functions in relation to matters of defence and foreign relations. In other words, the theory of equality was subject to the practice of inequality. I need not trace here the rapid development in practice of the activities of Canada and Australia in the international field between 1926 and 1946. It is sufficient to suggest that an entirely new concept in British Commonwealth relations is now emerging. This concept tends to reconcile .full dominion autonomy with full British Commonwealth co-operation. The same principle involves the possibility of a dominion acting in certain regions or for certain purposes on behalf of the other members of the British Commonwealth, including the United Kingdom itself. This is evidence that the machinery of co-operation between nations of the British Commonwealth has now reached a stage where a. common policy can be carried out through a chosen dominion instrumentality in- an area or in relation to a subject-matter which is of primary concern to that dominion. This principle <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> capable of extension, and suggests the possible integration of British Commonwealth policy at a higher level by a new procedure. Its importance is##'## very great and may rapidly increase. We appreciate the full support that we have received from the British, New Zealand and Indian Governments and also from the United States Government in these significant arrangements in relation to Japan. </para>

                <para>The Australian delegation was led by my colleague, the Minister for the Navy  and Minister for Munitions, <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> who will be making his own report to the House. Here, let me pay tribute to him and his colleagues for their able and untiring devotion to the mission to which they were assigned. I especially congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Makin</inline> on his election as first  President  of the Security Council. The fact is that, despite the forecasts of the sceptics and the men of ill-will, the United Nations is now successfully launched. Right at the outset the General Assembly and the Security Council had to face up to several acute problems arising out of the aftermath of World War IT. Several of the problems which came before the Security Council involved ##'## differences between some of the Great Powers themselves. There were critics who said that to bring such difficult issues before the United Nations at this stage would imperil the organization and therefore they should be shelved. Consistently with our attitude at San Francisco, Australia strongly opposed any such side-tracking. We considered that, if differences between powers, great or small, become acute, they should be brought into the open before the appropriate organ of the United Nations, discussed in the open and openly settled in accordance with the governing principles of justice and international law laid down in the Charter. From this point of view, it is a most hopeful sign that, though the peace settlements strictly so-called are outside the scope of the United Nations, so many problems arising directly out of war-time conditions should have been brought for adjustment in the United Nations, rather than reserved for small secret conclaves or for some <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline> Allied organization. </para>
                <para>Not all the issues brought before the Security Council have been finally settled. But the methods used in the effort to conciliate them have been those of frank public discussion and not those of the secret diplomacy and open power politics of the Munich days. No one can deny that the Security Council in the first fewweeks of ils life was put to a strenuous test. It faced up to that test and, as it gathers experience, will prove more and more capable of applying the principles of justice laid down in the Charter. </para>

                </para>
                <para>From our point of view the great feature of the London meeting of the General Assembly was the election of Australia to one of the three senior positions as a non-permanent member of the Security Council. At San Francisco, we joined with Canada in the struggle to lay down in the Charter the principle that, in the election of non-permanent members, the contribution of a nation to security should be a primary criterion. On this footing Australia was, in my view, clearly entitled to election in recognition of its outstanding contribution to the overthrow of tyranny in both world wars. Canada had a claim of equal validity and, in my view, both countries should have been elected. As it was, Australia was elected, and Canada made a graceful gesture to us in supporting Australia##'##s election at the final ballot. </para>
                <para>I was pleased to hear from my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Makin,</inline> that the Foreign Ministers of many countries with whom we had worked personally over long periods at San Francisco and at London had given steady support to Australia, despite the organization of a powerful ##"## ticket ##"## or list which would have excluded us from election, notwithstanding our indisputable claims. However, ##"## all##'##s well that ends well ##"##. I freely confess that I am deeply gratified at the great tribute thus paid by the United Nations to the objectives of Australian policy in war and in peace, and, above all, to the outstanding part the members of our fighting services have played in two world wars.. Having regard to all the circumstances, I regard the honour achieved by Australia, which also places a heavy responsibility upon us, as a culminating point in the carrying out of an external policy based upon principles openly proclaimed and vigorously pursued, not only in the interest of Australia and the British Commonwealth, but in a long and sustained attempt to carry into effect the great objectives of the United Nations laid down in the Atlantic Charter and other international instruments, especially the United Nations Charter and the agreement between Australia and New Zealand. A study of the terms of this agreement will show how marked an effect both countries have had in relation to some vital subjects dealt with in the agreement. From first to last New Zealand has been steadfast. We could scarcely have been elected to the Security Council without <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eraser##'##s</inline> vigorous advocacy. </para>

That function will require the negotiation of the world-wide network of special military agreements contemplated by Article 43 of the Charter. This task will be the main preoccupation of the Security Council during the next year. In the meantime the main function of the Security Council will be the settlement and adjustment of international disputes##'## by means of consultation and conciliation. It can prove an effective instrument for these purposes, providing that each of the five permanent members carries out its undertaking impliedly given at San Francisco and refrains from exercising its veto oppressively or capriciously. As is well-known, the policyof Australia was to deny the validity of the veto procedure in relation to the processes of peaceful settlement, as distinct from the processes of enforcement. In my views, some of the recent proceedings at London have demonstrated the soundness of the view advanced by Australia at San Francisco. </para>

The trusteeship system is to apply to such non-self-governing territories only as are placed under the system by voluntary agreements, concurred in by the States directly concerned and approved by the General Assembly. </para>
                <para>The Preparatory Commission of the United Nations recommended that the General Assembly should call on the States administering territories under mandate from the League of Nations to undertake practical steps, in concert with the other States directly concerned, for implementing article ##'##79 of the Charter, which deals with the negotiation and approval of trusteeship agreements, and thus inaugurating the trusteeship system. There are sound reasons for inviting the present mandatory States to take this initiative. They do not claim to possess the legal sovereignty of the mandated territories, or to be able to dispose of them as their own without restriction. On the contrary, though they exercise the exclusive right to administer the territories concerned, they do so subject to an existing system of international accountability, i.e., the mandatory system. The trusteeship system under the new Charter is intended to replace the scheme of accountability under the mandatory system. Having regard to the differences between the mandate system under the League and the trusteeship system under the United Nations, the Charter fully safeguards the position of the mandatory (States. First, article 77 declares in effect that it will be for subsequent agreement to determine which mandated territories shall be brought under the trusteeship system. Second, article 79 provides that the terms upon which a mandated territory ##'## is brought under the trusteeship system must be agreed to by the mandatory State. Third, article 80 lays down in substance that, pending the conclusion of a  trusteeship agreement in respect of a mandated territory, nothing in the Charter shall alter in any way the rights existing under the mandate. The position of Australia is safeguarded under  each of those provisions until a new agreement is negotiated and Australia becomes a party to such an agreement. </para>

The existing C class mandate will naturally provide the basis for the new agreement. It goes without saying, therefore, that, in order to be acceptable to Australia, the new agreement must, like the present mandate, designate the Government of Australia as the exclusive administering authority in the territory. Like the present mandate, it must also permit the ##"##territory to be administered as an integral portion of the territory of Australia and under Australian laws, subject, of course, to the general duty laid down in the Charter and also contained in the mandate to promote the welfare and advancement of the inhabitant. </para>

                    <para>In referring to the States with which trusteeship agreements are to  be negotiated, the Charter itself uses, but does not define, the phrase ##"## States directly concerned##"##. In the course of discussions as to the necessary parties to the agreements, the view of the Australian Government has been made quite plain. In my view, the States directly concerned are those States only which have an interest recognizable by international law in the sovereignty, control or disposition of a territory. That may seem very abstract, but no such agreement can be binding on Australia unless we make the agreement. The agreement must be negotiated with what are called the ##"## States directly concerned ##"##. Honorable members may recall that, at the Versailles Conference, Germany ceded its interests in many territories, including New Guinea, to the principal allied and associated powers, one of which at that time was the United States of America. There has always been a school of thought in international studies that the United States of America still has some sort of a residuary legal interest, or right to be consulted, iii connexion with those mandated territories. I do not agree with that. It has never been affirmed or accepted by us, and that is one reason why that phrase has been used. </para>

                <para>I draw attention to one vital difference between the mandate system under the League and the new trusteeship system under the United Nations. The terms of the mandates expressly prohibit the fortification of the territories. The assumption was that the mandated territories must be kept out##'## of the system of collective security envisaged by the Covenant. The Charter of the United Nations rests on the opposite principle. It expressly declares .that territories brought under the trusteeship system  are to play their appropriate part in the security arrangements to be established under the Charter. To this end, it pro- vides that the trusteeship agreement may designate the whole or any part of a trust territory as a strategic area. In bringing the Australian mandated territories under the trusteeship system, opportunity will accordingly be taken to eliminate a negative feature of the mandate system which in the past proved to be a grave danger to Australia. We shall accordingly ask for the right to establish bases, in. the interest of the security of Australia and of the South- West, Pacific Area. It was the provision in the existing mandates prohibiting any fortification which helped to give the Japanese so great an advantage in the early stages of the Pacific war. Despite assurances given to this Parliament by the government of the day, it is certain that in their own mandated territories the Japanese established naval and military bases m flagrant breach of the mandate ; and they did so with impunity. </para>

                <para>During 1945, in spite of difficulties caused by war commitments and drought conditions, procurement of supplies for Unrra went steadily ahead. More than ##Â£##7,000,000 of Australia##'##s ##"## first contribution has already been earmarked, principally for raw wool, manufactured woollen goods and surplus service stocks.  Unrra##'##s  needs in the current year will be ##"##much heavier than in 1945, and considerable funds will be required to meet those needs. Consequently, along with the United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, the Australian Government decided to make a second contribution. Owing to the difficult supply position in Australia this further contribution is subject to agreement between Unrra and Australia as to the form the contribution will take. </para>
                <para>The fourth meeting of the Council of Unrra will commence on the 15th March next. I stress that Australia is the fourth largest con-  tributor  to Unrra. This is an excellent record. It is clearly desirable that Australia should be represented on Unrra bodies at the highest level. Accordingly, at the forthcoming Council meeting, it is hoped that Australia will be elected to the Central Committee of the Council, which we propose should be enlarged from six to nine members. </para>

                <para>A conference for the establishment of an educational, scientific and cultural organization of the United Nations was held in London on the 1st November, 1945. This conference was held in accordance with the recommendations of the conference of San Francisco, in order to promote the aims outlined in article 1, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations. </para>

It is making arrangements for the first session of the general conference of the organization, probably in June. </para>
                <para>In considering the site of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Australia pressed for that of the United Nations, but it was resolved that Paris should be the headquarters. Australia favoured the close tie-up with the United Nations : It is proposed that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization should become associated with the United Nations as one of the specialized agencies referred to in Article 57 of the Charter. Effective co-operation is sought between the two organizations in the pursuit of their common purposes, but at the same time the autonomy of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization within the fields of its competence as defined in the constitution is recognized. The purposes cf the organization as laid down in the constitution stress the vital contribution which education and culture can make towards the firm establishment of international .peace. In recognizing the importance of extending popular education and the spread of culture as a means of achieving international collaboration, Australia is taking its full share of responsibility by  being  a signatory to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization constitution. </para>

Australia is represented on the Preparatory Committee for Refugees. </para>
                <para>In my view, the Assembly and the Council have already proved their value in the social and economic field. No other forum of equivalent standing existed, before January, where a crisis so alarming as the food situations in Europe and Asia, or a problem so difficult in its human and political aspects as that of refugees, could be fully and frankly debated. </para>
                <para>The working methods of the Assembly and other organs of the United Nations have begun to emerge. On a subject like . refugees, where deep differences appeared, --discussion and agreement on broad principles were essential. This agreement having been achieved in the full Assembly of 51 nations, the Economic and Social Council, which is a smaller working body of eighteen, could proceed to tackle the technical and organizational tasks. This, I believe, is a good precedent. </para>
                <para>Australia can take pride in being one of the main architects of the Economic and Social Council. At San Francisco the Australian delegation fought strong opposition to have the status of the body elevated, and to place real obligations upon it to foster better living standards and employment, without which international agreements will mean little to the peoples of the world. </para>

                <para>I now turn to several aspects of current Pacific questions. It is this area which will increasingly present the problems most immediate and vital to AustraliaAustralia is directly affected by events in Europe. But our stake in the Pacific is paramount. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said on one occasion that in the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand had taken primary risks, and therefore were entitled to a voice in the councils of a primary character affecting the Pacific. That is a view in which I entirely concur. The Australian Government has never relaxed for a moment in its determination to see this country participate as a party principal in all the international decisions that affect this area. Our efforts have had considerable success, but they cannot be lessened without danger to our future##'##. Australia stands to Asia, geographically and politically, in something of the same relationship as the United Kingdom to Europe, in such circumstances there is always a certain tendency to seek refuge in isolationism and baulk away from the problems that seem to have no obvious bearing on our way of life in this country. But like the United Kingdom in relation to Europe, Australia cannot afford to be insular in the Pacific </para>
                <para>By study of Pacific affairs, and through expansion of direct diplomatic and consular representation, Australia is setting out to make its own assessments of the problems of the Pacific. By so doing we may speak with a fresh, direct and independent voice in the councils of Pacific nations. It is our wish and intention to play a dynamic part in achieving, as a member of the British Commonwealth, a world comity. It is our destiny and duty to play that part in the Pacific. </para>

                <para>When the immediate problems arising out of the Armistice are being liquidated, the Allies will be faced with the task of making a lasting peace settlement for the whole Pacific area. Australia as a principal power in the Pacific is bound to play its part in ensuring that this vast area shall not again be ravaged by war. </para>
                <para>The questions involved are of great complexity and a satisfactory settlementwill require the most careful and frank consideration ##'##by all concerned. The Australian Government has made known to its Allies in the Pacific its conviction that it would be highly undesirable to deal with these questions precipitately or in a piece-meal fashion. </para>
                <para>In the first place, the Australian Government is fully conscious of the importance of making security arrangements in the Pacific. This is a matter in which account must be taken of the rights and interest of all the Allies, of the obligations attaching to membership of the United Nations, and of the##"## welfare of the peoples of the Pacific who are not yet self-governing. </para>
                <para>In particular, the Commonwealth Government will not be party to any hasty arrangements for the re-allocation of territory or the disposition of military bases in the Pacific. The Commonwealth Government does not recognize the claim that the acquisition of territory by force of arms confers a right to the retention of that territory. Australian fighting men have contributed to the common cause of victory in Europe and the Middle East, as well as in the Pacific. Moreover, Australia is at least as vitally concerned as any other nation in ensuring that provision shall he made for the future security of the Pacific. Our experience in the war is fresh in our minds. We recall the anxious days when all the British, Dutch and American bases to the north had fallen and the enemy was only just held back from Australia itself. The Government is very conscious, therefore, of its obligation to the people of Australia to ensure that such a threat shall never recur. </para>
                <para>The Government will enter into no commitments which will lessen the control of the Australian people over their own territories. Any consideration of plans for the joint use of any bases in ##'## Australia##'##s dependent territories should be preceded by an over-all defence arrangement for the region of the Western </para>
                <para class="block">Pacific, including the islands formerly mandated to Japan ; as an incident of any such arrangement, Australia should be entitled to reciprocal use of foreign bases in the region, thus providing for an overall increase in the security, both of Australia and of all other united nations  with interests in the region. </para>
                <para>The detailed means of implementing a security policy for the Pacific have yet to be decided, but this much is already apparent: Australian security is very largely dependent on our closest co-operation with the British Commonwealth and the United States of America. Any hindrance to the maximum degree of cooperation with either would be contrary to the interests of all these countries. It should be added that regional arrangements for defence are not only permitted but also encouraged by the Charter so long as the objectives are in accordance with the principles of the United Nations. </para>

                <para>Australia##'##s policy in relation to the dispute caused by Indonesian demands for self-government is to assist in settlement of the dispute and to discourage acts of provocation and violence which, by accentuating bitterness, would be calculated to prevent a just settlement. We have had special representatives in the Netherlands East Indies since V-J Day, including first <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmahon</inline> Ball and at present <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keith</inline> Officer. Both representatives have kept in close consultation with the British Military Command, the function of which is solely to carry out the armistice arrangements with Japan. The lines of a possible settlement of the dispute are indicated in article 73 of the United Nations Charter, by which each member has undertaken to assist its dependent peoples to increase their rights of self-government. Under article 73 everything depends on the stage of political development which has been and can be reached by the peoples concerned. What is appropriate to one territory may br entirely inappropriate to another. </para>
                <para>The most recent proposals of the Netherlands East Indies Government seem to me to mark a great, advance towards a satisfactory settlement. Whilst. Dutch sovereignty is retained, provision is made for a great increase in local self-government, and the proposals also envisage the ultimate admission of an Indonesian Commonwealth into the United Nations. The Dutch proposals are expressly based on article 73 of the Charter, and our special representative in the Netherlands East Indies is doing what is possible to assist the special British political representative now mediating between the parties with a view to a just settlement. </para>
                <para>Australia has a vital interest in the preservation of the war-time friendship with the Dutch in relation to the Netherlands East Indies. At the same time it is important to do everything possible to establish good relations with the Indonesian and other dependent peoples of the world who are advancing towards a far greater degree of self-government. These have been actively encouraged by the declaration in the Atlantic Charter of 1941, to which all the United Nations subsequently subscribed.. France has succeeded in making satisfactory settlements in relation to some of the peoples of IndoChina., and it is to be hoped that a settlement will soon be reached in relation to the Netherlands East Indies. </para>

                <para>The Regent##'##s proclamation asserted that this declaration##"## of war- had been made contrary to the will of the Siamese people and in violation of the constitution and laws of Siam. The Siamese Government therefore repudiated the alliance with Japan on the 21st December, 1941, and all other treaties, pacts or agreements concluded between Siam and Japan. It also afforded assistance to the forces of the Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia; it surrendered British territories it had occupied in Burma and Malaya, and it caused the apprehension as war criminals of leading Siamese who had inveigled Siam into its unfortunate and disastrous association with Japan. Siamese governments in office since the surrender of the Japanese have been disposed to co-operate fully with the Allies, and have sought to re-establish the relations existing before the war between the British and Siamese peoples. </para>
                <para>That association, which we had hoped might have grown into a firm alliance between Australia and Siam during the last war, was shattered not by any action on our part or on the part of the United * Kingdom, but ##'##by the acquiescence of the Siamese people in the domination of Siam by a group which made Siam a mere puppet m the hands of Japanese militarists, led Siam to declare war on Great Britain, and finally obliged Australia to declare war on Siam. </para>

These preliminary terms had received careful consideration from  His  Majesty##'##s Ministers in Australia and, after acceptance by the Siamese, were formally approved by the Government on the 18th January a? the basis for a final peace agreement or settlement.

                <para class="block">Future of International Co-operation. </para>
                <para>A realistic review of the international situation discloses so many unsolved problems that a considerable degree of pessimism is now sweeping the world. This pessimism has not been lessened by the temporary failure to solve at London the problems of Iran, Greece or Indonesia. In no one of -these cases did the Assembly initiate any discussions, and the Security Council##'##s attention was devoted solely to the question of whether international peace was being threatened. Other and deeper questions were involved, for example, a just Indonesian settlement, but these were deemed outside the jurisdiction of the Security Council. The Security Council cannot deal with any problems unless it is satisfied that there is a threat to international security. Its jurisdiction depends on that fact being found. Take the Indonesian situation. The overwhelming view of the members of the Council was that in that matter no threat to international security was involved. How could it have been? The British forces in Indonesia were there in accordance with the armistice arrangements. The Charter of the United Nations provides that in carrying out the armistice the Security Council has no jurisdiction, but that, of course, still leaves unsettled the great problem as to what future arrangements are to he made in that area between the Dutch and their Indonesian subjects. </para>
                <para>I shall refer now to several matters raised at an earlier stage of the proceedings of the House, and especially to import^ ant remarks by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> I have pointed to the undoubted pessimism.. We notice day by day the press accounts of the international situation, and we observe this pessimism on all sides. What is the cause of it. What are the facts? . We fire still in the middle of the period of transi tion from war to peace. The war is over in the sense that the enemy has given up resistance on the battlefield. The war, however, is not over in the sense that the catastrophic effects of the war are removed. Not all enemy forces have yet been disarmed. Hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops still have to be transferred from territory to territory. Displaced civilian populations have still to be settled in the countries from which they came. On all hands is seen evidence of the physical destruction caused by the war. Cities have been devastated and transport systems disorganized. Food shor.tages have made the task of feeding even Allied populations one of supreme difficulty. Above all, the Fascist enemy, defeated on the battlefield, is almost certainly organizing underground for a future resurgence. </para>
                <para>In these circumstances, it would have been a miracle if the cessation of actual hostilities had##"## given rise immediately to an era of peace and security. It is natural for populations which have suffered the privations of war to expect an immediate and dramatic improvement in their material conditions when hostilities cease. Actually, of course, such a sudden change is impossible. It is necessary that this should be fully understood##'## in order to counteract any feeling of frustration or disillusionment because the fruits of victory have not yet been gathered. </para>
                <para>Again, when hostilities cease, there is a tendency for Allied countries which have acted in almost complete unity during the war to become more aware of, and to accentuate, differences in outlook which by resolute and brilliant leadership had ##'##been submerged during the crisis of war. It is particularly easy to concentrate upon these points of differences and to accept them, not only as vital, but as being without remedy. In my view, this is a most dangerous attitude of mind. It can lead only to disaster, if it is unchecked. I have in mind, in particular, criticisms of the Soviet Union, without whose magnificent contribution complete victory over Hitler would have been either long delayed, or impossible. Whilst the British Commonwealth has fairly been said to have saved the Soviet Union in. 1939 and 1940, equally the Soviet is claimed to have  saved the British Commonwealth in 1941 and 1942. In truth, the unity in war-time of these powers and the United States saved the whole world from Fascist dictatorship. </para>
                <para>A chief factor which has created. doubts as to the peaceful intentions of the SovietUnion is its expansion, both territorially and in zones of special influence since 1939. The basic fact of expansion is undoubted. During the crisis of war, both  President  Roosevelt and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> entered into agreements giving the Soviet Union considerable territorial gains, not. only in Western Europe, but also in the Far East. Most of these arrangements for territorial expansion were made by the United Kingdom and the United States of America alone, and without prior reference to their allies. They were made primarily in the belief that the Soviet Union would be a trusted and peace-loving ally, not only in time of </para>
                <para>War  hut in time of peace. Surely that belief is not yet given up ! </para>
                <para>The real question is, not whether the Soviet Union territory and zones of influence have expanded, but what is the underlying intention and purpose of the Soviet Union. Is it to secure the political domination of other countries, or is it merely to protect Russia against any repetition of the so-called <inline font-style="italic">cordon sanitaire</inline> which united all reactionary influences in Europe against it during the period between the two great wars? Is it aggressive in substance, or defensive in substance? That is the great question. It will not be forgotten that in the Munich era of appeasement of Hitler and his Axis associates, there was the greatest inclination on the part of some Western democracies to isolate the Soviet Union and to hail Hitler as the saviour of civilization against the so-called Bolshevik hordes. </para>

                        <para>- Surely that is a matter within the knowledge of the honorable member. I think it is clear that throughout the whole era of appeasement from 1933, when Hitler came into power, to 1 939, the tendency of the Western democracies, that is to say, France and Great Britain, was to take this attitude towards Russia. </para>

                            <para>- It is all very well for the right honorable gentleman to say that. I could quote some of his own speeches in support of my contention. The then Governments of those democracies are no longer in power, and there can be no repetition of that. I am seeking to analyse what is the essence of the problem  raised the other day in the House by the right honorable member for North Sydney, and I repeat that, in the Munich era of appeasement of Hitler and his Axis associates, there was the greatest inclination on the part of some Western democracies to isolate the Soviet Union, and to hail- Hitler as the saviour of civilization against the so-called Bolshevik hordes. I could produce dozens of quotations in support of my contention. I am saying that Russia, between the two wars, was treated as outside the pale, and was not brought into an alliance against Hitler. Until Hitler actually attacked Soviet Russia, no arrangement with it was entered into by the Western powers. I am surprised to hear that that has been denied. I am not speaking of any particular government - it is a matter of history. </para>

J It is important to ##"##note that some of those who, between 1933 and 1939, first endured, then pitied, and, finally, embraced Hitler and most of his works, are now to be found amongst those who are prepared to join forces at once against the Soviet Union without any important investigation as to whether its expansionist policy is aggressive or defensive in intent##'##. ^ </para>

                    <para>A second factor in the situation is the very recent application of atomic energy to war-like purposes. An agreement was made between Britain and the United States of America in relation to the new discovery and in that arrangement, the Soviet Union was not included. Therefore, suspicion amongst the three major powers is not confined to suspicion of Russia, but it includes also suspicion by Russia. Whether the suspicions are justified or not is beside the point. On the one hand we know that on the part of the peoples of the British Common^ wealth and the United States of America there is no aggressive intention against Russia. But the Soviet Union points to the long era of appeasement, when Russian attempts to make the League of Nations an effective body were continued right up to the point of virtual liquidation of the League at Munich. The period of mutual suspicion seemed to end either in June,  1941,  when direct aggression against Russia made it our ally, or in  1942,  when the twenty-year treaty of friendship between Russia and Britain was##'## signed at London. </para>
                    <para>Now having lived through the great period of war-time partnership which promised a permanent understanding between the three great powers on all fundamentals, one is presented almost daily with the monotonous question - does Russia intend aggression? ^Having no clear evidence to the contrary and having during the last four years come to know some of Russia##'##s greatest statesmen^ take the view that the Soviet Union##'##s policy is directed towards self-protection and  security against future attack. J Un my opinion, its desire is to develop its own economy and to improve the welfare of its peoples. That is my view; perhaps it is wrong J One must arrive at some conclusion in These matters or it is impossible to move ahead with any policy: That is the opinion upon which I act. </para>
                    <para>Whilst this pessimism with regard to relations with Russia seems to be unjustified, there is also widespread pessimism in relation to the activities of Fascist-led dictatorships in several other ^ countries. Matters of essentially domestic concern do not usually come within the purview of the United Nations. Constitutional changes##'## are expected to come from within a country. But it is equally true and recognized in the United Nations Charter that Fascist developments in any one country which are likely to cause a breach of international peace are a matter of concern to the Security Council and the </para>
                    <para class="block">United Nations, and their jurisdiction over such developments is undoubted. </para>
                    <para>I believe that in all these cases first the facts and then the remedies must be sought through the United Nations, its Assembly, and its Security Council. The greatest difficulty is to ascertain the facts of each dispute. S&lt;3 far no investigation has been undertaken by or under the authority of the .Security Council. Temporarily, compromises have been made, but the full facts in relation to disputes or situations have hot been elicited. </para>
                    <para>In these difficulties, the two most hopeful signs are first the almost miraculous success of the Allies in the. war, and second, the fact that in a short period of less than twelve##'## months, the Charter of a new world organization has been created and the organization itself has come into being. Fifty-one members of the United Nations have pledged themselves to support the principles laid down iri the Charter, and the work of putting the principles into practice has begun. By these principles all the nations .undertake to refrain from aggression and to bring disputes before the United Nations for adjustment. </para>
                    <para>It is not difficult to find some flaws in the Charter itself. Neither will it be difficult to prove that the machinery of the United Nations is hot being used as effectively as it might. The important thing, however, is that a Charter does now exist, and that a world organization has been set up under which the habit of international conciliation and Consultation can and must be developed. It is the duty pf all of us to encourage the habit, of reference to the United Nations, because frequent contact between its members will lessen active suspicion and gradually encourage positive confidence and trust. The recent speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attlee</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevan</inline> on the proceedings before the Security Council rightly emphasize the importance of personal contact and frank exchange of views as a step towards more complete understanding. </para>
                    <para>I do not suggest that this analysis gives any reason for complacency. On the contrary, I think that we need to remind ourselves constantly that the winning of the peace needs a sustained effort, probably no less than did. the winning of the War: Fascism and Hitlerism were not ended with the deaths of Mussolini and Hitler. They are insidious philosophies which we sought to overthrow during the war. In my opinion they have not been finally defeated either in international or in domestic affairs. </para>
                    <para>Australia has consistently maintained the view that the United Nations organization should be given the fullest possible support by each member. By this means, a collective world opinion can gradually be built up, and it may also be possible to avoid the establishment of rival <inline font-style="italic">blocs</inline> of powers viewing one another through an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion. This policy will.be pursued by Australia * in the Security Council, where every effort will be made to ensure full ##'##discussion of international disputes as and when they arise. In this respect, the initial meetings of the Security Council were remarkably successful. . There was free, full and frank discussion at which the public was present. Those who had claimed that the Security Council would meet in secret and avoid a public discussion were confounded by, the event. </para>
                    <para>Even full and public discussion is not enough. Indeed, it may degenerate into mere assertion followed by mere counterassertion, charges followed by countercharges. There should, therefore, in most cases, .be- a careful investigation of the truth of the assertions and the charges and a true assessment of -the facts by the Security Council or other United Nations agencies, followed by a just recommendation or decision. This procedure would be in ##'## accordance -with##'## the true spirit of the. Charter of the United Nations. That is the organization which was established by all its members for the very purpose of discouraging isolated or limited alliances in favour of collective action in accordance with the principles of justice and law laid down in the Charter. The main purpose of the United Nations is security against war. With atomic energy being used for purposes of unlimited destruction, a new world war would cause devastation almost beyond human imagination and would, end modern civilization as we know it. </para>
                    <para>Special prerogatives and privileges have been vested in the major powers by the United Nations organization. Their mutual confidence is  an  essential  feature  of the new international order. Those who by a calculated policy sow distrust##"## between them endanger the life of the United Nations. Those who endanger the life of the United Nations threaten our chief bulwark against a third world war. </para>

                        <para>- When the House adjourned on Friday last some discussion had occurred on the incident of the ship <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> and the passengers - men, women and children - it took out of Australia. Up to the time that the House adjourned, although there had been very widespread indignation and profound public interest in this matter, the Government had put one view fairly consistently. Two Ministers had spoken in the House, namely, the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> . They said, in effect, ##"## It is quite true that this ship has gone out crowded with far more people than we would ever dream of putting into such a ship if we were in charge of these matters, but it is also  true that this is a matter which is outside our control ##"##. So far as those Ministers were concerned when offering their defence in this House, the##'## number of people to be loaded on the ship, the conditions under which they were accommodated, as well as the instructions for sailing and the course and destination of the vessel, were all matters in the exclusive control of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, General MacArthur. That was the view that was put by Ministers not only in words but also by conduct, because everybody will recall that on Wednesday of last week when this matter began - when the conditions of this ship were brought to the notice of {he Minister for the Army - the ship had not sailed. </para>

                <para class="block">I draw special attention to the Minister##'##s use of the word ##"## exclusively ##"##, as, in his opinion, it exonerated the Government from all responsibility. Honorable members will see that the whole force of the Government##'##s.defence was, in effect, ##"## It is a pity about this matter, but we cannot order an inquiry into it. We cannot order this ship into any Australian port. We really can do nothing about it,- because all the responsibility for all these matters rests upon the Supreme Commander who happens to be a distinguished American General ##"##. That was the position when we left here on Friday afternoon. Since then some remarkable events have occurred. General MacArthur, who was  prayed-in-aid  by the Minister for the Navy on Friday, has turned out not to be  the sure defence that he was expected to be, because he has spectacularly contradicted the whole story put forward by the Government. So far from agreeing that it was his command which was responsible for the number of persons to be loaded on the ship, and the conditions under which they -were to travel, he has made it perfectly clear that everything was an Australian responsibility, excepting that it was his command which had agreed to furnish a vessel with a designated capacity. In other##'## words, the Supreme Command produced a ship. If the <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> was in -Australian waters it was there  because of the action of the Supreme Allied Command, but matters -such as who should be put on the ship and the conditions under which they would travel, the arrangements for sailing and the direction of its course, were within Australian control just as much as they would be in the case of any other ship leaving an Australian port. Consequently, since this House last met we have been presented with one of the most remarkable conflicts that have emerged in recent years between responsible people under one great allied friendly power and responsible Ministers in this country. I have summarized the matter in that way; let me now quote a few words from the statement issued from General MacArthur##'##s head-quarters. I will not read the lot of it, but I quote these words - </para>

Tt has been stated that authorities in Japan may be responsible. This is completely erroneous.

There is a real feeling of indignation about this matter. ##'## The people of Australia have the right to know who was responsible for this, which, at the best, was a shocking bungle, and, at the worst, was a horrible scandal. Who was responsible for it? At the moment, all we have before us is conflict, because the Government assumed a certain defence last week, and that defence has been struck away from under it by some other authority to which it appealed. If the Ministers, in making their statements to the House last week, were correct in their view, and General MacArthur##'##s statements are wrong, then the Ministers must take the first opportunity of proving to this House that they were right and General MacArthur wrong. But if Ministers were wrong: in the statements they made, if, in fact, the position is as General MacArthur describes it, then the other question arises : How did they fall in to the error of stating to ##"##this House a position which has now been completely disproved ? Did they merely recite to this House what they were told by other people? If they did, do they regard that as a proper discharge of their duties in a matter of this kind? If they did,  again,  who were those people? Let this matter be probed =o that we shall discover, first, who was responsible for the conditions aboard this ship and, secondly, who in point of fact, was responsible for the extraordinary statement of responsibility made to this House by those two Ministers on behalf of the Government. </para>

                <para>The next thing that happened during the week-end was that the Prime Minister announced that a committee had been appointed. Nobody knows how. Nobody knows with what terms of reference it has been despatched to Rabaul, and despatched there with so little promptitude that, wind and weather not permitting immediate arrival, it got there well after the ship in question. In other words, the committee appointed to investigate this ship on its arrival, ultimately will investigate it not on arrival, but at least 24 hours after its arrival, indeed, almost after its departure, judging by at least one report published this morning. Here is a body that is to be regarded simply as a government committee appointed for this purpose with terms of reference which are not public terms of reference. It has gone there to have a look at a matter which is of first-class public interest, and the first thing the Prime  Minsietr <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> did, and his colleagues agreed with him, was to say to the press, without whose publications these matters would not have ##'##become known, ##"## You must keep away.

The exclusion of the press representatives from a point at which they would normally have been allowed to arrive, the exclusion of the pressmen from their normal privilege and responsibility of reporting matters of public interest amounts - and there is no other word for it- to censorship clamped clown in time of peace. We have had many discussions in this House about censorship. It is one thing to censor a newspaper report by having an official who runs a blue pencil through it, but it is a much more effective censorship to say that the newspaper shall not report at all. The press has been told, ##"## You must not go; you must stay back in Australia, and. as for information about the conditions on this ship, which has excited so much attention, you shall accept what our committee has to tell you and nothing else.##"## There you have a thoroughly dictatorial attitude to this matter, a.nd I say to the Government that it will satisfy nobody. It certainly will, not satisfy honorable members in this House who have an open mind on the matter. It certainly will not satisfy the public of Australia. Honorable members opposite will make a very grave blunder if  they  suppose that this is just some little newspaper agitation. Every honorable member knows that wherever he has gone  since this incident came to knowledge be has encountered a genuine moral indignation about it. </para>

If the attitude of the Government and honorable members opposite is that this agitation is unreal, that all this talk about these inhuman conditions is mere sob-stuff, that it does not matter what we do to a gathering of Formosans and Koreans and women and children - if that is their attitude, then I can only express my astonishment that the Government thought fit to send a committee to Rabaul at all. But it did so; and it thought fit to exclude the press from ally share of knowledge of what was going on. If ever a government showed that it regarded a problem as vastly important from its own point of view, this- Government has done so in respect of this matter. Yet, in respect of the things that count - the truth as to authority, the truth as to the conflict between this Government and the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, the truth as to why this ship was ever allowed to leave, and the truth as to why it was not ordered back - all these things are things upon which the people demand inquiry; and I regard myself not only as Leader of the Opposition, but also as their spokesman in making that demand in this House. </para>

                <para>The fact of the matter is that we did not send two messages asking to have the loading of the ship increased while it was in Sydney. We sent one message, and that request was refused. And it was refused quite rightly by the American people, because, as I have contended all along, they were controlling the movements of the ship. What we did in the second message was to ask the American authorities whether it was possible for the ship to call at Moresby and transport 250 Formosans from Moresby to Rabaul. That was on its southern voyage, and not after it had reached Sydney. General MacArthur, in his signals to me, makes that point clear. We did not keep insist ing that an additional 250 persons should be embarked at Sydney. The Leader of the Opposition said that <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> was overloaded at Sydney, and that protests against the overcrowding were made to the Government. The right honorable gentleman also said that the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> had early information about the matter. I understand that during the afternoon the Minister did receive some statements about some overcrowding on this ship. I do not know from what source the statements emanated, but I understand that they were official. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for the Army, who will speak later, is quite able to defend himself. When I heard about the position at dinner-time, I asked the Minister about it. From dinner-time till midnight he sought to discover from all sources whether any sound reason existed, as the ship had only a short passage to Rabaul where an examination of the conditions could be made, to justify recalling <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki.</inline> Our information was obtained from reputable and reliable officers. Let us forget for a moment that <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> was under American control. I say frankly that if I had had to decide, on the information available, whether the ship should be recalled, I would then have said, ##"## Let the vessel continue on its voyage ##"##. I do not wish to run away from responsibility for any decision of that kind. Not for a moment do I pretend that vessels which carry soldiers and prisoners of war to many parts of the world are not jammed with personnel wherever they go. More than 2,000,000 Japanese nationals must be returned from China to the Japanese islands. Recently, in Melbourne, the <inline font-style="italic">Daiku</inline><inline font-style="italic">Maru</inline> embarked a large number of passengers, including women and children. I do not attempt to disguise the fact that all these ships, including our own troop-ships, are jammed or crowded with personnel. That is due to the acute shortage of shipping throughout the world. The information which I received on the evening of the departure of <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> from Sydney, was compiled by men in the services, whom </para>

                <para>Mr.CHIFLEY. - Wherever these ships travel, they are heavily loaded with personnel. On that information, which I received from reputable officers, the Government decided that <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> should continue its voyage, and in the House that night a Minister made a statement indicating that conditions aboard the vessel would be investigated at Rabaul and that if changes were considered to be necessary after that short voyage, they would be made, and the women and children would be disembarked at that point. For that decision, I make no apology. Despite all the drama that may be injected into this incident, the Government, in the circumstances, acted in a proper manner. There may be certain aspects regarding the embarkation in Sydney which should be and will be investigated. The Government must rely on the judgment of its officials. They all cannot be inhuman. The officers responsible for the embarkation are Australians - our own fellow-citizens. Is it suggested that they all are entirely devoid of humane f eelings ? Yet honorable members opposite are telling the world that leading officers of the services, naval and military, are entirely devoid of humane feelings! </para>

I do not pretend that there would not be some crowdingon the ship. When those Formosans and Koreans leftAustralia <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> to their native land they were well fed and well clothed. They were called upon to suffer, if honorable members liketo say so, the same in- convenienceas soldiers all over the world suffer when they are sent overseas.

To-day he has endeavoured to extricate himself from the position in which he has been placed by his Ministers and officers.

                <para>The Prime Minister said he had no wish to enter into recrimination with General MacArthur. He has been too long at the game to overlook the wisdom of fighting within his own division. The right honorable gentleman commenced by endeavouring to explain to the House the general principle that had been established by the Australian and American authorities in regard to the transport of repatriates from Australia. He cited an agreement reached at a conference held so far back as the Sth November, 1945, and communicated to General MacArthur##'##s Head-quarters by Australian Army headquarters in the following terms: - </para>

But what is the position with regard to this particular matter? General MacArthur notified the Australian authorities that a certain vessel was being sent to pick up a number of repatriates. This was done and as a consequence, cables have passed between the American and Australian military authorities. First, General MacArthur cabled that General Head-quarters Allied Powers in Japan did not accept any responsibility for the repatriation of enemy nationals, prisoners of war, or others, from the Australian zone other than to furnish the vessels with a designated passenger capacity, and that all details of the loading of the vessels - the actual selection of the passengers, their assignment, and all other matters incidental to their passage - were entirely the responsibility of the Australian Forces which functioned entirely under their own command.

                        <para>- That is not so. The vessel was allowed to proceed on its original course. When it reached Rabaul the extra passengers were disembarked. That, in itself, is a complete condemnation of this Government, which is now required to explain why it has allowed such a stigma to be placed on the fair name of Australia. Why was the vessel allowed to proceed to Rabaul after questions had been raised concerning it when it was only a few miles out from the mainland of Australia? When the vessel reached within 3 miles of Rabaul the authorities removed from it 350 women, children and heads of families, and their place was taken by 294 men from Rabaul who had been in a concentration camp there. That made the total number on board the vessel 949, which was only one more than General MacArthur directed should be accommodated. The Government will have to explain why it consented to such an inhuman act of overcrowding as occurred on this boat. It stands condemned for having allowed to be cast on the fair name of Australia a stigma which will remain on our political record for generations. </para>

                    <para>.- The Prime Minister (Mr.Chifley) has effectively replied on behalf of the Government, to the extravagant statements made, for political propaganda purposes, concerning the circumstances under which the Japanese destroyer <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> sailed from Australia. The facts are that the vessel carried from Australia 1,005 Formosans, Koreans and Formosan civilian internees, including209 women and children. Of this total 573 Formosans and Koreans fought in the Japanese Army against the Allied troops in the Pacific area. They and their fellow countrymen and their forefathers had been Japanese nationals since 1890, but had, since the cessation of hostilities, asked to be treated as Chinese, as Formosa and Korea will now go back to the control by China under the Cairo agreement. The question of the embarkation of these Formosans and Koreans who, during the war. were classified as Japanese nationals,  was  not dealt with  on a ministerial basis but through service channels. </para>

                <para>Unfortunately many completely misleading statements have been uttered and many altogether unjustifiable allegations made. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said, in the course of his speech, that, as Minister for the Army, I knew about this matter before the ship left Australia. That is not true. The last I had heard of these people prior to the sailing of the ship was that they were still at Tatura and Cowra camps. The first message that I had on the subject of overcrowding reached me at. 2.40 p.m. on ##"##Wednesday afternoon, and I have witnesses who can testify to the time. It was in the form of a press inquiry in the corridor. I had my military secretary, Captain McDermott, with me at the time. I was then told that some criticism had arisen over the embarkation of these people from Sydney. Although the House was about to meet I immediately instructed Captain McDermott to telephone to Lieutenant-General Berryman, General Officer Commanding Lines of Communication, Sydney, a very distinguished officer.##'## Probably no man has a better military record in this war than Lieu tenant-General Berryman.I asked Captain McDermott to ascertain the facts. He subsequently furnished me with the following report, based on information supplied to him by LieutenantGeneral Berryman and Brigadier Prior :  - </para>

I also made a check on the information supplied to me by my Military Secretary. I myself contacted Lieutenant-General Berryman and Brigadier Prior, and they gave me an assurance that the information that I had obtained from my Military Secretary was absolutely correct. Lieutenant-General Berryman said that he could see no reason why the ship should be recalled. I did not even let the matter rest there, for I was on the trunk telephone line until nearly midnight. I endeavoured to raise the Navy Transportation Officer, Commander Knight, but he could not be located.With the permission of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> I communicated, on Thursday morning, as Acting Minister for Defence, with Admiral Moore, the . Naval Officer in charge at Sydney, and asked him whether Commander Knight, who had travelled down the harbour on <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> on Wednesday afternoon, was present, and he said that he was. I asked him to ascertain from Commander Knight how he had found conditions on this ship and what the spirit of those on board was when he left it. Repeating Commander Knight##'##s statement, Admiral Moore said that Commander Knight found that, after the Chinese Vice-Consul had addressed the passengers on board and assured them that they were bound for Formosa, and not for Japan, their whole outlook seemed to change completely and that going down the harbour everybody on board seemed to be in good spirits. Admiral Moore said that Commander Knight had further stated that the Japanese captain had said r,o him that he was quite satisfied with tie conditions and felt sure that the passengers would be safely landed at their destination. I also asked Admiral Moore whether, in view of the information he had, he .would recommend that the ship be allowed to proceed on its course to the first island port of call where an examination could be made, or whether he would recommend that the ship should be recalled to an Australian port. Admiral Moore said he could see no justification for recalling the ship and that it should be allowed to go on its course to the first island port of call, distant a few days voyage. Admiral Moore also stated that from information he had received he was satisfied that the whole matter had been grossly exaggerated and that, in his opinion, everything would be quite satisfactory on the ship. My other advisers, Lieutenant-General Berryman and Brigadier Prior, both gave me the same advice and expressed the opinion that, there was no justification for recalling the vessel. </para>
                <para>This is not a .matter that I have dealt with by myself. I have had frequent consultations with the Prime Minister, the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for the Navy and the Minister for Immigration. There was the closest collaboration by us on those matters, and the decisions made are our joint responsibility. </para>
                <para>Certain factors in regard to this incident have been highlighted recently in  the  press to the. effect that the Australian army authorities twice sought permission r.o exceed the allotted quota, that these requests had been twice specifically refused, and that, notwithstanding this, he army authorities had exceeded by 57 the number of passengers authorized by General MacArthur. </para>
                <para>From the information that has already been disclosed by the Prime Minister, it i- clear that one request only was made  10  the Head-quarters of the Supreme Command in regard to additional passengers, and this was purely an exploratory message to obtain information as to whether <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> could take on additional passengers at Port Moresby for Rabaul. In regard to all other vessels which bad been made available by the Headquarters of the Supreme Command, the standard passenger carrying capacity of naval and marine vessels had been indicated/but this information had not been furnished in regard##'## to <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> because it was not included in the vessels- providing the shuttle service which is being utilized between Japan and the Pacific islands under Australian control, but was a vessel specially allotted for one journey to proceed to Australia to repatriate the Formosans and Koreans who were held on the Australian mainland. When the vessel was allotted, the total number of Formosans and Koreans- both prisoners of war and internees - was 948. After the vessel had been allocated to Australia, the movement of Japanese subjects from internment camps to points of embarkation in. Australia had begun, and applications were thereupon received from quite a number of these people who had been classified as Japanese, claiming that they were, in fact, Formosans and Koreans. After investigation of their claims, ##'##57 of them were approved and were transferred from the Japanese sections and included among the Formosans and Koreans, with the result that, in the fortnight prior to the arrival of <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> in Australia, the number of Formosansand Koreans had been increased from 94S to 1,005. The Deputy AdjutantGeneral, whose responsibilities include all matters associated with prisoners of war and enemy internees in Australia, directed that the -1,005 Formosans and Koreans should he located in Sydney in accordance with the directions which had already been received from the Supreme Command Head-quarters for the concentration of Formosans and Koreans at that port for the purpose of embarkation. The Deputy Adjutant-General advises that, whilst he was fully aware of the later message from Supreme Head-quarters that the ship would be unable to take on 250 additional Formosans and Koreans at. Port Moresby, he assumed that there was not such a fine margin in the vessel##'##s capacity that the relatively small number of 57 more could not be taken. In the light of after events, it can be appreciated that his decision is to he criticized, but </para>
                <para class="block">I doubt whether even the most fully informed person at the time, without a knowledge of after events, would have queried his decision to send them on rather than leave 5##'##7 Formosans and Koreans in Australia to be repatriated at some future distant time, if and when a special vessel could be made available to make the long journey south to repatriate them, it not being possible under the orders issued to include them with Japanese for repatriation. The embarkation of these repatriates in Sydney was the joint responsibility of the Array and the naval authorities. The detailed instructions that were issued on this subject provided that security, entraining, de-training and delivery of the repatriates to the sea transport officer on embarkation were the responsibility of the Army authorities, and that the sea transport officer, a naval authority, would be responsible for. berthing, handling baggage on board, and the security of the prisoners of war and internees once they were embarked. </para>
                <para>In view of the criticism that has been expressed by honorable members opposite, I quote Colonel Kent Hughes, M.L.A., a prominent member of the Liberal party in Victoria, a man who fought during the war in the Far East, a Rhodes Scholar, and a reputable citizen. He made the following statement, which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> this morning: -  ##"## There has been a spate of words, a flood of words, in fact a typhoon of words recently over the <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> incident, which is of relatively small importance,##"## Colonel Kent Hughes, M.L.A., told members of the A.W.N.L. yesterday. Colonel Kent Hughes was a prisoner of war in Japanese hands from the fall of Singapore to VP-Day. ##"## If we have nothing better to criticize the Federal Government over we had better cease criticizing them,##"## he said. ##"## Conditions on the <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> might be offensive judged by our standards, but the destroyer has arrived at Rabaul without mishap. The passengers were actually travelling under far better conditions than anything they would experience in their homeland, either in peace or war. I can understand their concern, for, to a Formosan or Korean, to be put aboard a Japanese warship before the war meant death or slavery. A few words can rectify or criticize this small incident, but it will take real sacrifice, not of our essential standards of living, but of our surplus food, much of which now goes to waste, if millions of women and children in other parts of the world are not to suffer far worse conditions.##"## </para>
                <para class="block">It is very difficult for me to deal adequately with this question within the ten minutes available.

                        <para>- I repeat, that this movement of prisoners . of war and repatriates was made on a service level, and did not come before Ministers. I state very definitely that the Australian military officers who handle this work are not blackguards, as some honorable gentlemen, make out, and are not soulless individuals. Indeed, when the enemy was knocking at the door many of thes men risked their lives, played a conspicuous and heroic part in leading troops in battle, and were cheered by the people of Australia. It is dastardly at this stage to say that they are soulless blackguards. If they are as bad as honorable gentlemen opposite say that they are, they should not be in the Australian Army. I ask honorable gentlemen to ponder these words, used by an outstanding Liberal member in the Parliament of Victoria,  Colonel Kent  Hughes, in an address that he delivered to a gathering of members of the Australian Women##'##s National League in Melbourne.

He is a very eminent member of the Australian Military Forces, and is another man who languished in Changi prison camp.

                <para class="block">I have been informed by many members of the 8th Division that when Formosan troops were on guard, the Australian prisoners were treated more harshly than th##'##ey were by the Japanese fighting troops. All this propaganda in which honorable gentlemen opposite are endeavouring to indulge is not very popular among the ex-servicemen of this country. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> has stated ##'## that when General MacArthur asked that <inline font-style="italic">1oizuki</inline> should be taken into Rabaul, or to a port nearer to Sydney, it was off the Queensland coast, in  the vicinity of Rockhampton, and could have been taken into that port. That is untrue. At the time, I rang Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Louis</inline> Hamilton, the First Member of the Naval Board and Chief of the Royal Australian Navy. He advised me that at that time the boat was north-east of Cooktown, about 120 . miles from the coast, steaming towards Jomard  Passage, off the tip of New Guinea, and that Rabaul was the nearest and best port into which it could be taken for the disembarkation of the women and children. It has also been stated by Opposition members, as well as by a section of the press, that there was not a doctor on board. These critics have painted all kinds of dreadful pictures. There were only 97 women on board, yet I heard one honorable member say that twenty . babies would be born before the ship reached Rabaul, and there would be no doctor on board to attend to the mothers. As a matter of fact, there were on board two Japanese ships doctors, three Formosan doctors and fourteen medical personnel. Fears have been expressed for the safety of the women and unprotected children on board. My inquiries have satisfied me that these fears were absolutely groundless. Of the 97 women on board, 56 were married, 41 of them being accompanied by their husbands. There were on the ship 112 children under the age of sixteen years, and all of them were accompanied by at least one parent, many of them by both parents. Further, the total number of Formosan and Korean men was 796, compared with a Japanese crew of 180, who##"## were unarmed. The captain, officers and crew of the ship were held responsible by the Supreme Commander for the safety of the passengers. With their knowledge of the forthright action that has always been taken by the Supreme Commander against any Japanese guilty of failure to comply with his orders, there was no likelihood of their making any attempt to molest, interfere with, or fail adequately to look after the passengers who were under their care. Both the army and naval authorities have since advised me that throughout their consideration of this matter at the time they were aware that the ship would be crowded ; but they were also aware that it would be calling at an island port about five days out of Sydney, and in their view there was no reason why it should not sail for at least that period with its full complement of passengers; because, during their experience of the transportation of troops, including members of the Army Nursing Service and other women##'##s services, they had in the stress of war loaded ships to an equal if not greater capacity, with the knowledge that, concurrently with the maximum degree of discomfort to which the troops and women personnel would he subjected, they would also be subjected to bombing attacks from the air, as well as the risks from mines and submarines. Provided that the ships in such circumstances survived the risks incidental to war, the transportation authorities were able to land their passengers at their destination in reasonable health and safety. </para>
                <para>I consider that far too much##'## prominence has been given to##'## this matter, and T. cannot agree that the authorities concerned, having regard to all the circumstances, took action callously and thoughtlessly, as has been implied in the columns of certain sections of the daily press. I agree with the Prime Minister that General Douglas MacArthur has done an outstanding ##'## job for Australia, and we should not enter into any recriminations with him. He has proved a great friend to Australia. I have profound admiration for him. He agreed that if the passengers reached Rabaul in good condition there would be little cause for complaint, the judgment of the loading officers would be vindicated, and the incident should be closed. ##"##We know that they did reach Rabaul in good condition, much to the disappointment of many honorable members opposite. </para>

                    CAMERON (Barker) 1 8.121. - This matter, which was debated in a friendly manner last Wednesday night, has become one of almost international interest in its scope and implications. This motion is based on the fact that certain senior Ministers have made statements in .this Parliament, in reply to very mild words from the Opposition, which have been declared to be inaccurate by no less distinguished a person than General Douglas MacArthur. The first of these was the statement of the Minister for the Navy
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline>
                    I do not think that any honorable member on the Opposition side would believe that the Minister would deliberately attempt to mislead the House, but in view of further facts which have come to light since the Minister  spoke last Thursday night, the Opposition had no course open to it but to challenge the whole of the proceedings in the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline>
                    incident. So far I have said nothing about that ship, and how it was loaded. I doubt very much whether the conditions on that vessel were any worse than on the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Daiku Maru,</inline>
                    which carried Japanese nationals; but the whole matter has now been taken out of the realm of what is right and what is wrong with regard to the shipment of enemy nationals back to the Far East. It how becomes a matter of whether certain Ministers did or did not, deliberately or by inadvertence, mislead this Parliament in statements made by them to the House.
                </para>
                <para>With great respect to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> no attempt has been made to do other than put a best appearance on what the Prime Minister has described as an unfortunate misunderstanding. If this is an unfortunate misunderstanding, it is a rock on which many a government might easily have found itself piled up as a wreck. This Parliament is entitled to expect statements made deliberately from the treasury bench, as they were last week, to bear the test of the most searching inquiry, and the Opposition demands that such an inquiry be made. So far no attempt has been made to prove that the statements of the Ministers were other than what they hoped would make the best of all the circumstances. The honorable member foi1 Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> paid that the Minister for the Navy had done this country a disservice by his defence that the Australian authorities had acted in accordance with the specific instructions of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in </para>
                <para class="block">Japan. The Minister attempted to lay the responsibility  for this incident on the shoulders of General MacArthur, but with great enthusiasm and clarity, and without qualification or equivocation, the American commander .threw that responsibility back on the front bench in the House of Representatives, and the front bench has not faced up to it. The Minister for the Army may quote from the remarks of as many persons as he likes, but what Brigadier Blackburn or  Colonel Kent-Hughes  said haS nothing to do with the matter before the House. The question now under consideration is whether the statements made by himself, the Minister for- the Navy, and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> ought to have been made in this House, and will stand the test of, investigation by an impartial body. The case of the Opposition is that those statements will not bear the light of investigation. The best explanation we have of them is that there has been ##&gt;##an unfortunate, misunderstanding, but Ministers are responsible for whatever they say to the Parliament and the country. They cannot shield themselves behind statements by naval and army officers, no matter how distinguished they may be. The. Minister for the Army said this afternoon, once by interjection, and once in his speech, that he had first heard about this matter at 2.40 p.m. I am told that lie was supplied with this information shortly after 12 noon at a party meeting. </para>

It would have come out the following day as the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Shimbun,</inline> with Henderson still as editor. I have no doubt that many honorable members opposite would have formed themselves into an Australian quisling party to govern Australia. They are not fit to be called Australians. They have no concern for our men who were killed, and no sympathy with the soldiers and nurses who were ill-treated by the enemy. </para>

                        <para>- I do so, out of deference to you. I say that honorable members opposite have expressed no concern for returned prisoners of war, and they have not said too much about the starving Indians in Bengal, whose destinies have been presided over for the past two years by the new leader-to-be of the Liberal party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> G. Casey, now about to return to . Australia. Another thing I want to know about the <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> incident is how the news-reel men got the information which enabled them to be present at the wharf at 7 o##'##clock in the morning. How was one Melbourne newspaper able to send a representative over to Sydney from Melbourne the day before the departureof the ship ? How did they obtain the information that the ship was to sail, and how was it that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Penton</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henderson</inline> were seen in the vicinity of the wharf? The Leader of the Opposition has said . there is wide spread indignation over the incident. How, then, does it happen that, at his opening address in the Henty byelection campaign, he was not asked one question on the subject? How was it that the Prime Minister was not asked one question on the subject when he addressed a largely attended public meeting in the same by-election on the same night ! There is a lot of public concern as to what is behind it all, and how much politics there is in it. It is true that the New South Wales Parliament has passed a resolution on the subject. That Parliament ought to mind its own business; there are enough rackets in New South Wales to engage its attention if only it would devote its energies to its proper job. The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> pictured the scene had <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> encountered a cyclone. There was no cyclone in the area into which the ship was sailing; yet the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> published under scare head-lines that the vessel was heading into an area in which a cyclone was raging. In the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> there was a story that the vessel was in heavy seas. The cyclone was never a meteorological fact; it was merely an editorial fabrication. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> after visiting a cheap picture show, said that what he saw depicted in the newsreel had made him feel sick. Nobody in this House believes that the honorable member was made sick by what he saw there. If he was sick, I can tell honorable members what made him so. He  was sickened at the sight of so much cheap labour leaving Australia before he had a. chance to exploit it. </para>

                    <para>. - The speech that we have just heard from the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> is one of the most remarkable and also one of the most degrading utterances to which this Parliament has ever listened. It did much to justify the action of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in moving the adjournment of the House to-day. The Minister said, for instance, that the Formosans who were placed aboard <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> were  responsible for the events leading up to the mutiny that took place at the internment camp at Cowra. He said that they were the most fierce and vindictive section of the .Japanese armies against Australian prisoners of war. Were these the kind of men to put on a ship with innocent women and children, including pregnant women? The Government stands condemned for its treatment of the people on this vessel. Until Thursday morning of last week the Government might have pleaded that it was innocent; now it has been proved to be an accessory to this vile crime which has besmirched the good name of Australia. Those who are revolted by the action of the Government are not only members of the Opposition in this House but men and women throughout Australia. The people are raising their voices in protest; they are crying out that this wicked thing should not have been done. I shall not endeavour to go over the ground so well covered this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition when he dealt with the statements made in this House last week by the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> On Saturday morning there was published in the press of this country a message from General MacArthur which put the Government ##"## on the spot ##"##. Statements by Ministers last week were to the effect that the conditions under which prisoners of war and internees, as well as the women and children, were herded on <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> were the sole responsibility of the American authorities. . So fearful was General MacArthur of the Government##'##s honesty that he took the remarkable course of not sending his cabled messages to the Australian Government for publication, but to the United States Prisoner of War Information Bureau in Sydney. He realized that he could not take any risks with a Government which had so distorted the truth. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> said to-day, and the Minister for the Army repeated his statement, that he knew nothing of the conditions which existed on this ship; but I have before me a cutting from the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> which shows that from 12.10 to 4.7 p.m. on the 6th March the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> sent a continual stream of telegraphic messages to its correspondent, in Canberra asking him to get in. touch with senior Ministers, including ##"## Doc ##"## Evatt; the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> was specifically mentioned. Despite their denial, those Ministers knew what was going on. They have played the political game so long that they were afraid that the Government might be injured in the sight of the people of Australia if the truth were known, and so they prevaricated in their references to a voyage which might easily have been a voyage of death. This afternoon the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> interjected when the Leader of the Opposition was speaking : ##"## Bad luck you could not arrange for that cyclone ##"##. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. A merciful God saved ##Â«## the ship and its passengers from tragedy. The vessel passed through the Sydney Heads at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, the 6th March, and was reported to be travelling at 15 knots an hour. That rate of progress has not been challenged. It is a simple mathematical calculation to arrive at 720 knots for the two days from Wednesday to Friday when the Navy Office in Melbourne received the cabled message from General MacArthur that the women and children were to be taken off the ship, and that the vessel itself be ordered into port. The Australian authorities did not order the vessel to proceed to the nearest Australian port. They were so afraid of public opinion , that they allowed it to travel another 1,000 miles on what, according to the Prime Minister, was a ##"##short voyage to Rabaul##"##. I would not care if either the Minister for the Army or the Minister for the Navy produced Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Louis</inline> Hamilton, or even Admiral Horatio Nelson as a witness to prove the contrary, if the vessel was travelling at 15 knots an hour it could not have been so far north as the position in which it was stated to be at a certain time. I should like to know why the Prime Minister ordered the vessel to proceed to Rabaul. Was it because he could send a committee of inquiry there - a committee in the appointment of which this Parliament had no voice? On Sunday last the Prime Minister refused to allow press reporters to be sent to the port of call to report on the state of the ship when it arrived. It was interesting to hear the Minister for Information give his view of the Australian press to-night. He wanted to know how the press knew that <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> would sail on the 6th March and the time of its departure. He was particularly anxious to know how photographers were there to take photographs of the vessel##'##s departure. Was their action in filming the scenes as the vessel departed a crime? Would the Minister assume the role of a dictator and suppress all newspapers? The Government has been accused of fascism. Only by the grace of God was the Government prevented from committing the greatest crime that has ever been perpetrated in the history of Australia. The Minister for Information said that the Japanese people should be treated that way. I do not care a bit for the Japanese, but this House, as a Christian House of Parliament, should be prepared to follow Christian standards and act as the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> every Sunday in Adelaide preaches that people should act. More honour to him, but let him be a seven-day Christian and not a six-day politician and a one-day Christian. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> is not noted for care in language or argument, so I am not surprised that he should make such statements as he has made to-night. Bur I rise because of certain statements by the Loader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in introducing this subject this afternoon. He charged me with lack of good faith in statements that I made in this House on Thursday night. On the facts that were available I believe that any reasonable person, in assessing the value of the documents, would have expressed .exactly the same thoughts as I did. If, however, it is thought that in the assessment of the value of the documents there was some misjudgment, I ask honorable members to re##'##alize. that##'## it was a misjudgment that any honorable member could have formed. Let me recite to the House exactly what was said and exactly what the circumstances were. I told honorable members, as they will recall, that the Formosans and Koreans who##"## were despatched on <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> were prisoners of war and##'## internees of other than the Australian nation, and that the Australian nation was their custodian. Having established that fact, I indicated that a signal had been received by the Flag Officer in Charge in Sydney from thiCommander in Chief of the Allied Forces in Japan that the Japanese destroyer <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> had departed from Kure on the 13th February, and was sailing vh Rabaul to .Sydney to load 94S Formosans and Koreans, that it was to return via##"## Rabaul to Formosa to disembark them, that it required fuel, that it required certain provisions for 1,200 persons for twenty days and other provisions for fourteen days, and that 1 ton of meat was to be put on board. That was not an order or instruction issued by the Australian Government, but a directive, or advice, or whatever honorable##'## gentlemen like to call it, from some one else. We complied. The vessel, loaded as required, set out on its return journey generally in accordance with the directive. I also indicated that I had received the following intimation from the _ First Naval Member, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Louis</inline> Hamilton: - </para>

                <para class="block">That is the view held by the First Naval Member, a very distinguished man with long experience in the Royal Navy, who to-day is the trusted and highest official associated with the administration of the Royal Australian Navy. As that is his view, surely it cannot be held that the Government lacked good faith in any statements on this matter that Ministers, including myself, have made in this House. The situation that has developed is a disgusting display of political propaganda as a prelude to the impending general elections. During the week-end I addressed four meetings at which I was able to gauge the feelings of people, and I am conscious that this display of hysteria by which the Opposition is seek-, ing to inflame opinion against the Government will find no response from the public. On the contrary, my observations convince me that the people##'##s reaction will be the opposite to that sought and  that this campaign will bring upon the heads of the Opposition and the press a storm of indignation. Later in the year when the people will have the opportunity to voice their opinions it will be realized by honorable gentlemen opposite that the Australian people are too intelligent to be  tricked by such methods. This afternoon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> fully expressed the fact that many of the statements published in the press about this matter were either gross exaggerations or deliberate untruths. The desire to fry to make it appear that the ship was heading into seas where distress or even death was likely to occur on board is of course another example of the depths that the anti-Labour parties and press will go to in the hope of bringing political discredit upon the Labour party. Why. the vessel, which was 200 or 300 miles from where the cyclone occurred, was ahead of its schedule. It had had an uneventful voyage to Rabaul. It was found that more doctors were on the vessel than was at first thought, and the general condition of the repatriates on their arrival at Rabaul was satisfactory. The repatriates themselves were more or less satisfied with the conditions under which they had travelled. The senior Red Cross representative in Rabaul, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> Scotford,  is reported in this afternoon##'##s Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> as having said in the course of an interview with a representative of that newspaper - </para>

                <para>The scare and hysteria which honorable members opposite have endeavoured to engender in connexion with this matter is not -justified by the facts. . The naval officer in charge at Rabaul, who was the first officer to board the vessel on its arrival at that port, has assured us of the well-being of all on board. He said that a number of repatriates did not desire to leave the vessel, but preferred to continue their voyage on it in order that they might return the more quickly to their homeland. In view of those facts, the action of the press in dramatizing this incident in an endeavour to cause alarm reveals to the people of Australia just how far the press of .this country is prepared to go to serve party political ends. But the people will, I am sure, ignore the sinister suggestions in this pernicious and malicious propaganda designed to deceive them. I am confident that the people, as they did at the last##'## general elections, will, at the forthcoming elections, express their contempt of those tactics on the part of a cheap press, and will re-assert their demand for decency and honour among public men as well as decency of expression in public life which has been sadly lacking from the language of honorable m##'##embers opposite in their discussions of this incident. I was indeed surprised- at certain action on the part of the Leader of the Opposition to-day because I expect him to observe a high standard of conduct. However, he sought to express by gesture derision of my belief in a Supreme Being. The right honorable gentleman may seek to hold up to derision my Christian beliefs, but I make no apology to him, nor to any one else, on  that score. He repeated his offence in that respect. I should have thought that a man of his high and distinguished standing would not descend to that demeanour. Honorable members opposite, by their cheap sneers and contemptible conduct, show that they can do little better than to try to hold up to derision those who endeavour to observe the common decencies of life. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable members should clearly understand that I do not intend to advocate the payment of greater compensation to the persons who, according to the findings of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne, were unjustifiably detained in March, 1942. My purpose is to plead for justice for these men who were interned unlawfully and without reason, and who were subjected to possibly one of the most humiliating experiences that could ever befall a citizen in war-time. After all, can any adequate compensation be paid to men who have suffered, as these men have suffered, whose names have been besmirched, whose reputation has been damaged, whose homes have been destroyed, and whose businesses, which took a life-time to build, have disappeared overnight on the whimsy of the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> He made a statement to the House in circumstances which are open to suspicion. He indulged in a hysterical outburst which rocked Australia to its foundations. In my opinion, this is a complete case of Government maladministration in its most heinous form. The Government has shown a complete disregard for the subjectright of citizens, and because of that I propose to say something relating to the internment of these unfortunate men, and to the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne. </para>

                    <para>Perhaps it will be as well if I recall the circumstances of this case, because it will become very clear to honorable members as my argument proceeds that something very sinister is contained in the action of the Government. On the 10th March, 1942, certain members of the Australia First Movement were arrested under section 13 of the National Security Act, and subsequently a ministerial warrant was issued for their detention under regulation 26. In passing, I ask honorable members to note that the extraordinary occurrences which led to the motion for the adjournment of the House to discuss the <inline font-style="italic">Yoizuki</inline> incident have also taken place in March. Therefore, I say to this Government, ##"## beware the Ides of March ##"##, because it seems to me that March is an ill-fated month for this Administration. </para>
                    <para>The members of the Australia First Movement were arrested under section 13 of the National ##'##Security Act, which reads - (1.)

(2.) If a person suspected of having committed, or of being about to commit, an offence against this Act, is arrested under the provisions of this section, a report of the fact and circumstances shall forthwith be made to the Attorney-General or to a person appointed in that behalf by the Attorney-General, and - </para>

                    <para class="block">Subsequent inquiry revealed that Military Intelligence offered no evidence whatever to show, first, that these members of the Australia First Movement were found committing an offence. Secondly, they were net suspected of having committed or of ##"##being about to commit an offence against Australia. Indeed, those respon sible for the arrests stated that action was taken purely to break up the movement, and was not levelled against any particular individual. Thirdly, no charge was laid against the sixteen men within the period of ten days as prescribed in section 13 of the act. Yet that section was designed by this Parliament to prevent such an occurrence as thiswithin our democracy. Furthermore, the members of the Australia First Movement were not released at the expiration of ten days. ##"##Why was no charge made against these men? That is a pertinent question. I suggest that between the time of their arrest under section 13, and their subsequent detention under regulation 26, the Minister realized his error. Finding that he could not charge them, he detained them under regulation 26. If that is what happened, his action was one of the most cowardly ever attempted by any Minister of the Commonwealth. I ask the House to note one or two very important points. First, I again draw attention to sub-section 2 of section 13, which states - </para>

                    <para class="block">It so happened that we had an Acting Attorney-General about the time in question, namely, the 25th March. Fifteen clays after the arrest of these individuals - that is five days beyond the ten days allowed for action to be taken - the right honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> then Acting Attorney-General, in reply to a question by the former honorable member for Bourke, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Blackburn,</inline> said he had no knowledge of the matter, but would call for the relevant file, read the reports, and see what action the Government was prepared to take. These circumstances are strange enough in all sooth, but they pale into insignificance when compared , with the hysterical outburst of the Minister for the Army on the 26th March - sixteen days after the arrests. Honorable members will recall how that right honorable gentleman entered this chamber and made a statement which rocked this country as it has never been rocked before in its political history. The House, and the country had every reason to accept what the right honorable member said as an honest statement made by a responsible Minister. He said that the fullest possible investigation had been carried out by him, and no doubt remained in his mind as to the guilt of the individuals who had been arrested. In the light of the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne, it is evident that had even the most superficial inquiry been made during the fifteen days in which the Minister had to investigate the matter, it would have revealed that the happenings in Western Australia - honorable members will remember that it was the activities of the Australia First Movement in Western Australia that led to arrests in the eastern States - were of no importance whatever to the security of this country. Indeed, it is clear from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne##'##s report that the utterances attributed to the Western Australian members of the movement were the gabblings  of three or four imbecile windbags who had not the means even to stop a tram or kill a rabbit; yet sixteen men were arrested and thrown into prison. At the expiration of fifteen days - five days longer than is permitted under the section of the act to which I -have referred - no charge had been levelled against them, and. the Minister threw them into detention for a period of something like five and a half months. I shall quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne##'##s report on this matter. On pages 8 and 9 he says - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I ask the ##'##House to note His Honour##'##s observation - ##"## I am prepared to believe that Thomas was not a passive investigator ##"##. </para>
                    <para>The facts arc that on the 12th March, two days after the arrests were effected, Military Intelligence knew that there was no connexion whatever between the Western Australian##'## and Sydney movements. Therefore, the Minister too must have known that. This knowledge came into the possession of the Military Intelligence ##'##authorities upon the interception of a letter from Perth asking for affiliation. In addition, Detective Sergeant Richards of Perth who was in charge of the Security investigation, stated in a report dated the 20th March that there was no connexion whatever between the organizations in Western Australia and Sydney; yet on the 26th March the Minister for the Army in this House, linked the sixteen internees with ##"## treasonable conspiracy ##"## and interned them. One can imagine that happening in Fascist countries, but it is unbelievable that it should happen in a democracy. At the inquiry,  Colonel Mosely,  Sergeant Richards, and this informer Thomas all swore that there was no connexion between the activities at Sydney and those in Western Australia, as did -the four Perth members themselves. The action subsequently taken by the Minister was based on a letter dated the 13th March, from Captain Blood, requesting the internment of these individuals under regulation 26. I ask the House to note that Captain Blood did not suggest that a charge should be laid under section 13 of the act. He knew that he had to lay a charge against the individuals who had been arrested or release them, yet he detained them for five days longer than the prescribed period, and then asked the Minister to intern them under regulation 26 without any charge being made. This letter should be the subject of a special inquiry.  Et reeks with inaccuracies which must have prejudiced the Minister, and the Minister must take full responsibility for acting without satisfying . himself that the facts were as stated. The result of the Minister##'##s action was, that these sixteen men were interned and held for three and a half months without a charge being levelled against them. That must give honorable members food for serious thought. These men were arrested on the flimsiest pretext, were thrown into prison, and subsequently were detained under ministerial warrant. Notwithstanding that there were in existence appeal committees which would##'## have . listened to their appeals, they were held for three and a half months without a charge being levelled against them. Indeed, no charge has been levelled against them up to the present time. They were callously turned loose some five and a half months later, with the stigma of treason and traitorous conduct still fresh upon them. I ask the House to compare that action with the proceedings taken in respect of Ratliff and Thomas, against whom there was. a mass of proved evidence. Those two men were interned in June, 1941, and appeared before the Advisory Committee on the 19th July of that year. No time was wasted by the Government, which then was composed of men who now sit on this side of the House. The Labour Government assumed office on the 6th October. Cabinet considered, the case of these Communists on the 9th October, and released them on the 21st October. Compare that rapid action on behalf of the comrades of this Government, with the delay of five and a half- months in respect of men. who were arrested on the flimsiest pretext. The Perth cases were commenced on the 7th May, and the men were committed for trial in June. The hearing was in open court, and not according to the star chamber methods indulged in by the appeal committees. The verdict was given on the 23rd July, which was prior to the first hearing of the case against the Sydney men, eight of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne said should never have##'## been detained, and a number of whom were not even members of. the Australia First Movement. On the 17th July, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> reported the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> as having said, relative to Ratliff and Thomas - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The men were detained on the fiat of the Minister. They are not charged with any offence; they are not entitled to an open trial they hare no right to confront witnesses called, against them. The so-called Appeal Tribunal has the right to hear witnesses behind their backs. In all these respects the ordinarycourse of justice is completely forgotten. </para>
                        <para class="block">How true that is ! I ask the Attorney-General, who put up such a defence on behalf of Ratliff and Thomas, what he did to ensure that these other men would be given a trial equally as effective and speedy as that conceded to these Communists. A statement of that nature does not absolve the Government. Its action wa3 taken on the flimsiest evidence. The inquiry by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne was opened two years and three months after the original##'## action was taken, and another year and three months was required to complete it. This of itself must give rise to the gravest suspicion throughout ##'## the country that the delay was deliberately engineered by the Government in the hope that the whole sorry episode would be -forgotten. These men carried the stigma for three and a half years. Delay is of the very essence of refined cruelty, and can be attributed only to the guilty conscience of the Minister, who helped to postpone the trial of these unfortunate men. The evidence disclosed that three of the sixteen men arrested did not belong to the Australia First Movement, and according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne, eight of them should never have been detained.

                <para class="block">In the -three and a half years which elapsed before that inquiry was held, thelives of these men had been completely blasted. They had lost the whole .of their possessions. The loved ones of some of them had died while their names had not been cleared. Some of them were not even members of the movement. ##'## They were arrested on the flimsiest pretext, were detained, and were even refused a trial, no charge being levelled against them. They were thrown into durance vile. Anybody who had said that it was possible for such a thing to happen in Australia would have been classed as fit for ##&amp;## mental asylum. But this did happen in Australia, at the whim of a Minister who was stampeded by a false report, and must accept the responsibility for what was done. What answer has the Minister to the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne? Let us consider how this stupid, criminally irresponsible action of the Minister affected these men. I take, three cases as typical of all - those of </para>
                <para class="block">Matthews, Bath and Watts, two of whom were ex-servicemen of  World  Wai- I. and proved their loyalty by blood sacrifice while some of the members of this Government were under suspicion; -indeed, some of them were put in gaol during that war. Harley Matthews was never a member of the movement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne has stated that definitely in his report. In 1915, he served with distinction in World War I. Epstein had taken him as a model of the spirit of Anzac. He was living with his mother, who was 74 years of age. At 2 a.m. on the 10th March he was seized and thrown into internment on as base a charge as could be conceived, and was subjected to an interrogation unequalled in any other democracy in the world. He was never brought to trial, and was released six months after his arrest. The result was that he lost everything that he possessed. Not only was his name defamed, but his mother, 74 years of age, died in Adelaide when her son##'##s reputation was still besmirched. He was only allowed to attend her funeral under guard. If honorable members can support action of that kind against a man who on inquiry was proved to be innocent of the charges levelled against him, it is an everlasting blot on the escutcheon of Australia. Those wrongs cannot be redressed by the granting of the paltry sum of ##Â£##700. Can he buy back his good name and his mother##'##s memory for that? </para>
                <para>Take the case of another ex-soldier of the 1914-18 war named Watts, who served with distinction and was awarded the Military Medal. He had war injuries for which a grateful country paid him a pension, but he died two years and four months after his arrest, with his name still besmirched. He died with the knowledge that he was considered by his fellow men to be a traitor to the country which he had shed his blood in preserving. The irony of the whole thing! Will his widow be grateful to the Government to know that, when its action had materially contributed to her husband##'##s death, it had given her a paltry ##Â£##400 in an attempt to buy back his honour? </para>

From the standpoint of our primary production Australia owes a great deal to Japan. 1 represent a rural constituency, noted for its wool, and 1 know what the Japanese market has meant to the wool-growers and other primary producers of this country. Hundreds of thousands of pounds  has been lost to Australia by the trade diversion policy of a former administration. There is no indication that Japan plans any attack on Australia. That was evidenced by the utterances of the recently appointed Consul-General for that country. On the contrary, there is ample evidence that its people wish to have friendly intercourse with us. Australia, as a primary-producing nation, desires reciprocal trade with Japan. I deplore that responsible men in this Parliament, particularly supporters of the Government, should say anything which might give offence to nations which desire to be friendly. lt should be the aim of every honorable member to advance the cause of peace, and in that end he should realize that it is his duty to refrain from provocative utterances. </para>

Only the Communists took action in the famous Adyar Hall incident of - the 19th February. Certain action was taken by the Security Branch in Western Australia. Strangely enough, they appointed a man named Thomas, a Communist, as-a pimp or spy. Speaking of him, the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> said on the 2nd September, 1942- </para>

                </quote>
                <para>Yet this was the man whose evidence was accepted by the Government, the man upon whose word it took action. Thomas##'##s job was to make contact with Bullock, a former Communist. Bullock was typical of the Communists - he would join anything and shout for anything. Thomas represented himself as a man named  Hardt,  who represented- the Australia First Movement in eastern Australia. Up to this stage there was no evidence that Bullock was plotting anything, yet within a fortnight ##'##of meeting Thomas he and three companions evolved a conspiracy which was not backed by any means to carry it out. It is almost unbelievable that any government should be prepared to act on the unsupported evidence of this ##Â£##5 a week pimp, when it could have used the services of people of repute to join the council of Bullock. Nevertheless, the Government preferred to rely on the evidence of this Communist pimp, and sixteen persons lost their liberty. At the suggestion of Thomas, a letter was sent by Bullock to Sydney asking for affiliation. Security was informed by Thomas of the despatch of the letter, which was ##'##intercepted, and eighteen persons were arrested. Why did not the Security Branch wait until the letter had ##'##been received by the Australia First Movement in Sydney, and until it was able to learn how the people there received the proposal? Of course, that would not have suited the Communists. If the Australia First Movement had turned down the proposal no arrests would have been possible. Therefore, the letter was intercepted without waiting to see what would happen, and eighteen persons, were arrested. It is evident that some one in the east was out to get the##'## Australia First Movement. According to the evidence of Sergeant Richards, Thomas was sent to make contact with Bullock. Obviously no conspiracy was possible without Thomas. At any stage Thomas could have smashed the conspiracy with a single word, - but he took no action. Another curious fact is associated with an article published by M. Fitzpatrick in <inline font-style="italic">Smith##'##s Weekly</inline> of the 13th June, 1942, and which was sent to .the Civil Liberties League of Melbourne, in which jeering reference was made to - </para>

Another curious fact is to be noted. The Minister had, curiously enough, met the trade union conference just prior to the beginning of the last stage in the action when steps had been taken to associate Thomas with Bullock iri Western Australia. He had then made his infamous attack^ on certain members of the Opposition as ##"##guilty men who put Australia last ##"##. Some interesting information might have been obtained if we could have got him into the witness box. </para>

                    <para class="block">According to Ratliff and Thomas, Spender was responsible, and that was enough for the Communists. Let me sum up the curious sequence of actions that resulted in the blasting of the lives of a number of innocent men, and not only brought on them untold <inline font-style="italic">misery</inline> and disgrace, but also indelibly blotted  the  good name of Australia for all time. It is a matter for comment that the Communist party knows what goes on in the Attorney-General##'##s Department, and honorable members can draw their own conclusions from that. I ask honorable members to notice  Blain##'##s  letter. At a convenient time, while the Attorney-General##'##s Department was still in charge of the Security Branch, a spy was brought into contact with an exCommunist in Western Australia whose character was known to them. Out of that meeting there grew a conspiracy exactly on the lines which the Communists in Sydney desired, and which implicated the Australia First. Movement. At a- meeting in Western Australia, at which only four persons were present, it was agreed in the presence of the pimp. Thomas, the Communist, that the group should apply by letter for affiliation with the Australia First Movement in Sydney. </para>
                    <para class="block">This letter was seized upon by the Security Branch as a pretext for arresting a number of persons in Sydney, some of whom were not members of the Australia First Movement. On the 6th March, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> gave his last answer on the Australia First question before he left for the United States of America. Then the Army took over control of the Security Branch, and members of the Australia First Movement -were arrested on the 19th March. On the 25th March, the Acting Attorney-General knew nothing of the matter, but somebody in the Attorney-General##'##s Department must have known about it. Next day, the Minister for the Army made his curiously alarming statement in which he made charges unsupported by evidence. Later, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne found that there was no contact between the persons in Western Australia and the eastern States who had been arrested. Rigorous censorship clamped down on the press so that no one could defend these men. Although no names have been mentioned in this House, the Communist newspaper . was able trpublish a full list of the names of the persons charged. There is some contact between the Communists and either the Attorney-General##'##s Department or the Department of the Army. No action has been taken against the Communist newspaper that published the names. I should like to know##'## who drafted the Ministers##'## statement in regard to this matter. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister##'## for the Army is quick to give the answer to one question, but he is reticent regarding the other. I leave the whole sorry mess there. In his report <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne said that these people were doing nothing for the war effort. Surely, Matthews and Watts had secured immunity by reason of their wounds and their general condition of health. Watts served  as a guard in .a munitions factory and had previously been a volunteer instructor in the Militia. Hooper had invested in the war loan a few days before internment, and contributed ##Â£##25 towards the H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> fund. On the day that he was arrested Bath had an appointment to volunteer for the Royal Australian Air Force. Cahill and Downe fought as members of the Australian Imperial Force and their pay continued during the whole period of their intern-, ment. Downe Gould not he present at thelater stages of the inquiry, as he wa.##Â«## fighting at Bougainville. It is Strang##"## to find an Australian who fought at Bougainville arrested as a traitor. It is true that subsequently he was released. One of the Crowleys had offered his <inline font-style="italic">cnr</inline> free to the Army, and his son was serving with the forces. His wife was a nurse <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> the war of 1914-18. Masey was engaged full time in a large surgical instrument plant. One feature that needs emphasizing is the violence of the Communists in the campaign. The  chairman  of the meeting of . the 19th February was brutally assaulted. During the inquiry before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne two counsel were warned to keep out of the case if they valued their own safety. Bath -was waylaid and assaulted and Cahill appeared in the court showing evidence of maltreatment. These, are things which call for an inquiry. Some ministers would no doubt indulge in ##"## basher ##"## tactics if they could get away with it, but this is a free country -in which the rights of individuals must be respected. Ministers should give a full explanation to the House and the country. </para>

                        <para>. - This is an important question which should be considered quietly and without resort to such  extravagent  statements as have fallen from the lips of the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison).</inline> This is a matter that should he dealt with on a high plane and should not be the subject of .-anting party political propaganda. Honorable members will realize that the detention of twenty members of the Australia First Movement took place at a time when a Japanese invasion seemed imminent, and also that some members of the organization were found guilty of conspiracy against their own country. The honorable member for Wentworth read certain extracts which suited his cage, but I remind him that although some suspected persons were afterwards declared to be honest, others were found guilty. It is well to remember that a state of national emergency existed when these men were taken into custody; the enemy was advancing towards Australia and the fate of the nation was at stake. It was not a time for a ##"## wait-and-see ##"## policy. In military circles it was thought that the enemy would land in Australia at any moment, and it was deemed a wise precaution not to have free  in our midst persons suspected of being capable of stabbing our fighting men in the back. The problem of detaining persons who, rightly or wrongly, were suspected of being a potential danger to the nation was not peculiar to Australia, but was common to all the Allied nations iri a war in which ##"## fifth-column ##"## activities had reached an unprecedented standard of. ingenuity. War imposes heavy responsibilities on those with whom decisions rest in a time of national peril and the necessity for immediate action may well preclude that careful investigation which in normal times would precede arrest. It is to be regretted that in the exercise of emergency powers, the necessity for which could not be questioned by any reasonable citizen, innocent persons were occasionally thought to be guilty, but it would be unreasonable to expect that war-time powers will always be exercised with perfect justice and christian charity. War calls for swift action first and consideration later. When England was threatened with invasion the British Government took into custody over 3,000 suspected persons over night and shipped them to Australia with a request that they be held in internment camps here. During the next two years careful investigation  revealed  that the majority of those internees were harmless, and, accordingly they were returned to Britain. On that occasion swift action was taken by the British Government; the investigation followed later. It may be said that many of those people were innocent, but the nation was in danger and the British Government could not afford to take any risks. Had I, as Minister for the Army, refused to act on the definite recommendation of the Chief, of the General Staff and give my approval to detain these men after having received from the military intelligence officers advice that they should he arrested, what would have been my position had the Japanese invaded Australia and ##"## fifth column ##"## activity had undermined the safety of the country? Failure to have acted on the recommendations of the military authorities would have been inexcusable, and there would have been clamour demanding that I be drummed out of the Parliament.

It is, I suggest, quite unprofitable to criticize action taken in 1942 in the light of the fuller knowledge -available after elaborate inquiry in 1945. The circumstances are totally different. It should he remembered, moreover, that public uneasiness in 1942 was manifested by a feeling not that there were too many people under restraint, hut rather that there were too few.  His  Honour has pointed out that all the persons detained were- given a proper opportunity of appealing against their internment in accordance with the National Security Regulations. The honorable member for Wentworth made no mention at all of that.  His  Honour also pointed out that not only were they given such an . opportunity, but also special committees were formed to reconsider the cases of some of the persons detained.

In his report,  His  Honour recommends that the persons - wrongly detained are entitled to a public declaration that they were in fact wrongly detained and were not disloyal, and such a declaration should afford them some measure of redress This recommendation applies to the undermentioned eight persons out of the total of twenty persons who were detained. . . . </para>

He made certain recommendations in regard to eight out of the twenty persons concerned. The other twelve, he said, were rightly detained. Those recommendations have been carried out by the Government. That privilege was not extended to any other persons who had been interned. In time of war drastic action lias to be taken, and taken immediately. In no circumstances would I wittingly do an injustice to any man in the Community, but when the safety of this nation was at stake, when it was thought that the enemy would land on our shores at any moment, that##"## our men would be fighting to drive them out and when there was sufficient reason to justify Military Intelligence in recommending swift arrests of people suspected of disloyalty, for a Minister to have said ##"## No, he is a friend of mine, or is related to a friend of mine and that must not be done##"## and something subversive happened as a consequence, that Minister i-would never be forgiven. He would have been recreant to the trust imposed in him. I. feel sorry for any person wrongly detained. I know that people, probably foolishly or ignorantly, sometimes become members of associations, without knowing their real aims and objects. They are misled by others. While one can have great ##'##sympathy with them, I, as Minister, had to approve the action taken by responsible officers of the Army. The Ministry has carried out the recommendations made ##'##by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne. Nothing more can be done. It is unfortunate that certain people have suffered. Wars are cruel and bring hardship and misery to all kinds of people. In all countries engaged in war, when swift action has to be taken, mistakes sometimes occur, but the safety of the nation must be paramount. I believe that the Military Intelligence officers who investigated the Australia First Movement were actuated by a desire to do the right thing by Australia. Of the##'## twenty members of the movement who were interned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Clyne found that eight had been wrongly detained and should have some redress. He recommended the payment of certain amounts of compensation.

            <para>I have two matters to raise, both of which I intended to mention at question time, but the adjournment motion gives me the opportunity of saying now more than I could have said then. Frankly, I do not know under whose administration the first comes, so I address my remarks to the  Deputy  Prime Minister
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline>
                I have a letter, which I am not going to read, because I might be asked to table it, from a gentleman fairly close to the Government, in which he tells me that at Woodville, in South -Australia, in the. electorate of the Minister for the Navy
                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline>
                at one stage, the Government erected a hostel for the use of the Women##'##s Christian Temperance Union, the purposes of that hostel being that women engaged in munitions production in that area might have reasonably good board and lodging in the Woodville district. Some time afterwards the scope of the association##'##s activities was widened to accommodate working girls who were employed in factories other than those engaged strictly on the production of munitions. I am told that later the Government - I am not sure which Minister is . responsible - decided that any girl who ceased to be employed in a munitions factory, notwithstanding that she might obtain other employment in the same district and be willing to pay for her accommodation, must vacate the hostel. I should like the right honorable gentleman to fossick out which of the ##"## noble nineteen ##"## is responsible for that decision, and in due course to let me know whether it will be possible for the Government to take a more reasonable stand in this matter.
            </para>
            </talk.start>
            <para>The second matter concerns the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> I have had considerable correspondence with him on the subject. It concerns the Northern Territory. I have not yet handed over to the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain),</inline> since his return from a Japanese prisoner of war camp, affairs to which I have been attending on his behalf. I have not previously raised this matter in public. It is the case of a resident of Darwin who did not leave the Territory. As he puts it in a letter to me he was ##"## not one of those who cleared out ##"##. It is not necessary for him to have a permit to re-enter the Territory, because he did not leave the Territory. He owned a war service home at Darwin which the Minister- for the Army rented to the Shell Company of Australia Limited. My correspondent now informs me that in respect of the occupancy of the home by the Department of the Army, the Army authorities have paid half of the charges due to the War Service Homes Commi.sion, whilst this man is now being billed for the other half of the dues in respect of the whole of the period dating from the time the Army authorities took over the home. Surely, if the Government believes that it is worth while to commandeer a .man##'##s residence in Darwin the least it can do is to pay the dues that would have to be paid to the War Service Homes Commission instead of paying half of them and allowing the original occupant to be billed with the other half. In addition to being a soldier of the war of  1914-18,  this man has two sons at present on active service. Quite recently, his wife wanted to return to Darwin, but she has been told bluntly that if she returns she will not be- supplied with rations. For how much longer shall . we have to suffer under a system which denies to people the right to return to their place of livelihood? In certain European countries people are being moved about in hundreds and thousands. Darwin is but the size of a pecket-handkerchief when compared with the whole of Australia. Its total population would not make much difference to the Minister##'##s majority in his electorate of Capricornia. . No officer in the Army can convince me that the state of affairs in Darwin is such that old residents cannot be allowed to return there, or that people who did not leave the Territory during the war period should be pestered with requests as to why they do not possess permits to enter the Territory. I understood that the system of permits was abolished some time ago. For all the good it was, it should never have been put into operation. One gentleman who told me he had been turned out has explained to me how he got back. The system is so good that I still possess the permit I obtained in order to enter the Territory, although permits are supposed to be collected from holders before they leave the Territory. I##"## ask the Minister to look carefully into the ^natters which I have raised. To-morrow, I shall hand to him the letter to which I have referred. I shall not read it now because it contains statements which I do not deem it advisable to read to the House at present. In due course I may be able to refer to the other matters mentioned. </para>

                    <para>.- I raise .a matter which concerns the administration of the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin).</inline> A man can secure release from the Army if he has served five years ; but this provision has not been applied to members of the naval forces. When a young signalman, the##'## son of an Air Force officer, applied for- release in order that he might return to his employment, he was refused permission and is being retained in the Navy under manpower regulations. This man was called up a week before the outbreak of war. He has spent his twenty-first to his twenty-seventh birthday in the Navy in sea-going service, but because he is a single man he has not enough points under the points system to qualify for release. Had he been a stay-at-heme, or  been engaged on a shore job, or at headquarters, and been married, he would have been discharged long ago; but because he is a single man he cannot secure his release. Surely, the man-power provisions should not apply at this stage of the peace. In any case, the provisions applying to releases from the Army should apply to releases from the Navy also. If the Government were calling up draftees as replacements, all of these men could be released and would be enabled to rehabilitate themselves. If the Government delays further in such matters, these men will become problem cases so far as rehabilitation is concerned. Although thi3##'## man##'##s employers have held his job open for him for over six years, they, no doubt, will soon want to reshuffle their staff. In any case the man will suffer in respect of seniority. I urge the Minister for the Navy to give careful consideration to this matter,. I understand that the##'## young man intends to visit Canberra to put his claims before the Minister. </para>

                            <para>As a result of the investigation by  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed he recommended in an interim report dated the 7th March, 1945, that the sentences on Privates Wilson and Derrick and Sapper Chalmers should not stand, and that a proper sentence in each case would be imprisonment with hard labour for two years. Immediate effect was given to this recommendation. In a further report dated the 20th April, 1945, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed made the recommendation that, in addition to the remissions already granted, the sentences imposed by general courts-martial should he mitigated by erasing therefrom the sentence in each case that the discharge should be ##"## with ignominy##"##, as if those words in that part of the sentence had never been included. The recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Reed required very full and complete consideration by myself in collaboration with the Army authorities, in view of the effect of such a. decision in relation to sentences which had been or might be imposed by general courtsmartial on members of the forces who were guilty of offences under the Army Act. The position was further complicated by advice which had been furnished to me by the Judge Advocate-General, who stated that, in his view, it was not legally and constitutionally possible to give effect to the recommendation as the sentence had already been imposed and the discharges with ignominy had already been effected. </para>

As a result of this request, an order in council has now been signed by me recommending to  His  Royal Highness the Governor-General in Council that each of the sentences be mitigated by omitting so much of each of them as relates to discharge with ignominy from  His  Majesty##'##s Service. The legal position of these members in regard to entitlement and other benefits, as a result of their discharge from the Force by courts-martial sentences is similar to the position of other soldiers who have been discharged by sentences of courts-martial. </para>

                            <para>It is confirmed that there are sugar refineries in all States with the exception of Tasmania, but it docs not necessarily follow that Tasmanians are penalized on this account. On the contrary, districts in northern Tasmania enjoy a price advantage because sales are made at northern Tasmanian ports served by direct shipping routes, at approximately the same level as applies at capital ports in all States, an arrangement which does not operate in outlying districts in any other State. The recent shortage of refined sugar was not confined to Tasmania. Other States in which refineries are established were also adversely affected by the general fall in sugar refining and the lack of shipping. These were only temporary disabilities. Lack of shipping for refined sugar consigned to Tasmania would also have applied in the case of raw sugar for refining if there had been a refinery in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>I refer to the question appearing on Notice Paper No. 88 for the House of Representatives on Thursday, 4th October, 1045, in which you seek advice regarding applications by airline operators for a Commonwealth subsidy and would advise you that there are at present a number receiving Government subsidy in respect of services operated by them. </para>
                        <para>Payments generally are made either ofl the basis of mails carried or on the basis of miles flown. Payment on the basis of mails carried contains an element of. subsidy in that the pound-mile rate for the carriage of mails is greatly in excess of the rate charged by the operators for the carriage of passengers and freight. For payment on the basis of miles flown the applicable rate per mile is struck after investigation .of the estimated operating costs inclusive of a small margin for profit and estimated revenues, the excess of cost over revenue being paid to the contractor as a subsidy. </para>
                        <para>Recently an operator, receiving payment on a pound-mile basis for .mails carried, found that the resulting payment, due to the small amount oi mails carried over the services, was insufficient to bridge the gap between operating costs and revenues and applied for a direct subsidy payment. The company concerned was Ansett Airways Limited, and Cabinet recently approved of a subsidy payment at the rate of ##Â£##22,500 per annum to that company##'##. </para>
                        <para>Many applications for new air services have been submitted and many, if not all, of the services approved will require assistance either in the form of a direct subsidy or payment for the mails carried. </para>
