Sit  Robert Best's association with the public life of Australia dated from  1SS9,  when he was elected a member of the Victorian Parliament. In  1901,  he resigned to enter the federal sphere. At the first general Commonwealth elections he was elected" a senator for Victoria and thus became a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament. He was  Chairman  of Committees during the years  1901  to  1903,  Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Senate- from February,  3907,  to November,  190S,  and Minister for Trade and Customs during  1009-10. </para>

MENZIES (Kooyong- Leader of the Opposition). - I second the motion. The death of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best has brought to an end a career of great distinction and value. As one of his successors in the representation of Kooyong, it is difficult  for  me  to believe that almost a quarter of a century has passed since he ceased to take an active part in public or political life. He certainly did not cease to take an active interest in life, because, for the last quarter of a century, during which I have enjoyed a very close friendship with him. I have never ceased to marvel at his energy, enthusiasm, steadily maintained interest in various activities of the community, and constant practice of the law to a very advanced age. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best was a man of amazingly dynamic mental and physical energy. He was also, in my experience of him, a man of amazing generosity towards other people. He had the rare and admirable faculty in an older man of being interested in younger men. lie helped me in many ways not only at the beginning of my legal carreer, but also at the beginning of my political life. He had that faculty which we all so much admire, of being able to talk to very much younger men on terms of equality of mind and experience. I profoundly regret the news of his death. I convey sympathy to the members of his family, and express personal thankfulness for a splendid life of service to this country. </para>

                    <para>- On behalf of the Australian Country party I support the motion expressing appreciation of the service rendered to this country by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best, and sympathy with his sorrowing relatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best was one of that dwindling group of men who played an important part during the very critical formative period of the Commonwealth of Australia. He was one of the leaders in the Victorian Parliament at a time when the legislatures of the colonies were deciding whether the people of this continent should become an Australian nation. It is well that we should not allow the years that have rolled by to prevent us from properly recognizing all that we owe to those who did so much for this country at that period. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to be permitted on personal grounds to add my own tribute to the memory of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best. After graduating at the University of Melbourne, I was privileged to serve my period of articles in the office of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert.</inline> I learnt there to respect him, and I developed an affection for him which lasted down through the years. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has pointed out, despite his very advanced age he was a most active and dynamic man. If there is any truth in the saying that a man is as old as he feels, it is true of him. Almost up to the time of his death he had his regular game on the links of the Kew Golf Club. He actively pursued his' extensive practice of the law in the city of Melbourne. I join in the tribute paid to him for his public service, and add my own expression of sympathy with hi3 widow and family, to whom he was greatly devoted. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister did, in the first place, seek to get the Auditor-General to make an investigation. It is true that the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> raised the matter in this House about the same time. The matter was referred for inquiry, ' under terms of reference of which the honorable member is well aware, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Aber</inline> crombie, and he was directed also to inquire into certain allegations made by the Leader of the Country party. The inquiry is proceeding. I have not read all the details in connexion with it, but the Minister showed me the report which the Auditor-General had made to him. There are certain suggestions in the report, and some very strong criticism, but there is no allegation of any dishonesty regarding the transactions of the commission, although there are suggestions of carelessness. I do not remember the name of the refugee firm. </para>

Will the Minister say whether, in planning Australian industries, priority is given to the horse-racing industry over the motor carmanufacturing industry? If so, is it because although, motor car manufacturing provides more employment, the horseracing industry controls more votes? </para>

Brown Abermain Seaham Company threatens to cavil out half the employees at Stanford Main No. 1 Colliery unless they accept changed conditions of employment, namely, the extraction of pillars by a method different from that which has prevailed for many years - by tonnage or contract rate - and that the company now proposes to pay the men 25s. for each shift, in Lieu of the rate for first-class shift-men which a miner was always paid when he was taken from his tonnage or contract rate work? In view of the great demand for coal, is the Government prepared to allow that mine to close down due to the avarice of the company and despite wage-pegging regulations? "Will the Minister direct the Coal Commissioner to instruct the Production Manar ger to inspect the colliery forthwith, in order to keep the mine in full production and to maintain the conditions which have been laid down by regulation? </para>

                            <para>- It has not been the practice to tell the Commonwealth Bank what it ought to do with its gold holdings, but I have, as Treasurer, discussed the matter with the Governor of the bank and' with the  chairman  of the former Commonwealth Bank Board on various occasions. I could state the precise amount of gold held by the bank, but I consider that I ought first to discuss with the Governor whether it is desirable to make public statements . about, the bank's gold holdings, or any other kind of holdings.. I do not see much objection to such a statement being made, but I think. I ought to discuss that matter with him, because,, as Treasurer, I have never tried to influence the Commonwealth Bank to publish information other than that which the Commonwealth Bank Act requires it to publish. It is not usual for banks to disclose their gold holdings. Indeed, when the Bank of England was a private bank it did not broadcast what it held. </para>

                                <para>- We have been holding in Australia a great quantity of gold but it was not owned by the Commonwealth Bank. A large quantity was held, on behalf of the Bank of England, but the greater part of that has been shipped. We are also holding gold in Australia on behalf of certain other governments and foreign banks. We have added to our gold holdings, but not greatly, in the last twelve or eighteen months. When I have discussed . the matter with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, I shall be able to say whether it is desirable in the public interest to make public details of the character asked for. I shall at least be prepared to tell honorable members, who have asked questions on this matter, privately what quantity of gold is held, even if I do not make a public statement. </para>

When the Prime Minister was replying to a question asked by the honorable member for Indi with regard to gold holdings of the Commonwealth Bank, he challenged the accuracy of certain figures which I cited in a recent debate. I inform the Prime Minister that the figures which I used were supplied to me by the Commonwealth Statis tician, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Roland</inline> Wilson. If the right honorable gentleman doubts their accuracy, he must doubt the accuracy of the Government Statistician. </para>

                <para>As honorable members will realize, it is imperative that on completion of hostilities action be taken by the Government in the interest of Commonwealth economy to effect demobilization as rapidly as possible, consistent, however, with the retention of an organization and strength of personnel adequate to cope with immediate post-war commitments and demobilization requirements. </para>

Those applications are now being considered in conjunction with the personnel requirements provided in the interim force establishment, and recruitment from outside the service to make good the deficiencies will be initiated as soon as the additional numbers required under each of the various musterings are decided. </para>

                        <para>- A deputation which waited upon me in respect of this matter consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McNamara, Mr.</inline> McLelland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Field</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKenzie,</inline> and I. believe that they represented stockowners and agents in Victoria. The deputation requested that the Government lift the ceiling prices and quotas, and said that if that were done they could guarantee future market supplies. In reply to the first part of the honorable member's question, I have received advice on several occasions during the last few days, including a telegram which I received last evening and to which I have not yet replied, to the effect that the acquisition order was mainly responsible for the withholding of supplies, and that the order should be withdrawn. That advice has been repeated in direct communications from the agents' representative in. Melbourne. That indicates that the agents consider that they have some influence on the withholding of supplies to Melbourne. However, if the acquisition order is the obstacle, and the agents contend that normal supplies will be restored if the order be lifted, I again say definitely to the agents and to all other meat interests in Melbourne, that when they are able to inform me that normal supplies are available that order will be lifted. </para>

                            <para>- Is the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture able to confirm an allegation made at. the meeting which offered suggestions in respect to the settlement of the meat dispute in Melbourne that, prior to the action taken by the Government to issue the acquisition order and take certain other steps which resulted in that dispute, there was a consultation upon- such projected action between the wholesale butchers and the meat control authorities? It  is  alleged that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tonkin,</inline> the Meat Controller, made an admission to that effect. If the Minister is not able to confirm this allegation will he make inquiries into the matter ? As the principal wholesale butchers in Melbourne are Angliss and Company, which is Vesteys Limited, and the  Deputy  Meat .Controller ' in Victoria was previously an employee of Angliss and Company, and as the authority of the Government to maintain its control of meat may suddenly disappear through a court decision and the  Deputy  Controller may thereupon resume work for his former employers, does the Government consider it entirely proper that such ;a consultation should <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> taken place? I also ask whether the . Government considers it proper that prior to the taking of such action, there should have been confidential consultations -between the wholesale hoteliers and the Meat Controller, and no consultations whatever between that Got  vernment  authority and the producers who, af ter all, are the persons principally  concerned? </para>

The landing was one of hundreds of landings which have been made at Western Junction under similar conditions over the years. Whilst I d-o not desire to pass judgment on the crew of the aircraft, the 'fact that so many safe landings have been made over a long period indicates that it is perfectly safe to operate aircraft on the aerodrome in its present condition. Nevertheless, I have indicated to the honorable member for Wilmot and other representatives of Tasmanian constituencies that the construction of hard-surfaced r.unways at Western Junction is now under consideration, and I shall be happy , to facilitate the work as .soon as it is possible to do so. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Minister for the Army read in the press reports that Australian troops in Japan are complaining of " unbelievable bungling" in occupation plans? Is it a fact, as reported, that 129 men are living in '.an unheated room measuring 120 feet by 140 feet? Is it also a fact that the occupation forces have not, been immunized against typhus, which is prevalent in Japan? Will the Minister inform the House what, action has been taken to examine press reports of hardship amongst occupation troops, which persist despite official denials? </para>

                            <para>- My attention has  been  drawn to a report  in  the press following a similar report of a few days ago. The second report added that "angry officers blamed fumbling by politicians at Canberra for the state of affairs ".  I say very definitely that- 1 doubt whether any officer made such a. statement, because it is .absolutely absurd to suggest that any Minister at Canberra has been responsible for the internal arrangements made for Australian members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan. The statement to which the honorable gentleman refers is attributed to an unnamed Reuter's correspondent, who alleges that disillusioned Australian troops" have complained that plans for British occupation of Japan have been " unbelievably bungled ". </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>Such arrangements are obviously a matter primarily under the control of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces, who is in turn responsible to the joint  Chiefs  of Staff, known as Joint Chiefs of Staff, Asia, stationed at. Melbourne,' who are representative of the United Kingdom,. New Zealand and Australia. Statements of a similar nature to that mentioned by the honorable member, alleging "bungling ", recently appeared in a report published in sections of the press under the name of a correspondent, Massey Stanley. On that occasion the situation was thoroughly investigated by Lieutenant-General Northcott.  Commander in Chief, British Commonwealth Occupation Forces, who, in a report to Joint Chiefs of Staff, Asia, described the statements as " misleading and inaccurate ". General Northcott reported' that the article gave a "most distorted " view of the actual situation. General Northcott carried out a personal inspection  of  the Australian troops in their- quarters, and, considering the short period that units  had  been ashore, he found everything most satisfactory and reported  that  the men were happy  to be in  Japan after months of waiting  in  the tropics. He added that officers and men  of  advanced units  of  British, New Zea-V land and Indian contingents had expressed satisfaction with and admiration  of  arrangements made for their accommodation and reception. In General </para>
                    <para class="block">Northcott's opinion, the movement into the area had been well organized and efficiently carried out. There was evidence of damage to certain installations which had previously been occupied by American forces at Kure, but such damage was being repaired and improvements were being carried out. Investigation by General Northcott revealed that fresh meat and vegetables were on issue, and that fresh meat had been available in ample quantities since the arrival of the first troops. Limited quantities of fresh vegetables were available. Temporary heating of buildings had been installed until such time as oil heating stoves could be unloaded and tested before use. Sporting amenities were available to troops on arrival, and cinemas and canteens were in operation. The further criticism of the living conditions in the British occupation zone by the Reuter's correspondent has been brought under the notice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Asia, who in turn will take the matter up with LieutenantGeneral Northcott. On receipt of a further report from General  Northcott  the matter will again be considered by Joint Chiefs of Staff, Asia. </para>

                            <para>- No official application has been made by the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia for the issue of any passports, and consequently no such application has been refused; but that does not prevent the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Harold</inline> from- making one of  its  usual mischievous and lying statements that passports have been, refused bv me for the Australian tennis team. The other newspapers, of course, published a different story, which proves that the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> is now edited and published from the deepest of Sydney's sewers. The facts are that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Brookes,  chairman  of the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia, yesterday rang my private secretary and asked him to ascertain from me what the position would be if the association made an application- for passports for the Australian tennis team. He was informed that it was the desire of the Government that nothing should be permitted to interfere with the early transport to Australia from the United Kingdom of the wives and children of Australian servicemen, who had priority in the allotment of steamer passages. My secretary added that as the association's proposal involved the provision, of passenger accommodation from Australia to Great Britain and, a. few months later, from Great Britain to Australia, it was not likely that the Government would receive any such application favorably. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> was also told that such an application would prove embarrassing to the Government and the association alike. My secretary asked if the team would travel by air both to and from the United Kingdom, stating that if such an assurance were given, particularly in respect of travel from the United Kingdom to Australia, passports would probably be issued. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> replied that air travel would be too costly, and that the association desired the team to travel by steamer. During a later conversation on the subject, an officer of the association was told that the issue of passports to the team raised difficulties because of the thousands of people who. had been waiting for a long time to go to London on legitimate business or who for compassionate reasons were entitled to priority of travel over members of the sporting fraternity. The Melbourne officials of the association were understanding, and said that already, on two occasions, the association itself had decided not to send a team to Wimbledon as it was aware of the difficulties that existed in regard to passenger accommodation on ships. The pressure for the despatch of the team to Wimbledon came from Sydney, and an attack has been made by certain Sydney officials of the association upon a decision which I did not give and which was not asked of me. I now refer to a conversation between my secretary and two pressmen, one representing the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> and the other the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning. Herald.</inline> I do not blame the representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> for that newspaper's published distortion of the facts, because what he was told does not appear iri his newspaper, which carried a story concocted in Melbourne. These two pressmen were told what the position was, and also that the Government had done nothing to facilitate the passage to Australia of an English rugby team. That team is coming to Australia on a British aircraft carrier and apparently the members of it will serve as ratings <inline font-style="italic">en route.</inline> The Government.has not provided any facilities or made any arrangements for the displacement of any brides, children or fiancées of Australian servicemen' by footballers who wish to visit Australia. I do not believe that any true lovers of sport, whether they be cricketers, tennis players or rugby footballers, will support the attempt that is being made by certain people to make political capital out of a decision which, I am sure, will commend itself to the hearts and minds of the great majority of the Australian people. </para>

The buffalo fly, contrary to f he 'belief of many people, is not a 'huge insect nf 'the blowfly type, but is a very small' fly a"bout one-half the size of the ordinary house fly. ft settles in thousands on those parts of the body of stock which cannot be reached by the tail, the horns or the head, and never leaves the unfortunate animal which, consequently, is tortured throughout the twenty-four hours of the day. I have a copy of a letter written to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> English, of Malanda, on the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland. It was in consequence of the receipt of this and like letters that I proceeded to north Queensland about eighteen or 20 months ago, personally to acquaint myself with the problem. This is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. English</inline> wrote in May, 1944 - </para>

Upon my return .to the south, I organized a deputation/of members to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and the Minister for Munitions <inline font-weight="bold">-(Mr. Makin)</inline> - who, at that time, had the power to make materials available. I regret that .the Government has done practically nothing except make promises. Meanwhile, the fly has been moving southward without much hindrance from the authority responsible for checking its spread. In a letter to me dated the 6th June, 1944, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction said that he considered it utterly out of the question to establish a buffer area to prevent the southward advance of the fly. and that "he also considered it impossible  to prevent the ultimate spread of the fly to the limits of its climatic suitability. </para>

                        <para>- At this time,* I was doing my utmost to impress Ministers with the seriousness of the problem; and I have been continuing my endeavours ever since. On the 6th June, 1944, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, in a telegram to me, said that he was fully seized with the gravity of the problem, but did not favour the sending of a commission to northern Queensland to report on it. At that time, I was, and I have been since, urging that, because of the seriousness of the problem, a commission composed of veterinary experts and cattlemen should be sent to the affected areas to gain first-hand knowledge, and report to the Minister upon their investigations. The only satisfaction that I received from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture was contained in a letter to him, from the East  Barron dairymen's organization which he forwarded to me, asking for the retention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Norris,</inline> an officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Malanda.

                </quote><para class="block">Every effort by me and others to have the matter independently investigated has been frustrated. In a letter to the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> on the 11th July, 1944, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture said - it is known that in parts of the country where the buffalo fly has existed for several years,  the cattle have accommodated them selves to thu  fly  and have' shown little signs of loss of condition, although at first they were badly affected when attacked by the fly- </para><para>Apparently, that was regarded as good ground for complacency. The letter went on to say - </para><quote>
                    <para>Therefore, while the loss of production may be rather serious in the early stages, it is probable that the loss will decline considerably within a year or two. </para>
                </quote><para>That was the answer of the Minister to requests for prompt action to avert a calamity. Before I left for northern Queensland in July, 1944, I was assured by the Minister that a research station had been established at Malanda and - using his words - " everything possible was being done ". </para><para>When I arrived at Malanda I found . the research station to be a small room in the local hotel building, and the only practical piece of equipment in it was a refrigerator in which to store samples of blood and other matter. The young scientist, whose name is Norris, was keenly anxious to serve, but he was handicapped in every .way by the lack of adequate help and equipment. He had one part-time assistant in the person of the local daily instructor. One would have expected that he would have been provided with the labour for manual tasks, but he had to do even a substantial part of the fencing in order to erect the fly trap, ;of which I have a photograph. In the last Estimates an amount of over £750,000 was expended by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I ask the Minister in charge of that institution, how much of that money was used in the investigation of the buffalo fly problem? I challenge him to say that the expenditure, in that direction exceeded even £5,000, although millions of pounds is involved in the beef and dairying industries and food production is seriously threatened. I shudder to think of the consequences to the cattle and dairying industries of northern New South Wales and southern .Queensland, if as little is  done to   help the farmer as I found to be the case when I visited northern Queensland. The producers there were left practically to their own devices. They were using every kind of insecticide from  flytox  to sheep dip in a desperate effort to help themselves. They were unable to secure the necessary materials, such as wire gauze, to build the traps which the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research said should be used, and which have proved to be effective so far as dairy-farms are concerned. </para><para>On my return- to Canberra, as I mentioned earlier, I organized a deputation to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, as the result of which 625 coils of gauze wire, sufficient for 650 traps, were made available to the farmers of northern Queensland. I point out, however, that in the area which the fly is now approaching - the Burnett, Gympie, and Maryborough districts and the Moreton and South Coast districts of Queensland - there are about 30,000 dairy-farms. I have been informed by the New South  Wales Department of Agriculture that each cage trap - and one will be essential at every milking yard - requires 400 superficial feet of timber and 35 yards of gauze; or, if glass is used, it might require IS square yards of glass. I have not the exact figures with regard to glass. It is only a matter pf simple arithmetic to determine that 30,000 dairy-farms will require 12,000,000 superficial feet of timber and 1,000,000 yards of gauze. If glass is used, over 500,000 square yards will be needed. </para><para>The Minister has said that after the fly becomes established in a district, the cattle get used to it and no. very serious damage is done, but I have two letters, bearing on that point, one of which is from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> D. Davies, secretary of the North Queensland Coastal Cattle Fatteners Association, Innisfail, who wrote to me on the Sth August last as follows : - </para><quote>

The delay in providing it is inexcusable, because I saw it being sprayed on beasts at Townsville eighteen months ago.

                </quote><para class="block">When I was in Queensland the fly had become established in Nebo, in the Clermont district. I have a map before me which will show the Minister how seriously the fly has spread since then. In January, 1943, it had reached Malanda, in north Queensland, which is 900 miles from the New South Wales border. In July, 1944, eighteen months later, it had advanced 360 miles, and was then 540 miles from New South Wales. In November, 1945, a letter from the Minister showed that the line of advance was from Springsure to Bororen, so that the fly had advanced 160 miles in seventeen months, and was then only 3S0. miles from  New South Wales. I am informed by the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann)</inline> that the fly is now in the districts of Taroom and Eidsvold, and is now less than 180 miles from the New South Wales border'. Two years ago it was 900 miles away from the border and now it is only 180 miles away, yet the Government says that everything possible has been done ! The pest is now entering a district through which it will be able to spread like a fire through dry grass. It is entering the rich dairying districts of South Burnett, Gympie, Maryborough, and the electorate of the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> where the dairy farms adjoin for many miles. There are in those two areas in South Queensland 16,000 dairy-farmers, but nothing has been done' to meet the situation that will exist when the fly eventually reaches there. All that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has done is to issue a circular dated the 16th November telling farmers how they can mix an emulsion containing a DDT, and use spreaders of various kinds. Another circular issued about the 30th December gave details of the construction of a new kind of fly trap,- using glass instead of gauze. It was not until the 14th February last that the Minister gave any sign of recognizing the seriousness of the problem. On that date he held a conference with the Ministers of Agriculture of New South Wales and Queensland. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of lime granted.]</inline> Afterwards, a statement was issued by the Ministers to the effect that they realized that the problem of the buffalo fly must be treated as a national one. They recognized the inroads which the fly was making into the production of milk in Queensland, and how it was having the effect of reducing the weight of beef cattle aid damaging hides. It was further stated that an agreement had been reached to provide funds for research purposes. This was twenty months after honorable members had stressed as emphatically as possible the danger threatening the cattle industry. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture promised that he would try to arrange for a supplementary grant to be made for investigation purposes. </para><para>Now the fly has reached the northern edge of the south Burnett district, and also the districts of Maryborough' and Moreton. In those districts there are more than 640,000 dairying cattle which produce S3,000,000 lb. of butter a year. There are 864,000 beef cattle, and 16,000 dairy farmers. In northern New South Wales, where the fly may be expected to make its appearance at any time in the next twelve months, there are 1,776,000 cattle of which 976.000 are dairy cattle. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Nicholson,</inline> of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, has said that fly, once it enters New South Wales, will probably spread as far south as Newcastle and Sydney. Butter production in this threatened area amounts to 76,000,000 lb. a year, or 82 per cent, of the total butter production of New South Wales. The area produces 4,491,000 lb. of cheese, or 44 per cent, of the total State production. It also produces 523,000 pigs,  or 51 per cent, of the total State production. The value of the butter produced in southern Queensland and New South Wales is £12,000,000. a year. Although food production in this area is so seriously threatened, a mere trifle has been expended up to date by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research on research work to control the menace, and only a handful of men have been made available for the work. In reply to the statement of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture about eighteen months' ago that cattle became inured to the fly after a year or two, and that, there was, therefore, no need to take active control measures, I quote the following telegram which I received the day before yesterday from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> Davies, secretary of the stockowners of Innisfail : - </para><quote>

                </continue><para>I have here a- map which illustrates the rapid advance of the buffalo fly during  the last few years. In  1941,  it had reached a line beyond Douglas. By  1942,  it was down to Cardwell, in the Innisfail district. By  1943,  it was as far south as Townsville, and in  1944  it had reached Nebo and Clermont. In November,  1945,  it reached Springsure and Bororen, having advanced  160  miles in seventeen months. After the lapse of a further four and a half months, it. had travelled another '  200  miles south of Springsure, and, is now in the Taroom and Eidsvold districts, where it is only 180 miles from the New South Wales border. The rapidity of this advance requires immediate action by the Government. It has not been my purpose to embarrass the Government by advocating the establishment of buffer areas. I believe such schemes to be as impracticable as Ministers have described them. I believed that it was impracticable to establish such areas, and the Minister, after investigation, came to the same conclusion. It was suggested at one time that a buffer area  50  or  100'  miles wide should be established on the Queensland, coast, andall cattle removed from it. I did not believe that it was possible to do that. However, I now . make a suggestion that the following measures be applied: - </para><list type="decimal-dotted">

I shall not say more on this subject as I know that other honorable members wish tospeak. In view of the seriousness of thesituation, the rapidity withwhich thefly is moving, and also the probable greatloss of production, I urge the Government to act promptly. As an illustration  of the loss of production caused by the buffalo fly, I point OUt that when the fly strikes a dairying district, and is not combated, the production of some cows falls by as much as 50 per cent.; the average loss of production is from 20 per cent. to. 25 per cent. I do not charge the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture with- being unsympathetic, but I do not say that, he has neglected to do the things which ought to have been done, with the result that when the fly strikes southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, farmers there will be totally unprepared because of the lack of government assistance. </para></speech>

                    <para>. - It will In- obvious when I have concluded my speech that this motion has been moved solely for party political purposes. Consequently, the Government does not intend that the debate shall continue after the.: suspension of the sitting for luncheon. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> has used a number of extravagant phrases this morning. He has spoken of the complacency of the Government and its recognition of this belated problem, and has gone so far as to charge it with neglect of duty. Let us look at the problem in order to see who has been guilty of complacency, a belated recognition of the problem, and neglect of duty. The buffalo fly problem is not something new. The fly was recognized in the islands to the north of Australia over one hundred years ago,and it probably caine to the Australian mainland about that time. It was first officially recognized on the mainland of Australia in 1912, and in 1926 the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research began its investigations with a view to combating the pest. As  the honorable member has stated, this pes is n. small fly. It is entirely different from the cattle tick, which can be dealt with by dipping vin- animal.* affected. The buffalo fly is transported on the budies  of cattle and it can fly on its own account. It is, therefore, a very much more difficult pest to control than is the cattle tick. The spread of this pest can be- likened to the spread of a contagious disease. Should a case of influenza occur and the patient be completely isolated from contact with the outside community, the spread of that disease can be controlled. But it cannot be controlled so effectively once it has begun to spread through the community. Exactly the same thing happens in connexion with the buffalo fly pest. It could have been controlled in the past, when governments with views similar to those held by honorable members opposite were in power, but to-day the pest has spread to such an extent that at this stage its further advance cannot be checked. That is the opinion of scientific experts, who have studied the problem. If the honorable member for Richmond thinks that he knows what is likely to happen better than they do, he is setting himself up as a. judge in matters of which he does not know much. As I have said, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research first began its investigations in 1926. A survey carried out in conjunction with the Western Australian Department of Agriculture showed that the fly had spread as far east as the Robinson River. At that time it was confined to a fairly narrow belt of favorable country south of the Gulf of Carpentaria. I admit that that was a long time ago, but at that stage- the advance of the fly could have been prevented. It is useless for the honorable member for Richmond to say that the present Government should stop1 the advance of the buffalo fly. He charged the Council for -Scientific and Industrial Research with neglect, and asked how much money had been expended on attempting to eradicate the pest. As research into the buffalo fly pest has been in progress for twenty years, it is impossible for me to say at a moment's notice what expenditure has been incurred in that connexion. It is not, however, a matter of the expenditure of money. If £1,000,000 were expended, and an army of scientists were engaged in research, the advance of the buffalo fly could not now be prevented. In 1929 two entomologists were sent to Java to study the buffalo fly pest there, and they continued their work in that region and in northern Australia for several years. The original object of the work in Java was to determine why the buffalo fly was not considered a serious pest in that country. When the fly reached the mainland of Australia the conditions were entirely different, and it became a pest, whereas it is not a pest in the country where it originated. By 1931, it had spread well into Queensland. Honorable members opposite supported governments that were in power from 1931 onwards but they did not do anything to stop the advance of the fly when it could have been checked by the provision of a buffer area. I agree with the honorable member for Richmond that that is not possible to-day. </para>

I went to Malanda at a much more recent date and made a thorough investigation of the incidence of the fly and its effect upon dairy cattle at Malanda and on the Atherton Tableland generally.

                        <para>- My inspection of the area in  1945  proved that the fly could be controlled on dairy farms. I examined many farms where traps had been erected and saw that they are effective. The honorable member for Richmond referred to improving the traps. I do not know whether he meant traps of the type that he saw in  1944  or that I saw in  1945.  Improvements to the contrivance are possibly being made all the time, but the latest model trap, which is described in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research bulletin on the subject, is a great improvement on the American-type trap that was originally suggested to the council as being possibly of soma use. If the honorable member can suggest to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research or the Queensland Department of Agriculture further improvements, they will be considered, but I suggest that the honorable gentleman, . who is perhaps an expert on banana production, is not so expert as are the officials of the Queensland Department of Agriculture on such devices as the buffalo fly trap. However, if he lets us have his plan, it will be considered. The honorable member said that the Government had taken some action in this matter after the harm had been done. He used the phrase "After the horse got out of the stable but the. horse got out of the stable when the government he supported was in power, not while the Labour party was in office. </para>

                        <para>- Well, I claimed that this motion was moved for political purposes. The honorable member knows perfectly well that this Parliament has no power to set , up a statutory body to deal with the problem in Queensland because it is a State matter. That dis poses of the honorable gentleman's first point.  His  second suggestion was that the research staff engaged on investigation of the buffalo fly problem should be increased. I have already said that the staff is sufficient to handle the problem. Both the Minister for Agriculture in Queensland and I have had innumerable letters from dairy-farmers saying how much they have been helped by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in its research into the buffalo fly problem. I have already pointed out that, regardless of expenditure on research or the number of research workers employed, we cannot do more than is now being done to combat this pest. Money is not the obstacle to a solution of the problem. The honorable member's third point was that the Government should, provide the materials needed for the construction of these traps. He knows perfectly well that the Commonwealth Government has not the power to produce those materials, and that it has handed back to the States the controls it exercised in war-time. The State governments now entirely control the distribution of those materials. Therefore, it is sheer hypocrisy for the honorable member to suggest that the Commonwealth should provide those materials when, he knows that only the State governments can do so. The fourth point made by the honorable member was that the Commonwealth should restrict the movement of stock; but the Commonwealth has power to do that only in war-time. Only recently, honorable members opposite were complaining about the retention of controls, and raised a great, outcry when I suggested that the Government might find it necessary to acquire stock on the hoof. The honorable member for Richmond knows that the only way the Commonwealth could control thu movement of stock would be by regulation under the National Security Act. He knows that the State Government has power to restrict the movement of stock if it wishes to do so. He suggested that the Commonwealth should do something which he knew it could not do.  His  fifth point was that the Government should enter into mass production of traps. Replying to a question this morning, I reminded honorable members opposite that at the last referendum the Commonwealth asked for power over production. The honorable member for Richmond was among those who went throughout the country urging the people to refuse to .give the Commonwealth power over production of any kind whatsoever.' Now, he says that the Commonwealth should arrange the mass production of traps: He asks the Commonwealth to do something which he himself denied it the power to do through his advocacy in opposition to the Government's referendum proposals. The honorable member's sixth point was that the Government should provide extra money for this purpose.  If  the Government of Queensland requires financial aid from the Commonwealth in order to assist primary producers who have been involved in increased expense in combating the buffalo fly it can, like any other' State Government, apply for such assistance, so that the matter can be investigated and dealt with on a proper basis. Finally,- the honorable member said that the Commonwealth should take steps to ensure sufficient supplies of DDT. </para>

                        <para>- And the Army has used those supplies in order to control diseases in territories in which it was operating. As a medical man the right honorable member would have been the first to criticize the Government if the Army authorities had failed to obtain supplies of DDT for that purpose. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.']</inline> I- have dealt with the seven points made by the honorable member, for Richmond in moving the motion, and I have controverted each, of them. I have shown that they are matters which do not come within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, or, if they do, the necessary steps have been taken by the Government. The honorable member made a visit in 1944 to areas in Queensland infested by buffalo, fly. . Evidently, he is. completely out of touch with the present position, because he had much to say about the adverse effect of the fly on dairy herds, whereas the trap which has been evolved is completely effective in controlling the fly among dairy herds. However, the problem of combating the pest among cattle on the ranges must still be overcome. It has been suggested that traps erected at salt licks or drinking places might prove effective in dealing with the fly among such cattle. Whilst dairy cattle are yarded every day and can be passed through the trap without inconvenience to the farmer, it would appear that the only way of combating the pest among, cattle on the ranges would be ' by using ' disinfectants such as DDT. The Commonwealth Government cannot produce DDT, which is a patented preparation. The patents are owned by a very big chemical concern which has, in fact, a monopoly of them throughout the world. Again, I remind honorable members opposite that they campaigned against the Government's request to be given complete control over monopolies.' Yet to-day they complain that the -price of DDT is too high. I have also heard complaints that some disinfectants which are being sold under different names and which purport to contain a percentage of DDT are, in fact, entirely useless. The Commonwealth Government has not the power to test preparations of that kind in order to see whether they conform . to label. In fact, the community can be exploited by t]ie sale of these patent preparations just as much as it is exploited by the sale of patent .medicines. But the Commonwealth has no power to deal with these things ; it has no power to deal with any preparation which is a product of a big monopoly.. Honorable members opposite are responsible more than any one else in the community for our lack of power in that respect. </para>

                <para>I repeat that the motion has been moved, purely for party political purposes. If any blame is attachable to any government for failure to recognize this problem earlier and to take adequate steps to deal with it that blame rests upon government..-  which honorable members opposite supported. Those governments failed to prevent this pest from crossing from the Northern Territory into Queensland- and did not do anything to deal with it at that stage when it would have been quite easy to do so. But, now, they criticize this Government for not doing something when the position has practically got out of control. </para>

                    <para>.- The remarks of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> have been the most pathetic that I have listened to in this chamber. They were not only unworthy of a Minister, but also stupid. What a hopeless outlook it is for the producers of Queensland and New South Wales when the Minister holds up his hands in righteous indignation and says that he lacks the power, under the Constitution, to establish an organization to combat the buffalo fly and assist primary producers to get gauze and glass and timber for their traps on sheds. The Minister states that because honorable members on this side of the chamber did not support the Government's referendum proposals, he is not now able to catch even a buffalo fly. What an appalling proposition! The Minister's reply is the weakest that I have ever heard in this House. The honorable gentleman should <inline font-style="italic">how</inline> his head in shame. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Hundreds of thousands of producers from north Queensland to New South Wales are on the verge of losing the productivity of their live-stock at a time when the world urgently requires more fond. People are starving in the devastated areas of Europe, our kinsfolk in Great Britain are undernourished,  and  India is experiencing a famine. Australia should be ' the storehouse of the world, capable of satisfying the needs of all those hungry people, but all that the Minister could say was, "I cannot do anything unless the people endorse the Government's referendum proposals ". Words can hardly describe his attitude. . Never before have. I heard such stupidity in defence of inactivity. Years ago, this Government was warned of the danger of the buffalo fly. I first raised this matter when the present Government was in  office  on the 27th. January, 1943, and Honor able members opposite received my warnings with derision. On that occasion, the Minister said that he had not received any representations about the danger, and did not know anything about it. I then pointed out what had been done to bring the matter to his notice. Between January, 1943, and to-day the buffalo fly has moved 900 miles down the coast of Queensland, destroying valuable beef cattle and the productivity of dairy herds. The pest is responsible for the loss of 25 per cent, of the calves, through being bom prematurely, a loss of weight in cattle as high as 25 per cent., a loss of at least 3s. a hide, and a decline of dairy production of 33 per cent. In 1943 I warned the Minister of those dangers, but he took no action. On the 19th July, 1944, a deputation, which included the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> and myself,, waited on the Minister. We pointed out the serious consequences of the spread of the buffalo fly, and appealed to the honorable gentleman for- assistance to obtain supplies of gauze, timber, and DDT for emulsions for spraying stock, in order to check it and for the provision of traps. What has happened ? To-day, the Minister declared that he cannot do anything because the Government has not the constitutional power to act, but that if we had supported the Government's referendum proposals last year the position might have been different. He implied also that if we did not support the forthcoming referendum he would never be able to catch a buffalo fly. Never in my life have I heard such foolishness. It staggers me. </para>
                <para>The ravages of the buffalo fly are also affecting the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land. " Because of the menace, hundreds of ex-servicemen are reluctant to engage in cattle-raising and dairy production. Two gentlemen who purchased large and valuable properties in my electorate, discussed the problem with me. They informed me that they had bought the properties for their sons, who had served this nation faithfully and helped to defend it during the war.  They  desired to raise stud stock and stud dairy cattle, but because of the ravages of the buffalo fly, they would not attempt to  do so. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has a " dead hand ", he murders everything he touches. Through his neglect, food production is suffering. No person in this community is more dangerous than he is. The Reestablishment and Employment; Bill, which he introduced, provides preference for ex-servicemen for a period of only seven years from the 15th August, 1945. The Minister reduced the period as far as he possibly could, and thereby reduced the value of the preference almost to vanishing point. To-day, hundreds of thousands of servicemen who have not yet been demobilized will receive the benefit of the preference for a period substantially less than seven years. </para>
                <para>Whenever the Minister is allotted a task he fails dismally. I urge him to realize that his indifference to the ravages of the buffalo fly will cost Australia hundreds of millions of pounds. Because of his neglect, food is not being produced in the required quantities. In spite of his contention that he lacks the necessary authority, this problem could be properly tackled if the Commonwealth supplied the Government of Queensland with all the assistance that it needs. With that spirit of co-operation, the pest could have been successfully combated in 1943, when I first raised the matter. But instead of doing that, the Minister is happy to sit back, raise his hands in righteous indignation, and say that he cannot do anything. If the honorable gentleman met some of the cattlemen in my constituency, be would hang his head in shame. Ex-servicemen's organizations in Queensland invited him to visit them and discuss their problems with them, but instead of going north, he went as near to the South Pole as he could. I challenge him <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> make the utterly stupid speech, which he delivered this morning, to some of my constituents, or the electors of Maranoa and Wide Bay. If he did so, he would not leave their meeting without being severely handled. He would not deserve to. Our rural industries are being seriously affected by his indifference. Why does he not do something? </para>
                <para>To-day, the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> referred to the many attempts that had been made to arrest the spread of the buffalo fly. But the only reply which the Minister made was that he had no power to act. Where there is a will there is a way. I am satisfied that if the Minister had the inclination, he could tackle the problem. Instead of doing so, he occupied the time at his disposal this morning in pointing out what he could not do. We are not asking for that information. We should like to know whether he proposes to do anything, because we are anxious to cooperate with him. He accused us of political motives in launching this motion. There can be no politics in the destruction of two of the principal industries of the Commonwealth, namely, the cattleraising industry and the dairying industry. They have been important factors in establishing Australia's favorable trade balance overseas so as to enable us to import the raw materials that we require for our development. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has done as great a disservice to Australia in regard to these industries, as he has done in the handling of the problems of ex-servicemen. </para>

                    <para>. - I have listened with, interest to this debate. At least, the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony)</inline> endeavoured to indicate some reasonable method whereby assistance could be given by the Commonwealth Government to counteract the depredations of the buffalo fly, and for that practical contribution to the debate we are grateful; but generally speaking, honorable members opposite have, by interjection, suggested utter impossibilities. The Government has no wish to minimize the seriousness of this pest which is menacing the beef cattle and dairying industries not only in certain parts of Australia, but also in other countries. Endeavours to halt the onward march of various species of the buffalo fly in the United States of America have been without success. As the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> said, the ultimate check is climatic conditions. It is true, as the honorable member for Richmond said, thai, some time ago a deputation waited on mc and that I promised to visit areas  affected by the buffalo fly. Unfortunately, circumstances prevented me from fulfilling that promise. There was no lack of will on my part to make the visit, but certain difficulties arose, and I found it impossible. However, I sent to those areas, a man who is more familiar with the history and movements of the buffalo fly than any one else in this country. I refer to the Director-General of Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bulcock,</inline> who for twelve years was Minister for Agriculture and Stock in Queensland. Recently in Brisbane, a conference was held of Commonwealth, Queensland and New South Wales Ministers and technical officers, including the most highly qualified technical men in those States. Delegates included myself, the Queensland Minister for Agriculture and Stock, the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> H. Graham, the Commonwealth Director-General of Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.W.</inline> Bulcock, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> H. "Williams, Live-stock Officer, Department of Commerce and Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Max</inline> Henry, Chief of the Division of Live-stock, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Legge,</inline> Chief Veterinary Officer of Queensland.We went into the matter thoroughly. We had before us the history of the buffalo fly and could trace its movements over the years. All available information was supplied to us by scientific and veterinary officers. The conclusion reached was that the depredations of the fly could be reduced only by some method of control, and that the only effective method of control seemed to be the setting of traps. The real difficulty with which cattle-owners have had to contend is that of securing adequate supplies of DDT. When I visited Queensland recently, L received deputations from stock-owners in the areas affected by the buffalo fly, and from the Graziers Association of Queensland: The chief complaint voiced by the spokesmen for these deputations was the inadequate supply of DDT and also its high cost. In addition, there was serious criticism of the quality of the DDT that had been supplied. A promise was given by Queensland and New South Wales Ministers, that immediate steps would be taken to have an analysis made of all supplies of DDT to ensure that it met specific requirements. . That seemed to satisfy most of the stock owners. To every deputation that has waited upon me in regard' to this matter - there have been four or five - I have put the question, " What do you suggest can be done to prevent the spread of the fly? ", and on not one occasion has anybody been able to offer a worthwhile suggestion. All that the deputations sought was the assistance of the Commonwealth and State Governments in ensuring the availability of materials necessary for the erection of traps and only in the dairying districts. They assured me that on the Atherton Tableland four or five hundred traps were operating. I have been informed also that the depredations of the fly are worse immediately upon its entry to a new district. After that, the stock seem to become more tolerant, and to some degree immune from attacks. </para>

                        <para>- I gather that only in exceptional circumstances can the fly live in the drier areas. In very wet seasons it may spread so far inland as Tamworth, but as soon as dry conditions . re-assert themselves, it returns to the moist coastal areas. Members of the Queensland Parliament and cattle owners in the subtropical coastal portions of Queensland have told me that in those regions, after a certain period, stock becomes immune to a certain degree from the buffalo fly. They do not suggest that it is not still a pest; but the general opinion is that its effect upon thestock is minimized. They informed me, also, that they do not think there is anything that can be done. We discussed at length the proposal of a buffer area, and came to the conclusion that it might be a possible solution. </para>

                    <para class="block">The bill is to approve the sugar agreement made on the 17th December, 1945; between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of Queensland. Thebill, which is in substantially the same terms as the Sugar Agreement Act of  1941-1946,  is one of a series of agree- ments dating back to  1915  made between successive governments of the Commonwealth and the State of Queensland. Thirty years of experience have demonstrated the special suitability of the sugaragreement as an effective means of protecting the industry and for giving adequate consideration to the reasonable-  needs of growers, manufacturers, distributors and consumers. Commonwealth and Queensland governments of every political complexion have, since 1915, been parties to various renewals of the agreement. It has indeed become a non-party matter. The existing agreement is due to expire on the 31st August, 1946, and the Commonwealth Government has accepted the invitation of the Government of Queensland and decided to renew the agreement before its expiration. It is  necessary  that the agreement be approved as soon as possible so that the industry will know the position which will exist after August, 1946, and be able to plan accordingly. </para>
                    <para>The Australian sugar industry is to be congratulated on the very good production effort it made in the very difficult circumstances existing during the war. As in the previous war, Australian consumers and manufacturers were protected by the fixation of the home consumption price by the sugar agreement. No matter what fantastic heights the price of sugar reached on the world's markets, and irrespective of whether Australian seasons were good or poor, Australian consumers for very many years have had to pay only. 4d. per lb., which, as the following statement shows, is the lowest retail price in any capital city in the world at present. "Consumers and manufacturers have been protected under the sugar agreement from the high prices prevailing in the world's .markets not only during the war but also during peace-time. The present retail price of sugar has stood for fourteen years. In this respect, it takes a unique place amongst important primary products. Exporters of manufactured preducts are protected by special conditions in the agreement which enable them to obtain their sugar at the Australian equivalent of the world parity price or £32 10s. 9d. a ton, whichever is the lower. "Whilst accepting with gratification the stability and security which the agreement' affords, the industry has expressed some fear for the future. The limitation of prices to prevailing amounts was viewed with some misgivings and assurances were .sought that the Commonwealth would meet any further increases of production costs and reimburse the industry in the event of a fall of export, prices. It must be pointed out that the industry has been able to carry on at the present domestic price, despite increased costs of certain of its requirements, principally because of the remarkable improvement of its efficiency. The acreage yield in terms of raw sugar is now at least twice as great as it was in 1900, while the mills have also -greatly increased their efficiency during the last 30 years: Further, the Tariff Board in 1944 conducted an intensive investigation into the economics of the industry in respect of the 1943 crop, which was one of the worst- seasons experienced, but found that the payment of a subsidy was not war: ranted. The Commonwealth Government, however, while taking the stand that there could be no grounds for varying the existing terms of the agreement, recognized that future Australian cost levels were unpredictable, and accordingly gave an assurance to the Queensland Government that if, during the currency of the agreement, cost levels in Australia increased substantially it would be prepared, on representations from the Queensland Government, to give consideration to instituting an investigation into the sugar industry's, position in relation thereto. The claim by Queensland that the Commonwealth should guarantee the price of export sugar could not be entertained. The Commonwealth could not recognize as an obligation that it should subsidize sugar exports, and this is specifically provided under clauses 9 and 10 of the agreement. Clause 9 states - </para>

                    <para>Advice was received from the secretary of the Federation ofRetail Grocers Associations that his executive had instructed him to state that, if any adjustment was to be made to the wholesale price of sugar, provision should also be made for an increased margin to the grocer. As the wholesale price remains unchanged under the new agreement, the question of any alteration to the retailer's margin, therefore, does not arise. It must be pointed out that the Sugar Agreement is a document which relates mainly to peace-time conditions, and is based on the normal powers of the Commonwealth. The retail price of sugar is, therefore, not relevant to this bill. The Government has also received representations that the existing 2 per cent. wholesale discount be granted to what are termed " genuine wholesalers " only. The agreement provides that this 2 per cent. discount is allowable to any person, firm or corporation who or which in the opinion of the Queensland Sugar Board - </para>

                    <para class="block">The Government recognizes that the wholesale trade is an essential and important factor in the distribution of sugar and other groceries, and both the Commonwealth Government and the Queensland Government gave careful consideration to these representations when reviewing the agreement. Both governments agreed, however, that it would be undesirable to revert to the chaotic conditions which applied before 1940, when, under the agreement then existing, an endeavour was made to restrict the trade in the manner now desired. It has been decided, therefore, that it would be in the best interests of all concerned to allow 'the conditions for wholesale discount to remain as prescribed in the 1941-46 agreement. The agreement continues to provide for the prohibition of imports of sugar into Australia, except as to types of sugar which may be required for special manufacturing purposes and for scientific research. In consideration of this extended prohibition of imports, the Queensland Government accepts numerous obligations, the chief of which are - </para>

                    <para>In conclusion, I point out that on previous occasions the economic value of this industry to Queensland has been stressed. On this occasion it is quite unecessary for me to mention at length the great national importance of this industry, which has supplied Australia and other countries with sugar throughout the war period when sugar supplies were unobtainable from other sources. </para>
                    <para>The agreement is essential to the stability of the industry and to the security of the many people dependent upon it for their livelihood. I, therefore, commend to the House this bill for the approval of the new sugar agreement, believing thatall honorable members will agree that it provides equitable treatment for all sections of the community. </para>

Having regard to the fact that uniform income taxation has been made permanent, it becomes necessary to make certain consequential changes in respect of civil service superannuation, the rights of transferred officers and wartime arrangements generally as they existed under the original scheme. As 1 have said all I desire to say on the larger question involved, I do not propose to add to the debate on this bill or the four that will follow it. </para>

                        <para>.- The purpose of this bill is to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act. Any such bill is of importance because of the tremendous implications of the taxation policy in operation in Australia at present, which affects every man and woman in the community. Before World War I. Commonwealth income tax was unknown to our people. It began its tremendous growth from the- days of that war and it has now reached proportions which at that time were undreamed of. A great widening of the ambit and severity of taxation has also occurred. Just prior to the outbreak of World War II. only 300,000 people in Australia were paying income tax. To-day, the number is more than 1.700,000. As our 600,000 odd service men and women obtain their discharges the. number of taxpayers in the community will again be greatly increased. By the time demobilization has been completed we may expect to havewell over 2,000,000 income taxpayers in. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Australia, and that will be a very substantial proportion of the total population. As might be expected the quantum of tax collection has been swollen greatly. The budget of 193S-39, introduced prior to the outbreak of the Avar, estimated that £76,000,000 would be collected in that financial year. The budget  estimate  for  this  financial year, which includes many months of peace, is £336,000,000. I have no doubt that when the final collections have been made for this year the amount will ba substantially in excess of the estimate. Honorable members will no doubt bc interested to note how the volume of taxation collected in Australia has grown during the last five years. In the latest issue- of the booklet. <inline font-style="italic">Facts and Figures</inline> made available to us by the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> we are. furnished with the somewhat gloomy intelligence that from the middle of 1939 to September, 1945, tha total amount of tax collected was £844,000,000. But that is not the complete story, for those figures refer only to income tax. As we all know, there are many other sources from which both direct and. indirect taxation is . obtained. As we move about from day to day we cannot avoid realizing how these taxes affect the family budget and the individual pocket. If you take what I regard as the truer figure of total tax collections, you will find that for the five years ended June 1945, the Government collected £1,651,000.000. When the present year has concluded, that will have swollen to over £2,000,000,000- an ' astronomic figure for this voting country with a population of 7,000,000. We have become almost reconciled to the fact that we are, and have been for some years, the heaviest taxed people in the world; but we experience more difficulty' in reconciling ourselves to the probability that we shall be the last country in the world to experience a substantial reduction of the enormous tax burden that we are called upon to bear. In other parts of the English-speaking world, the position is very different. Already it has been found practicable in Britain, the United States of America and Canada to make considerable reductions of taxes compared with war-time levels. The Treasurer of South </para>
                    <para class="block">Africa, introducing his budget recently, described the proposed tax remissions in that dominion as a veritable Pandora's Box of benefits for the taxpayers. Contrast the position in Australia. An insignificant reduction of taxation was announced in the budget last year. If. did not take effect until the 1st January of this year, and in respect of income tax it represented one-sixteenth of the amount to be collected from each individual. There were not, at that time, reductions of the enormous taxes of other kinds. The total tax collections in the present year will be very much greater than in the previous year, despite the so-called remissions. All sections of the people of the Commonwealth were expecting a spectacular- reduction of taxation at an early date, by reason of the termination of the war resulting in a reduction of expenditure on armaments and the discharge of hundreds of thousands of service personnel; but even as recently as the last few weeks, when speaking in the course of the Henty byelection campaign, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> damped whatever hopes we might have had when he said that he could not offer any prospect of a reduction of taxes in the near future. Inthe absence of a clearer statement of Government policy, that is the sorry position in which we find ourselves at the present time. Members of. the Opposition consider that that statement has placed an unnecessary obstruction against normal recovery of the Australian- economy in the post-war period. We believe that substantial reductions of taxation are possible, and should be made. The Liberal party as a whole, not merely the parliamentary section of  it, has announced that, if returned to power, income tax reductions will be made, aggregating 40 per cent, during the next three years. In saying that, we. do not contemplate that there shall be a trifling reduction in the first year and probably a more substantial reduction later. What we envisage is a reduction in the first year which will give a real impetus to economic recovery in Australia. I shall be most disappointed if it is not possible to state that in the first year, should we resume office, the reduction will -be at least 25 per cent, on personal income tax rates. </para>
                    <para class="block">We consider that a .close examination of Government policy and accounts proves that to be practicable. Our views in that respect are supported by the dispassionate and very close examination of the problem which has been made by the economists attached to the Institute of Public Affairs in Victoria. They have gone to considerable pains to prove that the reduction I have mentioned should be practicable in the next three years. How tax reductions should be made is a matter of detail with which I am not required to deal on this occasion; but as this bill is aimed primarily at giving concessions which, though minor, are useful so far as they go, in order to  encourage  the conversion of war-time industries in' Australia to peace-time purposes, it may be interesting to consider for a moment the comparative usefulness of substantial reductions of company tax compared with substantial reductions of personal income tax. In recent years, studies of the tax position have been made by experts in the United States of America and Great Britain. Generally, their findings go to show that it would be preferable in those countries to grant material relief in respect of company tax before  dealing with the tax oh personal incomes. They point out that the high taxes on industry have four main disadvantages: They reduce business reserves and thus the rate of capital development, detract from business incentive and the willingness to undertake risky forms of investment, and tend to hold up prices and to depress wages. The conclusion arrived at was that, when the contraction of war expenditure made possible a reduction of taxation the reduction in respect of the tax on .profits should eventually be greater proportionately than that in respect of the income of individuals. The problem in Australia is somewhat dissimilar, and leads to a different conclusion. Our rates of tax on personal incomes are very much higher than the rates in the United States of America. Associated with that, we have the principle of the double taxation of company profits, which results in profits being taxed not merely in the hands of the company but also in the hands of the individual when distributed in the. form of dividends. </para>
                    <para class="block">Consequently, the net return to the individual on his investment is very small indeed, particularly as the dividends are taxed at property rates. Although, as I- hope to show, the reduction of the taxes on companies should be substantial, the first priority in Australia to-day, if we are to restore to the employer and employee the incentive, to speed up the sluggish response which Australian industry so far has manifested towards our peace-time demands, must be such a degree of relief from personal income tax as will, lead to that expansion of production which the national economy is demanding at the present time. </para>
                    <para>Turning to the position of companies, a particularly strong case is to be made out for relief in that direction. I do not intend to spend much time in examining the main proposals in this amending bill. It is claimed that they provide some assistance to post-war industry to get back into production for the purposes of peace. If we' examine the principal provisions, we find that they relate to a special allowance in respect of research activities conducted by Australian industries. They allow specially favorable rates of depreciation to those organizations that install amenities for their employees. They provide a favorable rate of depreciation in respect of machinery installed after June, 1945. The Government has not gone so far as the British Parliament, which has provided specially favorable rates of depreciation in respect of buildings constructed for peace-time production. There is one important and significant concession, namely, an extension of the concessional period of six months, which previously obtained in respect of technicians a.nd experts brought from overseas to aid Australian industry. That period has been extended to twelve months, and, in certain cases, where the Secondary Industries Commission gives a certificate that such a course would be desirable, the twelve months period may be extended to two years. These concessions are useful enough in themselves, but if it is claimed by the Government that that represents its policy for the encouragement of industry in Australia in the post-war years, I say that Ministers have dealt with only a fraction of that problem, and that the mass of Australian employers and Australian industries will experience little practical benefit as the result of the action taken under this measure. One would imagine that any government which bothered to peer beneath the surface would be convinced of the necessity for giving every possible encouragement to, not only the big industries, but also the small ones. </para>
                    <para>I have indicated something of the quantum of tax which governments have collected in past years from the Australian companies. It is estimated that for the financial year 1945-1946, the estimated collections from the taxation of profits will amount to £59,000,000. This sum is about £15,000,000 more than the total amount of tax collected by the Commonwealth from this source in any year prior to the war. That, of course, is only the beginning of the story. It, does not take into account the pay-roll tax, which makes a big contribution to Commonwealth revenues, and the sales tax, which is an enormous impost. Even then, we have not got anywhere near the bottom of the well. Every telephone call made by an Australian business firm, every cheque that is signed, every letter that is posted, and every gallon of petrol that is used in the course of business, carries its share of Commonwealth or State imposts, and contributes to the revenues of governments in Australia. Therefore, every business in this country, however big or small, however profitable or unprofitable, continues to be the provider of an incessant stream of dividends for governments in the Commonwealth. As each one of them represents a small gold-mine, the Government should take every possible action to see that they are kept in a healthy state, so that the payment of dividends may be maintained. It should not overlook the fact that the law of diminishing returns can apply where taxation rates are concerned no less than in other directions. </para>
                    <para>I mentioned earlier that these concessions would mainly assist the larger industries in the Commonwealth. That is undoubtedly true. The big organizations are those that bring experts from overseas, are able to expend considerable sums on research, and will get the greatest benefits from, special allowances in respect of machinery. The smaller organizations have not, in the war years, been able to build up reserves to the same degree as their larger competitors. They are mainly family concerns. The individuals engaged in those businesses have to carry the highest rates of tax, and can put very little away in reserves for expansion. But the large undertakings, with their capital position established over a long period, and concerned with the payment of moderate dividends from time to time, can set aside large reserves for expansion purposes. During the war, we have witnessed the steady concentration of business in the hands of the larger organizations in Australia at the expense of the smaller ones. It has always amazed me that a government, which claims to represent especially the smaller man, has consistently pursued a. policy which has built up the  larger businesses at the expense of the smaller ones. Just how important small industries were in the Australian scheme of things immediately prior to the war is indicated by statistics contained in the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">YearBook,</inline> which show that at least 50 per cent, of industrial employment was given by organizations with fewer than 100 employees. Prior to that time the number employed in larger organizations was slightly fewer than in the smaller concerns, but during the war, with big war orders concentrated in the larger industrial establishments, the proportions changed. Last year fewer than 40 per cent, of the employees were engaged in organizations with fewer than 100 employees, whilst about 60 per cent, were employed in the bigger businesses. I believe that that trend is continuing and will be accentuated in the post-war period. There has never been a time in the history of Australia when it has been more difficult for a man with small capital reserves, but with an abundance of industry and enterprise, to establish himself. There are all the difficulties which war-time controls impose, and the further drawback that out of the balance left to him, after paying his personal taxes little remains for business expansion. That is an unhealthy trend in a young and growing country like Australia. As happened in the  United  States of America, small industries built up on the basis' of the family group, or conducted by two or throe individuals of capacity, should gradually expand; but that is not the situation which has developed in Australia in recent years, and which the policy of the Government is maintaining. The solution of that problem is not to be found in <inline font-style="italic">u</inline> minor reduction of taxes. Lt requires a genuine and considerable reduction if the requisite encouragement is to  be given to the individual. On this point honorable members "will find considerable interest in a lecture by Colin Clark, who is, I think, known to most of them. The lecture, which was one of the John Fisher series, was delivered in Adelaide just before the war, the title being, "Australian Economic Progress Against a World Background ". So many of us are apt to assume - I among them  - that there is in man's affairs a steady development towards a higher economic level, that this lecture makes extraordinarily interesting reading. The opening paragraph reads - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>To regard economic progress as the normal and natural condition of human affairs is to betray the limitation of one's mind in both time and space. Of the continents of the globe, northern Europe, America, Australasia, and Japan, have, during the last century, made genuine and striking economic progress. But in southern and eastern Europe the evidences of progress are much more dubious. The great hulk of Africa's population remains in an entirely primitive stage of economic development; while in Asia, other than Japan (in which continent over half of the world's population is to be found, there is evidence of actual economic retrogression during the period which we are pleased to call " the century of progress". Even within the favoured minority of countries where genuine economic progress has been made, the rate of this progress is often grossly exaggerated. Alleviating the colossal total of the world's poverty will take much longer than some people think. </para>

Ear from that war having had any long-term depressing effect on Australian industry and production, it seemed to have the effect of stimulating Australian enterprise during the years that followed. To-day, we find ourselves in a comparable situation. We have just concluded a war which was conducted on an even greater scale than was the last, and there are certain factors of Australia's economy- which should, enable us to take a rosy view of the future. The country remains relatively unscathed: Industry, far from being destroyed as in some other countries, has expanded. We have an industrial population which is better trained than ever before. Before the last depression we had an unbalanced economy dependent too much on the seasons and on the wool-clip ; to-day, we have a balanced economy with secondary industries able to cater for most of our needs, and it is reasonable to suppose that during the next ten years they will be in an even better position to do so than they are to-day. Together with this, there is the pent-up purchasing power of- the people in the form of record savings deposits in the banks, and there is a greater demand for -consumer goods than ever before. There is an unprecedented demand for houses, and this will stimulate allied trades such as the manufacture of furniture, crockery, &amp;c. Thus, there are .present all the factors required for a decade of prosperity greater than we have ever before experienced. </para>
                    <para>Unfortunately, the results so far achieved are not proportionate to these prospects. Our economy is in a sluggish state. It seems to have bogged down. There is a much slower response to consumer demands than the times would seem to indicate as proper. The reason for this is, in part, high taxation. If persons are not spurred on by a belief that extra effort will obtain for them increased economic advantages, we shall remain in the present state for a long time to come. </para>
                    <para class="block">If those with capital to invest believe that there is not a reasonable prospect of success, having regard to the hazards which the investment of capital inevitably carries, there will not be after this war the economic spurt that was such a marked feature of our economy after the1914-1918 war. The trifling concessions contained in this measure only toy with the problem which confronts Australia. The Prime Minister does a. great disservice to his country when he says,ashe said in the Henty electorate recently, that he cannot offer any substantial reduction of taxation. The Institute of Public Affairs has shown that a reduction can be made, and we on this side promise that, if returned at the next election, it will be made. If the Government cannot give the impetus to production which a reduction of taxes would provide, it should get out of office and make way for another government, which willdoso. </para>

                        <para>. - Paragraph c of sub-clause 1 relates to benefits under the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act 1944. I have no objection to this paragraph if it means what it appears to mean, but I wish to know whether, during certainstrikes which occurred recently, men who refused to work received benefits under that legislation. I cannot think of anything more immoral than that payments made under that legislation should be exempt from income tax.  Before agreeing to this provision the Committee should have a statement from the Minister setting out the position. I shall reserve any further remarks until after the Minister has spoken.' </para>

During the last six or seven months certain employees, as for instance, miners, ironworkers and transport men, particularly in the maritime industries, refused to do their work, thereby throwing thousands of others out of employment. I now ask whether the funds provided under the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act have been used to make payments to those who through the action of their fellow unionists, were unemployed ? </para>

                        <para>. - The proposed new sub-section 2 of section 55 provides that the depreciation which will be allowed in respect of certain alterations and additions shall be 33-?{ per cent. Last year there was a long, and I believe useful, debate in this chamber on the subject of depreciation. The rate of 33-J per cent is entirely different from what is allowed by the Taxation Department. Figures shown to me prove that, in respect of certain fencing which had been erected, it was impossible for anything to be written off because all that was obtained was a certain percentage of what remained after previous depreciation had been taken into account. Here we have brought in a principle under which 33^ per cent, depreciation shall be allowed on amenities provided for an employee. If a farmer erects the fencing which he must have if he is to employ men, the rate of depreciation is only 3 per cent, on a diminishing return. If he builds a dam the rate is only 1 per cent, on a diminishing return. If he buys the machinery which he must have to keep men in a job, the rate, formerly 10 per cent., has been reduced, owing to the exigencies of war, to 5 per cent, on a diminishing return. This rate of 33-jjf per cent, it out of keeping with income tax practice in Australia. It is time that this committee had a look at things in a true perspective instead of in this squint-eyed way. I invite the committee to take into consideration what was done last, year when we had a "sea horse" drawn across the map of Australia. I did my best to have the New South Wales Taxpayers' Association challenge its constitutionality in the High Court; but, although it is not at all backward in telling the Commonwealth Parliament that it is wrong, it is remarkably slow in trying to prove it wrong in court. That action was one of the most unconstitutional things ever done in this country; but it ha.s never been fought in the High Court. I do not say that this provision could be challenged ; but the rate of depreciation provided is entirely out of keeping with the former practice of the Taxation Department. The Ministry should examine it. I do not expect it to do so, because, on matters of this description, it is not public policy that dictates its actions but party considerations, and of that this is the worst example we have seen. </para>

                        <para>.- I was  chairman  of a conference on taxation that was held at the request of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures. The primary producers were brought into it. Several of the provisions contained in this bill were decided on at that con'ference. Consideration in respect of the encouragement of research and the provision of amenities in industry was requested. A strong case was made out for both. The request was agreed to. It was asked that the rate of depreciation on fixtures and property providing for amenities or research should be 33-1f per cent, per annum so that the amount should be written off in three years. That docs not mean that any more depreciation is allowed, because once a thing has been written off, depreciation may no longer be claimed. At the rate of 10 per cent. per annum property is written off in ten years, and, at the rate of 331/3 per cent., it is written off in three years. After that no further depreciation is allowed. In order to encourage manufacturers and primary producers to go in for research, depreciation of the articles required for it is to be at the rate of 331/3 per cent., and the articles will be written off in three' years. The same principle is to be extended to amenities provided for employees. Employers submitted that to help them carry on industry amenities for employees were needed. Many employers have already provided them, and it was urged that other employers should be encouraged by this means to do likewise. If the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> will go around some of the cities and towns of Australia and see what the employers are doing in the provision of canteens, dining' rooms, wash rooms and lockers for their employees so that they shall be treated as civilized humans, he will appreciate the worth of that. The providers of those amenities want to write them off in three years. The honorable gentleman objects to that. </para>

                            <para>- I invite the right honorable member for Yarra, who is an expert on income" tax law, to tell us whether at the rate of 331/3 per cent. the property or fixtures on which that depreciation is to be allowed will be written off in three years. If that is true, it is another departure in the income tax law. A depreciation rate of 5 per cent. is not a constant 5 per cent. on the original cost, but on the remaining amount standing in the books of the taxpayer. If the right honorable gentleman's contention is right, the Taxation Department, for the first time, is recognizing the justice of introducing into the law a principle that it has never hitherto applied. I should be interested to know authoritatively whether that is correct, because I have argued in favour of that principle in this committee and in income tax offices, in South Australia as well as Canberra. This is a matter on which the committee should be clear. The sane and honest practice is to allow that if an article costs £100 and the rate of depreciation is 5 per cent., it should be 5 per cent. for twenty years, but, as the law stands or is being administered, it is 5 per cent. on £100 for the first year, 5 per cent. on £95 for the second year, and so on. Under that system, it is mathematically impossible for the article to be written off. If the 331/3 per cent. depreciation rate applies, as the right honorable gentleman claims it does - and I admit his excellent knowledge of such matters - 1 should be glad of that assurance. Then, having got it, I should want to know why that principle cannot be applied to every item on which depreciation is allowed under the taxation law. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know about libraries ; but the basis of prime cost is always available, and under this measure a man who provides amenities for his employees or expends money on research facilities is allowed to write off the cost in three years. The nature of the machinery must also be considered. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> says that a subsequent clause provides for depreciation at the rate of 20 per cent. That clause deals with an entirely different matter. If the honorable member studies the bill more closely he will realize that the objective of the clause to which he refers is to expedite the establishment and rehabilitation of industry in this country. That is now being done in Great Britain, New Zealand and Canada, where purchasers of machinery at the present very high prices are allowed immediately to write off 20 per cent. for taxation purposes; and, in addition, they are allowed the ordinary rate of depreciation. Under this measure 20 per cent. immediate depreciation is allowed in. addition to the annual rate of 10 per cent. That does not mean that in the long run they are allowed more depreciation than any one else. This provision is designed to encourage people to install the latest machinery in. order to speed up industry. That policy is being adopted the world over. Great Britain is striving hard to get into industry before the United States of America, and the United States of America is doing likewise. So also are New Zealand, Canada and other countries. Everywhere, industry is being encouraged in this way by easing the present high initial cost of machinery. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but prime cost is calculated after the special allowance. The allegation made by the honorable member for Barker that this is a party provision is unfounded; the concession has been adopted as the result of representations made in writing on behalf of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Queale,</inline> the  president  of that body. The chamber sent its experts to Canberra to discuss the matter, and the Treasurer asked me to preside at the conference. This provision represents only a part of their requests.

                        <para>.- In my speech on the second reading I pointed out that, whilst the purchase of machinery has been facilitated, special depreciation is not provided in respect of new buildings for industry. My recollection is that in Great Britain very substantial encouragement is being given in respect of the construction of new buildings for industrial purposes. I do not know whether the failure of the Government to follow that example is dictated by the need to concentrate upon the construction of homes as a first priority. That would appear to be the case; but I should wel- come some explanation from the Minister representing the Treasurer as to why no provision is made for special depreciation on new building construction. </para>

                        <para>. -  The clause provides for special depreciation of 20 per cent. on purchases. In making this provision the Government isthirteen years behind Hitler, who introduced it in Germany in practically similar terms in 1933, with the exception that when machinery was installed to take the place of other machinery the owner was allowed to write off 25 per cent. annually, being thus enabled to liquidate the full cost within four years. This bill allows special depreciation at the rate of 20 per cent. for the first year in addition to the ordinary rate. Last year I had occasion to raise certain income tax matters on behalf of taxpayers in the Northern Territory and South Australia. At the Commonwealth office for the Northern Territory and Commonwealth office for South Australia, both of which are situated in Adelaide, I asked for the depreciation lists. I was shown them, and I say definitely that on those lists no depreciation under any heading whatever is shown at a rate above 10 per cent. per annum. In view of what the right honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> has said, I ask that a complete statement of depreciation rates allowed by the Taxation Department be tabled in this House ; because, if the right honorable gentleman's statement be correct, I was misled last year in my interviews with officers at both Commonwealth offices in Adelaide. </para>

                            <para>- In my interviews at the Commonwealth offices in Adelaide I was given the impression that this was information which the department did not give outto the public. The officers adopted the attitude that they would show it to me as a favour ; and I am not unused to dealingwith Government officers. It is high time that a public declaration was made of the rates  of  depreciation. On another occasion I had a personal argument with the Taxation Department. In respect of one's own affairs one can get down to tin-tacks. For years the rate of depreciation on farm engines was 10 per cent.; but during the war it wasreduced to 5 per cent. Even if a farmer purchased a second-hand engine fourteen years old the rate of depreciation wasstill 5 per cent. on a residual basis. That is ridiculous, and would not be tolerated outside an economic kindergarten. I should like the Minister to say frankly what are the rates of depreciation on buildings, fences, dams, tanks, engines and the hundred and one items in respect of which the farmer is obliged to incur expenditure! My constituents will certainly be interested to know what those rates are. I was given to understand that the rates shown to me were purely an office arrangement. If a copy of the rates is available in the Library I should like the Minister  to  explain the secretiveness of the Commonwealth officers whom I interviewed in Adelaide last year on this matter. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to deal with the non-provision of special depreciation in respect of new buildings from the point of view of the primary producer. The large majority of farms in Australia will probably be mechanized as soon as possible. Mechanization will decrease the cost of production, but we cannot have mechanization of farms without providing the buildings to house the necessary plants. The price of all machinery rose considerably during the war. In addition, the cost of erecting a building to-day exceeds by 100 per cent. the pre-war cost. The proposed concessions should be extended in order to cover buildings used for housing machinery,whether they be situated on farms or at factories. I should like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> to explain why that concession has not been granted. </para>

That period is to be extended to twelve months, and if the Secondary Industries Commission so recommended, the period may he further extended by twelve months. In that way, an inducement is offered to technicians and experts to 'come to Australia from other countries. One of the serious taxation difficulties, to which no reference has been made in this measure, is the double taxation of the investments in Australia of persons residing in other countries and, I assume, the income earned in Australia by persons who normally reside abroad. I am not clear regarding the difficulties of the individual, but double taxation acts as a deterrent to overseas companies establishing themselves in Australia. The reason is that taxation must be paid first in Australia on income earned here, and secondly, paid on the net income when it  is remitted to the country in which the company is based. The Commissioner for Taxation went 'abroad in an attempt to resolve this difficulty, but I gather from references in the press that his mission was not so successful as he had hoped. </para>

I do not claim to know all the details, but representatives in Australia of overseas organizations have informed me that it is one of the important factors which influence them when they are considering whether they shall establish industries here. 1 should like the Government to take the opportunity presented by the discussion of this clause to say whether it can offer any hope that this difficulty will be resolved. It would be most unfortunate if industries now based in Great Britain were placed at a serious disadvantage compared with industries in foreign countries when they attempted to establish branches in Australia. The Government may be able to indicate what progress has been made to resolve the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>.- This bill seeks to embody four important and desirable amendments in the principal act. First, it raises the limit on war service homes from £950 to £1,250. This increase will give to purchasers a wider choice of designs, and will be of special benefit to. ex-servicemen who have family responsibilities and require fairly large homes. In most cases, deferred pay is absorbed in the purchase of furniture and cannot be applied to the construction of a larger dwelling. The increase will also offset to some degree the increased cost of home construction. At a later Stage I shall show honorable members how building costs have increased in South Australia, and indicate methods by which, in my opinion, the cost of war' service homes can be reduced to some degree without reducing their size. Stress has been laid on the fact that the shortage of building materials has greatly retarded the construction of war service homes. That is indisputable. However, I understand that State building authorities have a right to 50 per cent, of available building materials, and ex-servicemen have suggested to me that if the necessity to obtain a permit to secure the release of building materials were obviated, more war service homes could be built. What can be done in that sphere I am unable to say. In relation to the war service homes programme in South Australia, I wish to pay a tribute to the  Deputy  Commissioner for War Service Homes in that State, who has worked untiringly for the commission, and has done his best to assist ex-servicemen. Speaking on this measure, the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> criticized the extension of war service homes benefits to merchant seamen. Apparently, the honorable member would not recognize the fact that merchant seamen -played a' vital and dangerous role in the war. I disagree entirely with the honorable member's view. Although I admit that he proved himself a worthy son of Australia in the war of 1914-1S, and in the last war. I remind him that an all-in conflict such as that from which we have just emerged is hardly a healthy matter for men work-, ing below the water line in ships on the high seas. Their employment, in fact, is very hazardous, and I consider that they have every right to the benefit of our war service homes legislation. . They have taken great risks to carry vital materials of war and troops. My mind goes back to. the time when the news came through that S.S. <inline font-style="italic">Hereford</inline> had been mined off Kangaroo Island, which, of course, is not very far from the shores of South Australia. I had an opportunity to inspect that vessel, and found that a hole 40 feet by 60 feet had been blown in' its side. Another vessel struck a mine off Port Lincoln. I have before me a map of the coast of New South Wales showing the names of the ships that were sunk or damaged by enemy action during the war. Altogether, 29 ships were either sunk or damaged off that coast alone. The last war was quite unlike the war of 1914-18, when the Allies had the assistance of the Japanese navy and the Italian navy, both of which were our enemies in the conflict just ended. In this war men lost their lives even in Sydney Harbour. For those reasons, I support the claims of merchant seamen who served the Commonwealth and the Empire during the war, for inclusion in the War Service Homes Act. </para>

                    </para><para>It was an " all-in " war, and the merchant seamen had a large share in bringing victory to our side. </para><para>Much has been said about the cost of house construction at the present time. The latest available report of the War Service Homes Commission, that for 1944-45, shows that the average construction cost of war service homes is £912 13s. 5d. The average cost of a house and the land on which it is built is £1,0321s. 3d. I see nothing to quibble about in those figures. In South Australia to-day, good five-roomed brick homes can be built for £900, a fact which may be of interest to honorable members from the eastern States. An examination of the comparative costs of building materials now and before the war may be of value in considering this matter. During the war of 1914-18, the cost of iron increased to £80 a ton. However, the present price of iron is about £30 a ton, the price pegging regulations having held it down almost to the pre-war level. Before the war, the inside plastering of a home in South Australia cost1s. 9d. a yard and to-day the cost is 2s. 3d. a yard, representing about £7 for the house. The cost of ceilings before the war was 4s. 6d. a yard, and to-day it is 5s. 9d. a yard, which represents about £5 for the house. After studying costs and considering various means of economizing without affecting the durability of houses, I have come to the conclusion that the cost of a house estimated to be worth £1,200 to-day can be reduced by £60 or £7.0. This saving can be achieved by having the bricks of inside walls laid on their edges and set with cement mortar. I have had extensive experience of home-building, and I know that this method can be employed with satisfactory results. It requires fewer bricks and offers an admirable way of reducing housing costs. I am anxious that everybody should be properly housed, and I should like every man to have the chance of owning his own home. I have said before, and I reiterate now, that interest charges on capital outlay for home-building should be reduced as low as possible so that ex-servicemen and others may be able to own their homes within their lifetimes. The ideal rate of interest would be one merely sufficient to cover administrative expenses. The report of the War Service Homes Commission states that delay is caused by the necessity for architectural work. The Commission has about 500 designs for homes. It should adopt the system used by the State Bank of South Australia. A contractor for the erection of a house under the bank's scheme is provided with specifications, and with a ground plan of the projected building on which the roof is indicated by dotted lines. That is all that any contractor should need to build a home. If the War Service Homes </para><para class="block">Commission adopted that method, and employed inspectors to examine houses in course of erection, its building  programme  could be speeded up considerably. Under the present system, tenders are called by advertisement for the construction of homes. Then, contractors have to be supplied with the architects' plans. Then there is a further delay, until estimates are submitted by the contractors, before work can be undertaken. Under the bank's system, the contractor has specifications and the "plan for the type of building chosen by the prospective owner, and uo delay is necessary. There is not much work in the construction of a cottage which would require any departure from the ordinary specifications,  r  make this suggestion to the Minister in the hope that he will give serious consideration to it. It is a good way of speeding up construction of war service homes. </para><para>I now raise another' matter which affects "diggers" of the 1.914-18 war. I do so because, on a previous occasion in this House, I stressed the difficulties experienced by some ex-soldiers of the 1914-18 war during the economic depression. I cited particular cases. Since then I have had to wait some time for an opportunity to reply on this subject to statements made by the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony).</inline></para></speech>

                        <para>.- This short measure contains four important specific provisions. The first is designed to increase, from £950 to £1,250, the maximum amount that may be advanced for war' service homes. The second provision relates to the value of land on which war service homes may be erected. The War Service Homes Commission has held some blocks since the depression, and their value has now increased to such a high level as to make  it  impossible for a soldier purchaser to. pay their present value. The Government  has  wisely decided that the land on which a war service home is to be erected shall be assessed at its fair value or  its  actual capital value, whichever is the less. I commend tha Government for this proposal which will confer a distinct advantage on the prospective borrower The third provision enables the War Service Homes Commission  to  grant loans on  the.  security of Crown lands leased in perpetuity from a State. This is an innovation which I have advocated in this House on many occasions, as has also the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser).</inline> At some of the seaside resorts on the south coast of Queensland only leasehold land - can be obtained, this provision will extend to those entitled to the benefits of the legislation a privilege which they have not hitherto enjoyed and will be particularly welcomed by many' ex-servicemen living in mining areas and coastal towns of Queensland.. The fourth provision extends, to all members of the mercantile marine working on the Australian coast the benefits of the  Avar  service homes legislation. I am opposed to this proposal. Under the original act eligibility for its benefits  was  restricted to members of the fighting forces who entered a theatre of Avar, and to a limited number of munition workers who  went  to the United Kingdom during the war of 1914-1S to assist in the manufacture of  the  munitions there - probably their number would not exceed 100  -  and members of the mercantile marine who risked their lives to keep the sea lanes free of a marauding enemy. Under the amendment proposed  by  this bill, 'however,  h  seaman who sails across the  entrance  to Port Phillip Bay,  from  say Point Nepean to Geelong,  or  whose ship is engaged in trading between the headlands of .Spencer's Gulf, will in future become entitled to apply for a war service home-. That is not only unreasonable  but  also distinctly unfair to those who  have risked their lives- in the defence of this country or to keep safe from enemy activity the trade routes of the world. It is especially so when we consider the large numbers" of servicemen who to-day are awaiting war service homes and who probably will have to wait another twenty years before material and labour are available in sufficient quantities to permit free building. This watering down of the conditions of eligibility is reminiscent of the. Government's attempt to water down conditions of eligibility under the rehabilitation legislation. Seamen foremen employed on the Australian coast receive £10 14s. 6d. a week including special war risk payment, but those who fought on the battlefields of the world received nothing but their service pay. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Very many members of this House and organizations of returned servicemen throughout the country have pressed for two years for an increase of the maximum amount Of the loan. The only comment I make upon the Government's proposal in this connexion is that it has been too long delayed. Money alone will not build war service homes; adequate supplies of building materials, furnishings, fittings, and equipment of all descriptions, together with skilled and semi-skilled labour must be provided. With the inflated costs of labour and materials, it is obvious that the maximum amount of loan would have to be increased. On the 7th August, 1945, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> E. O'Connell, manager of the Timber Merchants Association, of Melbourne, said this regarding the cost of building labour - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The' cost of labour is the biggest single item in the cost of building, and this could bo reduced appreciably if workers could be induced by their union officials to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. For the last three or four weeks, however, certain union officials have been" prepared to adopt " goslow"' tactics on works being carried out under the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I am endeavouring  to show that costs are rising generally and that this is a- vital factor in the cost of war service homes. The position is accentuated by industrial troubles which have been prevalent throughout the country during the regime of this Government. The recent unfortunate experience in the iron and steel industry caused the Government to' seek from outside Australia. 20,000 tons of galvanized iron to meet Australia's most pressing requirements of that commodity and  imported  iron is much more costly than that manufactured in Australia. The raising of the maximum loan will increase the amount, paid weekly by the soldier purchaser and greatly increase his total interest bill. It will probably mean  that many unfortunate soldiers will be paying off their homes during the whole of their lives. I suggest that, in order to offset soaring costs, there should be some adjustment of interest charges along the lines adopted in New Zealand, where the owner of a war service home is for some period. freed of interest charges. The Minister might very well consider making such a provision' in the War Service Homes Act. The Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement Act No. 44 of 1945 provided that any excessive cost of homes due to the inflated price of labour and materials was to be divided equally between the Commonwealth and the State concerned, and not passed on to the occupier of the home. In other words, if a house which should have cost £1,500 cost £2,000, the tenant would be expected to pay only on the basis of £.1,500, and the Commonwealth and State Governments would meet any obligations in respect of the remaining £500. I ask the Government to consider applying that principle to war service homes. Individuals who are successful in ballots for the  few homes that are becoming available should be required to' pay only on the economic value of the property. They should not Iia ve to meet excessive charges on account of the present inflated costs of labour and materials. It seems to me that houses which should be built for £1.250 will be loaded with heavy additional' charges. After the' last war heavy demands were made 011 our house construction resources and costs became much higher than they should have been. The result, ultimately, was that the war service homes that were built in that period were re-valued, and tens of thousands of pounds was written off the original cost. </para>

                    </continue><para>The prospect of applicants obtaining war service homes in the near future is most gloomy. On the 14t,h March I asked the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> for some information about the number of war service homes that had been built in certain years. On the 20th March I received from him the following particulars: - </para><para class="block">

                    </para><para>In those five years only 23 homes were built. In the period from, the 1st July, 1945, to the 2Sth February, 1946, 61 homes had been erected. These figures indicate clearly that a long and weary wait stretches before service men and women, who have applied for homes. I also asked what number 'of applications for war service homes received in each State of the Commonwealth and in the Australian Capital Territory up to the 28th February last had not yet been finalized. The total was given as 11,955. If that number of applications lodged by the 28th February last be still unsatisfied, what prospects have applicants since then of obtaining homes within any reasonable date? I am quite certain that if it were not for the general knowledge of people that inordinate delays were inevitable in satisfying applicants for war service homes, the number of applications would be very much greater than it is; but people know that it is futile even to apply for homes under present conditions. At least 300,000 persons are still, awaiting demobilization from the various services. Very many of them will need homes. During recent years the Government has done practically nothing to help people to obtain homes. The War Service Homes Commission has done what it could do to provide homes for eligible applicants. The officers of the commission are efficient, sympathetic, and anxious to do a good job, but this Government, has put them in an impossible position. It should at least make sure that materials are available for the commission to use. During and after the last war 21,379 homes were built by the commission. </para><interjection>

Undoubtedly construction of war service homes in Australia is lagging far behind such work in New Zealand. Up to the 31st January this year, 2,239 homes have been built for ex-servicemen in New Zealand at a cost of £3,076,226. In Australia between the 1st July, 1944, and the 28th February, 1946, nearly 12.000 ex-soldiers had applied for war service homes, but only 69 homes were erected. Homes cannot be built without material. On this point I remind the Minister
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline>
                                that on the 18th July last he announced that, subject to anticipated releases from the services, sufficient supplies ofmaterials and fittings would be available in every State to meet each quarter's requirements.

No doubt he had made inquiries from his officials and he gave the assurance that sufficient materials and fittings would be available. Seeing that he gave that assurance I am entitled to ask him where the materials and fittings for the war service homes are to be found? The Minister is as silent as a tomb. On behalf of the ex-soldiers of this country, who were assured by one honorable gentleman opposite who now holds Cabinet, rank that the sky would be the limit in providing money to meet the needs of ex-service personnel, I again ask where the materials for house construction are to be found ? I want to know why ex-servicemen cannot have homes provided for them. Possibly the reason is that the Government does not believe in building them.

It is imperative to speed up this building programme. An almost parallel case is that of the settlement of ex-servicemen on the land. Although the applications from ex-servicemen total 28,500, not one block of land has been made available for this purpose to date. In <inline font-style="italic">Soldier Superb,</inline> Allan Dawes stressed that relatives and friends of servicemen might help to keep up their morale by emphasizing in letters to the troops the bright prospects they would have upon their return of settling down with their wives and families in war service homes.

I urged the Minister many times last year to release from the services every man who could swing an axe with skill, for the felling of trees in the mountains and scrub, as well as all those who could work in timber mills, who could make bricks and tiles, and who could produce pipes and galvanized iron. I said that hundreds of thousands of skilled workers would be available as soon as the war was over for the building of war service homes and homes for civilians.

                        <para>.- The War Service Homes Bill is a very important measure. Before making observations on the amendments to the act that are proposed in the bill, I shall reply briefly to some of the statements of the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis).</inline> I am not greatly influenced by the " crocodile tears " which he shed in regard to war service homes and the general set-up of the organization that is responsible for them. In the first place, the honorable gentleman stated that he was emphatically opposed to members of the. mercantile marine receiving any consideration under the act. He cited the case of a man who will be entitled to a war service home even though his service during the war consisted only of his having sailed from Point Nepean to Geelong. In citing that case, he rather exaggerated the position. The circumstances of such a man would not differ very greatly from those of a man who, having enlisted for overseas service, would be entitled to a war service home even though, through no fault of his own, he ' had not left Bankstown during the period of the war. The men who oran the risk of sailing in dangerous waters are as much entitled to a war service home as is any other person for whom the act makes provision. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The honorable gentleman also referred to building costs. I regret that it has been found necessary to increase from £950 to £1,250, the maximum amount to be provided, mainly because of higher building costs. No matter what party » we may belong to, all of us should endeavour to ensure that building costs will be kept down to the absolute minimum., so that the average wage-earner or ex-serviceman may be able to obtain a home which he will have a reasonable chance of paying for. Unfortunately, building costs have risen. . Many factors are responsible for that. Unlike the honorable member for Moreton, I do not " pass the buck " to the workers. It is all very well to assert flippantly that the men will not work, and that there are industrial troubles which cause costs to rise. Not many years ago, State governments composed of men of the same political ilk as honorable members opposite, sold the State brick works' in New South Wales, which would have been largely instrumental in keeping, building costs at a reasonable level. </para>

                            <para>- I bow to your ruling, sir. I considered it necessary to say that honorable members opposite are hardly fair when they " pass the buck " to men who are not in any appreciable measure responsible for the rise .of building costs that has taken place. Honorable mein.bers opposite are remarkable in that they are disposed at all times to boost the magnificent Labour Government that is in. office in New Zealand. One of the reasons why Australia is somewhat backward at present in regard to the provision of war service homes and other things, is that it did not have a Labour Government as early as did New Zealand. It is all very well to acclaim what New Zealand" is doing in regard to housing, and to cast aspersions on efforts to the same end in Australia. The figures cited by the honorable member for Moreton in regard to the New Zealand situation' were misleading, and must be refuted. The Commonwealth Government <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> faced with the same circumstances as the Government of any other country, in regard to building construction. It is not short of money, but is handicapped by lack of man-power and materials, am] there is a definite lim i: to the resources available for home building. The Government considers that the ideal approach to the matter is for the various State governments, in co-operation with the Commonwealth, to build a number of houses, a proportion of which -shall be available to ex-service personnel. An agreement  between the Commonwealth and the States with regard to the matter was reached at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, and of the houses now being erected in the various States not less than 50 per cent, are being made available to ex-servicemen. With the permission of the House I shall incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the following table showing the number of homes allocated to ex-servicemen under the Commonwealth and State housing agreement up to the 31st December, 1945 :- </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">lt will be seen that of 3,1S8 houses allocated throughout the Commonwealth, 1,839, or 59 per cent., have been allocated as required by section 9 of the Commonwealth and States housing agreement. It is interesting to note that in one small part of my electorate about ISO houses are being erected. That is more than the total number built by the anti-Labour governments which have been in power in this country during the last 20 or 30 years. </para>
                    <para>Those who paint a gloomy picture with regard to war service homes should remember that the position is not so bad as it may appear. If the Commonwealth Government built a greater number of war service homes than at present, as suggested by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis),</inline> it would merely cause fewer homes to be built under the various State schemes, because it would correspondingly reduce the limited supply of building materials now available to the States. </para>
                    <para>We cannot fight a war and send many thousands of our able-bodied men overseas, thus taking them out of essential industries, and at the same time have houses built at as high a rate as in normal times. I shall not be happy until every ex-serviceman and every civilian who needs a home can obtain one at a reasonable rent, or ' at a fair purchase price. I commend the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> upon the desirable alteration for which the bill provides of the conditions under which war service homes are to be built. The provision in clause 4, which will increase the maximum permissible expenditure on a war service home from £950. to £1,250 is long overdue. I hope that all land available for the building of war service homes will be utilized 'at an early date. The bill has my cordial support, as it provides for changes which will confer on ex-service personnel benefits to which they and their families are justly entitled. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill contains matters of moment to ex-service men and women and others who will ultimately obtain war service homes, but we should not lose sight of the precedent established after World War I. when war service homes were provided as a special recognition of the sacrifices made by members of the fighting services. The bill now before us is designed to extend the enjoyment of a privilege formerly confined . to ex-service personnel. It follows a precedent established by the present Government with regard to measures formerly designed for the benefit of members of the fighting services, so that persons whom the Government selects may receive the benefit of this legislation. We saw that policy adopted in the Reestablishment and Employment Act, and we now find it repeated in connexion with the War Service Homes Act. The honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline> rightly said that this bill is designed, not only to give merchant seamen an advantage, but also to grant a benefit to men who did not leave Australia during the recent world war. </para>

                            <para>- Those who fought overseas are worthy of added recognition. These members of the services who did not leave Australia, possibly for reasons beyond their control, had the advantage of living in safe bases practically under peace-time conditions. Why  should the base " wallahs " be granted the same benefits as those who made blood sacrifices overseas? I believe that the merchant seamen should not be included in a measure of this kind. In view of the fact that the War Service Homes Act was designed to recognize the services of our fighting men it should be used exclusively for that purpose. A .measure is already on the statute-book relating to merchant seamen and recognizing their war services. That gives them the advantage of a war loading in respect of their pay. Our fighting men received no extra payment for going into the firing line and doing battle to save the people of Australia and preserve their standards of living. They fought for a rate of pay which was a mere bagatelle, whereas the merchant seamen received a war loading which gil ve bini a handsome wage, in comparison with the payment made to our fighting men. I do not desire to detract from the bravery of the merchant seamen who carried our troops through danger zones and into the fighting arenas. I have the utmost regard for them, but if they have not received sufficient  recognl:lon  of their services, , the Government should be prepared to submit a separate measure for that purpose. If the Government desires to give special recognition to the seamen who have risked life and- limb, let it do so; but this bill will produce fantastic anomalies. Seamen who have travelled from port to port in Australia, and have never experienced danger greater than that involved in making a trip from Circular Quay to Manly, are' to receive recognition similar to that to be given to men who fought on the Kokoda Trail, or who suffered the loss of limbs or eyesight. This bill has been designed to cut across an important principle that has been established in respect of measures such as the War Service Homes Act. Men who have never smelt danger should not be placed on the same footing as those who have made blood sacrifices. I do not wish it to be said that I blame the men who wished to fight overseas but were not permitted to do so. Yet that is no reason why merchant seamen should receive the same consideration as others who made blood sacrifices. Whilst commending certain features of the bill, which I regard as of great value to ex-:members of the fighting services, I consider that the Government is largely destroying the value of the measure by including among the beneficiaries men who have no valid right to be included. If the merchant seamen are worthy of special recognition - and many of them did go into the danger zones and are worthy of consideration - they received it in the 'form of a- war loading. Fantastic wages were received in some instances. Not only did seamen get f/om lis. to 16s. a day, as compared with the 6s. 6d. paid to our fighting men, but. also seamen who took a dredge around the Australian coast were paid up to £78 a month. The first cook employed on the dredge received £S6 10s. a month and the second cook, £65 10s. If the Government wishes to recognize the services of merchant seamen, let it bring down a measure to deal with the matter, and I shall give it the support to which I think it is entitled, but I do not wish a bill designed to benefit ex-servicemen to be cluttered up with the extraneous matters which this measure contains. </para>

                        <para>. -This bill embodies several amendments of the War Service Homes Act, and one of them provides for an increase of the maximum advance which may be made in respect of a war service home from £950 to £1,250. If £950 was considered a reasonable limit in 1935, how can £1,250 be regarded as reasonable now, seeing that costs have risen enormously in the meantime? The Minister ought to know more about housing costs than I do, but my personal experience is that prices have risen by from 80 per cent, to 100 per cent, since the beginning of the war. The increase of the maximum amount allowable for war service homes is out of proportion to the -actual rise of costs, and therefore I ask the Government to consider raising the limit by another £300. We do not want to put men who served Australia well into indifferent houses. As an instance of the greatly increased cost of building, I mention that in 1939 I had a cottage built for one of my employees. It was constructed of fibrocement, and although it did not have all modern conveniences, it had proper sanitation, and water and electricity were laid on. That cottage cost £600, exclusive of the land on which it was built. I now wish to build a house for another employee, and have consulted the same architects, who say that a similar house would now cost £1,200. Even at that cost, the house would not be suitable for a returned serviceman with a wife and family; it would not be big enough nor would it be sufficiently well constructed. I urge the Government to increase the amount which may be granted for the construction of homes for ex-servicemen. It is, however, useless to increase the permissible amount if houses arc not to be built. "We have been told that the Housing Commission in Victoria has built very few homes during the last five years. The number of houses now under construction is small compared with the houses being erected in other parts of Australia for civilian use. Figures supplied to me in this connexion arc striking. They show that whereas 1915 applications for homes were received in 1944 only nine houses were built. In the following year, eight homes were completed notwithstanding that applications for homes totalled 3,500. In the present year 65 homes were completed to the 28th January. It has been said by some honorable members, including the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly),</inline> that the comparison made by the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> between the number of houses constructed in Australia and in New Zealand is wrong. The honorable member for Moreton said that in New Zealand 2,239 homes were built for ex-servicemen to the 31st January, 1946, whereas in Australia only 69 homes were built in the same period. The honorable member for Martin explained that the homes built in New Zealand comprised all the houses allotted to soldiers, whereas of the houses built by the Australian States for soldiers, 1879 have been handed over to ex-servicemen. I point out first, that the conditions under which homes are built by the States and then handed over to ex-servicemen are not the same as under the "War Service Homes Act. if the States can build houses and hand them over to ex-servicemen. I want to know why the War Service Homes Commission cannot do so. The statistics do not reflect credit on the com mission. Considering the support that it should havereceived from the Commonwealth Government, the commission ought to have constructed more than 69 homes during the war. This is a matter which the War Service Homes Commission and the Minister for Housing should investigate. If the act is to be of any benefit to ex-servicemen, a much larger number of homes should be constructed. Many hundreds of applications for homes are already in hand, and others are coming in daily. I know that honorable members generally regard the situation in regard to war service homes as unsatisfactory, and are anxiously looking for an early improvement. </para>

                            <para>- The War Service Homes Act provides a means of giving some recompense to the men who served their country well. For the most part members of the fighting services received low rates of pay during the war, whereas men who served in the merchant navy were paid for war risks; some of them earned large sums of money. I emphasize the desirability of granting some measure of priority to those who are now eligible. If others come into the scheme; the difficulty of providing homes for those who are now eligible for them will be increased. Much has been said as to the necessity for speeding up thebuilding of homes. Ex-servicemen generally are dissatisfied with the progress that has been made; they believe that more could have  been done during the war. If  the  electors believe that Government bungling  is  the ca use of the present chaos, they  will deal  with the matter in the near future. </para>

                        <para>. -  Like many  Other  bills introduced by this Government, the short measure before us is eloquent in what  it  does not say. The first proposal contained in the measure relates to merchant seamen, and, personally, I have not much to say against it. In my opinion, a man who served in a coastal vessel during the greater part of the period when we were atwar against Japan took a greater risk than did the men who sat in Victoria Barracks. That applies also to a number of places outside Victoria Barracks. The important thing is that a departure is made from the usual. On that point, the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sheehy)</inline> misunderstood the remarks last week of the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> whose attitude was not to make derogatory references to men who serve on the coastal ships, but to maintain that the act should not be altered to increase the number entitled to benefit and thus lengthen the wait  for  homes of those whose claims are already established. The second, and I think, forseveral reasons, the most important point, is the provision increasing the maximum advance for the construction of a house from £950 to £1,250. That  is  about 31½ per cent. It is most eloquent, though silent, testimony as to what the Government considers is the economic future of Australia.It means that everybody requiring a house, whether constructed by the War Services Homes Commission, by any other body, or privately, will henceforth have to pay at least 31½ per cent. more for it  than  hitherto. That is a significant admission. In the opinion of the Government, rents will be one-third greater than they were. </para>

                            <para>- That is  not  the point. The point is that the Government considers that henceforth people will have to  pay  about  one-third  more rent than before. It is not possible to argue that the increase from £950 to £1,250 could otherwise be justified, or that it applies only to the construction of homes under the War Service Homes Act, and that people not provided for by the act will still be able to have homes constructed at the old price. Therule applies to all or none. I raise that because I believe- that the hitherto unspoken intention of the Government is increased rents and costs generally, which will involve increased wages. The kernel of the Government's financial policy is a closer approximation between the debts incurred in the war and the income in paper money from which they will be met. I do not intend to go deeper into that now. </para>

                            <para>- I simply state that as the Government's objective about which it has been discreetly silent up till now. I think the House is entitled to examine the ability of men to build homes for £1,250. I have a letter prepared by members of the Glenelg Sub-branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League. Glenelg is in my electorate and, as it is a suburban area, naturally the 1,200 or 1,300 members of the sub-branch have an idea of building costs. The letter is somewhat caustic about the treatment received by members who went to the War Service Homes Commission for information about these matters. The statement reads - </para>

                        <para>When you receive notice to Attend the office and discuss plans and specifications you find that for £950 you can build three rooms and a kitchenette, bathroom and laundry of very small dimensions, minus fencing, bath heater, stove, tank, copper outhouses &amp;c, which after adding such things as jarrah flooring, extra height for ceilings, which by the way are only specified as 9 ft., transfer, survey, architects fees <inline font-style="italic">&amp;c.,</inline> you are up for £1,250. </para>
                        <para>The above is only for the married couple without a family. The family man needing a five-roomed house is not in the race under £14,00 plus cost of building block. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Their view is that the cost of a building block in the area is about £150. They are working on the basis of a 50 ft. frontage at £3 a foot. The building will cost £1,130, architects' foes £33, transfer fees, title search, survey, valuation, &amp;c, £10 10s. bringing the total to £1,323 10s. It may be argued that this was mentioned by the honorable member for Booth'by, that brick houses are available in South Australia at a. much lower figure, but I think they are available only through certain State institutions, and I doubt their availability to ex-servicemen with the War Service Homes Act operating. If they are I shall be happy. But we must look at the figure admitted, after careful consideration, by the Government as the amount required to enable a man to set himself up in what it regards as a decent house. In committee I propose to move an amendment, because it is time Government supporters were tested on one or two things. What attitudes does the Government intend to adopt towards men returned from this war who have built homes but have been lent only £950 and had to draw on other resources, probably other loans, for the difference between the £950 lent to them under the War Services Homes Act and the £1,250 provided for in this bill. That is something that the Government should face. </para>

                            <para>- I should not be surprised at anything the Government tried to do. but good legislation and sound administration carries the principle that the law shall state what the Government <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> the power to do; and if this bill cannot come into operation until it receives the Royal Assent, obviously the Government cannot make it retrospective, unless an amendment to that effect be made. Therefore, in the interests of those concerned, it is only fair that the Government should give serious consideration, before we go into committee, to the acceptance of the amendment I have suggested. I do not want to force anything on the Government. </para>

                            <para>- But I have been known to insist on the bells being rung for a division, and I will do so if the Minister is not able to see reason between now and when clause 7 is reached in committee. Those are the important points. It is useless for the Government to talk about housing schemes for the soldier, or anybody else, until it attends to the first essential, the production of adequate materials. Unless that be done the Government, instead of engaging in comforting talk as it has up to the present, must say to the soldiers, " Until certain men are prepared to work, especially in New South Wales, you boys will have to do the best you can. You can go and live with mother ". </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> -I have no desire to engender heat in the debate. The constructive criticism, offered by honorable members opposite will be carefully considered, and any amendment of this legislation deemed to be necessary in the light of experience will be made. I admit that up to the present only a. limited number of war service homes has been constructed. However, the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis),</inline> and the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> simply endeavoured to make a political football of the  soldiers' needs. Other honorable members opposite did not attempt to do so; their criticism will be carefully considered by the Government. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Honorable , members opposite who believe that under the conditions that have operated during the last few years it was possible for the Government to embark on an extensive scheme of building war service homes in accordance with the traditional policy of the War Service Homes Commission are just hoping for the impossible. But I hope that as the result of this measure and of departmental action which will be taken in co-operation with housing commissions in each of the States, which now control supplies of building materials-, we , shall obtain a greater now of materials and shall be enabled to launch a reasonable programme of construction within the near future. The honorable member for Wentworth spoke only on behalf of the man who served outside Australia, the man who sacrificed </para>
                    <para>Ii is blood. That is a new argument for honorable members opposite, because the original War Service Homes Act which wa.= introduced after World War I. by a. _ government which they supported provided that every man who volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force, whether he left Australia or not, should be eligible for a home. This bill does not alter that provision. In that respect it follows the policy embodied in the original act. 'The honorable member for Wentworth, apparently, can be speaking for only himself in (hat regard. 1 doubt whether he really gave serious thought to this matter when he was a member of a previous government. He may have voiced in Cabinet the views he has just expressed, but he has certainly not done so elsewhere. The honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> said that if other housing commissions could build homes throughout Australia the War Service Homes Commission should be able to do likewise. The War Service Homes Commission does not propose to build homes under the same conditions as will be observed by State housing, authorities,' because it seeks to give to the soldier and his wife a home to their liking. Applicants are permitted to make a choice from hundreds  of plans. If none of those plans satisfies them the com- . mission will accept plans prepared by their own architect provided all relevantconditions under the act are observed. In that respect the commission observes a policy that was laid down long before the present Government took office. That policy will enable the commission to obviate jerry-building. The commission does not build great groups of homes to a common pattern, but aims to give to the soldier and his wife the right enjoyed by every other citizen who can afford to buy or build a house to obtain the kind of home which they desire. When the housing agreement was. made with the States, the Commonwealth, realizing that that was the policy of the commission, insisted that at least 50 per cent, of the homes constructed by State authorities must be rented to returned soldiers until such time as it was possible for the commission to build homes to their own liking. The fact is that in practically every State 60 per cent, of homes so far constructed by State authorities have been let to returned soldiers. The honorable member for Balaclava urged that the maximum advance of £1,250 should be increased. The Government stands firmly by that limit. However, this legislation is not unalterable, like the laws of the Medes and Persians. Twelve months hence, when this Government will still be in office, the legislation will be reviewed in the light of experience; and should it be necessary that limit will be increased. However, we hope that the flow of building materials will be increased as the result of action now being taken by the States :&lt;&gt; mechanize brick kilns and to improve organization, and that building costs will decrease. If that hope i3 realized the advance of £1,250 will be sufficient. I repeat, that if it be found to be notsufficient, the Government will not hesitate to ask Parliament to raise the limit. </para>
                    <para>Most opposition has been expressed to the extension of the benefits of this legislation to merchant seamen who served during the war off the Australian coast. I have here a copy of last week's <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Sun,</inline> in which appears a map showing the number of ships sunk off the Australian ea3t coast, and the locations of sinkings during the war. It shows that 29  Australian ships were sunk and eleven damaged as the result of enemy action. The provision to which honorable members opposite object was inserted in the original act after World War I. Admittedly, it applied only to merchant seamen who had served on ships overseas, but fortunately, no hostile submarine operated off the Australian coast in  1914-1S.  Consequently, merchant seamen serving in ships in Australian waters took no risk in World War I. </para>
                    <para>In  1941,  the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> as Minister for Labour and National Service, introduced a bill to amend the War Service Homes Act. Why did not honorable members opposite insist then that ha should not commit the Government to give serious consideration to the proposal that, merchant seamen who had- served in ships off the Australian coast after the outbreak of war in  1939  should be eligible for the benefits of the War Service Homes Act. Replying to representations by honorable members on this side of the House, he said -  1 appreciate that some hazards in Australian waters are just as great as those which are experienced by seamen in service abroad.  . . I assure honorable members that this point will receive full and sympathetic consideration by the Government. .Normally I would suggest .that wc defer this measure until the Government has had a;i opportunity to consider the submissions of honorable members; but, in view of the f act that the Parliament will bo in recess for some weeks, and any deferment of .the bill might hold up aid which otherwise could be given to men or their dependants, I suggest that the bill be passed as it is now drawn. If that be done, I shall bring under the notice of the Minister for War Service Homes the representations made byhonorable members during this debate and ask him to consider them during the recess. </para>
                    <para class="block">The honorable member was not speaking irresponsibly, as the honorable member for Barker does in this chamber. He spoke as a responsible Minister in charge of a bill, and made that definite and considered statement. If this principle is so wrong, why was not the honorable member for Fawkner compelled to abandon it in  1941?  Yet he promised that the government of the day would .'consider it carefully and sympathetically </para>
                    <para>The Government has decided that members of' the mercantile marine who served in ships off the Australian coast after the commencement of World War II. have taken serious risks. The bones of some of them are now lying at the bottom of the sea off the Australian coast. Merchant seamen took the risk which soldiers and sailors took. In reply to the objection raised by the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull),</inline> I point out that merchant seamen will not be able to apply for war service homes until this bill becomes law. Thousands of applications have already been lodged with the War Service Homes Commission which deals with them in the order in which they are received, and for that reason, any applications which may be lodged in future by merchant seamen will be low on the list. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly ! I now desire to deal briefly with the charge that this Government has erected only a small number of war service homes. I have already informed the House that this Government considered that 50 per cent, of the homes which are erected by the housing commissions of the States should be allotted to ex-servicemen. They are entitled to that privilege. The honorable member for Moreton. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> declared that during the war of  1914-18,  the government of the day built war service homes. I am not impressed by that statement, because the original act was not passed until  191S.  Therefore, few, if any, war service homes could have been built during World War I. Apart from . that, let us examine, the ability of Australia to build war service homes during the two world wars. If this Government had been able to build three houses for every one thousand that, were built in  1914-1S,  it would have done an excellent job. In the war of  1914-18,  Australia was not threatened with invasion, as it was in the last war. After Japan entered the war, we were compelled to divert 'to the armed services materials which normally would have been used for building. However, I shall not. weary the House with a repetition of facts which .are known to every  one. Honorable members opposite in criticizing this bill, are again playing the game of politics. They will play politics with any subject, and even with servicemen. The truth is that after Japan entered the war, it was physically impossible for the Government to build war service homes. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of the sort! From 1939 to 1941, very few persons were eligible for war service homes. Before a serviceman may apply for a war service home, he must be discharged from the forces. That provision was inserted in the act by a non-Labour government. Applications for homes increased as the war progressed. In 1941-42, 160 applications were received in New South Wales, 47 in Victoria, 9 in Queensland, 45 in South Australia, 24 in Western Australia and 10 in. Tasmania. In 1942-43 applications were: New South Wales 191, Victoria 95, Queensland 25, South Australia 81, Western Australia 33 and Tasmania 23. In 1943-44. when numbersof men were being discharged, applications for war service homes increased appreciably; they were: New South Wales 66S, Victoria 511, Queensland 126, South Australia 190, Western Australia 172, and Tasmania84. For the first eight months of 1945-46, the number of appli- cations totalled 7,882. The War Service Homes Commission has advised me that many of the applicants do not desire to build at the present time. They are waiting until this amending legislation becomes law, so that they may derive the benefit of the increase of the statutory limit from £950 to £1,250. During the regime of the Labour Government, the War Service Homes Commission has implemented a portion of the act which was never given effect while honor- able members opposite occupied the treasury bench. I refer to the provision which permits an ex-serviceman to build his own home privately, if he is able to do so, and to have plans prepared privately. An applicant may go to the office of the War Service Homes Commission in any State and select one of 400 or 500 plans available to him. This service is provided free of charge. If he cannot find a plan to suit his requirements, he may employ his own architect and have a special plan prepared. He may also have a home constructed on his own land if he so desires, provided certain standards are adhered to. The War Service Homes Commission owns housing blocks in every State, and an applicant may select a block and have his home built by a private builder, either to a plan provided by the commission or to a plan of his own. We are hopeful that with the passing of this measure, and the appointment of liaison officers between the commission and the housing authorities in the various States, a larger share of available building mate rials will be given to the commission. I can assure honorable members that there will be no repetition of the jerry-building which was a feature of war service home.? construction after the last war. On that occasion some homes were so poorly constructed that bricks could be pulled out of the walls with the bare hands. Hundreds of thousands of pounds were wasted on houses which practically fell down on the occupants. </para>

                        <para>.- This clause provides for the inclusion of merchant seamen in the list of persons eligible for benefits under the War Service Homes Act. As the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> has introduced my name into the discussion and has referred to certain comments made by me some time ago, I take this opportunity to say something in relation to the object of this clause. It was interesting to be reminded of certain évents  which, quite frankly, I had forgotten during the intervening years. However, I do not rise now to retract anything that I said at that time. I merely wish to draw the attention of the committee to two developments in regard to merchant seamen which have occurred since my earlier remarks were made. The first of these is that, in view of the hazards to which merchant seamen were subjected during . the war, a carefully graduated scale of bonus payments bearing direct relation to the risk involved was worked out. The position of merchant seamen, therefore, was different from that of servicemen who were undergoing risks, in some cases, perhaps, not greater than those of merchant seamen, but in other instances very much greater. The servicemen had a standard rate of pay irrespective of the risks they were undergoing, whereas merchant seamen received bonus payments to compensate them for the hazards of their employment. Another important difference between the two groups was that merchant seamen were pursuing their normal calling, and therefore had opportunity for advancement in that calling, whereas servicemen, except the relatively few professional soldiers, were engaged on a task very far removed from their peacetime avocations. The theme running through the whole of the rehabilitation legislation of the Government is the obligation which rests upon the community to restore to their peace-time opportunities and occupations persons whose civil careers had been interrupted by their services to their country. I believe that that, in the first place, constitutes an important distinction between servicemen and men of the merchant navy. Secondly, we should not allow this fact to slip from our minds: Whilst there may have been very good reason for Us to view sympathetically the claims of merchant seamen during the war, I do not think any of us will commend the attitude that these men have adopted since the end of hostilities, so far as war risk payments are concerned. It is almost incredible that seven months after the end of hostilities in the Pacific, merchant seamen should still be receiving their high war-risk bonuses. The current order of the Maritime Industries Commission prescribes a 25 per cent, bonus on interstate and intra-state ships trading south of Townsville and Port Hedland, 15 per cent, for St. Vincent's Gulf, 33^ per cent, for interstate and intra-state ships north of those points, and 50 per cent, for overseas ships going north of Townsville and Pert Hedland, from their last Australian port on the outward voyage to their first Australian port on the homeward voyage. So, we have carried into this peace-time period, very substantial bonuses which have no relation to the hazard that the seamen are called upon to accept. </para>

I believe, however, that the Government is trying,, in some respects, to devolve responsibility for the construction of these homes on to State instrumentalities and State governments. The consequence of that, a3 I have already observed in Victoria- ' </para>

                            <para>- I was endeavouring to save the time of the committee. The remarks that I was about to make are relevant to clause 4, and in view of your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I shall reserve further comment until that clause is before the. committee. The Commonwealth Government has passed over to the State governments many controls which it exercised during the war. Its justification for this policy is the necessity for restricting building activity to home construction only. On paper that appears to be very desirable, but in practice it does not work out very well. If the Minister wants homes to be constructed as rapidly as possible, he will not achieve his end by restricting industry for the benefit of one special section. In order to prove my point, I refer to what happened in the last year of the Menzies Government's administration. In that year, a record number of homes was built in Victoria. In the same period a record general construction programme was carried out in that State. The one helped the other. Artisans passed from one job to another, and, as the building industries were expanded to meet the demand for one kind of construction, they were able to handle other kinds as well. That sort of expansion will not be achieved by confining building operations to one particular group. If the Minister wants the building industry to expand, he should remove, as far as possible, the restrictions now in force. If he fails to do so, he may find that the policies adopted by State governments, from the best of motives, will nullify the development which he seeks to encourage. </para>

                    <para class="block">It appears to-be very innocuous at first glance, but it proposes to grant to merchant seamen who travelled between ports within a State during the war the special benefitof the war service homes legislation, which was designed primarily to assist members of the fighting forces to obtain homes at reduced costs. The war service homes scheme, in its present form, provides one of the easiest means of purchasing a home ever offered. This bill introduces an entirely new principle into the scheme. As I said in my second-reading speech, although the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> probably did not appreciatemy point, the original act was designed specifically to assist members of the fighting forces, persons who went to Great Britain to make munitions, and merchant seamen who travelled overseas into theatres ofwar. I definitely oppose the inclusion of men who were engaged in the merchant, naval service between certain Australian ports only. If the Government wishes to grant some measure of assistance to those seamen, it should introduce legislation for that special purpose. Thousands of ex-servicemen are to-day awaiting a chance to build war-service homes, and it is possible that many hundreds of thousands who have not yet applied will eventually do so. There is already a serious holdup in the war service homes programme. </para>

                            <para>- I regard the war service homes legislation as being, in the main, a gesture of appreciation by the nation of the splendid servicesrendered by the members of the fighting services. The proposal to bring within its ambit members of theAustralian mercantile marine who served in ships plying along our coasts is not in keeping with the spirit that prompted the introduction of the original act, namely, to extend its benefits to those who had gone overseas into the theatres of war. The members of the Australian mercantile marine not only get very substantial rates of pay, but also good quarters and food, and, in addition, a war-risk bonus. The current order of the Maritime Industries Commission provides that the war-risk bonus shall be at the rate of 25 per cent. in respect of interstate and intra-state ships trading south of Townsville and Port Hedland, 15 per cent. for ships trading in Spencer's Gulf, and331/3 per cent. for interstate and intra-state ships trading north of the ports mentioned. For overseas ships going north of Townsville and Port Hedland, a bonus of 50 per cent. is paid from the last Australian port of call on the outward voyage to the first port of call on the homeward voyage. A soldier on active service received a payment of 6s 6d. a day plus 2s. a day deferred pay. He had to withstand the privations of desert warfare in the Middle East, of snow-clad mountains in Greece and Syria, and of jungle and infected swamps in the Southwest Pacific Area. All of this for a total of 6s. 6d. a day! Yet the soldier is asked to share the limited number of homes that can be built by the commission with members of the mercantile marine working in Australian waters who, throughout the war, have enjoyed a relatively comfortable existence. The extension of the benefits of this legislation in the manner proposed will have a disastrous effect upon ex-servicemen who have been waiting years for a war service home. If the Government wishes to build homes for members of the mercantile marine it should bring down a special bill for that purpose which could be discussed on its merits. In time of battle a soldier lives largely on biscuits and bully beef; his- more fortunate compatriot in the mercantile marine is amply catered for all the time by the generous scale of rations laid down by his awards.

                    <para class="block">No Minister can. honestly defend a proposal such as we now have before us. I am not unmindful of the services rendered by members of the mercantile marine. I pay a tribute to their work; but I do not agree that they should be placed on °an equal footing with members of the fighting forces and be enabled to compete with ex-servicemen for the few homes that the War Service Homes Commission can build each year. If thisclause is passed in its present form it' will cause grave disappointment to manythousands of ex-servicemen, mostly young men with families', who have been waiting for years for a home. Instead of adopting a policy which will result in still further delaying the provision of homes-' for ex-servicemen, the Government should be taking every possible step to expeditetheir construction. I paid tribute earlier to the  Commisioner  and his staff, many of whom I know personally. They aremost estimable men, who are anxious torender the best service they can to theirexservicemen comrades. If, in addition to dealing with their present difficult problems, they are to be obliged to make provision for another group of men out of the limited building and man-power resources that are available, an entirely new organization should be established! and should operate under separate legislation. I ask the Minister to withdraw this provision. </para>

                        <para>.- Seldom do I disturb the pleasant atmosphere of the committee by intervening; in a debate; but as one who represents a waterside electorate which embraces manymen who went down to the sea in ships,. I consider that I ought to say 'somethingon this clause. I am not seeking for thosemen great, gifts, rewards or honours, because such are not bestowed by this legislation, but I do seek on their behalf recognition of the services that they rendered' during the war period.- They were, in effect, the life-line between the battle linesand as indispensable to the war effort as the men in the trenches. There should besome tangible recognition of what they did. I have said that I am not seekingfor them gifts, rewards or honours. In plain fact, a war service home' is neithera gift nor an honour, and the right to possess one is merely a recognition of." service. My reason for saying that, is that the purchaser of a war service home is in no 'better position than the private individual who contracts to build a home for himself. For instance, he does not :get any concession in regard to price. It costs as much, perhaps more, to build a war service home as to build by private contract. The purchaser of a war service home gets very little concession in regard to the interest charge, .because to-day the ex-serviceman is charged an interest rate of 3-J per cent, which is exactly the same a.s the private bank rate on building operations. The penalty for failure to maintain payments does not advantage the purchaser of a war service home in comparison with the man who buys a home privately. It has been proved in thousands of instances since the last war that the purchaser of a war service home who fails to keep up his payments faces eviction and the loss of his equity in the property, as does any private individual who contracts to purchase a home. Added to that, the man who takes on a contract to purchase a war service home accepts a life obligation, under which he gambles against the fate of industry, assuming that until he is able to complete his payments, possibly in 30 years' time, he will remain in employment and will not default. So those who are given the privilege of  purchasing  a war service home have bestowed on (hem not a gift or an honour, but merely a recognition of the service they have rendered to their country. It is true that, as the result of amendments subsequently embodied in the act, a concession is given to the widow of the purchaser of a war service home. If a man dies before discharging completely the obligations imposed on him under his contract, his widow may take over the contract to complete the payments, and if unable to do that may occupy the home at a nominal rent during her lifetime. That is no greater concession than many building societies give to those Who build homes under their control. Under a system of insurance, the purchaser of a. home under many private contracts is protected -in that connexion. If he dies, the home immediately becomes the property of his widow. Therefore, if this concession wore given to the men who went down to the sea in. ships, it would be neither a gift nor an honour, but merely a recognition of their -services. </para>

                    <para>What is the history of the war service homes legislation?, It was enacted early in 191S; not in the heat, fervour find enthusiasm of war, but when this Parliament had an opportunity to survey the whole field- both recognition of members of the armed forces and the possibility of housing them. Despite all contradiction, there was no war service homes legislation in force during the war of 19.14-18. I have said that a war service home is neither a gift nor an honour. I go further and say that those who purchased such homes in 1919 placed a millstone round their necks. One of the greatest scandals, in building construction in this country was the building of war service homes by jerry-builders. Reviewing the history of this legislation, we can be assured that those originally responsible for it legislated in a calm atmosphere. In that atmosphere, they decided to include men of the merchant marine who had served overseas. Let us consider the present position. The concession was given to men with overseas service because World War I. was fought overseas. But in the spread of the recent war, there was not an area on the globe which was safe for the men of the merchant marine. I cannot recollect- any ship having been sunk or damaged in Australian waters in World War I. In the recent war, however, more than 30 ships were sunk or damaged on the New South Wales coast alone, and the total number on the whole of the Australian coastline was 33 sunk and thirteen damaged. Therefore, honorable members will see that the whole spread of the most recent war was different from that of 1914-18. What is there to show that those responsible for the original Avar service homes legislation, had they been faced  with  the problems with which we  were  confronted in the recent Avar, would not have omitted from that legislation the qualification that men of the merchant marine must have served overseas? Comparisons in such matters are odious. I remind honorable members that service in any armed force is an absolute lottery. Because of the disposition of the units to  which  they were attached, many men  who served throughout the recent war did not hear a shot fired, yet they are as much entitled to a war service home as is the man who went through the thick of it and was severely injured. As the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> has said - viewing the matter in the worst light, what is the difference between giving a war service home to a member of the merchant marine and giving one to the " Base Wallah " who did not go beyond Victoria Barracks? That is the position we are up against. Even though comparisons are odious, I remind the committee that there was no more nerve-racking job in the whole war than that performed by the men of the merchant marine. Very often they were ill-protected, and did not sail in convoy, yet they faced the same risks from bombs and torpedoes and mines as did the bestequipped ship in the British Navy. Even if their ships did not meet with disaster - and a great many ships did - the fact that for over <inline font-style="italic">five</inline> years they were subject to such nerve racking experiences should entitle them to special consideration. They performed their duties with heroism. There is no brighter page in the history of Australia's war effort than that which records the deeds of the men of the merchant navy, whether they sailed in convoy or not.In 90 per cent. of the cases they were over-matched in that they lacked a sufficiency of defence weapons, and had no protection against mines. Therefore, the matter of pay or bonuses should not enter into it. Does the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> believe that high pay or a bonus could compensate a man for the loss of hislif e ? Does he believe that a wife would be prepared to sacrifice her husband for the sake of benefiting by high pay or a. bonus? If pay is to be a consideration, we should compare the rates of pay received by various ranks in the Army. Would the honorable member deny a general the right to a war service home because he received more pay than a private? Not only does the honorable member throw into the scale against the merchant seaman his pay and bonus, but he also throws in the menu. While he charitably remarks that he is not opposed to seamen getting good food, he neverthe less mentions the good food as a reason why seamen should not be entitled to war service homes. The fact remains that the merchant seamen were engaged on the Australian coast in an extremely risky service. Would the honorable member for Moreton have taken on the job at their pay? </para>

It is not in our power to provide them with such things, but it is in our power to do whatthe Parliament did in 1918 : that is, to give to merchant seamen who served in war theatres the right to war service homes. During this war our merchant seamen serving on the Australian coast were exposed to all the hazards of war, and the Parliament should suitably recognize their service. </para>

                            <para>- I was about to remark that the honorable member for Dalley made a very good second-reading speech on the clause. It is interesting to note that heshould be four ships out, in his account of the sinkings. Such a matter should be the subject of accurate knowledge. The honorable member drew a gloomy picture of the economic future of persons who take war service homes. He did not use the word " liability " although I tried to put the word into his speech, for him.. However, everything he said indicated that the ex-serviceman who takes up a. war service home accepts a liability for  30  years, and he referred to the inconvenience of such a liability in the event of the occupant being evicted or losing his equity in the home. While the Labour party was in opposition I was lead to believe from the speeches of Labour supporters that when Labour got into power every one would be immensely well off, and that, indeed, no one would have to work at all. There would be no such things as loss of income or poverty oi' evictions. There would be a state of universal well-being guaranteed by the Government. Now, the honorable member for Dalley, in a speech lasting only ten minutes. has completely wrecked my faith in the Australian Labour party. He should take the opportunity to assure me that he was speaking without the Australian Labour party policy before him ; that on this occasion he was looking at life and at the facts of the situation as they arn, and not as they are represented in the Australian Labour party policy. </para>

                        <para>.- I agree with the comments of the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> who, in contra-distinction to the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> explained clearly the position in regard to merchant seamen. The honorable member for Moreton ran true to form, and mouthed the usual platitudes about what ought to be clone for e'x-servicemen. He has been doing the same thing for the last  25  years. For part of that time he was a Minister of the Crown, and for twenty years out of the  25  he was a supporter of the government in office. He has had many golden opportunities to do for' cx-servicemen what he now says that this Government ought to do, but the fact that it is necessary for him to keep on making the same requests indicate that he is not anxious to do anything in particular for ex-servicemen, but wishes only to use them for his own political ends. By now, I think the ex-servicemen have reached a proper understanding of the honorable member and his friends, who are now demanding that the Labour Government should do the things which they declined to do when they had the opportunity, and which they are secretly hoping that the Labour Government will not do, either.

                    <para>As for the clause under discussion, I believe that the proposal of the Government is a sound one. Seamen who took ships to sea during the war ran grave risks, graver risks than some members of the services, and I believe that they should have the same right to war service homes. Indeed, I believe that the Government should have gone a - good deal further. It is provided that any person who volunteered, and was accepted for overseas service, and those who actually served overseas, shall be entitled to a war service home. Yet it is a fact that many men who volunteered and were accepted never left their own. States, or even the capital cities. Nevertheless, they are. entitled to war service homes. There were in the armed services many mcn who were called up, and did not have a choice as to their place pf service. They were drafted into the service, put into uniform and sent to Western Australia, Queensland or the Northern Territory, where they served for over four years. They should receive the same consideration as other ex-servicemen. If this cannot be provided in the bill now, the Government should amend the legislation as soon as possible so as to provide for it. </para>
                    <para>While houses are so urgently needed, and while the powers of the Commonwealth Government are restricted in regard to the provision of homes, the Government should use the War Service Homes Act as a method to provide homes for as many persons as possible. In this way, it should be possible to provide homes for a great many more people than in any other way. The Government should seize the opportunity to build twice as many homes for the people as is possible under the act as it now stands. </para>

                        <para>. - Many merchant seamen who sailed the seas during this war faced dangers and suffered hardships as great as did any of those who sailed with the Royal Navy or the Royal Australian Navy. I do not think that any experience could be more horrible than that of' a stoker working in the bowels of a ship running the blockade to Malta during the height of the blitz against that island; and what could be worse than the experience of seamen on ships carrying supplies on the northern route to Russia? I remember once travelling to Tasmania on the <inline font-style="italic">Zealandia,</inline> which now lies wrecked in Darwin harbour. I went down into the engine room, and along the propeller shaft as far as the thrust blocks. I went down to the stokehold, and in the engine room inspected the triple expansion engines. There, I talked to the second engineer, and it struck me what a harrowing experience it would be vo be working down there in a ship that was going through seas where there existed danger from mines or torpedoes. Actually, the engineer had been in a ship that was torpedoed during the last war. I can speak as a neutral on this matter, because no submarines ever went up the New England rivers, nor were any mines laid in them, but my honest opinion is that merchant seamen ought to be. entitled to the benefits of this measure. </para>

                        <para>.- The remarks of the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> should have the endorsement of every honorable member. As the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> has indicated his intention to support the bill there cannot be much wrong with it, because generally the honorable member, for political purposes, does his best to find flaws in proposals submitted by the Government. During the war enemy submarines frequently lay off the coast of New South Wales, particularly in the vicinity of Newcastle. It may not be generally known that many vessels were sunk off the Australian coast. I have had some sad experiences following disasters caused to merchant shipping by enemy action. On one occasion I represented the Government at a funeral of nine merchant seamen belonging to the <inline font-style="italic">Arawa,</inline> which was torpedoed by the enemy. Luckily,, the bulkhead held, although the propellor was missing and the aft part of the ship was. badly damaged. Oxy-welders had to be engaged to extricate the body of at. least one seaman which was encased in steel. The devastation was indescribable. I said then that if any men were deserving of honour for the part they played in the war, no one was more entitled to it than were the merchant seamen who risked their lives in enemyinfested waters. When the present Government first came into office it had to rely a good deal on the support of two independent members. In 1942 a bill to amend the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act was returned from the Senate with an amendment providing for preference to ex-servicemen. The then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> agreed to accept the Senate's amendment, provided that merchant seamen were included. Later, the Senate, to its eternal disgrace, refused to accept his suggestion, and as the Government could not rely 'on the support of the two independent members in this House, it was not able to give effect to its intention. At that time the Opposition in this chamber was larger than it is now. Honorable members will recall that its ranks were thinned at the last election. That" process will be carried further when the next appeal is made to the electors. </para>

                            <para>- Although the seaplane base at Rathmines Bay afforded some protection to shipping, enemy torpedo boats frequently lay off the coast near to Newcastle. That was natural, because from time to time ships carrying iron and steel to the rest of Australia sailed from New-  castle. There were many sinkings of vessels in that vicinity. I know something of the seamen from that locality,, and I sincerely support this clause which will give to them the right to a war service home. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> said that there was some discrepancy between figures cited by honorable members in giving the number of ships sunk off the Australian coast. I rise to make it clear that the figures cited byme related only to sinkings off the coast of New South Wales, and did not include naval vessels. In this clause the Government is endeavouring to give effect to its general poiicy of meting out justice to every one. Some twelve months ago I attended a dinner of ex-naval men at which Commander Symonds, of South Australia, paid a great tribute to the members of the merchant navy. He referred particularly to those who had sailed in vessels which traded along the Australian coast, and stated that it was not an uncommon thing for them to suffer from extreme cold and that other risks awaited them beyond the 3-mile limit. I regard Com- mander Symonds as sufficient authority for saying that these men endured many hardships. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not propose to detain the House long in discussing this bill. As the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> explained in his second-reading speech, what is being done in this measure represents, in effect, a tentative arrangement, pending the possibility of. giving effect throughout the British Empire to the general rule of fully independent nationality for husband and wife. It is perhaps of some interest to realize that although the Parliament of Great Britain has been dealing with the problem of nationality as between husband and wife and child for something over a century, we are now aiming in the direction of the state of affairs which existed before Parliament took any action in the matter at all. The common law position before statute law came into operation was, as the Minister pointed out, that marriage had no effect on the nationality of a woman. That is to say, in the event of a British man marrying a German woman, the woman retained her German nationality and the man his British nationality. Then, no doubt, problems arose as to the nationality of children, and some attention was directed to it with a view to securing something like harmony of nationality within the' boundaries of a family, and the result was that various steps were taken from time to time. Eor example, in Australia, the Nationality Act 1920-1930, which honorable members will find in the consolidated volumes, provided, in section 18, that the wife of an alien should be deemed to be an alien. That is, if an Australian woman married a foreigner, she assumed the nationality of her husband. He, being an alien, she became an alien. After that, there were various discussions, and, in particular, the Hague Convention of 1930, arising from a conference at the Hague on this very important and complex matter, was adopted in Australia by our act of 1936, and, without having any desire to repeat what the Minister said, perhaps I ought to remind honorable gentlemen of the effect of that. For this purpose. I am omitting irrelevant matters. Where a British woman under the act of 1936, marries an alien, she does not cease to be British, unless, by reason of her marriage, she acquires the nationality of her husband. That is the first step. The wife then, assuming she became an alien because of marriage to a foreigner, in the circumstances in which she acquired his nationality, was, so to speak, able to contract, out of that state of affairs by making a declaration that she desired to retain while in Australia or in Australian territory, the rights of a British subject. So, the law, as it stands - apart from this proposed amendment - in effect, amounts to this, to bring it right home: An Australian marrying an alien in circumstances that would normally make her an alien can make a declaration, and, having made that declaration under the act, retains, while in Australia and Australian territory all the rights of a British citizen and is subject. I may say, to the liabilities of a British citizen. That does not mean that she remains in fact a British subject; it means that she retains the rights and liabilities of one.  Her  status as an alien continues, but she is permitted, by exception from that status, to exercise certain rights and become subject to certain liabilities as if she was a British citizen in Australia. Now, the present bill operates on that state of affairs, and provides, as honorable gentlemen will see, that an Australian woman - and again I am 'taking the example of an Australian woman who at the time of her marriage to an alien was resident in Australia and was a British subject - shall, while in Australia or any Australian territory, be a British subject, or continue to be a British subject, unless she makes a declaration that she desires to retain or acquire the nationality of her husband. Again, I have omitted the words that are not material to the discussion. So what this bill does is to reverse the process. Under the existing law, she becomes an alien, unless by making a declaration she reserves to herself certain rights as a British subject while in Australia and Australian territory. </para>

This bill reverses the process, because it provides, by force of the act itself, that she shall, while in Australia or Australian territory, be a British subject, not merely exercise the rights and be subject to the liabilities of one, unless she declares out. She originally declared in, under the 1936 legislation. She made a declaration as the result of which she retained certaiu Australian rights and obligations. Under this legislation, she retains not only Australian rights but full British citizenship, unless she declares out - unless she takes the necessary steps to say, " I am adopting the nationality of my husband ". </para>

                            <para>- Yes. That is what I was saying. While she is in Australia, now or in the future, she has the full benefit of this legislation unless she contracts out. When she is in another British dominion, the law of that dominion applies. Our law will not change her status. It will be determined by the general rule that applies. I mention that because it is a few days since the Minister's second-reading speech was  made, and it is perhaps necessary to refresh the minds of honorable gentlemen on this matter. </para>

                    <para>I have no quarrel with this proposal. It is a proposal of a kind that I could imagine might be well put forward in any British dominion. I agree that it is most desirable, when dealing with British nationality, that we should have a nationality law that is the same all over the British Empire, because all sorts of intolerable anomalies will otherwise arise. For instance " AB " is deemed to be British in one part of the Empire, and foreign in another part. The ultimate objective of the Government is that we should develop ali over the British Empire - I understand it to agree with the desirability of uniform law - a system under which we shall not have separate nationalities for husband and wife. I know that that is a matter that has attracted a good deal of attention, particularly among women, women's societies and representatives of women. All I want to say for myself is this: there is one word of warning to be offered about it. It is a very simple matter to say that the husband and wife of a marriage shall retain the nationality they had before the marriage. The real problem arises in relation to the children. Under our existing law - and I refer to the Nationality Act 1920-1936, section 6- the child is British if born in a British country, or on a British ship, and the child is British if born abroad if the father is British, either by birth or by naturalization, and then, of course, the commonest case of all, the child is British if born of British parents, or if horn in British territory. But let me take the case of a child born abroad, if the father is British and the mother, by reason of some operative law, is not. Under our existing law, that child born abroad of British father, either by birth or by naturalization, is a British subject.. It may be said, then, that this illustrates some inequality of the sexes. I feel difficulty in knowing how we are to fix British nationality in the case of a child, if we pay regard to the independent nationality of both parents. Suppose the father is British and the mother French, are we then to say that the child's nationality depends upon some selection by him at some stage. Under our present law we. say to that child, " Your father is British; you are a British subject. If you do not want to be a British subject you can move off and get nationality in some other country." </para>

                            <para>- Not in all cases, but in a great number of cases; and what I am saying is that if we are to look forward to what is the ideal in this matter we will make a common rule all over the world. Then we have the problem as to bow to determine the nationality of a child in the circumstances I have mentioned. A boy, if he inherits the nationality of his father, as he does under existing law, may be said to be British ; but if his mother's nationality is equal in all respects he may be presented with a completely free choice as to nationality, and some machinery would need to be brought into existence to enable him to make a declaration in that respect. I am not raising this matter because I think that it can be solved in a few minutes' discussion, but in order to suggest that this problem of nationality is not merely a domestic problem. It is in the highest sense an international problem. It may be governed by the rules of all sorts of legal systems. </para>

                            <para>- And it did exist a few years ago in the case of various continental countries, but I would not be dogmatic insofar as Dutch law is concerned. What I suggest to the Government is that this is a matter which cannot be ultimately dealt with by one country. It is a. matter which must ultimately be solved in somefashion by international consultation. We have had international conferences before. There  was the Hague conference to which reference was made ; and the Australian representative at such a conference is, all too frequently, in the position of being uninstructed as to what, the real Australian view is on the matter. That is no one's fault; conferences arise and some one, a lawyer, represents us at them. This problem is full of technicalities; it is infinitely difficult. I suggest to the Government that with a view to the final clearing up of this matter it would be better to appoint an expert committee representative of all interests including women, because they have a proper interest in this problem, and that that committee should in quite an informal fashion investigate the technicalities so that when the next international conference arises in respect of this matter the view of this country could be put clearly. I am not opposing the bill. I have spoken partly to offer my comments on the problem as I understand it and partly to suggest to the Government, because this is not a party matter, that a committee of the kind I have mentioned would do very useful work and we would be enabled to make a really valuable contribution at an international conference at the Hague, or elsewhere, if that suggestion were adopted. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill raises an extraordinary problem. Under the measure the proposition is put forward that if a British woman marries an alien she continues to be a British subject, unless she contracts out ofher British nationality, as long as she stays in Australia; but, apparently, the moment she goes outside the 3-mile limit' on a foreign ship she loses her British nationality. Then,when she comes back to Australia from the country where her husband is living she again acquires British nationality. Let us suppose that she possesses property in Australia which she holds under the married women's property legislation as a separate estate and that war breaks out between Australia and the country of which her husband is a national.  If  she is out of Australia at the time, her property would be seized as the property of an enemy alien. But if that woman escapes and comes back to Australia she is then a British subject and is entitled to hold property in the Commonwealth. Numerous anomalies arise in this matter. Despite what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has said, I cannot understand why the Government cannot give British status to such a woman so far as Australia is concerned whether she is outside, or inside, Australia. I cannot understand why she cannot retain her British status even when she is outside Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I did not have the opportunity to hear the second-reading speech of the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> but I am greatly impressed by the case advanced by the Leader of the Opposition ' <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> The bill is a step in the right direction. I recall the debate which took place in connexion with the amending legislation introduced in 1936. I participated in that debate. Prior , to that time a womanautomatically assumed the nationality of her husband, and some tragic cases arising under that law came to my notice. I recall the case of an Australian-born woman who, because her husband was an alien, was obliged to take out naturalization papers in order to qualify for a widow's pension. It seemed ridiculous that a woman born in Newcastle, New South Wales, had to apply for naturalization <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> a British subject. That is what happened prior to 1936. I am impressed by the case presented by the Leader of the Opposition in respect of the nationality of children in the circumstances he mentioned. Again, where an application is made for a transfer, or transmission, of property after death the beneficiaries are obliged to sign a declaration that they are of British origin ;  otherwise, the property is not transferable to them. Then the point arises with respect to clause 3 which amends section 18a of the act by inserting the following section :  - 18b. - (1.) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, every woman who at the time of her marriage to an alien, whether before or after the commencement of this section, was resident in Australia and was a British subject shall, by force of this section, while in Australia or any Territory - </para>

                        </item>

                            <para>if the marriage is celebrated after the commencement of this section - continue to be a British subject, unless she makes a declaration that she desires to retain or acquire the nationality of her husband. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para class="block">She would be deemed to be a British subject unless she declared that she wished to acquire the nationality of her alien husband. That provision contains the elements of danger. The law which applies to the registration of aliens under property acts may be circumvented by people returning to Australia in order to claim property under this provision, because proposed new section 18b contains the vital words " whether before or after the commencement of this section ". Some of my fears may be unfounded, because I did not hear the Minister's explanation of the bill, but I hope that consideration will be given to my suggestions. In the past, conferences have examined the registrationof aliens, and I believe that in future, conferences should consider the subject of nationality, because people move from one country to another, and, as I stated earlier, those who have been debarred from acquiring or disposing of property may, under this provision, be able to dispose of it. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ! I administered the nationality laws of the Commonwealth for two years immediately after the existing act became operative, and 1 know from experience the anomalies, dif- ficulties and hardships which have beset many women because of these big problems. They do not confront most of us, but those who. are brought face to face with them know that they can occur in a most unexpected form and cause acute hardship. There are in the world to-day countless thousands of people who are regarded as stateless, and who, voluntarily or perforce, have been obliged to leave their country which subsequently lost entirely or in part its own autonomy. Some people left Austria before it was incorporated in Germany under the Hitler regime. They left Austria with an Austrian nationality. They did not acquire nationality when the amalgamation of Austria and Germany took place, and for purposes of nationality they are regarded as stateless people. That is the experience of thousands of people who left the continent of Europe to live in other countries, and they are beset with extraordinary personal and legal difficulties in the country in which they are living. Many women in Australia have had that experience. The Lyons Government grappled with the problem in 1936, and introduced the ameliorative proposal which operates to-day. The present Government proposes to go one step further by formalizing the status of these people. The whole purpose, of course, is to help the people concerned in regard to their rights of citizenship, but it occurs to me that citizenship involves obligations as well as rights. The obligations of citizenship under such a condition of affairs as this are not so easily dealt with - I admit also that the rights are not easily dealtwith - because there will be a class of people whose nationality will alter as they move from country to country. The primary obligation which accompanies the rights of nationality is the obligation of loyalty to one's nationality, and how any government can fairly and equitably interpret loyalties in respect of the obligation of a man who  changes hig nationality nearly as often as rabbits .pop in and out of a burrow, no one can ever explain. or understand. It is impossible to define such a position, and yet, in war-time, people are arraigned on charges of treason because their conduct and loyalty are impugned. On such occasions, how the obligations of loyalty of such a man who changes his nationality to-day and resumes his original nationality next month I do not pretend to understand. </para>

                            <para>- I leave it for the honorable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mulcahy)</inline> to propound that doctrine. 1 do not oppose the bill, 'because it is designed to take another step to help a certain class of people of our own nationality who, almost without exception, were born in this country. But I associate myself with the view expressed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that this bill should be regarded as no more than a patchwork, and an endeavour should be made to regularize the whole business. It appears to me that the United Nations, through the Economic and Social Council, provides the best venue for discussing such a difficult problem. It can be resolved only when a great degree of unanimity, is achieved between the nations as to the manner in which this matter should be treated. But it would be unsatisfactory and almost ludicrous for one mem'ber of. the British Empire to invoke the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations to deal with the problem if British communities themselves have not been able to reach an agreement upon it. The Government should take an early opportunity to confer with other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations with a view to seeing whether they can agree among themselves on some formula to achieve unanimity. . When that has been done, they can approach the Economic and Social Council to see whether the matter can be carried to its ultimate objective.  </para>

                        <para>. - I warmly support the bill. I realize the difficulties that are inherent in a measure of this description, but I con gratulate the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> upon having adopted the rather feminine attitude of looking across the difficulties at the possibilities. Having had the experience of the act which is now in operation^ we know enough of the difficulties to be able for the moment  to set them aside, and make this beginning towards a further clarification of the position. I entirely agree with the honorable member for Indi and the Leader of tile Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that these difficulties should be thoroughly weighed, and judgment passed upon them so that when we do go into conference with other nations, particularly members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, we shall have something really constructive and feasible to put before them. This matter of course has been raised on many occasions at Imperial Conferences. I recall that it was a subject for discussion at the 1935 Imperial Conference, -but little progress was made. However, on this occasion I believe that the Minister for Immigration has done a distinct service to the cause of' preserving to women the rights of nationality, and I hope that through consultations and conferences further progress will be sponsored from this part of the world. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I thank the House for the reception it has given to this measure. At least the bill proves that the age of chivalry has not yet passed, ft proves too, that honorable members in the Parliament are prepared to concede to the women of Australia some of that equality of rights about which we talk quite a lot, but at times do very little. As the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) has said, this subject has been discussed at a number of Imperial Conferences. It was not possible at any of those conferences to secure complete unanimity of opinion, and the best that could be done with the proposal that women should not surrender their British nationality upon marriage to an alien inside the British Commonwealth of Nations was the compromise to which the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> has referred, giving to each Dominion that elected to do so, the right to pass legislation conferring the rights  and privileges and also imposing the obligations of British citizenship upon women who, after having married aliens, made application to the appropriate authority in the dominions for the retention of those rights. It was of course provided, necessarily, that the exercise of any such rights and the acceptance of any such obligations could only exist while the person concerned remained a citizen of the dominions that passed the legislation. The Dominion. of South Africa has not yet passed the legislation which the honorable member for Indi said this Parliament passed whilst he was Minister for the Interior. Speaking from memory, only New Zealand and Australia have passed the legislation. We have dealt with the problem in two ways. First there is the international aspect which is covered by the Hague Convention, and then there is the practice obtaining within the British Commonwealth of Nations which, is determined from time to time by agreement at Imperial conferences. South Africa holds the view which has obtained from about 1870 onwards in the British statutes followingthe abandonment of common law practices, that a woman loses her nationality on marriage. This Government believes that it is important that we should go much further than has so far been attempted within the British Commonwealth, and I confess that what is proposed in this measure has not been a' matter of agreement at any Imperial Conference. We propose to pass this legislation and to bring it into operation by proclamation. We shall then say to the British Dominions that we think that they should pass the same or similar legislation, and should not offer any objection to this particular piece of legislation. However, the subject-matter of this bill and other questions of nationality are likely to come before an Imperial Conference at an early date. In October last year, the Canadian Parliament, introduced legislation which goes even farther than that- which we .are now discussing. It proposes to establish Canadian citizenship which will be the paramount consideration for persons residing in Canada. No person can be a Canadian citizen unless he or she is a British national, but under the Canadian legislation the emphasis will be placed on citizenship  within  the Dominion of Canada. That far-reaching measure has evoked a request from the Dominions Office in Great Britain that the whole subject be referred to an Imperial Conference at an early date. According to a cablegram that arrived from the British Dominions Office on the 26th March, that conference will be held at Paris in June, at the conclusion of the Peace Conference. I believe that at that conference a much more liberal view - I do not mean in the party sense but in the true and proper sense of the word - will be taken of this question of nationality than has heretofore prevailed. It is true, as the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> has said, that many problems are associated with this question. If we leave  the question alone we shall leave many problems unsettled ; if we pass this legislation we shall . create a few more problems; but I believe that the general opinion will be that if we pass this measure we shall be dealing with women much more fairly than in the past. </para>

                            <para>- Precisely, and I trust that after the Imperial Conference takes place we shall have further amending legislation introduced into this Parliament which will give not only to women who reside in Australia, but also to Australian women who go abroad, the right to retain British citizenship upon marriage to aliens. Their right to British nationality because of their birth within the British Commonwealth of Nations should be inalienable. That is the basis of this Government's views. Australian wives of Americans who go to the United States do so as British citizens, and remain British citizen? unless, by their own overt act, they decide to become American citizens. The United States of America has faced up to the problem mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition of' the nationality of children born of an American father and a non-American mother in a realistic fashion. A child born of- American parents, outside, the United States of America can only be an American citizen if, at the age of 21, he or she opts to become an American, and a child of an American father and a non-American mother has the same right to opt to he an American citizen, as has the child of two American parents. A child of an American father and a non-American mother born in the United States of America is a citizen of the United States of America. Other countries, too, have adopted a policy similar to that of the United States of America. Inside the British Commonwealth of Nations, Eire has passed legislation to give effect to that policy. In Soviet Russia, and in a number of South American countries, the same rule obtains. Eventually, I suppose, at a convention at the Hague or elsewhere., the principle will win universal acceptance, as I believe it should. In the concluding passages of his speech, the Leader of the Opposition suggested that the Government should give consideration to his proposal that an expert committee be appointed to discuss with the Government the problems dealt with by this legislation. I accept the suggestion, and as I have no doubt there are people interested in this legislation the officers of my department will meet their representatives and ascertain their views on it. I am sure their views will be freely given and that they will also be of great value. When the report comes back from the Imperial Conference we might find that this legislation can be extended as honorable members would desire it to be extended, and that other dominions will be found to be willing to recognize, in their territories, the British citizenship which we confer on Australian women by this bill. </para>

                    <para>There is little more that I can add except to draw attention to the fact that divided sovereignty in Australia of itself creates difficulties. Some State laws permit an unnaturalized subject to hold land while others forbid it. Before 1937, when legislation was passed following upon the Imperial Conference of 1935 which gave the limited right we now propose to extend to women, it was possible for an Australian-born woman, because she was the wife of an alien, to have no right to hold property in Queensland but to be able to hold property in her own right in Victoria. The actof 1937 did, to some degree, correct that absurd and grotesque anomaly. I have no doubt that this bill will have a speedy passage through this House and through the Senate. After its passage through both Houses of the Parliament the. Government will take action on the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition for the convening of a conference of those interested so that we may obtain the benefit of their views. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to bring before the House a matter which gravely reflects upon the administration of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. From the evidence which I shall bring before honorable members it appears that the Minister has given preference to the manufacturers of dog biscuits, primarily used to feed racing greyhounds, over the needs of the people of Great Britain and Europe and the starving millions in India. As I shall show, this preference has been given, not only to the detriment of our export obligations, but also at the expense of the Australian poultry farmer and bacon producer and at a price which sacrifices the interests of the wheat farmer. The unfortunate position of the people of Great Britain, and of India where famine stalks the land, is only too well known to honorable members.I remind them, however, particularly those representing dairying and poultry farming districts, of the acute shortage of mill offals for feeding poultry for the acute is this shortage that many poultry production of eggs and pig products. So men have had to go out of production and pig fatteners have ceased operations. In the New England electorate, particularly in the Tamworth area, which pro- duces one-twelfth of the total egg production of New South Wales, poultry farmers have had to slaughter their flocks because of the shortage of mill offals for feed. Yet, at this very time, the Minister chooses to cut down their already restricted feed supplies, thus further reducing production. In support of these very grave charges, I produce a circular dated the 11th February, 1946, which was addressed by the New South Wales State Superintendent of the Australian Wheat Board to millers, wheat distributors and others concerned. The circular reads as follows :  - </para>

In a time of acute shortage like the present, it was a practice which the State Superintendent refused to countenance. Doubtless he had the support of the Australian Wheat Board. Those orders should be enforced, and not be subject to external interference. I want the House to note particularly the date of the circular - the 11th February, 1946. The order was enforced, and no wheat was supplied to dog. biscuit manufacturers for the purpose of making dog biscuits, up to the 4th March, 1946. In the interval, something must have happened.

                <para class="block">No mention was made in that circular of the Wheat Allocation Committee which is representative of the State and Commonwealth Departments of Agriculture. Apparently, the Minister had completely overriden his technical advisers in having made this quantity of wheat available for the purpose of making biscuits for racing greyhounds. Unless he had unimpeachable justification for doing so, the Minister should not have overriden the Australian Wheat Board, which had the support of its technical advisers. Had he been here, I would have asked him what justification he had for overriding his tenhnical advisers. I point out to honorable members that 50,000 bushels is not a mere bagatelle, but is equivalent to 1,000 tons of flour and 300 tons of pollard and bran. This latter, if fed to poultry, would result' in the production of many thousand dozen eggs, which could be used to feed starving people overseas ; and the 1,000 tons of flour, if placed on the Indian market, would have a very good effect. I also direct attention to the price at which this generous Minister graciously offered the farmers' wheat to the owners of racing greyhounds. The circular stated - </para>

                <para>The reply of this generous Minister was that the export price was 10s. 4£d. a bushel, trucks port basis. This means that the wheat-farmer, through the generosity of the Minister, has made a compulsory gift to the dog biscuit manufacturers of approximately £12,500. What representations were -made to the Minister which caused him to divert this quantity of wheat? By whom, were they made? What claims did the dog biscuit manufacturers advance which could be considered superior to those that I have mentioned, namely, those of the hungry people of Great Britain and the starving millions of India ? These 'charges are- so grave that they demand the fullest reply from the Minister. It is essential that he shall reply on the facts as I have stated them. No other course is open to me than to charge him with having placed racing greyhounds before the starving humans of Great Britain and Europe. If this is the sort of administration for which the Department of Commerce and Agriculture is responsible, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> should investigate the matter. </para>

                    <para>For some time a request has been made by means of correspondence and interviews for certain action to be taken at Buck's Bay, in my electorate, in the interests of fishermen. This bay has a beautiful natural breakwater, and the local fishermen are engaged in the sharkfishing industry, which has developed to a considerable degree on the South Australian coast. They need improved harbour facilities for their craft, and these could be provided by blasting a hole in the reef at Buck's Bay. The Minister concerned knows that this matter is of interest to a large number of ex-service- ' men, but his last communication to me was that they had better get in touch  with the Navy or Army authorities, with a view to obtaining explosives with which to do the job themselves. Although men may have served in the defence forces, they are not necessarily qualified to use a large quantity of explosives in order to blast a hole in a reef. The  Government  should take up the matter as a post-war work. It could not safely be left to local residents. The government departments concerned could complete the job at an early date. I have letters from Melbourne firms which are prepared to purchase certain products of the sharkfishing industry. The matter should toe regarded more as one of Government policy than a question whether one department or another has explosives to spare. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> has raised a matter which is not to be mistaken as a mere criticism of one of the many acts of government administration which will call for comment, but as one of first-class consequence. I feel sure that it will not be regarded by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> nor the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully),</inline> as one which can be disregarded, but will be recognized as one of serious import, upon which some explanation is called for, if, indeed, a satisfactory one can be devised. We all know that Australia has not sufficient wheat at present to meet the demands for human .requirements. The strongest representations have 'been made to it from the headquarters of Unrra, and from various governments overseas, that we should exercise, to the most extreme degree, care in allocating wheat for stock feed, and go  to the limit in making every 'bushel we can possibly spare available for export abroad for human consumption. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>For many months past we have read in the daily press that in the next year or two the most critical food shortage in modern times will be experienced. One reads daily in the newspapers authoritative statements to the effect that millions of people are condemned to die of starvation within a measurable period of time. In that atmosphere, and in those circumstances, these appeals have been made to the Government to restrict, 'as far as possible, the use of wheat for stock feed and other purposes, and to make it available for human consumption. The Minister for -Commerce and Agriculture himself in the last couple of weeks has so explained the position to the House, and has capped his remarks by saying what we recognize with some pride, that, upon a close examination of the position, and as a result of these desperate appeals from overseas, another 5,000,000 bushels of wheat have been subtracted from the quantity previously set aside for stock feed in Australia, and will be exported for human use. I have not the slightest doubt that that was the cause of the warning circular sent out by the State Superintendent of the Australian Wheat Board in Sydney, pointing out- to millers that they were not permitted to supply wheat intended ' to be used for dog' biscuits. The warning was .given that if it were discovered that wheat was allocated by them for this purpose their whole . supplies might be cut off. But three weeks later another circular was addressed to the same millers by the Australian Wheat Board. The honorable member for New England read its exact terms. It stated clearly, on the authority of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, that millers were now advised that 50,000 bushels of wheat were to be set aside for the manufacture of dog biscuits. That meant that 50,000 bushels of wheat which had been hypothecated for human consumption was, on the direction of the Minister, to be .withdrawn and used for the manufacture of dog biscuits. Surely this is not something that can be lightly brushed aside. An explanation is demanded. The matter raises some interesting points. The honorable member for New England put his finger on one when he said that wheat which had been allotted for export at 10s.  43/4d  a bushel would now, by direction of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, be fed to dogs in the form of biscuits and the growers would be paid only 4s. lid. a bushel for it. This, on the quantity involved, would represent a loss of £12,500. </para>
                    <para>For many years, the wheat-growers, who have had as bad a time as any other section, have been agitating for control of the" product of their labour. Governments with which I was associated were charged by the Labour party with setting up boards which were not controlled by the growers, and the Labour party gained many thousands of votes by promising that if it were returned to power it would establish boards on which growers' representatives would be in a majority. There is, in fact, now an Australian Wheat Board upon which the growers representatives are in a majority, but that board is no .longer permitted to decide how the wheat shall be disposed of. It is the. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture who decides how much shall be exported and how much held in Australia. The board cannot say how much wheat shall be allotted to power alcohol distilleries, or whether the wheat is to be sold at a low price for use in Australia or at a high price for export. The Australian Wheat Board is no more than a ghost institution. It has an office but it has no authority. The Labour party honoured its promise by appointing to the board a majority of growers'- representatives, but it destroyed the value of this concession by taking away from the board all effective authority. The board cannot determine whether wheat shall be sent to the .starving people abroad, or whether it shall be used to feed dogs, probably racing dogs. I am a man who earns his living with the valuable aid of sheep dogs, but I have never seen a working clog fed with dog biscuits. These biscuits are fed to poodles, lap dogs ' and racing dogs. This matter must be  dos&lt;.:y examined, and an explanation given to the people and to the Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - During the last eighteen months, I have repeatedly stressed the need for Go- \ eminent assistance to the tobacco growing industry in Australia if the industry is to be saved. To-day, the industry needs Government help, or it will go out of existence. For some time past the Government has been conducting an inquiry through the Director-General of Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bulcock,</inline> into conditions in the industry, as a result of which the Government paid a  10  per cent, subsidy on. realization in order to assist the growers. Since the Government has had control of marketing and the system of appraisals has been in operation, the percentage increases have- been liberal, and I have no quarrel on that point. In  1941-42,  the Government increased payments by  10  per cent., and in the following year by another  10  per cent. It had previously increased payments by  25  per cent., so that, the total increase represented  45  per cent. The point is, however,' that although prices were increased by  45  per cent., growers did not obtain any financial benefit as a result. That is my quarrel with the system, and in this the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> agrees with me. The following table illustrates how the system has worked out .so far as the growers are concerned :- </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">As I have said, the Government granted a  10  per cent, subsidy in addition to the  45  per cent, increase, and that is the only addition which has resulted in an actual increase of income to the grower, because that did not come into conflict with the interests of the tobacco combine. "When the first increase of  25  per cent, was given, the grading list was revised and some of the lower grades were eliminated. Thus, the growers had less tobacco to send, and actually received less money, while the combine benefited by getting tobacco of a better quality at the same average price. Each year, as the increase was made by the Government, so the grading became stricter. The combine declares that the quality of Australian-grown tobacco has deteriorated. Tobacco </para>

                    <para>is grown in Australia in four zones - northern Queensland, southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. Would any honorable member suggest that, over a period of years, the grade would automatically decline in each of those four zones, so that the average payment would remain the same? Is it suggested that, after twelve or fifteen years' experience, the growers have not learned something about  tobacco-growing,  and that their product would not improve in quality, rather than deteriorate? I was told that the tobacco combine said that it would not buy . Australian tobacco unless it was graded  by  the. combine's own appraisers. In theory the grading is done  by  a representative  of the combine, a' representative of the growers, and a representative of the department, but in practice the combine's representative gives his verdict, which generally prevails. The stage has been reached when the Government must act. The question to be decided is whether the combine or the Government is to control the industry. If the present conditions are maintained the industry will be driven out of existence. If it be contended that the combine is justified in having its own appraiser I retort that the growers have an equal right to say that they will not sell their product unless they have their own appraiser. That would cause a strike. Commonwealth graders appraise wool and butter, and the producers of those commodities do not object. They realize that that is the only fair system. In the first year of appraisement the quantity of tobacco grown in Australia totalled 0,900,000 lb. In 1944-45 it fell to 2,500,000 lb., and the estimate for this year is about the same. "When I visited the Texas district about 2 years ago I found that tobacco was being grown on nearly every farm along the river road. Recently I visited the same district again, and I saw tobacco growing on only two of those 'blocks. I saw costly barns .and treating plants lying idle. The Government must decide whether or not Australia intends to retain this industry. When that question was put to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, he replied strongly in the affirmative, and I believe every honorable member would echo his reply, because Australia needs all the industries that can be established here. The subsidy paid to the combine amounts to £750,000 annually: the profits made by the combine amount to £960,000. lt pays dividends every quarter. Last year, £753,000 was paid by way of subsidy, and the profits of the combine remained about the same as before and the dividends were continued. The combine is protected against rising and falling prices. I admit that it was necessary to regulate prices in war-time, but the combine has had a fair deal, whereas growers' costs have increased immeasurably during recent years and yet they have had no offset in price. Many growers have been driven off the land. </para>
                    <para>The table of limits means nothing to the tobacco combine, because the appraisement systematically declines as the table of limits is revised. By the courtesy of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture I was able to attend a tobacco conference recently in Sydney. I was unable to remain to the end of the conference because of my parliamentary duties here, but I learned that the conference broke down because the growers stood out for an average price of 3s. per lb. I endorse that demand. The Minister admitted to me that that was a fair request. The solution of this trouble is for the Government to appoint independent appraisers" so that the growers may know that when a table of limits is decided on it will be faithfully .observed. I see no other way cf saving the industry. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> and the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> charged  the Government with having permitted 50,000 bushels of wheat to be made into dog biscuits, despite the fact that three weeks previously millers were warned not to use wheat for that purpose. It is contended that wheat was sold at 4s. lid. a bushel instead of at a higher price. I do not know the facts of the case hut I shall arrange to have the matter examined. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> is absent to-day attending a wheat conference. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann)</inline> has again referred to the tobacco industry. I recollect that this matter was raised by him when he introduced a deputation to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture some time ago. I understand that his charge is that because appraisers have adopted a certain practice, the substantially increased subsidy by the Government does not benefit the growers. That subsidy had been a matter of contention for many years. The subsidy was paid because otherwise the cost of tobacco to the consumer would have been substantially increased, as during the war the price of imported tobacco almost trebled. The subsidy was based on the lower dividend as  compared with the dividend paid before the war. I understand that the honorable gentleman requests the appointment of government appraisers so that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Limited and other tobacco companies, but particularly the former, because it processes the bulk of tobacco sold on the Australian market, shall be required to pay for Australian leaf prices determined } by a government appraiser, f shall certainly discuss that with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. There certainly seems to be some reason for the honorable gentleman's request, if, as he says, that principle' has been applied to other industries. </para>

                            <para>There is a shortage of suiting materials of the worsted variety which is the type mainly preferred by Australian men. The supply position in regard to tweeds and woollens is much better and in excess of local demand. Such shortages as exist of worsted suitings is due almost solely to the inability of textile mills to attract female labour. The requirements of ex-soldiers arc catered for by an arrangement made between the Government and the Federal Retailers Association, whereby the latter body agreed to give preference to discharged personnel for one suit, two fashion shirts, one pair of shoes and one hat. If this agreement is faithfully applied, then servicemen should have no difficulty in obtaining a suit within a reasonable period of their discharge. </para>

                        <para>Will the Prime Minister state whether ex-servicemen who contracted malaria are prohibited from obtaining positions in the Public Service? Is it a fact that malaria cases are not accepted as pensionable by the Repatriation Commission? If so, will the right honorable gentleman explain why ex-servicemen who contracted malaria in the execution of their duty are penalized by being prevented from obtaining positions in the Public Service? </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>No. The fact of having contracted malaria does not itself prohibit appointment to the Commonwealth Public Service. All appointees must pass a medical examination, but there is provision in the Public Service Act for the admission of servicemen who do not reach the health standard required of other entrants. War pensions are granted in respect of incapacity arising from malaria in the same manner as incapacity arising from any other disability. </para>
