                        <para>- Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to the warning issued by Mr. Justice Brennan in the Queensland Criminal Court, and published in to-day's press, that defiance of the Arbitration Court and direct action mean nothing less than bloodshed and bloody revolution, and that since the war certain influences have arisen and are trying to disrupt and ruin the country by overthrowing the normal form of government? Did  His  Honour issue this warning when imposing a fine of Â£100 on a striker for a vicious assault upon a volunteer labourer at the Murarrie bacon factory, near Brisbane? Does the Prime Minister concur in the view expressed by Mr. Justice Brennan? If he does, what action does he propose to take with a view to avoiding the threatened revolution which  His  Honour forecast? </para>

                        <para>- I have not seen the statement attributed to Mr. Justice Brennan. Knowing something of  His  Honour, I can say that occasionally he is prone to make rather exaggerated statements. If he has made the statement attributed to him, I do not accept it as an expression of the truth. I am not aware of any action that I need take beyond what the Industrial Court of Queensland is empowered to take in connexion with the trouble. </para>

                        <para>- I assure the honorable member that the Government desires that the young men in the Army, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy shall be demobilized at the earliest possible date. Between the 1st October, 1945, and the 22nd June, 1946, 283,000 armed personnel were demobilized. With Cabinet approval, I set up a special committee, composed of the Secretary of the Department of the Army, Mr. Sinclair, as  chairman,  and Mr. Norman Watt, representative of the Treasury, and the Adjutant-General, as members, to make a special survey of all army establishments,with aview to ensuring that everything possible is being done to discharge men immediately they become surplus. A careful watch is being kept over the working of the points system under which demobilization is being carried out very satisfactorily in all the circumstances. I appreciate the point raised by the honorable member, and I assure him that the matter is under constant consideration. </para>

                        <para>- A question on this subject was asked while the Minister for External Affairs was in the House. He then said - and this represents the views of the Government - that he believed that the Government ought not to be asked to make a judgment until the facts had been investigated. I understand that the subject has been investigated by a committee, and that certain recommendations have been made. The final decision will, of course, be taken by the United Nations. I do not know what particular statements the honorable member had in mind when asking his question. </para>

I have been informed that the company proposes to dismantle certain machinery for treating the salt at Lake Hart, and if transport charges are the difficulty, the granting of this concession might enable the salt to be treated. </para>

Whatever reports are given to the press should certainly be available to Parliament. The Slater committee's reports were made to me for my own consideration on subjects which I considered required investigation, and consequently I do not propose to table them. As to the report of the Inter-departmental Committee on Civil Aviation, the honorable member has asked for its presentation at least half a dozen times. The answer has invariably been "No"; it still is "No". </para>

                        <para>- Has the Minister for Information seen this morning's edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> in which only the speeches of members of the Opposition are reported on the bill to broadcast the proceedings of this House? As it is well established, particularly by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), that a fair and accurate report is required of the proceedings of this House, is not the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph report</inline> a gross breach of privilege? If so, does the Minister consider that the New South Wales Crimes Act should be invoked to deal with the proprietors of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph?</inline></para>

                        <para>- I take no notice of what appears in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> nor do I take much notice of the opinions of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) when he speaks in either his legal or his political capacity. I am not aware whether the Crimes Act of New South Wales could be invoked in respect of the breach of privilege alleged by the honorable member. The very fact that the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> printed only the speeches of members of the Opposition during the debate on the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Bill proves to me that this chamber was right last night in extending absolute privilege to those who broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament, because the people will now hear both sides of a debate when the press of Australia deliberately prints only the contribution of one side. </para>

                        <para>- Since this Government took office it has consistently adopted the policy that when drought is only partial and limited to certain areas relief is primarily a matter for the State governments, though when overtures have been made to the Commonwealth by State governments for assistance in providing drought relief, in no case has the Commonwealth refused to contribute on a Â£1 for Â£1 basis. If the Queensland Government makes an approach to the Commonwealth in this connexion, I have no doubt it will be treated in the same way as have other State governments seeking similar assistance. Water conservation is primarily a' matter for the States. The financing of water conservation projects is a matter for the Loan Council. </para>

If so, will he make a statement to the House with regard to the contents of the reports and as to the results of the tests? </para>

                        <para> - <inline font-style="italic">by leave -</inline> Yesterday, the honorable member for Indi (Mr. McEwen) referred to the appointment by the Controller of Meat Supplies of an inspector in Victoria to supervise pig sales, and mentioned that the officer appointed was also a buyer of pigs. The facts are that, owing to the excessively high prices which were being paid for pigs in Victoria in May and June of last year, representatives of certain sections of the industry requested the Controller of Meat Supplies to police markets in order to ensure that prices were related to the prices determined by the Commonwealth Government under the pig-meats plan. The. Controller of Meat Supplies endeavoured to obtain the services of a competent independent man to carry out these duties, and ultimately accepted a recommendation from a committee of bacon-curers and exporters that Mr. J. M. Wilson, a pig-meats exporter, be appointed. Mr. Wilson began duty on the 10th June, 1945, and ceased duty on the 19th July, 1945, a period of less than six weeks. He carried out his duties to the complete satisfaction of the Controller of Meat Supplies, and at a financial loss to himself. I confess that I am at a loss to understand the reason why the honorable member raised this matter twelve months after the person concerned ceased duty with Meat Control. </para>

                            When  I raised this matter, I had no knowledge of the circumstances other than what were popularly believed to be the facts in that portion of my electorate which was concerned. The statement of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture
                                (Mr. Scully)
                                confirms the allegations that have been made, namely, that buyers of pigmeat, traders in pig-meat, bacon curers wholesale butchers and exporters, finding that competition between themselves at auction was forcing prices to a level embarrassing to them, made representations to the Meat Control asking that action be taken to reduce the price of pigs on the hoof. As the result of those representations, a meeting was conducted, I understand, under the chairmanship of the honorable member for Ballarat
                                (Mr. Pollard).

                            <para>- Apparently the honorable member was not  chairman,  but he attended, the meeting. I emphasize that no producer of pigs was informed of the intention to hold this meeting, or given an opportunity to attend it. The point emerges that an agreement was reached that official steps should be taken to reduce the price of pig-meats. That is a matter of government policy, and I do not propose to comment upon it now, but I regard it as highly improper that for the purpose of reducing the price of pigs at auction, officials of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture should accept the recommendation of buyers of pigs regarding the person who should be appointed and clothed with the authority of an inspector to attend sales and fix prices. </para>

                        <para>-  I wish to make a personal explanation. I, perhaps, misled the honorable member for Indi (Mr. McEwen) when I said that I was present at the meeting at which he alleged I occupied the chair. I neither attended nor chaired the meeting at which, according to him, an exporter was appointed an inspector of pig-meat prices. It is true that from time to time, by invitation, I have attended meetings of the Newmarket Meat Producers Association, and other primary producer organizations of one kind and another, and I know that the honorable member has attended similar meetings, for he has been working hand in glove, with such organizations in their various ramifications. </para>

                        <para>- One of my duties is to cause a continual check to be made of unemployment figures throughout Australia, and submit reports on the subject to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. I am happy to say that there is no indication of any dangerous development of unemployment in Australia at the moment. The total number of persons unemployed in Australia on the 21st June last was 11,100, about - 60 per cent, of whom were receiving unemployment benefit. The other 40 per cent, were receiving a reemployment allowance as ex-servicemen while awaiting employment in the type of work they desired. South Australia has a very good average, for the total number of unemployed there on that date was 8S0, about 50 per cent, of whom  were ex-servicemen. </para>

                        <para>- Last week, in reply to a question by the honorable member for Richmond, I stated that it would be very difficult to have the very bulky report of Mr. Justice Davidson printed, in view of other work that had to be undertaken. The honorable member for Richmond suggested that a summary might be made available to honorable members, and I promised to endeavour to distribute in roneoed form copies of a summary that had been prepared for members of the Cabinet. Subsequently, I inquired of Mr. Justice Davidson as to the matter generally, and was informed that an officer under his control, Mr. St. John, was preparing a complete summary of the report. I apprised the honorable member for Richmond of this. I understand that the summary was posted yesterday. It had not arrived this morning. As soon as it reaches me, I shall endeavour to have copies of it made and distributed to honorable members. I owe an apology to the House for a statement that I made in regard to the printing of the Auditor-General's report, which I thought had been put in hand. I found later that when I had moved for the printing of the report, the Leader of the Opposition had secured the adjournment of the debate. Apparently the view of the Government Printer, which, no doubt, is technically correct, was that until the House had approved of the printing of the report the work could not be proceeded with. The Leader of the Opposition agreed last week not to debate the motion for the printing of the report, and the work is now being proceeded with expeditiously. </para>

                        <para>- Since the gradual withdrawal of man-power regulations and the cessation of war-time activities associated with the man-power organization, some staffs have had to be reduced. Arrangements had to be made for State public servants who had been loaned to the Commonwealth to be returned to their former positions, or to be found positions in the Commonwealth service if they chose to remain in it, and there were opportunities for their absorption. The change-over has now been completed. Wherever possible, men who were found to be redundant have been absorbed; but there are still some officers classified  as  temporary employees who are anxious to know, whether they can be given permanent status. </para>

                        <para>- I have not read of the possibility of all iron foundries in Victoria being closed because of a dispute in regard to wages. Had there been such a possibility, it would have been brought to my notice.  I cannot fight a shadow, but must have substantial grounds for any action that I may take. If the action referred to by the honorable member has been taken by employees, it would be in contravention of the regulations relating to wage-pegging. I have heard that some employees have acted in that way, and that there are employers who have conspired with their men to violate the regulations. Proof of such action has to be available before a prosecution can be launched. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that the honorable member refers to contracts entered into by the natives with the Army authorities. Now that the Army has handed over control to the civil administration, we have decided that it would be improper to require the natives to complete the contracts which they had made with the Army Authorities, and with no one else. With the cessation of military control, it was decided by the Department of External Territories that the natives should be allowed to decide whether they would continue in employment under fresh contracts, or -return to their villages. We believed that, in the interests of the Territory and the natives themselves, this right should be extended to the natives involved. Most of the planters in the area already taken over by the civil administration are now finding, as shipping becomes available, that they can get enough native labour, although they at first complained of the action taken by the administration. The Government has set itself the objective of eventually abolishing the indentured labour system, and the results already achieved and the manner in which the natives are continuing to co-operate with the Government have led us to believe that this policy is correct. The Government does not intend to vary it.</para>

                        <para>- The Government fully realizes the difficult position in the United Kingdom because of the shortage of food. While I was abroad, I discussed the matter with the Minister for Food, Sir Ben Smith, and the Secretary for the Dominions, Lord Addison. I promised that I would discuss the subject with the Minister for Commerce and was possible for us to make an additional contribution to Britain, and to Agriculture in order to learn whether it the world generally. Subsequently, requests were made for supplies for China, India and other places. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture announced that more wheat was being made available for shipment abroad, and we have done everything possible to assist other countries with supplies of wheat. It fre quently happens that when Australia allocates wheat to Great Britain the wheat, is not, in fact, used there. The British authorities have been more than generous to other countries by diverting to them food cargoes originally intended for Britain. </para>

                        <para>- I shall have periodical surveys made andfurnish statements on the lines suggested by the honorable member. At present great difficulty is being experienced in obtaining sufficient shipping space to send flour to destinations abroad recommended by the British Ministry of Food. Some of the inland flour mills have had to reduce the number of shifts worked because of our inability to secure sufficient shipping to transport the flour overseas. The Government has recently been advised that it may expect this month a substantial tonnage of shipping in Australian waters; that should improve the position considerably. </para>

                        <para>- The position is being continuously reviewed, and some time ago a comprehensive survey of buildings and accommodation was made, under the direction of the Minister for the Interior, by Mr. Westhoven, previously Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator, a man well-known to many honorable members, and well experienced in matters of office accommodation and organization.  His  survey covered three States, Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. Much accommodation has been made available as a result of that survey, and of the reviews made from time to time under the direction of the Minister for the Interior. I am aware of the great difficulties that arise from the shortage of accommodation, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. I assure the honorable member that the matter is constantly under review and that everything possible is being done. </para>

                        <para>- I shall have the honorable member's request examined. The honorable member will be aware that most of the vehicles available from army stocks are not of a type suitable for use as or conversion to civil ambulances. I speak from a good deal of personal experience in this matter. Most of the army vehicles available for disposal are too heavy for the purpose suggested by the honorable member, especially in country districts where roads are not good. On a number of occasions applications have been made by country communities for the allotment of suitable chassis for this purpose. These have invariably been treated with every consideration, having regard to the requirements of other users. I shall look into the matter and ascertain what can be done to assist in this worthy object. </para>

                            <para>- I submit this motion in an endeavour to arouse in the Government a sense of its responsibility in the grave industrial crisis that exists, not only  in Queensland, but also throughout Australia generally. Industrial unrest and turmoil are seen on every hand. The crisis in Queensland has assumed such grave proportions that no self-respecting national government can continue to sit complacently by and take no action to remedy it. It is necessary to review the trend of events that have led up to the present state of affairs in Queensland. The trouble had its origin- in a strike of employees in a bacon factory at  Murarrie,  when four men were dismissed on the 6th March, nearly three months ago. On the 29th March the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union ordered a State-wide strike. On the 2nd May the State Arbitration Court ordered the meat-workers to resume work on the 16th May. The employees ignored this order and the union was de-registered. On the 27th May the trouble spread to waterside workers, who refused to load meat. On the 12th June, coal-miners ceased .work in support of the strikers in the meat industry. On the 13th June, the Disputes Committee of the Trades and Labour Council, most of the members of which are Communists, decided that' members of the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen, the Australian Railways Union, and the Waterside Workers Federation should cease work on the 19th June in support of the meat strikers. On the 19th June, the Industrial Court ordered the Federated Locomotive Enginemen and the Australian Railways Union not to strike without a secret ballot. On the 26th June, the meat-workers rejected the proposals submitted by the employers for a settlement of the dispute. On the same date, a state of emergency was declared, and restrictions of power and transport came into force. On the 27th June,- the Queensland Cabinet ordered a ballot among the meat-strikers. On the 28 th June, the Queensland Cabinet ordered a compulsory conference of the employers and unions involved in the meat strike. On the 1st July, the conference of employers and employees failed to reach a settlement. On the 2nd July, the conference broke down. Drastic railway restrictions were announced. Striking meat-workers decided they would not resume work even if there was a majority " Yes " vote in the secret ballot. </para>

                    </continue><para>This recital of events illustrates the critical state of affairs prevailing in Queensland at the present time. That the position is certain to become *worse unless the Commonwealth Government intervenes is shown by the statement of the meat union <inline font-weight="bold">president, Mr. H.</inline> Field, when addressing Booval miners on Monday. The .present strike, said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Field,</inline> was not the last .major struggle. It would probably prove to be merely the first round. Further evidence of a determination to continue the industrial trouble was provided by the '  president  of the Queensland Coal Employees Union, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Millar,</inline> who told the Rosewood miners that their motion for a secret ballot would not be acceptable even if it were carried. There is also ample evidence that the Communist party is active in fomenting industrial strife in Queensland. The Communists are elated at their success so far. </para><para>The seriousness of the position is shown by the fact that more than 16,000 men are on strike. They comprise about 5,600 meat-workers, 3,000 coal-miners and 7,S00 waterside workers. As a result of the restrictions, it is estimated that about 70,000 people are out of work. Plants making agricultural implements are high in the list of those enterprises which have been compelled to put-off staff ; saw-mills, private engineering and ship-building works, and secondary industries of all kinds have been adversely affected. The unemployment roll is growing daily. Coal reserves are dwindling. There is a depressing stagnation in business. Building materials, foodstuffs and other essential commodities are being held up. There has been a serious dislocation of export and import trade. ' It was estimated yesterday that the meat strike alone has cost Queensland graziers more than Â£1,000,000 because of the loss of export trade. Cattle in northern, central and southern Queensland have been taken to rail heads and yarded before despatch to the meat works, but because of the impossibility of their being slaughtered, they have had to be released. Beef that ought to have been available for export to Great </para><para>Britain and for local sale is consequently not available, and the cattle have lost condition. </para><para>There is every indication that, unless the strike ends very shortly, at least one in four of Queensland's working population, exclusive of rural wage-earners, employees in small businesses and' the like, will be unemployed. The effect upon Australia's export trade is also disastrous. Great Britain is urgently in need of food. The Commonwealth Government has undertaken to supply substantial quantities of meat to the United Kingdom yet, because of this strike in Queensland, which has extended over such a lengthy period, it is likely that the people of Britain will be deprived of at least 35,000 tons. Continuance of the strike will result in this figure being greatly increased. So, as a result of industrial lawlessness in Queensland, not only the Australian people but also the people of Britain will suffer. </para><para>I propose to give at least four reasons why the Commonwealth Government should intervene in the Queensland strike. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has said repeatedly in his complacent manner that the position is one for the Queensland Government to handle and that the Commonwealth Government has no intention of intervening. On the 20th March last, I asked that the Commonwealth Meat Controller, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tonkin,</inline> be sent to Queensland to effect a settlement.  That his visit was greatly delayed is shown by an answer received to-day from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> to the following questions asked by the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Abbott) : - </para><list type="decimal-dotted">

                    </list><para class="block">The lengthy report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tonkin</inline> shows that although the Prime Minister has steadfastly refused to intervene in the disputes he did in fact intervene, but in a most ineffective way, by sending the Meat Controller to Queensland. The reasons which warrant the Commonwealth Governments intervention are : - First, under National Security Regulation 77 of 1942, which is still in force, the Minister for Defence may direct any person resident in Australia to perform any services or duties in relation to his trade, calling or profession, as are specified or to do or refrain from doing any specified acts. Such directions may be applied to persons generally, to persons in a particular area, or to persons of a particular class. Secondly, under the Crimes Act, a proclamation may be issued if there exists in Australia a serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States. In what circumstances is the law to be administered ? The Government of Queensland, under war-time powers, has proclaimed the existence of a state of emergency. Surely that is sufficient justification for Commonwealth intervention ! Again, under what conditions will the Government invoke the Crimes Act, if it does not regard the present situation in Queensland as sufficiently serious? In reply to a question in the Senate, the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> stated that he would not have any hesitation in invoking the Crimes Act in order to meet the circumstances that arose. I ask: What circumstances have to arise before the Government will invoke the Crimes Act? Industrial turmoil reigns in Queensland. A state of emergency has been proclaimed. But the Commonwealth Government has neither the courage nor the determination to implement its own laws. </para><para>The third reason is that the Commonwealth is expending thousands of pounds a week to provide employment benefits for persons who, because of the. strike are out of work in Queensland. This is expenditure of public funds. Taxpayer's as a whole depend upon increased production for a reduction of taxation, but they are paying for the encouragement and continuation of a strike that is curtailing production. Government moneys are being used to provide unemployment relief for the strikers of Queensland, who have reduced the country to its present condition. It is futile for the Prime Minister to shake his head. My statement is proved by the fact that the Commonwealth Employment Service has received more than 6,000 applications for relief since the commencement of the strike. Surely this large disbursement from Commonwealth funds gives to this Government the right to intervene with a view to terminating the dispute and saving the further expenditure of public money. But instead of acting, the Prime Minister sits placidly in the centre of a cocoon of non-intervention and is quite satisfied to allow the position to drift. He shuts his eyes to, and turns his back on this industrial trouble," and declares that responsibility for settling the dispute rests with the Government of Queensland. What would be the right honorable gentleman's attitude if. similar conditions prevailed in every State? Would not they warrant Commonwealth intervention? The difference is only one of degree. </para><interjection>

The political parties on this side of the chamber stand four-square for the enforcement of the law without fear or favour. We stand four-square also, without any of the pretence that the Labour party has, for arbitration and conciliation. The arbitration laws should be enforced just as firmly as should the. criminal and civil law. If the arbitration law is unjust or impracticable, it should be amended; but so long as it exists, it should be enforced. The Prime Minister must not forget that he swore to enforce the law. It is useless for him to retort, " What would honorable members opposite do in the circumstances " ? The administration of the Commonwealth is divided into three compartments - the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. The function of Ministers is to give effect to the executive requirements of a country. The Prime Minister must accept hisresponsibility. </para><para>The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> whose wings' were' probably clipped a few evenings ago, has referred repeatedly to the defenceless position of Queensland during the war.

This industrial turmoil is occurring north of the so-called " Brisbane line ". What has any member of the Labour party south of "the Brisbane line " done to enforce the law for the purpose of terminating the dispute?. Approximately l,000,000 people in Queensland are left defenceless industrially by the enemy within the gate. What does this Government propose to do to destroy that enemy, and protect all those people? The residents of Queensland have a right to expect peace, order and good government, as promised in the Constitution. In this crisis, the Prime Minister should show all law-abiding citizens that he has the power and the determination to enforce the law. <inline font-style="italic">{Extension of time granted.]</inline></para><para>The Government of Queensland has insisted upon a compulsory ballot to decide whether the strikers shall resume  work.

                        <para>. - I deeply regret the industrial trouble that has arisen in Queensland, resulting in loss of production and affecting the economy of the State. When the .Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr! Fadden) was speaking, I asked him to indicate precisely the kind of power that, he considered should be exercised for the purpose of terminating the dispute. The right honorable gentleman certainly got very hot and frothy; but he continued to generalize. It is true that he made a statement about the enforcement of the Crimes Act, but he knows, as do all other, honorable members, that we have had to listen, in this House, for years to statements of that kind. When the right honorable gentleman was a member of the Menzies Government he and his colleagues had ample opportunity to apply this ' so-called law enforcement policy in the big strike in the coal-mining industry. They could then have tested their ideas, for the strike lasted about three months. But what did they do to .put these drastic provisions into operation? The Leader of the Government, who is the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> visited the coalfields and appealed to the miners to return' to work. In short, he appealed for industrial peace, but did not enforce the law. </para>

                            <para>- My electorate includes a big coal-mining district which has a very fine record of production. All I ask is that the Leader of the Australian Country party shall suggest some positive action and not continue to generalize. What precisely would he do to meet a situation such as exists in Queensland ? The position is that the State Government ' has complete constitutional power  fo  deal with the industrial situation. It has done much more than merely exercise its ordinary powers, for I hold in my hand a copy of a proclamation issued by the Lieutenant-Governor declaring a state of emergency in Queensland. In such circumstances severe penalties may be imposed for breaches of the law. Let us be realistic if we cannot be sensible ! Surely all honorable gentlemen realize, and probably no one more clearly than the right honorable member for North. Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> that men who are not willing to work cannot be forced by act of Parliament to work. I asked the Leader of the Australian Country party to tell us precisely what he would do to meet the situation that at present exists in Queensland if he were a member of the Government, seeing that the State Government is already exercising emergency powers. </para>

                            <para>- What does the right honorable gentleman mean by that statement? ' The Queensland Government would resent interference by the Commonwealth Government in the industrial struggle that is taking place, particularly as the great majority of the men concerned are covered by State awards. If the right honorable gentleman imagines that I, and the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde),</inline> in the earlier stages of this dispute, failed to keep in close touch with the Queensland Government on the  matter,  he is very much mistaken. No one has been more anxious than we have been to see this dispute settled. However, the State  Government  has full constitutional powers to do what it desires in this matter, and the majority of the men  concerned are subject to State awards and laws. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman made -many loose statements but he had nothing to say when he was invited to indicate precisely what he would do if he were a member of the Commonwealth Government, particularly having in mind that the Queensland Government has already declared . that a state of emergency exists, which gives it power to apply emergency legislation. If the men engaged in an industry will not work because of some grievance of their own, or because they are sympathetic with ether workers in industry, they cannot be forced to work by the application of industrial laws. That has been proved a thousand times over the years, and it was proved during the period that the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party held the most important portfolios in the previous Government. I have never tried to fool myself that men can be driven back to work by the force of the law. That procedure has never yet proved successful. If the Leader of the Australian Country party believes that military force should be applied, and that if men on strike will not go back to work they must be shot down, let him say so. </para>

I believe the Leader of the Australian Country party said that between 15,000 and 16,000 men were on strike, but about 70,000 were indirectly affected. Would he suggest that the 15,'000 or 16,000 men should be fined and if they did not pay the fine be put into gaol? I am trying to reduce the right honorable gentleman's generalizations to some con crete proposals. </para>

The right honorable gentleman skirted all around the problem, but he had no effective suggestions to make. The fact is that these men, for some reason, have refused to return to work. The right honorable gentleman says, " enforce the law ". What would happen if that were done? I take it that the men might be fined or gaoled.  But would that solve the problem? In the case of the coal strike to which I have already referred, would such action have got us any more coal? Would that policy ensure that the men on the waterfront would work? </para>

                            <para>- And this Government has done better in relation to- industrial production than the previous Government ever thought 'to be possible. I say again: Let us be- realistic. Let those who advise' us make some concrete, precise and detailed proposals. Let them cease talking wildly about drastic law enforcements. Rightly or wrongly, and I am not entering into that at the moment, these men in Queensland are on strike. I am not attempting to condone the strike; I merely point out that if the men have decided that they will not work, they cannot be forced by law to go to work. What then is the next step? They may he fined, and if they do not pay the fine they may be sent <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> gaol. But the application of such a policy has never been successful in settling an industrial dispute. I defy any honorable member to prove to me that such action has ever produced industrial peace or effected a settlement of an industrial dispute. I have been associated with many industrial disputes. Even if a mistress has a difference with her house-maid, I am expected to intervene. The right honorable gentleman wants me, on behalf of the Government, to intervene in the Queensland meat dispute, although the State Industrial Court is in control of it and the State Government, under its emergency powers, is operating the relevant legislation in order to deal with it. What form of intervention does he propose? Does he want me to order the men back to work? </para>

                            <para>- The employers said that they would not meet the employees in conference because of a direction that had been given by the Industrial Court. Therefore, we have the extraordinary position that, even had the . employees and the employers been willing to come -together with a view to effecting a settlement, the employers were not prepared to confer until the Industrial Court directed that a conference be held. I understand that the court has taken what the right honorable gentleman would describe as a very strong stand in this matter.' It has said to the union, "You are de-registered, and until your members return to work we shall not have anything further to do with this case". Friendly offices were used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tonkin</inline> with a view to inducing the employers to meet the employees. To the average man, that would seem the sensible thing to do in any industrial dispute. I understand that the employers said to the employees, " No. The court has declared that we are not to have any conference with you. You must first return to work ". <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted:]</inline> I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tonkin,</inline> "If you can have a talk with these parties separately, see whether it is possible to induce them to meet one another. Also, see whether the Queensland Government will help to bring about a conference. Do anything that you can in your official capacity as Meat Controller ". Had I been in Brisbane, I would have done precisely that. I would have tried to talk to the different parties, in order to induce them to be a little more reasonable. All the parties to the dispute have been strongminded, and have hotly maintained the stand they have taken. There is too much strong-mindedness in many industrial disputes, I do not deny that I. would have tried to induce the parties to come together. I could not, of course, approach the Industrial Court. I do not know whether the State Government or the Premier would be able to make any approach to the . court, because it - has made the declaration, " You must go back to work before we shall do anything ". The employers say, " We will not meet you until you go back to work ". The reply of the employees is, "We will not return' to work except under pre- strike conditions ". The right honorable gentleman has urged that the Commonwealth Government ought to intervene because of the influence that is being wielded by Communists. I have received hundreds of telegrams from those whom he has described as Communists, asking me to intervene in total disregard of the State Industrial Court and the State Government. To do that would be to destroy the effect of the Queensland law and the judgment of the Industrial Court; not that that would worry me very much, because I believe that there are some faults on that side. In my opinion, had the employers been pre- . pared to give way a little, the strike could have been settled. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman wants me to override the State Industrial Court and the State Government, by the exercise of .a power possessed by the Commonwealth; in other words, to flout the Queensland law and the State court. We have been unable to discern in what way any law that we could operate would be more effective than the laws which the Queensland Government has the power to operate. Their application, of course, does not get the men back to work. There is a great deal that I could say about the dispute; but I do not want to add fuel to the fire. I have been very disappointed at the trend of events. As a matter "bf fact, almost every day since I returned from abroad I have been told that negotiations were proceeding and that the  dispute would be settled. Yet it has dragged on from d&gt;ay to day. I do not want the right honorable gentleman or this House to believe that I am happy about the position. If the Commonwealth were to engage in a fight not only with the strikers, but also&gt; if you like, with the employers, the Queensland Government and the State Industrial Court, a state of affairs akin to legislative anarchy would be created. Had the Commonwealth Government issued an order stating that the meat-workers should return to work under pre-strike conditions,, the order would have been obeyed. But that would have been a complete flouting of the Queensland Industrial Court. It . would have been' totally at variance with the wishes of the State Government and would have been violently opposed by the employers. Merely because we did not wish to flout other laws that were operating in respect of the matter, such an order was not issued. </para>

                            <para>- Of course he would. The newspapers which espouse political doctrines different from mine would have charged me with having overridden the State Industrial Court and the Queensland Government. The matter does not involve ia return to work at award rates. Apparently, some agreements between the employers and employees have been operating for a period of years, giving to the employees considerable benefits which are not provided for in the award. At least, that claim is made by the employers and the court. The matter does not touch the four men who were dismissed from their employment in a bacon factory. I believe that their dispute could have been settled by the court separately. The Communists, near-Communists, or  Cryptos  - call them what you will - are the very people who have been asking us to step in and override the State laws by saying to the employees, " Go back to work on prestrike conditions ". The dispute is most regrettable. I do not make any apology, nor does the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, for having asked the Meat Controller to see whether personal contact with the parties would produce a better feeling and result in the men returning to work. "We cannot drive men back to work. They are really in. no different position from that of the milk producers who refuse to .supply milk. Men have the right to refuse to work. I admit that it is unjust to the community. In the final analysis, </para>

However, I cannot see why the Commonwealth Government should attempt to override the State Industrial Court in opposition to the State Government, or why we should attempt to override the State emergency legislation.

                        <para>. - The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has taken up an attitude which is characteristic of the Government in its dealings with industrial disputes. He says, in effect, " I am not my brother's keeper ". He went on to say that the dispute was the concern of the Queensland Government, and that he did not propose to interfere. If a different approach had been made to the dispute, if a more conciliatory  attitude had been adopted, and the men had been asked to go back on pre-strike terms, they would have done so. All that, of course,- is a matter for argument, something for' a tribunal to decide. I am not concerned with the details or even the merits of the dispute. What I am concerned with as a citizen of Australia is this : There is at present in Queensland open defiance of the law. The Prime Minister says, " What is the Government to do? " Well, I shall tell him. He should enforce the law. The right honorable gentleman said that the Premier of Queensland had exercised to the full" 'the powers which he enjoys under the ordinary laws, and that he had, in addition to this, declared that a state of emergency existed. That, says the Prime Minister, is enough. He is not called upon to interfere: he does not intend to interfere. He has a ring-side seat, and proposes to sit back, doing nothing. Shall I tell him what more he could do? He could say to this House and to the people: "I am heart and soul behind Hanlon ". The Premier of Queensland has pointed the way that the Prime Minister should go, but the Prime Minister has refused to follow it. He will do nothing: that is his policy. The workers in this instance and in others have been encouraged to strike by the refusal of the Government to enforce the law. When the Parliament was discussing the position on the coal-fields he adopted the same attitude. He said, " I am not going .to put 15,000- or 20,000 . men in jail ". Of course that cannot " be done, but if he had put out the fire when it was but a little blaze there would have been no great conflagration to-day. The Government has not enforced the law. Men have been encouraged to strike, and there is a feeling in Australia that the best way to get something " out of the -employers is to strike, rather than to go to the Arbitration Court. The Labour party's policy is arbitration. Long ago, it turned its back on strikes. At one time, the strike was the only weapon in the hands of the worker, butthat time has long since passed, and law, the most powerful agency in a civilized community, is now at the service of the workers. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Papers which come to me from the Waterside Workers Federation refer to the glorious victories won by strikes, and contrast them with the paltry results of arbitration. Yet arbitration has done more for the workers' of this country than a millennium of strikes could have achieved. No one who has 'taken part in a strike of any duration would deliberately urge upon the worker's such a hazardous and costly course when it is possible under the law to gain their end by peaceful, safe and inexpensive means. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Brennan said yesterday, the action of the strikers in this instance constitutes a gross defiance of the law. Well, what are we to do? Our course is clear : we must muster up enough courage to enforce the law, and prove by our conduct that strikes do not pay. The Prime Minister asks : " What am I to do ". Let him -enforce the law. A formidable list of regulations has been drawn up to deal with strikes and absenteeism in the coal industry, but how many of them have been enforced ? How many men have been fined? Far from the law being enforced, a member of the Government goes about the country encouraging the workers to strike. In spite of this, the Prime Minister says : " What can I do ? " </para>
                    <para>I know that there is an election in the offing, but if the Prime Minister had as much courage as the Premier of Queensland has shown iri the meat workers' strike, he would insist that, once and for all, there must be a showdown, and then we would see who really governs this country. Do the public count for nothing?1 Are the interests of the people of. Queensland' to be utterly ignored? -The Labour Government in Queensland has taken a step which must result- in one of two things: Either the Government will be defeated, and anarchy will reign -supreme, or the law, for which the Labour party stands, will emerge triumphant. </para>
                    <para>The other day I listened to some talk about communism in Australia. And a little time ago the people were treated to -a stage-play put on in order to create the impression that the Labour party was in earnest in repudiating the Communists, but all this left things as they were. Communism still directs the Government and defies the law. Communism is at the back of this strike, as of. every other strike. I have in my office now a list of unions that are controlled by Communists, both in Queensland and throughout the rest of Australia. The Labour party has repudiated the Communists, and outlawed them from the Labour leagues, but that leaves the matter exactly where it was. The Communists still hold the Labour party in their toils. Communism controls all but one of the great industrial organizations of this country. And though that control is master of the political leagues the power of organized unionism in the Labour movement overshadows the political Labour party, whose members dare not act contrary to Communist, commands, and I waited the other day to hear one member get up and denounce the Communists, and wash his hands of the organization, but not one of them did so. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension of time granted.]</inline></para>
                    <para>I support wholeheartedly the motion. Some of the Labour supporters who are interjecting are loud-mouthed supporters of unionism; but they have never done anything for the trade union movement except live on it. Now that unionism has become a great power in Australia, these gentlemen have climbed on to the band wagon, but when I entered the Labour movement there was no band wagon. There was a " black maria " on the one side and a hearse on the other. To be a unionist in those days was to be an  Ishmaelite  - with all doors to employment slammed against you. We built up the Labour movement when our only weapon was the strike. Then there came to us, like a gift from the gods, the arbitration system, which attempts to settle disputes and redress grievances on the basis of justice. We now stand for a fair deal for the workers. If they have grievances the court will redress them. If the court is unsatisfactory, Labour has a majority ' in Parliament, and can alter the law, but we must obey the law, good or bad, while it stands. The Prime Minister would do himself and his party much good if he would now stand up and say to the Premier of Queensland, " I am behind you to thu end ". </para>

                        <para>. - It is obvious to any one who has listened to the speech ' of the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> that he introduced this motion in the hope of making political capital out of the unfortunate position which exists in Queensland. We regret that the strike occurred, but we have no power to cut right across the sphere of the State Arbitration Court and the State Government. The Federal Government is in no way responsible for the strike. We all regret the industrial holdup that is causing so much distress to many people, but we must not overlook the fact that the dispute arose in an industry which is under the jurisdiction of the Queensland Industrial Court. When the trouble started I was Acting Prime Minister and had frequent consultations, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, in which I offered him any assistance which the Federal Government could give. We asked whether there was any way in which the Commonwealth Government could assist to bring about the settlement of this dispute, but the Premier assured us that his Government had the requisite power to handle the situation, and that the dispute had occurred in an industry which was covered by an award of the State Industrial Court, but that if he found subsequently that he needed the assistance of the Commonwealth he would ask for it. I give him credit for his earnest attempts to settle the dispute. Four or five weeks ago he was instrumental in getting the employers to agree on certain points, and he placed proposals resulting from those discussions before representatives of the employees, but they were rejected. He put counter proposals by employees before the employers with, the same result. Later he secured agreement among the employers in regard to individual meat works, such as those at Townsville, Rockhampton and Gladstone, and the abattoirs in Brisbane, whose ' employees were working under agreements in addition to the State award, that if the men went back to work representatives of the employers would meet in conference with representatives of the union and endeavour to iron out their differences, and that any matters upon which common agreement could not be reached would be referred to the appropriate tribunal. It will be seen that from time to time he has conferred with representatives of the employees and employers, and on Monday last he presided over a conference at which both sides were represented. That conference proved abortive, and the Industrial Court has now ordered a secret ballot of the members of the Meat Industry Employees Union. The Leader of the Australian Country party, being in Opposition to-day, says that the Commonwealth Government has done nothing to settle this strike. He says that strong action is required, that we must come out into the open and fight these people. Such generalities get us nowhere. What did he do to bring about industrial peace when he was one of the senior Ministers in the MenziesFadden Government? They had a coal strike on their hands for nearly three months.' They had no remedy. We know that some subterranean action was taken by the right honorable gentleman with a view to settling the coal strike which occurred during his term of office, but that action merely resulted in revelations in regard to the use of secret funds and in the appointment of a roy;il commission to inquire into the matter. That certainly was not strong action. The right honorable gentleman now says, "Let us have the searchlight of public criticism focused on the Government and let us ascertain just what it has done. in respect of. this dispute". The strikes that occurred during the regime of the Menzies-Fadden Government caine within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. But what did the then Government do about them? The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> addressed meetings of the coal-miners and treated them to sharp quips and amusing repartee. Did that settle the strike? Not at all. The anti-Labour Government failed dismally to end the industrial unrest then prevailing. I agree with the Prime Minister's assertion that the use of force and the imposition of extreme penalties when feeling is running high will not get men back to work. T recall that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> was Prime Minister in 1929 he told the people that experience had shown that penalties did not prevent strikes or lock-outs. </para>

                            <para>Dixon, editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Communist Review,</inline> and now assistant secretary of the Communist party, was actually invited by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who was then Attorney-General, to discuss the merits of communism over the network of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Just imagine a conservative Minister holding a responsible position in the government of this country inviting one of the outstanding Communists of Australia to discuss the merits of communism over the radio network of Australia! Was ever such an offer extended by a Conservative Minister to any Labour advocate to debate with his opponents the case for Labour? The fact remains that these people were interested, just as they are to-day, in giving that wide publicity to communism, which in turn, they hoped, would have the effect of disrupting labour organizations so . that they would be easy prey for the opponents of Labour . generally. The policy of this Government in regard to industrial disputes is well known, as, indeed, i3 the policy of all State Labour governments and the Labour party itself. We stand for conciliation and arbitration because we believe that to be the best policy in the interests of the country generally. Honorable members opposite have not made one concrete suggestion which would be of any assistance in ending this dispute. When they were in office, they failed dismally. -When the Leader of the Australian Country party was invited to do so, he skated all round the subject and indulged in meaningless generalities. The right honorable gentleman would have the people believe that if he were in office there would be no industrial disputes. It is an historical fact that considerable industrial unrest has been the aftermath of war. After the first world war industrial unrest throughout the world increased enormously. In Australia in 1918, the year in which hostilities ceased, 580,000 workingman days were lost because of - industrial disputes. In 1919 no less than 6,000,000 working-man days were lost through the same cause. In 1918 in the United Kingdom 6,000,000 days were lost because of industrial disputes; but in 1919 the loss had increased to 35,000,000 days. The United States of America had a similar experience. In 1918 working days lost in the United States of America numbered 509,000. In 1919 the loss had increased to 16,000,000 working-man days. When I was in Great Britain, although the war was still being waged, there was trouble in the coal-mining industry, and in the United States of America upwards of 500,000 men were out of work at that time. Industrial unrest, unfortunately, appears to be world-wide; it cannot be settled by merely waving a wand. Honorable members are obviously trying to exploit the present state of affairs for party political purposes, but the attitude of this Government is clear; it stands for conciliation and arbitration and it has no power to interfere in a State dispute being handled by a State Arbitration Court and a State Government exercising sovereign powers. Endeavours by the Leader of the Australian Country party and the' right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> to link the Labour party with the Communist party, merely because there are some Communists associated with this industrial dispute, will fail to influence thinking people who know, that every State Labour conference and federal Labour convention has agreed that no member of the Communist party will be allowed to join a branch of' the Australian Labour party. The Communists' constitution is different and their methods are different, and no affiliation whatever is allowed between them and the Labour party. Time will not permit me to go into that aspect in further detail, but one has only to look at the 16-point resolution, which was carried by an overwhelming majority at the State Labour conference in New South Wales, to know that the Labour party has no kinship with the Communists. No charge can  be effectively laid against this Government that it is not interested in the Queensland dispute. It is deeply interested and deeply solicitous of the welfare of the Queensland people. It has had frequent consultations with the Queensland Government, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon</inline> has said, "I do not want any help; I am handling the matter under the powers that I have as head of the Queensland Government. I am standing by conciliation and arbitration and will continue to do so ". </para>

                        <para>.- Especially, as a Queenslander, I am utterly dismayed by the attitude of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and his <inline font-weight="bold">deputy (Mr. Forde)</inline> towards the calamitous strike that is paralysing Queensland industry. They have neither condemned the strike nor undertaken to support the Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon,</inline> in his efforts to end it. The last two speakers on the Government side, like Pontius Pilate, have washed their hands of the matter and left it entirely to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon.</inline> They have let Queensland down. That is not the way to settle strikes. The Commonwealth Government must take the responsibility for the industrial lawlessness that has broken out in Queensland, because its policy of appeasement of the industrial outlaws of this country breeds strikes. The Communists, who control the trade unions, work brazenly in fomenting industrial trouble, because they know perfectly well that this Government is so supine that it will do nothing to check them. Why, since December last year, this Government has stood by futilely while the " mercy " ships needed to take food and medical supplies to Java for the relief of the European and other former prisoners of the Japanese have been tied to the wharves. That is bad enough, but, in Queensland, a strike is raging that is the worst in the history of the State and, without doubt, one of the worst in the history of Australia. The deplorable failure of the Government to stand up to its responsibilities in industrial matters - to-day the Prime Minister would not even condemn the strikers - has led us to a pretty pass. I concede that a conference of the Labour party in Sydney did indulge in a bit of sham fighting against the Communists when it carried a resolution dissociating the party from them, but actions speak louder than words, and action by this Government against the industrial lawbreakers, not only in Queensland, but generally in Australia, has been singularly lacking. Consequently the Queensland dispute has been growing in inten sity for four solid .months. Production has dwindled to almost nothing. The situation in Australia contrasts gravely with that in Great Britain where production is exceeding even the wildest expectations of the most optimistic of its Ministers. I direct the attention of honorable members to the following confirmation 'of that in this morning's press : - </para>

                    <para>It is amazing, especially in the face of  that state of affairs in Great Britain, that the Commonwealth Ministry should be so lacking in a sense of its duty as- to wipe its hands of the Queensland crisis and deny the Premier the. powerful aid that it should be able to extend to him to bring the present dreadful situation to an end. Last week 5,600 meat-workers, 3,000 coal-miners and 7,800 waterside' workers were defying constitutional authority by refusing to work, thereby forcing into unemployment about 70,000 other men and women. In my home town of Ipswich the railway workshops are idle and 3,000 hands are "out" because of lack of power and coal. Food urgently required for Great Britain is not available. The graziers and dairymen have lo'st more, than Â£1,000,000. Conferences have been abortive and after months in which it has been unable to restore law and order,' the Queensland Government has declared a state of emergency under which services needed by the people have been drastically curtailed. The sufferings imposed upon the people as the result can be laid at the door of this Government. </para>
                    <para>That the Prime Minister must help the State Government is shown by the fact that the  president  of the meat workers U 111on, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Field,</inline> speaking at Booval, said that the strike was not the last major struggle and that it would probably prove . to be merely the first round. The unemployment' roll is growing daily. Business is stagnating. The necessaries of life are not being produced. Home building is held . up. Transport is nearly at a standstill. Internal and export trade is almost nonexistent. Thirty-five thousand tons of beef promised to Great Britain will not be despatched. How lamentable that is when the food rations of the people of Great Britain are reduced to such a degree that even bread is rationed ! Production is going downhill fast in Australia, particularly in Queensland, because of industrial lawlessness, but this Government will not lift a finger to end it. The women and children of Queensland' are suffering a shortage of commodities worse than that suffered by them .in the darkest days of the war. Even now I plea,d with the Prime Minister to shake -himself out of his lethargy and take active steps to. break the power that the strike leaders have taken to themselves because of his Government's inept handling of industrial matters. The  right honorable gentleman cut a pitiable figure to-day when he said that he could do nothing and appealed to us to suggest what he ought to do. He has surrendered his right- to lead the Government of this country by his failure to stand behind <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon</inline> with the power that he possesses under the Constitution. I remind the. right honorable gentleman that the unemployment relief funds appropriated by this Parliament will be mulct in many thousands of pounds as the result of the present state of affairs, mid that many more thousands of pounds will have to be appropriated to meet the needs, of the men and women who have been forced out of work through the illegal activities of the Communist-led strikers, unless action is speedily taken to force the strikers back to work and thus end the need for the rigid restrictions on production, that have been made necessary by their defiance of authority. No political party that allows itself to be cowed by industrial anarchists into allowing them to deprive men and women of themeans of living, can claim the right togovern the country. </para>

                        <para>.- Thegenesis of the industrial dispute in Queensland is not difficult to discover. The workers are endeavouring to uphold the principle of seniority that workersthroughout Australia have supported for many years. If employees must be dismissed, those who were the last to be engaged should be the first to be discharged. The trouble occurred in Queensland because the employer dismissed men without regard to seniority, and, ' naturally, the employees resented it. Only the strenuous efforts of the Commonwealth Government have prevented the spread of the troubleto other States, with a further loss of production. The Leader of the Australian. Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> derives considerable satisfaction from this disputeMembers of the Opposition always welcome industrial turmoil at the approach of the general elections. They invariably blame the workers; .they never criticize the employers. But employers, as a class, are capable of "pin-pricking" the workers into striking, as happens in the coal- . mining industry. The coal-owners know that they have a diminishing asset. Because of the heavy taxation at the present time, they are not able to make substantial profits from that asset. Therefore, they do not favour maximum production . until taxes have been reduced. </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the Australian Country party exhorted the Government to intervene in the meat industry dispute in Queensland.' The right honorable gentleman considered that the strikers should be punished with the utmost rigour of the law. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> answered the Leader of the Australian Country party most effectively. He asked, whether the right honorable gentleman considered that the workers should be put in gaol. Of course, that would lead only to an extension of the dispute. Before the Government could put all the strikers in gaol, it would need to call out the armed forces, and that would result in serious disorders. The attitude which the Leader of the Australian Country party adopted this afternoon reminded me strongly of the attitude adopted by a former member of his party a few years ago, which earned for him the nickname of " Shoot 'em Down ". In future, the right honorable gentleman will be entitled to the name of " Shoot 'em Down Artie ". </para>

He went to the coal-fields, and the representatives of the men endeavoured to negotiate with the men. He had arranged for the proceedings to be broadcast, but he. was not prepared to allow the miners to state over the air their case in reply to his submissions. As he knows, his meeting was sabotaged. The hall at which he was to speak was empty. I grant that the right honorable gentleman was courageous enough to address the men at the park in which they were holding a meeting, but he was obliged to rely on appeasement. In response to their demands, he appoined the commission that awarded them the pension which they now enjoy, and a shorter working week. </para>

                    <para>Honorable members opposite accused the Government of not being prepared to co-operate with the Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanlon,</inline> in settling the dis'pute. That is not correct. The Commonwealth was told, in effect, to "keep its bib out of it ", because the dispute was a State matter. The Government of Queensland has now proclaimed a State of national emergency. I believe that if the Commonwealth possessed the necessary constitutional powers, it should intervene. But when, at the last referendum, we sought such power, the honorable members opposite opposed the granting of it. When they occupied the treasury-bench, they supported constitutional reform, but when they are in Opposition, they sabotage any proposals for granting to the Commonwealth increased powers. In my opinion, the Commonwealth should have complete authority over industrial matters, and I hope that at the forthcoming referendum the people will confer upon it that power. </para>
                    <para>In what I am about to say, I do not desire to be misunderstood. The Communist party is probably stronger in my . electorate than in any other constituency in Australia; but being a democrat, I cannot agree to the suggestion of the Leader of the Australian Country party that the Communist party should be declared an illegal organization. In a democracy, every individual, has the right to express, without fear of the consequences, his political opinion. Shortly after the outbreak of World War II., the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies,</inline> declared the Communist party an illegal organization. What was the outcome? .The Communists then used as their mouthpiece in New South Wales the State Labour party, headed by the HughesEvans group. That was the only occasion on which their candidates did not forfeit their deposits at an election. In my opinion, the Communist party is blamed for many  thing3  for which it is not responsible. </para>

                        <para>.- The purpose of the motion is to focus attention upon the serious unrest in . industry, not only in Queensland, but throughout Australia. Every one realizes that a serious drift is occurring in industrial matters. The delay in overtaking the housing shortage is largely attributable' to this widespread industrial unrest, and the Commonwealth and State Governments are incapable of grappling with the problem. As the result of strikes, Australian citizens are enduring serious inconveniences. People in Great Britain are hungry because 35,000 tons of beef has not been treated in Queensland since the commencement of the dispute in the meat industry. Livestock cannot be transported by rail from New South Wales to Victoria because of the shortage of coal." Indeed, the whole general movement of goods on the railways is breaking down. </para>

                    <para class="block">When the matter was raised in the House this afternoon the Prime Minister was compelled to break his silence to indicate where the Government stood. What did he' say? Hemade a puerile speech pointing out that strikes occurred in other countries as well as in Australia. He referred to the division of constitutional authority in this country. He said that he was sorry about what was happening, and that he had no doubt that if the employers were willing to do something the strike could be settled. He proceeded to say that the workers of Australia had a grand record. Such statements have been made from time to time by gentlemen sitting on the ministerial bench, and they are, in themselves, an incitement to strikers to defy the law. So long as such speeches are being made by the Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime Minister we shall have industrial unrest in Australia. Not one word fell from the lips of the Prime Minister or the  Deputy  Prime Minister, who is himself a Queenslander, in condemnation of the strikers for defying an award of the Queensland Industrial Court. They did not in any way castigate these people who are dislocating industry and many public services. Not a word was said by either of the right honorable gentlemen which could give the people of Brisbane any hope that theymight soon have something better than candle-light to see their way about their homes. No expectation was given to them that they might soon have improved tram and train services. All we heard was a puerile diatribe against the employers. </para>

                            <para>- If the employers are wrong they will be condemned by the appropriate judicial authority. The point is that this Labour Government, which declares that it stands for arbitration, has absolutely refused to enforce our industrial laws. The position, in short, is that a Labour government is inherently incapable of dealing with industrial un rest because of the association of the political Labour party with the industrial Labour movement. Because of this relationship no present occupant of the treasury bench has any inducement to take a strong stand on an industrial matter. The Prime Minister himself reminded us that he represents a constituency which includes a big coalmining district. The right honorable gentleman knows that if he took a strong stand in regard to industrial unrest in the coal-mining industry he would lose all hope of winning his pre-selection ballot, and if he could not win that ballot he could not remain Prime Minister of this country. The continued presence of the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> in this House is dependent also upon his winning a preselection ballot. All the members of this Government depend upon the result of pre-selection ballots, and they are not likely to do anything drastic against striking unionists. It is just as well for the Australian people to realize that for this reason Labour governments are utterly incapable of taking a strong stand on industrial matters.  If the people want industrial peace they will have to turn the Labour party out of office. A Labourgovernment will never exercise the strength necessary to deal with industrial unrest. The Prime Minister fell back upon the ancient political trick of saying to the Opposition, " What would you do about it ? ". But the party in office should have its own plan for dealing with such a situation. It should not need to solicit advice from the Opposition. I remind honorable gentlemen opposite that a nonLabour government which was faced with industrial unrest, first in the ranks of the seamen and next among the waterside workers, took strong action to terminate the disputes and its actions were endorsed by the electors in 1925 and in 1938. </para>

It is more than strange that this motion should have been launched during a week in which we have got nearer to peace in industry than we have been for a considerable time. I remind honorable gentlemen that the long-standing dispute at the explosives factory in Victoria has been settled this week, and the men have gone back to work. Another long-standing dispute involving the employees of Poole and Steel Limited has also been settled, and the men are back at work. All through this week conferences have been sitting with the object of settling the dispute in Brisbane which is specifically mentioned in the motion before the House. Representatives of the parties concerned, under the chairmanship of the Premier of Queensland, have been sitting for long periods, and only- this morning the Premier issued a statement to the effect that, although the parties did not reach complete agreement yesterday afternoon, the door to settlement had not been closed,, and the parties could again meet round the conference table. </para>

                    <para>This motion has been launched because honorable members opposite fear that they might miss an opportunity to make statements derogatory to the workers of Australia. Let us compare the statements that have been made by honorable gentlemen opposite during this debate with the actual facts of the case. The Leader of the Australian Country party charged the Government with failure to use its power to intervene in the dispute, but everybody who knows anything about the matter is aware that the organization 'involved in it is registered with the Industrial Court of Queensland, and that the workers engaged in the industry are covered by an award of that court. The Commonwealth has no jurisdiction in the dispute, and no Commonwealth industrial machinery exists under which the Government could intervene. </para>

                            <para>- 1 did not interject while the honorable member for Indi was speaking, and I certainly do not intend to become hysterical now. The honorable gentleman knows very well that the Commonwealth has no constitutional power to intervene in the dispute. The Queensland Government has taken action to deal drastically with the men who are on strike. The union concerned has already been deregistered, which means that its members have been deprived of the protection of the court. That is a most serious matter. In Queensland, it should be remembered, the principle of preference to unionists is in force. Every worker who is employed under an award of the Queensland Industrial Court is entitled to preference in employment. But not only has the registration of the Meat Industry Employees Union been cancelled, but also preference, which is of vital concern to trade unionists, has been withdrawn. No reference was made this afternoon by Opposition speakers to these very important facts, and nothing was said about the heavy penal sections of the Queensland industrial law. The fact 'is that the Queensland Government has taken drastic action to enforce the law. These men were working under a State law. Had they been working under a Commonwealth law I have no doubt that Acting Chief Judge Drake-Brockman of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court would have taken cognizance of the dispute and would have intervened himself, or detailed one of his brother judges to do so. Had no judge been available for the purpose, one of the Commonwealth industrial commissioners would have been instructed to take charge of the .matter. However, as the men were working under a State and not a Commonwealth law, the Commonwealth had no authority. The men have broken the State law and they have been punished severely by the deregistration of their -union and the withdrawal of preference. </para>

                    <para>One would have gathered from the remarks of honorable gentlemen opposite that nothing had been done to attempt to settle the dispute, but only the day before yesterday the ham and bacon section of the union, the representatives of the Queensland abattoirs, and also other parties to the dispute who were meeting in conference, agreed upon a formula for settlement, but because the men in the exporting group refused to accept the formula, the conference broke clown. However, as I have said, the door is still open for a further conference. In the meantime, the State Government has taken further action, for it has seized the membership roll of the union and ordered that a secret ballot be held. The ballot-paper shows on the face of it that it was prepared by the State Industrial Registrar for issue to members of the union, who were requested to vote upon the question of whether they were prepared to return to work under award conditions on the understanding that, after their return to work, the four men mainly concerned in the dispute, which involves the interpretation of the seniority rule, should have their grievances investigated at a round-table conference under the auspices of the Industrial Court. The secret ballot is proceeding. </para>

                    <para class="block">Under existing nationality law, an essential requirement for the grant of a certificate of naturalization is that an applicant shall have resided for a prescribed period within the British Dominions. The Territory of New Guinea does not form a part of the British Dominions for the purposes of nationality law, and residence in the territory cannot, therefore, be counted as residence for the grant of naturalization. This means that the only way open at present to a person living in the territory to acquire British nationality, which will be recognized in Australia, or other  parts  of the Empire, is to abandon his domicile there and take up residence in Australia or some other part of the British Commonwealth. The purpose of this bill is  to  enable a resident of the territory to qualify for naturalization as a British subject while maintaining his residence in the territory. The right of the Commonwealth to legislate for the grant of naturalization to residents of New Guinea is not in doubt, as in 1922 the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations, in  reporting on the national status of inhabitants of territories under B and C mandate, under which the Territory of New Guinea was classed, stated -  It is open to Mandatory Powers to whom B and C mandates have been entrusted  to  make arrangements in conformity with their own laws for the individual and purely voluntary acquisition of their own nationality by inhabitants of these territories. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Commonwealth has long realized the desirability of making provision which would enable certificates of naturalization  to be granted to persons resident in New "Guinea who have for a considerable period been much more closely associated with this country than with any other country. </para>
                    <para>The matter of amending the United Kingdom Nationality and Status of Aliens Act to permit of residence in B and C mandated territories to count as residence in  His  Majesty's Dominions for the grant of naturalization was brought before the Imperial Conference in 1923 at the instance of the Commonwealth Government. The conference recommended that the power of granting imperial certificates of naturalization be extended so as to cover persons residing in B and C mandated territories and also in protectorates, and a draft bill was accordingly prepared in 1924 for intro.duction in the United Kingdom Parliament. Although representations were made by the Commonwealth from time to time, nothing was done by the United Kingdom authorities to give effect to the bill until 1926, when a revised draft was submitted to the Imperial Conference held in that year. The revised draft wasapproved by the conference, and also by the Commonwealth Government. The introduction of the revised bill was, however, deferred, as the United Kingdom Government took the. view that with the passing of the Statute of Westminster in relation to the position of dominion mandated territories, certain drafting amendments of the bill were necessary on technical grounds to secure that (a) where the respective dominion parliaments had made appropriate provision for the grant of certificates of naturalization to residents in their mandated territories such certificates should be duly recognized ; and (fe) residence in such mandated territories should be treated as residence within  His  Majesty's Dominions for the purposes of the United Kingdom Act. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth endeavoured to secure the passage of the bill by the United Kingdom Government, but in 1937 was advised that the matter of introducing legislation on the lines indicated was still under consideration and that a decision in regard to it had not been reached. As it 'seemed unlikely that the United Kingdom Government would introduce this legislation at a comparatively early date, consideration was given to the amendment of the Commonwealth Nationality Act so as to extend it to the Territory, of New Guinea as if that were a part of the Commonwealth for the purposes of the act. Cabinet approved of this in 193S. But the Commonwealth Crown Law authorities have expressed the opinion that it is not possible to grant to residents of New Guinea naturalization which would be effective throughout the British Dominions. The Government has decided that the next best should be given to residents of the territory; that is, that they shall be accorded the privilege of qualifying for the grant of British nationality which will have effect in the Commonwealth and its territories. The bill makes that provision. </para>
                    <para>I am confident that all members will share the Government's belief that residents of a territory which for so long has been closely linked with Australia, should no longer be denied the opportunity of becoming eligible to acquire British nationality. I have no hesitation in commending the bill to their favorable considers tion. </para>

                            <para>- They would be regarded legally as Germans, although they are really Austrians, because it has been the practice in this country to regard as Germans everybody who was in Austria even before the Anschluss effected by Hitler in 193S. The only people in this country who are regarded as stateless are those who were so declared by* Hitler when they were ejected from Germany, or those who have been so classified in consequence of turmoil in various countries in Europe. Since 1916&gt; we have had in this country people who were residents of Czarist Russia but are regarded as stateless because they claim that they have never been citizens of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The number of stateless persons in Australia is comparatively small, if we exclude all of those who were driven out of Germany and were refused German passports. The fact that they were refused German passports naturally made them stateless. </para>

We have had to devise a new system in respect of those who were caught up in the cataclysms in Europe during the last few years. The people covered by this bill are mostly missionaries and planters. Some of them have given 38 or 40 years of their lives to the service of this country, in one way or another, in New Guinea, yet are still ineligible to acquire British nationality. During the war period, their lack of British nationality was a danger to them. Had they resided in Australia for five years, of that long term of service in New Guinea, they could have acquired British nationality, which would have been recognized throughout every part of the British Commonwealth of Nations.

A grant of naturalization is not made to. any person in Australia without the approval of the security service. That is an inflexible rule. The same requirement will be laid upon the security service to approve of the applications of any persons in New Guinea, for naturalization under this legislation, when it becomes effective, before any further consideration will be given to such applications. </para>

Technically, any person can be naturalized in this country; but it is' a rule of the department that naturalization shall be granted only to persons of European origin or descent. Persons are admitted to this country if they are substantially of European origin. By " substantially " I mean that persons who are more than' one-half of European extraction - for example, an Eurasian who is five-eighths of European extraction - would be admitted to the Commonwealth and would be treated as though they were persons of European descent. That is the practice of the department, over which the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> presided for a portion of his ministerial career, and over which the honorable member for "Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> ' held sway in the long, long ago when he was a Commonwealth Minister of State. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to answer the honorable member's aberrations in regard to summer schools, or any other subject. I am presenting a bill that has been considered from time to time by many governments of the Commonwealth. It is a- measure designed to do in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea precisely what has been done by the Parliament of the United Kingdom for persons who have resided in Palestine for the required period of five years. Such persons are entitled to naturalization certificates which, while they continue to reside in Palestine, give them all the rights and privileges of British nationality, but once they leave Palestine the certificates no longer have any effect. In this bill, we propose to grant certain limited rights of citizenship, and 90 per cent, of the .persons who will benefit deserve to do so. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, with my permission. As I have previously said no application for naturalization is considered by me unless it has been approved by the security service. I repeat that that is an inflexible rule. ,If an application is so approved, I then consider the other, aspects of the application which affect the suitability of the person .for naturalization. The security service has approved of many applications for naturalization which I have rejected, not because the applicants were subversive or constituted a menace to the security of the Commonwealth, but because they were anti-social in their activities, and had flagrantly disobeyed the law. Most of those who apply for naturalization are given their papers, but the grant of citizenship is not lightly made. I am not concerned with an applicant's political views. I have no doubt that, under our immigration scheme, we shall have an influx of tories who may be nearly as bad as the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> but that will not prevent their being naturalized. I trust that, by this digression, I have been able to enlighten honorable members regarding a subject which is fairly involved, and of great importance. </para>

                    <para>I should like to add that it is not the Government's intention that this shall be the final word on the subject. It is proposed to hold a conference of representatives of the United Kingdom and the Dominions in the near future to discuss certain nationality questions. It is intended to raise at that conference the matter of making provision that residence in New Guinea shall be regarded as a qualification for the grant of a certificate of naturalization which will be effective, not only in Australia- and its territories, but also throughout the other countries of the British Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>That the bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>The object of this bill may be shortly stated. It proposes to give absolute protection against civil or criminal proceedings, for example proceedings for libel, in respect of the publication under the authority of a parliamentary committee  of any document laid before the committee or of any evidence given before the committee. </para>
                    <para>The Parliamentary Papers Act 190S- 1935, which the bill proposes to amend, provides, amongst other things, that no action  or proceedings, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for publishing any document published under the authority of the Senate or the House of Representatives. The act does not apply to publication under the authority of a parliamentary committee, but where the evidence given before a parliamentary  committee is tabled in either House of the Parliament and ordered by that House to be printed the protection given by the act applies. </para>
                    <para>However, when evidence is tabled and ordered to be printed, a large number of copies must be printed in order to meet the requirements of the circulation list for parliamentary papers. For example, upon the .tabling of the report of the Standing Committee on Broadcasting regarding proposed staff regulations for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the number of copies printed was 660. It is considered that the expense of printing the evidence before parliamentary committees as a parliamentary paper is not always justified. As an instance, the Standing Committee on Broadcasting considers that the number of copies of the evidence given before it which, generally speaking, need be printed is about 40. I feel sure that honorable members will agree that where a committee itself arranges the publication of evidence before it with the object of saving public money, it should not be deprived of the protection of the Parliamentary Papers </para>
                    <para> Act. It may be that the publication is already privileged either at common -law or by virtue of section 49 of the Common-  wealth Constitution, but it is considered desirable to put the matter beyond doubt. The bill is 'designed to achieve this object. </para>
                    <para>The bill applies to documents and evidence published after the 23rd September, 1943, which was the first sitting day of the present Parliament, so as to cover certain evidence before the Broadeasting Committee which has been published by the committee since that date. </para>

                    <para class="block">The principal object of the bill is to remove certain disadvantages which have occurred by reason of the delay at' present existing in the examination work, of the Patent Office. That delay has been brought about in part" by the fact that a large number of examiners of patents - representing over 60 per cent, of the staff - were released1 during the war from the Patent Office for service in the forces and in other departments. The delay has also 1 een partly brought about by reason of an abnormal and entirely unpredictable increase of the number of applications for patents. This increase appears to bc largely due to the great industrial de- \velopment which has taken place in Australia in recent years. Many overseas manufacturers discovered during the war that the Australian market was worthwhile, and that they cannot obtain royalties for the use of their inventions in Australia unless they patent them here. In 1939, the number of applications for patents was 5,700; last year it was 7,300; and it is expected that this year the number will exceed 10,000. In passing, I should like to mention that the state of the work in the Australian office is not singular, that the position in the British office is practically the same, and that the state of work in the United States office; is also far above normal. </para>
                    <para>Every effort is being made to obtain the services of additional examiners of patents. It takes, however, at least three years to train an examiner fully in his work, and it is theref ore evident that some considerable time will elapse before any substantial reduction is made of the arrears of examination work in the Patent Office. Any serious delay in the examination of patent applications has a detrimental effect on inventors, and onindustrial development. In the 'first place, .the delay abridges the inventor's rights in his invention because it abridges' the life of his patent, which commences from the date of application. Secondly, manufacturers who desire to embark on new projects do not know of the inventions which may be lying dormant in' the Patent Office and may ultimately interfere with their own developments. </para>
                    <para>The normal procedure in connexion, with an application for a patent is that after it has been examined and passed by an examiner,, it is accepted by the Commissioner and thrown open to public inspection. Any person who considers that he would be prejudicially affected by the application, if granted, may lodgeopposition within, three months. If there is no opposition, or' the opposition is dismissed, a patent is sealed on the application, and that patent dates from the dateof. the. application and runs for sixteen years. The inventor, however,, may not commence any action for infringement until his patent has been sealed, and' then only in respect of infringementsoccurring after the publication of thecomplete specification, which takes placewhen the application has been accepted. The Patents Act contemplates ' that normally an application would be accepted within twelve months and the patent sealed within sixteen months. These times were substantially observed before the war. At the present time, however, publication consequent upon acceptancedoes not take place until approximately two years after the date of. application. The rapidity of technical developmentstaking place at the present day is such that the effective life of many patents i* very much less than the period of sixteen years for which they are granted,, so that a delay of even two years represents a greater proportion than one-eighth of theeffective life of the patent. </para>
                    <para>As far as industrial' development isconcerned - a matter to which the patent system is primarily- directed - delay in publication of specifications leaves manufacturers in the dark, and hampers them in their- developmental activities. Under1 the existing law, a- specification remainssecret and is not published until it" has been accepted. At the present time, this does not, as I have mentioned, take place until about two years after the application is lodged. In- other words, the undue prolongation of the secrecy period is embarrassing to. manufacturers. A partial solution of the difficulties of inventors and manufacturers alike lies in the expeditious publication of complete specifications lodged in connexion with applications for patents. This bill, therefore, proposes to amend the law so as to provide for the publication of complete specifications forthwith after lodgment at the Patent Office, and for a patentee, whose invention has been used after publication, to be entitled to damages for infringement committed from the date of publication forthwith after the lodgment instead of from the date of publication consequent upon acceptance. Damages are, of course, only recoverable if a patent is ultimately sealed on the application and only in respect of valid claims. As a corollary to the provisions referred to, the bill also gives protection to persons who may be threatened with infringement actions by applicants on the basis of questionable .or invalid claims, and prohibits the making of false representations that articles are patented or the subject of pending applications. The bill also proposes to make permanent a practice adopted during the war under the National Security Regulations of not examining- a provisional specification until the complete specification has been lodged. In many cases, applications are accompanied by provisional specifications only and lapse by reason of the failure of the applicant to lo'dge a complete specification. The time spent in examining provisional specifications which may lapse will be saved by reason of this amendment. </para>
                    <para>The passage of the bill will not detract from an inventor's existing rights, but will, in fact, also enable his exclusive rights in his invention to commence at an earlier date. On the other hand, the bill will benefit manufacturers by making it possible for them to ascertain at the earliest possible date what inventions have been evolved by others and are the subject of patent applications, thereby enabling manufacturers to avoid .wasteful duplication of develop- mental activities. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> trust that the bill will commend itself to the House and be passed without delay. </para>

Although the department assessed his nervous disorder as' attributable to war service it refused to grant a pension on that ground.

His  father has approached me and  complained about the treatment meted out to his son and made grave charges against certain people at the reception  house in Sydney where the ex-serviceman was declared insane.

As you know the hoy was kicked in the head playing battalion football and for a long period suffered from amnesia and his papers were endorsed *' B2 : for mainland service only ". You will be surprised to know that when his discharge on medical grounds was ultimately decided on, he was in an operational area in Wewak, New Guinea. </para>
                        <para>The next thing we heard about the boy was when a letter from the Red Cross was received stating that he was a patient in the 114th Australian General Hospital at Goulburn and asking us to call and give them some information. My wife called in and was asked some frivolous questions; I went to Goulburn and was there informed that the boy was suffering from nervous disorder and was having shock treatment. When I asked why it was we were not notified that he had been there for at least a month, I was told that the Army did not inform relatives unless it was a matter of life and death. The Officer Commanding also told me that my boy was' discharged on man-power grounds, and it took your letter to his wife to make him realize that ho did not know what he was talking about. The boy was discharged in. August in a very bad state of nervous disorder, without a pension. He secured a position with a firm in Sydney, where he gave great satisfaction. In January last he was knocked from a lorry down an embankment and fractured his elbow. He was under treatment by compensation doctors for about sixteen weeks then a bone specialist was called in and it was decided to operate. Although it should be known to the medical profession that the giving of a general anaesthetic usually had a deleterious effect on a patient who had had shock treatment, and although it was pointed out to them that he was such a patient, he was given a general anaesthetic. The operation was a success physically and a fair amount of movement of the joint has eventuated, but as I anticipated, his mental condition was worsened and the nervous disorder returned. At this time it was brought to my notice that he had a printed form from the Repatriation Commission stating that he was under the care of the repatriation and a medical man had been appointed locally, and at -any time his' services were to be available. As my son's condition did not improve, I took him on the 7th June to see a doctor and he decided to place him in a repatriation hospital. Late in the afternoon he was taken by ambulance to 113th Australian General Hospital. From now on what I am going to tell you would be what you would expect to read in the pages of a Frankenstein horror magazine and would not be expected to be enacted in this so-called democratic country. </para>

She clothed him suitably and naturally, considering she is seven months' pregnant and greatly upset by this latest development, persuaded him to go back to hospital. When you consider that he said he had walked from the hospital without any foot covering and then walked back again after being suitably clothed, you can imagine what condition he must have been in. </para>

                            aunt visited him at 113th on 10th June, and was informed that he was to be moved to 101 Australian General Hospital at Punchbowl the following day. The distressing feature connected with 113th is that his Returned Soldier's Badge (his most treasured possession) was stolen from his coat; he asked that it be recovered and returned to him, .but up to date we have heard nothing of it; also some of his clothing that he took to 113th is missing. On Wednesday morning, 12th June, his wife rang Punchbowl and was informed that she could see her husband at the Reception House that afternoon. Even in the condition she is in she went to the Reception House at. Darlinghurst, and was informed that he was to be sent to Callan Park; she came home and told me on Wednesday night. Knowing that, the repatriation have a lot of patients in the cottages at Callan Park I was not too much disturbed, but all the same did not like the admission to the Reception House at all. On Thursday, 13th June, I visited the Reception House at 2 p.m. I saw my son and was informed by him that he had told the staff he wanted to get in touch with his' father; they ignored his frequent requests. I made inquiries and was 'told that the boy had requested to see me, but they did not believe him. I then asked both

He looks well a'nd is well cared for. He reiterates that hehad repeatedly asked the staff at the Reception House to get in touch with me and they told hi in to keep quiet.

It is amazing that he should- have been certified' as insane with out the knowledge of hrs parents, having regard to the fact that within, at the most, a. couple of hours, contact with them could have been made by telegram- or a ' message sent by taxi. It appears that he has been the victim of gross negligence if he has been placed iii an asylum as insane without anything having been done to notify his family of what was contemplated.  His  family has given magnificent service to this country. The- father fought overseas in the 1'914-18 wa-r and the four brothers in this war. They can look with pride on their achievements. They are entitled' to every consideration,, not the thankless- sort of treatment that this- boy has apparently received from the authorities. I ask that the Minister order an immediate investi-gabon. Â©f all the circumstances- of theissue of the- certificate. The doctors' should' be asked to1 explain on what grounds they issued the certificate, in view of the patient's- medical record. The authorities at the reception house should also be asked to explain their part.

                            <para>- No ; this ' matter was brought to my notice.' The honorable member concerned in this matter is a barrister. So far as I am aware he has never been established in this industry, and therefore could not have had a base year of trading on which the 1 per cent, quota could be established, or a licence to import watches to the value of Â£2,700 a year granted. I take it that this figure would represent the invoice price of the goods, and that the total sum involved in general trading would be considerably more. . If my' assumption be correct that this honorable member has never been engaged in this line of business, why did he receive, preference over other ex-servicemen ? </para>

                            <para>- Then my case cannot be sustained, and the honorable member's name will be cleared. I am sure that is what he most desires. I point out that under the Government's reestablishment scheme an ex-serviceman is not assisted to establish himself in an industry with which he was not associated prior to his enlistment. Honorable members know quite well that an ex-serviceman seeking a re-establishment loan must prove to the Repatriation Department  that he has' been previously engaged in the industry. The point is that these  licences were issued under a specific ruling, namely, that the quota should be 1 per cent, of the importations of the base year. Why has the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> been given preference over other ex-servicemen, and over legitimate merchants in this line of business who not only have been refused increased quotas, but also have had their quotas reduced ? </para>

                            <para>- That is common knowledge. I also know that the quotas were reduced, as the honorable member may ascertain for himself by making inquiries from the department concerned. Compare this case with' the circumstances surrounding the re-establishment of ex-servicemen in industry generally. An ex-serviceman who wishes to become a dental mechanic is_ refused vocational training in this work becau.se, according to the Repatriation Department, there are too many dental mechanics. Similarly, a man who wishes to be trained in the printing trade is told that there is no position available for him because he is over 21 years of age. and cannot join the printing trades union. Also, instructions have been given to the rehabilitation section of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction to the effect that no applications will be granted to enter the. boiler-making, .blacksmithing, electrical, and some sheetmetal trades. On one hand the men are being refused an opportunity to be trained in certain jobs, and on the other this member of Parliament, a barrister by profession, who has not previously been engaged in this trade, . and who is certainly not a merchant, is granted an import licence. I can regard that as only the grossest form of distinction. A member of the Parliament has received consideration far exceeding that extended to any other citizen. I do not know whether the honorable member has been a merchant. By profession, he is a barrister. I do not know whether he proposes to establish himself in business, or continue as a legal practitioner. </para>

The honorable member for Watson is a barrister. If he were given a licence to obtain a number of briefs, the matter would be entirely different; but he has been granted a licence to import watches, and that presumes that he was formerly in that particular calling. If he is not a merchant and does not intend to forsake the legal profession, this House should know why he has been granted permission to import Â£2,700 worth of watches. </para>

                    </continue><para>Recently, the Government amended the National Security (War Service Moratorium) Regulations, thereby causing considerable confusion in the building industry. The purpose of the amendment was to permit ex-servicemen to apply to the courts for the right to enter unoccupied homes. It was said, and I have no doubt with a great deal of truth, that there were many unoccupied homes in Sydney, and, indeed throughout Australia, and' that homeless ex-servicemen should have the right to seek permission to enter them. Unfortunately, careless drafting of the </para><para class="block">Amendment  has resulted in an extraordinary condition of affairs. The effect is that an ex-serviceman may apply for the right to enter any house now in the course of construction, even though the builder is under contract to a buyer. The person who has contracted with the builder for the erection of the home for himself- must appear before a magistrate  and  state reasons why the ex-serviceman should not take possession of it. Private builders who 'erect homes for sale, are placed in a most difficult position. They are endeavouring to accommodate large numbers of homeless people,, and assist the Government with its housing programme. It is only by the sale of homes that they build that they are able to continue in thetrade. Most of them are " small " contractors, and when they sell a home, they  are  able to establish credit to purchase more building materials. The position now is that before they complete the erection of a home, an ex-serviceman applies for the right to enter it, and, if he is successful, the builder becomes a landlord instead of a vendor. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Yes. One builder in the eastern suburbs of Sydney informed me that he was erecting five houses under contract. He has already received three notices to appear at the Paddington Police Court to show reason why those homes, upon completion,- should not be made available to persons other than those for whom he has contracted to  build. He informed me, "that apart from time wasted in attending the court, I have to pay the legal costs,  and may find that I have become a landlord. My affairs are such that I cannot afford to be a landlord. I must either continue to build homes, or go bankrupt ". Thousands of builders throughout Australia are in a similar plight, and the natural result of this amendment of the regulation will be that home construction will be slowed down. Contractors will not build homes when they may be prevented from selling them. I know that the Government is deeply concerned about the matter, and is inquiring into the situations. It did not intend that -the regulations should  have this effect. Magistrates are postponing the hearing of applications of persons for the right to enter homes in the hope that the Government will quickly amend the regulations. Therefore, I urge the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> and the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> who, I know, is concerned about the matter, to grant relief to builders who are endeavouring to overcome the housing shortage. </para>

                    <para>The second claim by the honorable member for Wentworth was that, when provision was being made for assistance in the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen in  the watch trade, all members of the trade * had their import quotas reduced by 33-j per cent. That is true, but at that time they ..were enjoying a quota of 150 per cent, of the imports in their base year. The reduction of 33-\ per cent, was made to ensure that they would still be receiving 100 per cent, of their base-year imports. The third assertion of the honorable member, which is totally incorrect, ' although he may not have been aware of it, was that these quotas were given only to base-year importers. The opposite is the case. The quotas were given to ex-servicemen who were not base-year importers. That was the basis of the ministerial ruling in the first instance. </para>
                    <para>With regard to my being a member of the legal profession while also an importer of watches, I have to say that I am a member of the legal profession, but I have been unable, since my discharge, to secure chambers in which I could practise. My plight _ in that regard is no different from that of a large number of the members of the bar in New South Whales. There is a great lack of office accommodation in Sydney suitable for them. I thought it would be desirable for me to enter a trade, as many other members of the' New South Wales bar have done. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> is in no better position in that respect than I am, from the point of view of legal ethics, a.nd certain members of State parliaments who are members of the bar are similarly engaged. I consider that I was not acting improperly in applying for an import licence to assist hie in the importing business in which I am engaged. The importation of watches is not the only activity of the business. It is not necessary to obtain special licences or quotas for the importation from the United Kingdom of. such goods as crockery and ceramic ware, and I see no harm in pursuing a. trade of that nature. </para>
                    <para> The honorable member for Wentworth, who is always pointing to the returned soldier's badge, and saying how much is being done by the Opposition for ex-servicemen, will, no doubt, make an attempt to justify the bringing into Australia by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Packer, managing director of Consolidated Press Limited, of a quantity of furs from non-sterling countries. This was done without application being made to the Department of Trade and Customs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer</inline> did it " off his own bat ", because he had sufficient money for the purpose. I do not think he would have relied on his war service to be treated as an .ex-serviceman. The honorable member for Wentworth claims to be an ex-serviceman of World War II., although I believe that his military work was confined to his duties as a liaison officer with the American forces in Sydney. How does he justify the bringing into Australia of furs, which are prohibited imports, unless obtained by importers holding base-year licences? Was action taken by the department to confiscate those furs, in view of the fact that the regulations provide that if such goods are imported without a licence they must be immediately confiscated? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer</inline> had a scream head-line in  the press this morning about my activities, and declared that the accusation against me had not, been made because of a desire to gain party political capital from it. The honorable member for Wentworth claims to be jealous of the privileges of this House, and anxious to give honorable members an opportunity to express their, views, if they had any doubt" in their minds. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer</inline> published an article headed " Labour M.H.R. given a Licence to Import Watches ". Had I been an anti-Labour member of this chamber, probably nothing would have been heard of this matter. </para>
                    <para>I shall not allow members of the Opposition, acting on behalf of vested interests in particular trades or industries, to run mc or any other ex-serviceman out of business. When the watches which I shall import reach Australia, they will be sold at a price slightly below that fixed by the Prices Commissioner, as a protest against the blackmaarketeering which has been practised in this trade. I hope that I have cleared, up any doubt which honorable members may have as to whether I still hold a quota import licence. I do, and I -propose to' avail myself of it as long as I am able to do so. As for the honorable member saying that, as a member of the bar, I ought not to engage in a trade, perhaps he -will explain why a gentleman posing as a barrister has canvassed from door to door among homes and flats at Double Bay. This man came to my mother's flat, at Double Bay, soliciting subscriptions at 2s. 6d. each from persons willing to join the Liberal party. If advantages have been obtained by reason of the quota system in connexion with import licensing, and the continuance of the Division of Import Procurement, firms which support the Opposition politically have mostly derived those benefits. Recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Arthur Moore, Director of the Division of Import Procurement, after having been as generous' as he could " get away with " in his treatment of firms such as Sydney Snow Limited and David Jones Limited, has now been paid off by receiving employment with those firms. That happened just after he returned from abroad after an absence of several months at the expense of the Commonwealth. I have nothing to hide in regard to this matter, but I believe that some honorable members of the Opposition are not in that position. They have much to hide in respect of their administration of departments when Ministers and in connexion with other matters, also. If there are to bc explanations, let their explanations be as full as possible so that we shall know where every honorable member in this House stands. Should there still be some lingering doubts in the minds of honorable members opposite regarding the transactions with which I arn concerned I shall be glad to remove them at any time. I base the- justification for the granting of this licence to me on the fact that I am an ex-serviceman, and have not been given anything to which other servicemen are not entitled. </para>

                        <para>. - I bring to the notice of the. House the harsh manner in which an airlines company operating in northern New South Wales has been treated by the Commonwealth Government and the Government of -New South Wales. North- Western Airlines Limited commenced an airline service on the 14th March, 1938, connecting Moree, Tamworth and Sydney. The company consisted of between 300 and 400 shareholders in the Moree district of New .South Wales. For three years it operated until it was compelled to close down after the war had continued for about eighteen months. During the period of its operations the company's machines flew 305,000 miles and carried 2,3S7 passengers without any accident whatever. The company commenced operations without a government subsidy, and conducted a service between the places mentioned, with three stops on each journey. When the service closed down in 1941 in order to assist the war effort the company was supplying transport to Sydney from Moree, Tamworth, Inverell, Narrabri, Quirindi and Scone, and received a subsidy from the. Government. It had to build its own aerodrome at Moree, and during wet weather passengers had to be transported to the aerodrome by means of a three-horse buckboard, because the local municipal council refused to build a road half a mile in length to the aerodrome. Efforts ' to have a town aerodrome established prior to the commencement of the service met with no success, and therefore the directors decided to provide ' an aerodrome. Accordingly, they purchased the necessary land, erected hangars and offices and put down gravel runways, so that a service could be provided in all weathers. For other towns, aerodromes were provided by government grants, but that was not done for North - Western Airlines Limited. I understand that when that company ceased operations it was given an assurance that it would be granted a licence to continue the service after the war. Since the 19th July, 1945, the company had been endeavouring to purchase an aircraft and was given an assurance by  the De Havilland Company that it could purchase a new seven-passenger De Havilland aircraft in England, delivery to be given at Mascot in four months, but that it was necessary first to obtain ministerial approval. Although the company sent representatives to Melbourne and (Sydney and, in addition wrote to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully),</inline> the Minister for. the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> and the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford),</inline> as well as to the Department of Civil Aviation, it could not get any satisfaction; it has not yet been granted a permit to purchase an aeroplane.

                    <para class="block">The point is, that the Butler Transport Company has been allowed to purchase Douglas aircraft, whereas North- Western Airlines Limited has been -prevented from purchasing the De Havilland aircraft which it required to operate its service. It would appear that a great injustice has been done to this latter company. The facts almost demand a special inquiry by a statutory body, with a view to determining whether there has been any underhand work, or any bribery and corruption. It would seem that, for some reason, the Butler Transport Company is receiving much more favorable treatment than is being accorded to North- Western Airlines Limited, which sacrificed everything  during the war by making available its aircraft, pilots and the whole of its equipment for use in the war effort, whilst the Butler Transport Company continued to operate its air services in New South Wales. I hope that the Minister for Air will look into the matter, and will ensure that justice shall be done to . NorthWestern Airlines Limited. </para>

                        <para>.- The Government, in making very liberal provision for the payment of a war gratuity to ex-members of the fighting services, has laid it down 'as a matter of general principle that the gratuity shall not be payable in cash for a period of five and a half years from the termination of hostilities. That, generally speaking, is a wise provision in the interests of both the ex-serviceman and the community. Many ex-servicemen will have deferred pay coming to them, and that will enable them to settle down until the economic conditions of the country become stabilized. They will not be the victims of unscrupulous people such as those who preyed upon ex-servicemen of World War I., the war gratuity of many of whom was whittled away, whilst others became indebted to money-lenders. The Government has made certain exceptions to the general rule, one exception being that an ex-serviceman who desires to acquire a home may obtain financial accommodation through approved lending institutions, including the Commonwealth Bank and the Rural Bank, and have his war gratuity applied to the reduction of his indebtedness. Many ex-servicemen are waiting to take advantage of that provision; but it appears that it. will not operate until there has been compliance with various formalities. Many cases have come to my notice lately. Quite recently, an ex-serviceman applied for assistance to the Rural Bank, only to find that the officials of that institution did not have any application forms, or any information to guide them, in the transaction of such business. I ask the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> or whoever is dealing with the matter, to expedite the procedure, so that those who are waiting may proceed with the purchase or erection of a home. In other cases there is warrant for the liberalization of the provisions. I refer particu-' larly to elderly ex-servicemen. A constituent . of mine who served in World War I. and World War II., in the latter for about five years or more, is now about  63  years of age. His wife is  67  years of age. Because of sickness in his family, and other heavy expenses which he has had to incur, he desires to obtain immediate payment of his war gratuity. He is precluded from borrowing for the purpose of acquiring his own home, because most of the lending institutions will not make advances to elderly people on account of the possibility of their being unable to complete the repayments during their lifetime. This man has a grandson, aged twelve years, -for whom he has undertaken to care and provide, his parents being dead. Immediate payment of his war gratuity would be preferable to withholding it for five years, at the end of which time he might not be alive to enjoy it. Another ex-serviceman,  60  years of age, who had been in one of the services for some time, has reared a family of ten children, seven of whom are still dependent on him. Because of his age, he finds it difficult to obtain employment, private employers not  being willing to engage men of an advanced age who may become entitled to ' the payment of worker's' compensation. He was in the upholstery business employed before he enlisted, and now desires to establish himself in that business on his own account. He has obtained some contracts, but needs a little money.  His  war gratuity amounts to only  Â£30,  and the immediate payment of it would not have any effect upon the general -scheme, whereas it would be of considerable advantage to him at a time when he badly needs it, by enabling him to provide himself with necessary facilities: He applied to the Repatriation Commission for a grant under the provision which relates to ex-servicemen conducting business enterprises on their own account. The Commission, after an inquiry, decided that as he had not been employed on his own account previously he had not the necessary experience and knowledge to branch out independently now. He is quite willing to have his war gratuity set off against any grant or loan that may be made to him by the Repatriation. Commission. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The purchase of furniture is in much the same category as the acquirement of a home, because it is a necessary part of a home. It would be far better for an ex-serviceman to apply his war gratuity to this purpose than . to borrow, from a money-lender or to enter into a hire purchase agreement involving the payment of a high rate of interest. Such cases call for the liberalization of the conditions under which the war gratuity may be payable immediately.' </para>
                    <para>The Government has widened considerably the benefits obtainable under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, thanks to the recommendations of the committee "of which the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> was the  chairman.  I believe that that act has been very sympathetically administered during the regime of this Government. But in all acts of that description anomalies are bound to occur. An instance that came to my notice recently relates to an ex-serviceman of the last war who is a constituent of mine. This man enlisted in the last war, but, because at that time troops were not being sent to France, he was sent to New Guinea where he served for one year and  191  days. He is now  55  years of age, and because of ill health he has been obliged to relinquish his employment with the Tramways Department in Sydney. He is now unemployed. Had he served in a theatre pf war in either the last war, or World War I. he would be entitled to a service pension, but the Repatriation Department has ruled that he is not entitled because he did not . serve in a theatre of war. I am surprised at that ruling. When the repatriation legislation was last amended I studied the provisions of the bill carefully, and I was under the impression that the definition of theatre of war inserted in that legislation applied to World War I. as well as to the last war. In fact, that provision was con.siderably liberalized, some servicemen who did not even leave Australia being, in certain circumstances, classed as having served in a theatre of war. In reply to this man's application the Repatriation Commission wrote - </para>

                    <para class="block">This case discloses an anomaly, because . in the last war New Guinea and islands in the Pacific were considered to be theatres of, war.' In World War I. this man suffered the rigours of the tropical climate and life in the jungle as a soldier in New Guinea. Surely, he is as much entitled to a service pension as any soldier who served in the Pacific Islands during the last war, and certainly more entitled to it than those men who did not even leave Australia, but, because of particular circumstances, are entitled to it. However, I am sure that the Government, which has shown its preparedness to approach these matters in the light of experience, will give sympathetic consideration to cases of this kind, and at the earliest opportunity effect an appropriate amendment of the legislation to cover such cases. </para>

                        <para>.- I take this opportunity to refer to anomalies arising under our repatriation legislation. I know that I have raised these matters repeatedly on previous occasions, but I make no apology for doing so again. I do not care who derives the credit for any adjustment to rectify anomalies. I am glad that the honorable member for Reid' <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Morgan)</inline> .and the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">,(Mr. Daly)</inline> have particularly dealt with the subject which I am about  to  raise; and I hope that as the result of representations by honorable members on both sides of the chamber the  Government  will take, heed of these matters. I do not say that the anomalies are the Minister's fault, but he is partly responsible for the unsympathetic treatment in cases of the kind I shall mention. I agree with the honorable member for Reid that this legislation, which was intended to give justice to the serviceman, and which has been improved from time to time,, is still deficient in many respects. Servicemen realize that fact. It is not a political matter. I ask honorable members opposite to co-operate with honorable members on this side of. the chamber in our endeavours to have anomalies adjusted. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I refer first to the dependent parent's pension. The rate  of  this pension was  reduced by the Scullin Government during the depression. I do not throw that up 'at the present Government. The reduction was made of necessity; but whilst other classes of pensions have been restored in full, the pension payable to dependent parents has not been restored. All of us know of parents who believed that pensions would be payable to them automatically upon the death of their sons in the services. I know of- two sons, with one of whom I served in this war, who were killed within a period of a few weeks. They were the only children in their family. Their parents enjoyed a very small income, the husband receiving a retirement allowance after long service with a business firm. When these parents applied for a dependent parent's pension, a local police officer was sent to their home to investigate their affairs, and because it was found that approximately Â£4 a week was coming in to the home they were told that they were not eligible to receive the pension. They had to fill in a very humiliating application form similar to that which applicants for the old-age pension must present. They should not be treated in this way. If, for example, the sons of these parents had not volunteered, or if they had' served only in the forces at home, they would be living in comfort 'to-day. But now,' after the sons' allotments have ceased, they are told by the Government which has always said that it is grateful to the servicemen, that they are not eligible to receive the dependent parent's pension if they own property to the value of Â£400, although it may be only unusable land, or if they have an income over the old-age pension limit. In order to obtain a pension they have to prove to the commission that they are practically destitute. Do honorable members consider that that is fair treatment of the dependants of men who have given their lives in the defence of this country? </para>
                    <para>On previous occasions I have forcefully criticized the administration of the "War Service Homes Department, particularly the failure of the Government to build up a stock of building materials in order to enable the department to undertake a building programme immediately following the conclusion of hostilities. Many people are unjustly excluded from registering for a home. They are not even given a chance to have their names placed on the list of those eligible. I. have in mind the case of the widow of a serviceman. I am sure that honorable members do not know that a willow i3 ineligible for a war service home if she possesses only a few hundred pounds and her only income is a pension, whereas a widow who is affluent, even a <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> widow, can register for a war service home. But the legitimate widow of a serviceman, who may possess only a few hundred pounds and her widow's pension, after a searching examination by an official of the War Service Homes Department, is refused a home on the ground that she is not a good risk. Under this system the person who is most in need of help is refused assistance. I read from a letter written by the  Deputy  Commissioner to the widow of an air-gunner whose brother also was killed - </para>
                    <para>Your application for assistance to build a home has been carefully considered, but I regret there is no alternative than to decline it since, unfortunately, the income- in your own right cannot be regarded as sufficient to warrant the Commission's making you an advance under the War Service Homes Act. </para>
                    <para>The provisions of the act make it incumbent upon . the Commission to ensure that each applicant has reasonable prospects of being financially able to fulfil the obligations which would be imposed by any security to be entered into, and which would include not only payment of principal and interest by monthly instalments, but rates, insurance and maintenance costs. </para>
                    <para class="block">Does it not astound honorable members that a young widow with the burden of rearing children and in need of a home is refused a war service home because she is not in affluent circumstances? In a letter to me that widow's sister, also a war widow, writes - </para>
                    <para>It seems ridiculous that a girl has to be debarred from owning her own home and making one for her child simply because she has not sufficient income. How, might I ask, is she to acquire an income when she has a child to look after or maybe even two. The pittance these  girls  are asked to live on isn't, and never will be, enough to run a home on, so isn't it time, either the Government or the people of Australia saw to it that they got enough? Surely their husbands' lives are worth more to -their country than this. </para>
                    <para>How can they afford- to buy a home on Â£3 7s. Cd. a week! It's impossible isn't it and yet to my way of thinking the girls with the least income should be the ones to be helped first. Their reasoning just doesn't make sense to me. </para>
                    <para>You may quote my sister-in-law's case in Parliament or to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lazzarini</inline> and most definitely to the Minister for Repatriation. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Minister for .Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Frost)</inline> is familiar with such cases. A deputation representing war widows awaited upon him to discuss them, and he had no answer to give except to point to the act. That was months ago, but still nothing has been done to effect an improvement. Surely the Government must feel some sense of responsibility when the way in which the act' is being administered has the effect of driving widows into poverty. In the case I have cited, the widow had Â£500, and was receiving a pension of Â£2 10s. a "week. If that is regarded by the authorities as insufficient security, the Government should increase the pension. Personally, I believe that a pension of Â£2 10s. a week is not enough for the widow of a man who has lost his life in the service of his country. </para>
                    <para>The entitlement tribunals are charged with the duty of reviewing the cases of applicants who have been refused pensions, but it is a very difficult tribunal to interview. Some time ago, I was approached by a man who had been discharged from one of the services on medical grounds, but he was refused a pension, and was living in poverty. He was fit when he enlisted, and now is anything but fit, and has undergone two operations. When he was refused a pension he applied for a hearing before the Entitlement Board, and was again turned down. I was so sorry for him that I went myself before the board with him. Let it be understood that if it is difficult for a member of Parliament to get a hearing before the Entitlement Board, it is much more difficult for Private Smith or Gunner Jones. The board seemed disposed to' reconsider its finding, but the claim has not yet been settled. I have here a letter from the wife of a man who has been fighting a claim for years,, and the board has decided at last that he is entitled to a pension. Now he must go through all the procedure again in the way of medical examinations, and his wife recently wrote to me in these terms - </para>

                    <para>I am pleased to say that my husband's appeal to the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal was successful, but instead of bringing relief it has only led to more anxiety, as he is now being required to submit to a further series of medical examinations, which I fee] is more than is really necessary. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is in line with the case mentioned by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly)</inline> in which a man who had been refused a pension was shortly afterwards declared insane and committed to Callan Park. A few years ago, I appeared before the Entitlement Tribunal on behalf of a man who had been held as a prisoner of war by the Turks at the same time that I was myself a prisoner. He became so ill that he was exchanged by the Turks, and they made very few exchanges. Subsequently, his widow applied for a .pension, but was refused. I went before the board myself, and was able to have the decision reversed. Medical testimony was that the man had died from such and such a. cause, and outside specialists were asked if that condition was likely to be the result of war service. That is .the sort of question which members of the tribunal ask doctors, and, of course, the doctor can  fairly say that the condition could have arisen from other causes. Had. I not been there to say what I knew of the case the widow would not have received a pension and she and her five children would have suffered undue hardship. I know of another man who had been badly beaten in captivity; he was practically a mental case and was receiving 100 per cent, pension when he died in .a remote hospital.  His  widow has tried unsuccessfully to get a pension, and although I have written in her behalf the board has refused to reopen her case as his death is claimed to be not due .to war service, and no further relevant evidence is available. The Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, which is a beneficent measure, and is liberal in many respects, yet permits such unjust anomalies as these. </para>
                    <para>Under the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act, an unemployed ex-serviceman in receipt of a war pension of, say, 25s. a week, has the amount of his pension deducted from the 27s. a week which he is entitled to receive as an unemployed person. This provision does not apply to persons who are receiving income in similar circumstances from other sources - from a friendly society, for instance. "When the bill was before the Parliament, I moved, an amendment to this provision, and the Minister in charge of the bill promised that he would see what he could do to adjust the matter. I should like to know whether it has been adjusted. </para>

                            <para>- Well, an anomaly still exists, because persons receiving payments from other sources do not have the amount deducted from, their unemployment relief pay, whereas ex-servicemen receiving pensions do suffer a reduction. In my opinion, the Entitlement Board might well be abolished and the cases ' be allowed to come before a court, where the parties would receive justice more expeditiously. If the Government wishes to have the matter investigated so that the deficiencies and operation of the act can be authenticated, let it call a conference with all the service organizations concerned. The servicemen and dependants generally do not want charity, but only a fair deal. Many of them defy their disabilities and make no claim for a pension; but others who cannot help themselves should get the pension it was intended they should receive, according to the measure of their disability or hardship, but which is often denied them by  regulations. As an alternative to a conference, the All-party Soldiers Committee should be reconstituted. I was overseas when ' that committee sat previously or I would have placed some of these matters before it. Undoubtedly, the committee did valuable work in increasing the rates of pension, but it failed to adjust these -anomalies which I bring to the notice of the Government in the hope that something will be done to rectify them in the very near future. <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr. POLLARD</inline> (Ballarat) [10.36].- An announcement was made last week that the Government in its wisdom had decided so to liberalize the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act as to bring within the ambit of pensions eligibility approximately 114,000 additional people. Recently I had occasion to visit the headquarters of the Pensions Department in Melbourne, where I was astonished to see the staff crowded into rooms which, from the health point of view, were shockingly inadequate. I was so shocked that I asked to be taken round the whole of the office accommodation, with a view to ascertaining whether what I saw at first glance was a general indication of the position throughout the whole of the building occupied by the department. I ascertained that not only was there general overcrowding, but that it was even worse in some sections than in the section I first visited. If 114,000 additional people are to be brought within the ambit of the invalid and old-age pensions legislation, it must be obvious that the departmental staff will have to be increased, and that the accommodation at present available will be more inadequate than ever. I hesitate to think what would be the effect from the health point of view if. an increased staff were housed in the existing accommodation in Melbourne.  It seems strange that on the one hand the Government should make available for the relief of sufferers from . tuberculosis an amount of Â£250,000, while on the other hand it creates within one of its own departments the very conditions in which the tuberculosis germ thrives. I bring this matter before the Government in the hope that prompt action will be taken to ensure that the Melbourne staff of the department is more adequately housed. I trust that the Minister in </para>

The position in Melbourne is, I am afraid, also repeated in the other capital cities. The need for an improvement of the accommodation in the Melbourne office is particularly urgent, because I noticed young people in the twenties or early thirties, an age at which they are most susceptible to infection from the dread tuberculosis germ, constituted a large proportion of the staff 'there. </para>

Alice Springs is 1,000 miles north of Adelaide, and Tennant Creek lies another 320 miles north, beyond the railways terminal. Ten years ago the miners at these two centres as the result of my assistance in the House were successful in defeating influential mining interests represented on the Stock Exchange in Adelaide who sought to prevent the area from becoming a miner's field. As the result of pressure exercised by me and by the local miners upon previous governments, three batteries were established in the Tennant Creek district. During the war, however, this Government decided on some extraordinary methods of developing Central Australia by producing wolfram. It tore the machinery out of two of these batteries and carted it to the wolfram-fields 200 miles away. </para>

The people of Central Australia are so incensed at this arbitrary action that the Government will always be held in contempt by them. Quoting from memory, figures supplied" to me by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> who looked after my interests while I was away, no less than Â£250,000 was expended on the wolfram project and only Â£37,000 worth of wolfram was produced from the field. Chinese, who were inexperienced in min-  ing and who could never hope to be experienced, were brought from Nauru to work the field, and its direction was put in the hands of people against whom the sinister insinuation is made by the people  whom I represent that they went there in the hope of eventually dominating, not only the wolfram field of Central Australia, 'but also Tennant Creek. It is to the credit of my honorable friend that under his pressure the Government hurriedly appointed him to lead, a commission to investigate the conditions at the wolfram field. It is because of his intuition and exact knowledge that compensation is being paid to the wolfram miners. </para>

                            <para>- My complaint is about the way the job was tackled and against  the- people who were put in charge. I demand to be told why the miners at Tennant Creek were hunted away and the big El Dorado mine was left unmolested. Why were the big people not hunted away, too? I  Want  an answer. That is plain language. I am a man of few words, but easily understood. The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson),</inline> a. miner him-' self, has been to Tennant Creek. Yet he has not rehabilitated it. In view of his experience, I am amazed that he should have allowed his leg to be pulled by the people who want to concentrate all activity at one battery. I admit that he was advised by the Director of Mines at Alice Springs. I admit also that  centralization means less  cost.  Diesel oil can be brought from Darwin. But centralization suits only the gamblers who want to concentrate the miners in one  place at week-ends so that- they may bleed them. That does not suit the women. Neither does it suit the individuals- who want a .battery 16 miles out and another 27 miles out. The Minister was good enough "to -tell me that he would do nothing a'bout Tennant Creek until they have held a plebiscite on the battery question. </para>

I must admit that the Minister ' for Supply and Shipping ' has tried to do his best, but he has been too late every -time, because the Minister for the Interior has not conferred with him. All the -satisfaction that the Minister for Supply and Shipping has been able to get has been apologies and statements that " it will not occur again ". There is insufficient co-operation between the Ministers concerned in Northern Territory matters. It is a disgrace that men isolated in the Northern Territory who are trying to develop that area are not given priority in the purchase of goods disposed of by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. Another matter is that because the Tennant Creek area was not prescribed as a " war area ", the Government will not replace the equipment that was stolen from the miners. Therefore, I urge the Minister to get busy. The difficulty is that he is administering so many activities that he cannot possibly devote his full attention . to the Northern Territory. </para>

There are other prospectors working out on the field, but no authentic information is available. There are shows being pegged. Quite a number of lease-holders are on the field who are engaged for wages, and are not able to get out and work their shows, owing to the shortage of finance to carry on for an indefinite period before ' being able to have their ore treated. There are a few lease-holders who have plant . and equipment awaiting better crushing facilities before starting work.

He is interested only in the " hillbillies " and " rat-bags " in the industrial areas. Unlike the honorable member, I take a broad national view. These miners at Tennant Creek are not " hillbillies " or "rat-bags". They will' be the strongest bulwark against the sovietization  of the Northern Territory. They did not sign the petition that the Minister for the -Interior produced to rebut the petition that I presented to the House. They are individualists, and will still be engaged in the gold-mining industry long after this Government has ceased to exist. Of course, the Government hopes that these miners will go out of business, and the ore be provided by such mines as El Dorado. </para>

                        <para class="block">I have now given to the Minister details of the events at Tennant Creek since the miners returned a few months ago. I have also complained of the lack of action on the part of the department. Apart from the request for the rehabilitation of the three batteries, there is another urgent matter, namely, the necessity to provide a complete water supply for Tennant Creek. Honorable members may not be aware that Tennant Creek has an annual rainfall of only 10 inches and if a dam were constructed in the hills, the supply would not be adequate for the requirements of the town.Actually, water for domestic consumption in the town ship must be carted a distance of 7 miles at a cost of from 7s. 6d. to 10s. a 100 gallons. Water obtained from the bores is not fit for domestic consumption. In the circumstances, the residents of Tennant Creek advocate the provision of a water supply at, Attack Creek, a distance of 40 miles north from the town and situated at the southern end of the BarklyTablelands near Rockkampton Downs station. This area has an assured rainfall. At Mount Isa, in the north-western portion of Queensland, a dam which was built on Rifle Creek has been filled only twice because of the low rainfall. That dam can be filled only once in about seven years, but if the dam which I propose for the supply of water to Tennant Creek were constructed, it would be filled every year. I shall not discuss the report which the Minister for the Interior read recently regarding the development of Northern Australia, because I have secured the adjournment of the debate on that matter,but it seems to me that he is running away from the known in endeavouring to get a blue print of the unknown. Before the Minister proceeds with a fantastic scheme for the development of Northern Australia, I urge him to make the rehabilitation of the Tennant Creek area a No. 1 priority job. </para>

                            - Four thousand tons of table margarine manufactured from coco-nut oil are already being produced on behalf of the British War Office. A further 1,000 tons were offered to London in May, but have not yet been accepted. It is expected that an additional 1,500 tons of margarine can bo made available, if required, to the British Ministry of Pood by the end of this year. In addition all supplies of table margarine Â» declared as surplus from Australian Army stock are offered from time to time to the Ministry of Pood and disposed of according to its instructions.

                            - The International Emergency Fowl Council, allocated to Unrra for supply from Australia 5,000 tons of soap. The United Kingdom advised its approval of this. Tenders for supply of the first half of this amount are about to be called. In addition the Commonwealth Government is offering to make available to England 5,000 tons of soap for direct purchase. The amount of tallow involved. in these two allocations is approximately (5,000 tons. If the United Kingdom accepts the offer of 5,000 tons it will directly assist the edible fat position there, as it is understood that quantities of edible fats are being used in the United Kingdom for the manufacture of soap. Tin's would not be the case with soap from Australia, which is made from inedible tallow. The position regarding edible animal fats in Australia is very serious and the majority of industrial margarine factories which supply the bulk of fats used for shortening for all industrial purposes are operating on a very reduced scale. In fact, the largest plants arc  to-day  supplying only 30 per cent, of the quantities which they supplied in 1942. In these circumstances the Government has not agreed to release any commercial quantities of edible fat for export to the United Kingdom, although it is not restricting the export of fats in gift parcels, &amp;c.

                            - As a result of the cancellation of the Australian allocation of 8,000 tons of peanuts from India, which was intended for oil expression, and the improbability of alternative oil being supplied in the near future from overseas sources, we are unable to make any positive contribution to the world position in this regard. In fact the Commonwealth Government is at present considering the diversion to the production of peanut oil of half of the Queensland peanut crop which would normally be sold on the Australian market. This will involve considerable Government expenditure by way of subsidy in view of the disparity in prices between peanuts used for ordinary consumption and peanut butter and for oil expression.

                            - A survey was made recently of the present and estimated future production of factory butter in Australia during 1940. There is every indication of a striking improvement in the over-all production, which is expected to reach the figure of 100,000 tons. After making provision for known demands by the Australian services, the  British  Admiralty and the British War Office, together with requirements for Australian civilian consumption and other export orders approved by the British Ministry of Food, it is anticipated that at least 05,000 tons of butter will be available for shipment to the United Kingdom during this calendar year. This quantity compares very favorably with the 45,300 tons shipped during 1943, 40,136 tons during 1944, and 40,647 tons during 1945.

                        <para>Owing to the excessively high prices which were being paid for pigs in Victoria in May and June of last year, representatives of certain sections of the industry requested the Controller of Meat Supplies to police markets in order to ensure that prices be related to the prices determined by the Commonwealth Government under the pig-meat plan. The Controller of Meat Supplies endeavoured to obtain the services of a competent independent man to carry out these duties, and ultimately accepted a recommendation from a committee of bacon  curers  and exporters that Mr. J. M. Wilson, a pig-meat exporter, be appointed. Mr. Wilson took up duty on the 10th June, 1945, and ceased duty on the 19th July, 1945, a period of less than six weeks. He carried out his duties to the complete satisfaction pf the Controller of Meat Supplies and at financial loss to himself. I am unable to understand, why the honorable member has raised this matter twelve months after the person concerned ceased duty with the meat control organization. </para>

                            <para>The practical application of these trials is a matter principally for the State Departments of Agriculture and for individual station owners. The Commonwealth, through the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, will continue to give the assistance of which it is capable. Had. those in opposition to the referendum proposals of 1944, particularly in Queensland, not been so successful, the Commonwealth would have had, for a term of years at least, powers and responsibility of the more direct sort which the United Graziers Association of Queensland have in mind. In fact, the Commonwealth has no such powers. </para>

                        <para> - On the 20th June the honorable member for Griffith (Mr. Conelan) asked whether the report of the Board of Inquiry set up toexamine the conduct of courts-martial and detention barracks had been received. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I understand that the boardhas completed the final draft of the court-martial section of its report which is now being typed. The final draft of the section of the report dealing withdetention barracks will be completed within a few days, and the typing of that section will then be undertaken. I understand that the report is a lengthy one and that typing, editing and assembling will take some weeks, before which the report cannot be made available. </para>
