                            <para>- I have not given particular thought to whether or not the gold holdings ought to be disclosed. The statistics are prepared by the Commonwealth Bank, and the Treasury neither gives any direction nor makes any suggestion in regard to the manner of their compilation. The Commonwealth Bank is, of course, required to conform to the law as it has been laid down by this Parliament. I do not attempt to interfere in regard to the information which it furnishes. I shall, however, arrange to have an inquiry made, so as to ascertain whether there is a special reason why further information should not be supplied. </para>

                <para>I shall preface a question to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General by a brief explanation. Each day the Australian Broadcasting Commission broadcasts a number of news services, including reviews and commentaries, anddoubt sometimes arises as to the fairness of the comments. One commentator, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> D. Black, who is employed by##'## the commission frequently as a news commentator, and for school broadcasts on public, affairs, said recently that he regards histask as being to insinuate ideas into the minds of his listeners. I now ask whether the Minister will arrange that copies of all news broadcasts, reviews and commentaries to be made over national stations shall be made available for inspection by members of Parliament, preferably by having them placed on the table of the Library? </para>

As that answer does not contain the information which I sought, I now ask the Minister whether recruiting for the first month of the campaign was stopped after only eight days, and, if so, why? </para>

                                <para>- Had the honorable member brought this matter to my notice earlier I could have given him a more detailed reply. I know that a complaint was made by the troops at Lae that certain things had happened contrary to what they expected as the result of statements made regarding the movement of troops. Upon becoming aware of the complaints, I immediately despatched the  Deputy  Adjutant-General, Brigadier Campbell, to Lae to inquire into complaints that officers were being brought out in preference to other men who considered that they were more deserving, and to find out whether troop movements were in accordance with the arrangements that had been made. Brigadier Campbell arrived at Lae on Wednesday morning last, and I expect to receive his report before long. It is the policy of the Government to honour, in the letter and in the spirit, all promises made to the troops as far as possible. Sometimes ships are delayed for one reason or another. In one instance, a ship was scheduled to go to Lae to remove troops, but because all the Japanese had been removed from Faroe Island, the ship was diverted to pick up Australian soldiers who had been doing garrison duty there. As a result, the arrival of the ship at Lae was delayed. I assure the honorable member that the matter to which he referred is not being overlooked. </para>

I had such inquiries made as it was possible for Treasury officials to make, and last week I received a detailed statement on the subject, but I think it will be necessary to have the matter examined by the Commonwealth Actuary. </para>

                        <para>- I have already made inquiries, and have learned that there is no substance in the allegation that machines which are still useful are being destroyed or broken up for scrap. It is necessary to protect the public against imposition. It is not unknown for##'## persons to buy up what is virtually scrap material in the form of worn-out machinery, then to repaint it and palm it off on to people, particularly in country districts, as being of much greater value than it really is. These machines have done a great deal of war work and are considered by competent judges to be of no further use. Such parts of the machines as may be used in some other way have been taken from them, and only parts that have no further use have been discarded. That is a protection to the public, and I consider it to be the right and proper procedure to take. </para>

                        <para>- All that I can tell the honorable member about the matter is that an agreement was made with the Dutch Government, through the Dutch Minister, that the distribution of foodstuffs in the Netherlands East Indies would be completely in the hands of the British Command in the Netherlands East Indies or of agencies approved by the British Command. The presence of an observer to see whether that arrangement is properly carried out does not seem to me to be a matter for the Dutch Government at all. What the Dutch Minister objects to is the suggestion that an observer should sail on a Dutch ship. That objection I share with him. </para>

Then it will be the subject of a Cabinet agendum and a decision will be made by the Government.

When a decision has been made by the Government it will be announced in the usual way. </para>

                        <para>- I have not had an opportunity to read the complete report which the honorable member made to me and which I tabled. Some representatives of the Australian Government are now in Germany whilst others are on their way to Germany. These officers are examining some of the aspects mentioned by the honorable member, and their inquiries concern the particular plant he has mentioned. The value of industrial equipment which we anticipate receiving from Germany in respect of reparations will not exceed ##Â£##2,000,000. I do not know on what basis that valuation has been made. Of course, we shall  also receive capital goods as a part of the reparation arrangements. The particular plant mentioned by the honorable member would have to be dismantled and this would involve the destruction of much structural work, whilst two, or three, large ships would be required to transport the plant to Australia. Ships will not be available for many years for that purpose. The honorable member has suggested that the Government should consider obtaining blue prints of this plant in case it may be thought desirable to erect similar plant in this country. Inquiries are being made into##'## that proposal. ##'## </para>

Can the Minister now give the reason why this large quantity of tyres was burned at Morotai, bearing in mind the serious shortage of tyres in Australia? Further, if motor tyres and motor trucks are available could not the Government make representations to the Government of the United States of America to permit these valuable and necessary articles to be made available even at cost to Australia which is so badly in need of such goods ? </para>

                        <para>- I have no recollection of any representations having been made by the Premier of Queensland to myself, that being the usual channel through which such a request would come. If an application for assistance be received, naturallyan inquiry will be made into the extent of the damage, and whether it is desirable for the Commonwealth Government to make a contribution towards meeting the losses caused by the floods and to relieve necessitous cases. If the representations do come through that channel, they will be given every consideration. </para>

Does the Government propose to resume all land reverting to it with a view to settling ex-servicemen on those areas? In explanation, I point out that many ex-servicemen desire to settle in the Northern Territory. Does the Government propose to give those men an opportunity to do so? Does it also propose to clip the wings of those great monopolies there? </para>

A considerable number of leases will fall due this year and next year. Those leases, of course, are subject to the existing ordinance, which gives certain rights to the present lease-holders, provided they elect to make certain improvements. But I am hopeful that sufficient leases will be available in the Northern Territory to satisfy the applicants to whom the honorable member for Bendigo referred. </para>

If a member of the Opposition secures the adjournment of the debate on the motion ##"## that the papers be printed##"##, and the subject is placed on the notice-paper, it may exclude the whole of this matter from the debate on the earlier motion. I should like an assurance that this will not happen. For the Minister to make two speeches on this subject is bad enough. I should welcome an opportunity to make two speeches myself, and I should like to know whether I shall be able to do that. </para>

Honorable members will recall that, at San Francisco, in June last, the delegates of Australia signed the Charter of the United Nations. The Charter was subsequently approved by this Parliament and its ratification by the Australian Government was signed and sealed at Canberra on the 4th October last. The ratification was deposited in Washington on the 1st November, on which date Australia formally became an original member of the United Nations. All of the 51 signatories have similarly ratified the Charter. With the coming into force of the Charter, the way was open to translate a written constitutional document into a living and active institution and, certain preparatory work having been already accomplished, the General Assembly was called into session in London on the 10th January. </para>

                <para>Organizational Tasks</para>
                <para>As this was the first General Assembly, a great part of its work was organizational in character. On the one hand it was necessary for it to organize itself so that it could exercise its functions. For example, it had to establish its own committees, decide on the methods by which its business should be conducted and lay down its rules of procedure. On the other hand, it was also necessary for the General Assembly, as the only fully representative organ of the United Nations, to perform certain acts in order to bring the other principal organs into existence. For example it had to elect the non-permanent members of the Security Council and all the members of the Economic and Social Council and of the International Court of Justice and it had to establish the regulations under which the Secretariat is to be appointed, </para>
                <para>A great deal of this organizational work was perhaps not so much in the public eye as some of the other matters that came before the General Assembly, but, in assessing the importance of the recent meetings, it is no exaggeration to say that the success of the first part of the first session, and the happiest auguries for the future of the United Nations, lie in the fact that this essential organizational work was done smoothly and effectively and, for the most part, without contention or controversy. In a sense, this work was an act of faith - a practical manifestation by the nations that they intend to make the organs of the United Nations work and have a clear idea of the way in which they wish to see them work - and in this act of faith every one of the United Nations joined. All were equally trying to build a sound structure. </para>

                </para>

The Executive Committee of the Preparatory Commission, consisting of the representatives of fourteen nations, including Australia, met in London last August and worked steadily for over three months preparing agenda, drafting rules of procedure, staff regulations, and plans for the functioning of the various organs. Their work went on almost unnoticed, in committees and  sub-committees,  day in and day out, while other political issues were occupying the public mind ; but the detailed technical work done by this committee, composed of persons expert in the field of international relations, had a considerable influence on the orderly inauguration of the United Nations. The report of the Executive Committee was submitted to the Preparatory Commission of 51 nations, and the Commission carefully examined the report and passed it on, with some amendments, to the General Assembly. The substantial parts of the Commission##'##s recommendations have now been approved either by the General Assembly or by the other organs and- so have passed into the structure of the United Nations. </para>
                <para>Australia can find some satisfaction and pride in the fact that it was one of the fourteen nations privileged to serve in the Executive Committee and that its delegation, under the extremely able leadership -of the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> made a positive contribution to the work of that Committee. I should also like to inform the House of the very high standing of Australia##'##s prestige in the councils of world affairs. The Minister for External Affairs has contributed a magnificent part in placing Australia in a foremost position, and his -administration of this high and responsible office has given a new significance and import to the place this country occupies in the esteem and goodwill of other nations. Similarly in the Preparatory Commission, which met for a month in London immediately before Christmas to receive the report of the Executive Committee, the Australian Delegation led by Lieutenant-Colonel Hodgson, Australian Minister to Paris, played a notable part, </para>

                <para>The whole of the work of the first part of the first session of the General Assembly is reviewed in some detail in a written report by the delegation, which I have tabled. This report includes an account of the steps which the General  Assembly  took to establish itself, and the other principal items on its agenda, together with the text of the resolutions adopted, whilst among the appendices are reproduced the more important states ments made by the Australian delegates. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> do not propose to go over the same ground in the same detail in my present statement, but it may be of interest to honorable members if I were to refer briefly to some of the more outstanding events. </para>
                <para>First, there is the election of Australia for a two-year term as one of the nonpermanent members of the Security Council. As was mentioned by the Minister for External Affairs, an attempt was made before the election by some of the major powers tq arrange an agreed list of candidates for election to the six vacancies, and it appeared that various other groups of powers having interests in common, were prepared to, accept such a list of candidates on the understanding that the candidate or candidates favoured by their group would be supported. The view taken by the Australian delegation was that the criteria for election to the Security Council, are clearly laid down in the Charter - first, the contribution of nations to the maintenance of international peace and security, and, secondly, the equitable geographical distribution of seats - and that members should apply those criteria in casting their votes. </para>
                <para>Australia was not included in the lists which were being handed around, but, on instruction, we formally notified other delegations that we wished to be considered. In seeking support, the Australian delegation did not bargain with any other delegation nor did we express an opinion regarding the claims of any other candidate. We based our case, first, on the fact that Australia##'##s record in two world wars showed that it was a nation which had contributed to security and, second, on the necessity, in view of the importance of the Pacific in future world security, of having a representative of that region on the Security Council. The proposed list of candidates made no provision for the representation of the Pacific among the non-permanent members. </para>
                <para>Our action was justified by the fact that a majority of the General Assembly supported us. It was an accidental but nevertheless unfortunate result of Australia##'##s candidature, that it should have been brought into a direct contest with Canada for the last vacancy on the Council. After three ballots the position was that Australia had 28 votes and Canada 23, but neither had obtained the necessary two-thirds majority. To end the deadlock, Canada withdrew in our favour. This gracious gesture was immediately acknowledged by our delegate. In conformity with our instruction, the delegation had supported the nomination of Canada as well as that of Australia right down to the final ballots, believing that Canada##'##s war record, too, had marked the sister dominion as a ##"## security ##"## power. </para>

                </para>
                <para>In the elections for the International Court of Justice, Australia, for the first time in its history, had nominated a candidate, Professor K. EE. Bailey, Professor of Public Law in the University of Melbourne, who had- been a member of Australian delegations to the San Francisco Conference, the Preparatory Commission, the General Assembly, and other international gatherings. It is a tribute to the high personal regard in which Professor Bailey is held in international circles that, in the circumstances, he should have come within a few votes of election. ##"##What chiefly militated against him was that several delegations were firmly of the opinion that the Anglo-American system of law would  be sufficiently represented by three members on a bench- of fifteen, and when, in the first ballot, eminent representatives of the United Kingdom, the United </para>

                <para>Another most important decision was the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Trygve</inline> Lie, of Norway, as Secretary-General. The Secretary-General has to be nominated by the Security Council and appointed by the General Assembly. Under the interpretation of the Charter given by the five permanent members of the Security Council, the nomination of the Secretary-General required the concurrence of these five powers. It therefore became necessary to find a name that was acceptable to all five. In private discussions ##'## various names were- mentionedand eventually it became apparent that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lie</inline> would be acceptable. to all of the Big Five.

Australians will have a natural desire to see a due proportion of our citizens taking .part, as members of the Secretariat staff, in the work of the United Nations; and the provisions of the Charter in regard to the recruiting of staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible give an assurance that a number of places will be available to Australians. </para>

                <para>The sixth of the principal organs of the United Nations, the Trusteeship Council, has not yet been established. The difficulty is that under the Charter the Trusteeship Council is to consist of representatives, in equal numbers, of states which administer and states which do not administer trust territories. Therefore, it is impossible to set up the council until a minimum number of trusteeship agreements have been concluded and approved by the General Assembly. After various proposals had been discussed, involving some issues not immediately concerned with the organizational task of bringing the Trusteeship Council into existence as early as possible, the General Assembly . adopted recommendations, the effect of which is that the states administering territories now held under mandate have been invited to take steps for the conclusion of agreements on the terms of trusteeship in respect of such territories. On the conclusion and approval of  these agreements by the General Assembly, preferably not later than the second part of the first session next September, it is expected that there will be a sufficient number of trust territories to enable the Trusteeship Council to be constituted. </para>
                <para>As the Minister of External Affairs has already dealt with other aspects of trusteeship, particularly as they affect territories administered by Australia, I do not propose to touch on any but the purely organizational aspects of this matter. </para>

                    <para>Other important decisions taken by  the General Assembly concerned the location of its head-quarters and its budgetary arrangements. After prolonged debate and a certain amount of contention, it was decided to locate the permanent head-quarters in the United States at a site to be selected in the ##"##Westchester and Fairfield districts on  the  border of New York State and Connecticut. Recommendations regarding the exact site and precise area will be made to the General Assembly next September after further studies by the Head-quarters Commission, of which Australia is a member.  Until  the permanent headquarters have been developed - and estimates of the period range from two to five years - the temporary head-quarters will be in New York City. The position taken up by the Australian delegation in debating this question was in favour of a site in the United States, preferably in the vicinity of San Francisco. We differed from some other delegations in. believing that a more thorough examination of the subject, and ##'## a careful consideration of all relevant factors, should have been made before a particular region or site within the United States was designated; but, the majority having made the choice in favour of New York, mainly because of its relative nearness to Europe, we acquiesced in the decision, and will co-operate in establishing near New York a head-quarters that will be such as to allow the United Nations to develop and to carry out its great responsibilities in favorable conditions. Australia is a member of the Head-quarters Commission that has been appointed to make further studies and report to the General Assembly in September on the requirements at the head-quarters. </para>

This provisional budget will come up for review at the September meeting, in the light of experience in the intervening months. In order to finance the first year##'##s expenditure, a Working Capital Fund of 25,000,000 dollars will be established, and members will be asked to contribute to it in accordance with a temporary assessment, based on the scale used for the - Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Australia will be asked to pay 2.875 per cent, of the total advances. This quota is subject to adjustment when a permanent scale has been adopted, and amounts paid to the Working Capital Fund may be set off against future contributions if the General Assembly should later decide that it is not necessary to maintain the fund at its original level. An Expert Committee on Contributions, on which Australia is represented, has been established to make recommendations regarding a permanent scale for the assessment of contributions. </para>

For example, the work ##"##which the League is still doing in regard to the control of narcotics should be continued without a break, and the library which the League possesses will be of great service to the secretariat and  members of the United Nations.

Other nonpolitical functions and activities will be subject to selective transfer after examination by the Economic and Social Council, but in the meantime certain activities, such as control of dangerous drugs; will be carried on provisionally. The material assets of the League of Nations will be taken over by the United Nations on or about the 1st August, 1946, valued at their original cost to the League. Shares in the total credit established will be distributed among states which are entitled to participate in accordance with percentages to be fixed at the next meeting of the League Assembly, which, it is expected, will be held early in April. Shares of members of the League which arc members of the United Nations - and Australia is such a member - will be credited to them in the books of the United Nations, and the General Assembly will decide on the purposes to which these credits will be applied.

The question was immediately asked whether . the system of world security, which had been so carefully planned and written into  the Charter, would now be of any effect. Numerous other questions, ethical as well as political, were raised by thoughtful men in all countries, who saw the discovery as the beginning of a new era in human history.. At the same time the great possibilities of applying atomic energy, not for destruction but for the advancement of material welfare, were- foreseen. Numerous related problems of raw material supplies, location of industries, and the value of resources developed in a pre-atomic age, immediately came to mind. </para>
                <para>The General Assembly, after only a brief discussion, .adopted a resolution sponsored by the five permanent members of the Security Council and by Canada, to set up an atomic energy commission, whose function will be to proceed with the utmost despatch, and inquire into all phases of the; problem, and make such  recommendations from time to time as it finds possible. In particular the commission is charged with making- specific proposals to extend the exchange of basic scientific information for peaceful ends, to control atomic energy to the extent necessary to ensure its use only for peaceful purposes, to eliminate atomic weapons from national armaments, and to provide effective safeguards by way of inspection and other means to protect complying States against the hazards of violations and evasions. The commission will report to the Security Council and will be accountable to the Security Council for matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security. In appropriate cases the reports will be transmitted by the council to the General Assembly and the members of the United Nations as well as to other organs. Australia, as a member of the Security Council, will be .a member of the Atomic Energy Commission during the next two years. </para>

                    <inline font-style="italic">Urgent Problems Arising from the War.</inline>
                </para>
                <para>Among the urgent current questions in which the General Assembly was asked to make decisions were several arising immediately from the war, namely, the plight of refugees, the reconstruction of devastated countries, contributions to Unrra and the fear of impending starvation in many countries. </para>
                <para>The debate on refugees revealed differences in view as to the seriousness of the problem and the principles to be applied in solving it, one of the main differences being between those who wish to compel refugees to return to their country of origin, and those who believe that, if a refugee has valid objections to doing so, he should not be compelled to go back. The General Assembly asked the  Eco-  nomic  and Social Council to examine the whole problem and make recommendations to the second part of the first session next September. The Economic and Social Council acted promptly and appointed a committee of twenty members, including Australia, tq commence the examination of the problem and report to the council in May. </para>
                <para>Following a debate in the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council has also been asked to place the problem of the physical reconstruction of devastated countries on its- agenda as an urgent matter. The subject has also been listed for further consideration at the September meetings of the General Assembly. </para>
                <para>A resolution drawing attention to the critical state of the work of Unrra and urging members to make a second contribution to Unrra of 1 per cent, of national income was introduced by the United Kingdom delegation. The General Assembly decided to appoint a committee of ten members to consult with the signatories of the Unrra agreement who have not made or arranged to make their second contribution, and to urge upon, them that they make their second contribution with the least possible delay. Before the close of the General Assembly the Australian delegation was authorized by the Government to announce that Australia would make a further contribution to Unrra, subject to agreement with Unrra as to the goods to be supplied. </para>
                <para>A resolution was##'## adopted unanimously by the General Assembly drawing attention to- the world grain situation and urging emergency action to conserve grain and make it available for human consumption. The debate revealed an appalling prospect of starvation in many lands, and a strong appeal was made to all countries to take concerted and coordinated efforts, both for humanitarian reasons and to maintain order and stability and allow reconstruction to proceed. Several grain exporting countries, including Australia, placed before the General Assembly the facts concerning grain stocks and possibilities of shipment. Speaking for the Australian delegation; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beasley</inline> promised that both the Government and the Australian people would contribute in whatever way they could to overcome the present shortage and check the spread of famine. </para>
                <para>Adjournment</para>
                <para>On completing its agenda, the Genera##]## Assembly adjourned until the 10th September next, when the second part of the first session will be held. It is expected that the agenda of the second session will contain a great proportion of items related to current world problems, although some organizational matters, such as the budget, the head-quarters, and several questions relating to the secretariat, will also have to be completed. </para>
                <para>On the whole, the work of the first part of the first session has been encouraging. I should like to take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to the excellent work that was achieved by every member of the Australian delegation. I cannot speak too highly of the. manner in which each member devoted himself to his duties, which at times proved a serious strain and required long hours in the preparation of material, as well as other inescapable tasks. In every instance the co-operation given w.as extremely valuable. </para>
                <para>It is a memorable fact that, within a year from the date on which invitations were first sent out to the peace-loving nations of the world to attend a conference at San Francisco to consider the establishment of a new international organization, that organization has commenced work. In face of any momentary discouragements, we should recall this achievement as an indication of the continuing unity and determination of the 51 members of the United Nations in responding to the world##'##s need for peace. The important fact to remember at all times is that these 51 nations are now working together within the framework of a great institution dedicated to international co-operation. </para>
                <para>Besides leading the Australian Delegation to the General Assembly, I had the honour of representing Australia at the meetings##'## of the Security Council which were held in London at the same time as the meetings of the General Assembly. Under the provisional rules of procedure adopted by the Council, the presidency of the Council rotates monthly among the members in the English alphabetical order, ##'## and it therefore was my great honour to be asked to preside, as the delegate of Australia, over the  meetings  of the Council during the first month of its life. </para>
                <para>That was an exceptionally difficult month for the Council. In the first place the Council had to establish itself and organise its work so that it could discharge its functions under the Charter. In the second place it had to handle some exceedingly delicate current problems which- were brought before it under Chapter VI. of the Charter, which concerns the pacific settlement of disputes. The Preparatory  Commission  had worked out in detail provisional niles of procedure for the General Assembly, which was able to adopt them provisionally a,t the very start, and to act under them throughout. In the case of the .Security Council, however, no rules had been prepared for dealing with matters under Chapter V,I. of the Charter. The idea was that these matters were so delicate that it would be wise to leave the Security Council itself to draw up its rules when it was fully constituted. The result was that the Council had to work out its rules <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc,</inline> as it went along, taking each step as the need arose. The task is still far from complete. A committee of experts was at work during the first series of meetings, and was to meet again before the Council reassembled in New York to-day. </para>
                <para>The Veto</para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-style="italic">Since</inline>
                    my return to Australia I have been asked questions about the use by the Soviet delegation of its ##"## veto ##"## to prevent a majority of the Security Council from adopting a resolution about the withdrawal of French and British troops from Syria and the Lebanon. The voting rules laid down in the Charter for the Security Council are certainly both complicated and controversial. They were adopted at San Francisco only, after long debates. My colleague, the Minister for External Affairs was by general consent the leader of those who thought that the voting formula was unsatisfactory. I should like to quote what he said at the conclusion of the debate. It still stands, and goes to the heart of the problem -
                </para>
                <para>I can only hope that during the next few years the Great Powers will demonstrate to the world by their actions in the Council that they will not in practice exercise to the full the veto rights which they possess under the Charter. Certain public indications along these lines have already been made, and we all accept these indications thankfully and in good faith. If it can be agreed that all peaceful means of settling disputes must be adopted and exhausted, and that in practice the veto will not be used to block such procedures, I am convinced that we will make a great step forward.This would remove many of the doubts which the middle and smaller countries have felt regarding acceptances of the present text . . . The Great Powers can perform a great service to the world if they demonstrate in practice that the powers given to them under the Charter will be used with restraint and in the interests of the United Nations as a whole. </para>
                <para>The San Francisco text is there, and we must work under it as it stands. It means that the Security Council cannot adopt a resolution on any matter of substance whatever, unless all the five permanent members vote in favour of the motion, and at least two of the six elective members. Obviously, if any of the permanent members were to use their legal powers, as an everyday practice, to prevent a majority of the Council from adopting a resolution with which they individually disagreed, the Council could easily be paralyzed altogether as an instrument for effective international conciliation and the peaceful adjustment of situations that are likely to endanger international peace. </para>
                <para>Our experience in London has shown three rather encouraging things: First; that, even without any formal resolutions at all, the Security Council is a valuable forum for consultation and discussion. The more the frank exchange of views on important current international questions takes place in the Security Council, instead of at informal or secret meetings of the former belligerent States, the stronger will the Charter system become. Even though no motion is carried the discussion can make clear to the States concerned how their actions are regarded by other States - in a word, can express world opinion on the matters in hand. Secondly; that even if a permanent member of the Security Council can and does prevent a majority of the Council from adopting a resolution dealing with the substance of the matter in hand, means may nevertheless be found of expressing the sense of the Council on the merits of the issue. An illustration of this is the statement made by myself, as  President,  by common consent, in closing the discussion on the Greek question. Everybody agreed that in this case no formal action was required ; a declaration by the  President  sufficed to make clear the opinions held by a majority of the members. Thirdly, even though no formal resolution can be taken; the parties may nevertheless be willing to act in accordance with what they realize is the general sense of the Council. A case in point is the example set by France and Britain, in agreeing to act in exactly the same way as they would have done if the veto had not prevented the Council from adopting a resolution concerning the withdrawal of French and British troops from Syria. This is a most valuable precedent. </para>
                <para>Summary</para>
                <para>Summing up, I would say that the voting rules laid down in the Charter make it essential for the Security Council to aim, in all its discussions, at building up the maximum of agreement, and avoiding asmuch as possible the easy but rather disintegrating course of voting each other down. The Council is made up of eleven States, five of which hold permanent seats. Effective action will not be possible unless it can build up a real corporate sense. I think there are signs already that such a corporate sense is growing, despite the difficulties of opinion, between the permanent members themselves, that were expressed with regard to the situations in Greece, in Indonesia, and in Syria and Lebanon. </para>
                <para>In conclusion, I would suggest to honorable members that, in reviewing the events of London, they should look on them as the start of what we hope will prove a great concerted move by the nations to##'## bring peace and security to the world. The task will call for much patience and understanding and goodwill among all nations. The members of the United Nations must honour their undertakings and live up to their responsibilities. Australia, as a young nation, side by side with other members of the British Commonwealth, has already played an active part in the foundation of this new organization and we must be prepared to go on with faith and energy, proving ourselves worthy members in a great cause. </para>

                        <para>.- I refer again to a matter which I brought to the attention of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> in July last in connexion with the death at Bone, Algeria, in April, 1944, of an Australian lad named Ian Munchenberg. Munchenberg attempted to enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force in South Australia in 1943. He was rejected as being medically unfit. He then attempted to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force, and was again rejected on medical grounds. He was anxious to serve his country, and therefore he requested permission to join the crew of a Norwegian vessel which at that time was lying at Port Adelaide. He was then eighteen years of age.  His  mother, a widow whose husband died from wounds received during the 1914-18 war, was in receipt of a war pension. The boy joined the crew of the Norwegian vessel, but he was not granted a passport. He was not vaccinated or inoculated and, having to pass through feverinfested areas, he contracted fever during April, 1944, was taken off the ship at Bone, and placed in a hospital where he died a few days later. He was to have received ##Â£##25 a month from the company which owned the ship, and he had made an allotment to his mother of ##Â£##10 a month.  His  mother, who is in very straitened circumstances, received one allotment. In July last, I asked a question about the treatment of this woman and received the following reply from the Prime Minister :  - </para>

                        <para>Inquiries have been made into the matter, and I now inform the honorable member that Ian Walter Munchenberg was signed on as assistant steward ona Norwegian steamer at Port Adelaide on the 23rd February, 1944.  His  monthly wages were ##Â£##A71s. 3d., plus ##Â£##A17 13s.1d. war risk bonus. He died of smallpox at Bone, Algeria, on the 18th April, 1944. According to information supplied by the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission, no money was due to him at date of death, but. on the contrary, he was in debt to the vessel to the extent of ##Â£##13 19s. 7d. As stated by the honorable member, one allotment of ##Â£##10 had been paid to his mother. It has also been stated that his effects did not warrant fumigation expenses and were destroyed. This may have been necessary on account of the disease from which he died. The engagement of the. deceased was not subject to the Navigation Act or the Merchant Shipping Act, and it seems that compensation in respect of his death would be payable only if Norwegian law so provided. It is not possible to extend benefits to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Munchenberg</inline> in accordance with the provisions of the Seamen##'##s War Pensions and Allowances Act, as this act only applies if a deceased seaman loses his life through ##"## war injury ##"## </para>

Some consideration should be given to his widowed mother. When I heard that the boy was supposed to have been in debt to the shipping company to the amount of ##Â£##13, I interviewed a number of ship captains, who informed me that on no occasion would a captain advance to a seaman as much as ##Â£##13.

                        <para>. - I have one or two matters to bring to the attention of the Government. The first, which relates to potatoes, has already been the subject of questions in this House this week. As the Minister for Commerce and. Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> at least must be aware, every State, except ##"##Western Australia and Tasmania, has imported potatoes in the last few weeks, and there is still an acute shortage in most States. Whilst that is the position on the mainland, there is a crop of about 250,000 bags of potatoes waiting to be dug in Tasmania. The cause of this position is the shortage of shipping. I am well aware that few ships are available, and I have frequently stressed that fact in the last few months in speeches which I have made to my constituents. The loss of shipping during the war was much greater than most people supposed, and I have told the electors that we must share with the peoples of other nations the inconveniences caused by the shortage. However, I consider that, if the Government made an extra effort, it would be possible to divert some ships to Tasmania to load potatoes, in the interests of both the growers in Tasmania and the consumers on the mainland. During January and February last year, 571,000 bags of potatoes were exported from Tasmania, but this ##'##year only 211,000 bags have been shipped across Bass Strait. The potatoes remaining in the ground are rapidly deteriorating because of second growth. In the north-east about four weeks ago the loss from second growth was from 15 to 20 per cent., and now it is as high as 70 per cent. In other parts of the State Irish blight has led to the loss of a tremendous quantity of potatoes. At the same time the Federal Potato Controller, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Foster,</inline> has been suggesting that it may be necessary to. give a premium to growers in other States to dig immature crops owing to the shortage. So it will be readily apparent to the Government that a ship or several ships at the moment would be of tremendous benefit. I am well aware that other things are in need of transportation, but the point in connexion with- the potato crop is that it will deteriorate and eventually be lost with great pecuniary loss- to the growers and considerable loss of food to the other States, whereas other materials possibly might well be a little delayed without detriment. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The other point in connexion with the potato position I mentioned yesterday in a question, to which the Minister replied that consideration was being given to the whole position. The point I raised was that control of the growing and distribution##'## of potatoes will come to an end in November next, but most States have not yet any plans to take its place. There appears to be indecision all round as to the methods that will be adopted after November to carry out the marketing of potatoes. In Tasmania the preponderance of opinion among farmers seems to be in favour of continuance of. orderly marketing. If the present scheme comes to an end without any other scheme having been adopted and put into operation by the States, great loss and confusion will eventuate. I understand that several States have made application to the Commonwealth Government, to have the present scheme continued for at least another year, to allow time for. the other plans that are maturing to be placed before the farmers. It will be understood , (hat such schemes as that proposed by the Potato Marketing Board of Tasmania will be put before the growers for acceptance or rejection, but. in the meantime, these farmers, who have been sowing 10 or 20 acres and are likely to go on doing so unless .some guidance is given to them, will possibly find themselves in a very serious position next year, when requirements will be down to the peace-time level. </para>
                    <para class="block">The point I put to the Government is that it is absolutely necessary for some announcement to be made at a very early date as to its intentions, so that there shall be no indecision and confusion and so that the growers shall be aware of their precise position. Whether the Commonwealth Government decides to comply with this request or to do otherwise, the growers should at least know where they stand. </para>

It means that men who try to provide for their families, whatever their age, are penalized. I have collected several instances that, I think, will throw a little light on the subject. I am assured that the Commissioners of Taxation watch the daily register, and, if a married woman is shown to have acquired property, she is immediately sent a letter somewhat in the terms of this letter, which, I understand, was actually received - </para>

                    <para class="block">When that information has been supplied it is usually followed up by other searching inquiries into the affairs of both the husband and the wife. Here are some of the cases that have been put to me as having actually occurred or as being liable to occur. The first case is that of a man who buys a house and puts it in the joint names of himself and his wife. That, I believe most honorable gentlemen would agree, is a. perfectly reasonable and proper thing for a man to do. It is to be noted that in this case  there is no possible avoidance of estate duty, as on the husband##'##s death estate duty would be payable on the full value of the property. Under the Gift Duty Act, however, he is regarded as having made a gift to his wife, and that, I would remind honorable gentlemen, despite the section of the Christian marriage service that says, ##"## With all my worldly gifts I thee endow ##"##. In this case apparently all the property is regarded as the property of the husband, and he is regarded as having made a gift to his wife of a half of the value  of the property. If the property is valued at over ##Â£##1,000, gift duty is charged on a half of the amount. If the value is ##Â£##800, and the gift, therefore, ##Â£##400 that amount would be free of duty, because the amount; on which duty is charged is limited to ##Â£##500; but if eighteen months before or after the date on which he makes that gift of ##Â£##400 to his wife he makes a gift to any other person the value of all the gifts is added together, and if the total exceeds ##Â£##500, gift duty is payable on the total. This latter rule applies in all instances. Of course, if the husband bought the house in his wife##'##s name only, he would pay duty on the full amount. </para>
                    <para>Another point is that if a man takes his son into partnership in a business which he has built up over many years - and very many men build up businesses with that object in view whilst, frequently, the son himself helps in the processthe value of all of the assets in the business is calculated, and one half of the total value is regarded as a gift from the father to the son, upon which gift duty is payable. </para>
                    <para>Another case to which I direct particular attention is that of a wife who purchases a property, say for ##Â£##900. out of her own separate bank account which she had accumulated over a period of twenty years by savings out of her weekly allowance from her husband. The commissioner rules that these savings remain the property of the husband and that on the wife purchasing the house, the husband has, in effect, made a gift to her of the value of the house; andhe is assessed gift duty on that amount. </para>
                    <para>I cite another case: If a man opens a bank account in the joint names of himself and his wife, whenever he makes a deposit it is regarded as a gift, and when the total is sufficient it becomes subject to duty. I understand that at present several cases of that kind are pending; but they have not progressed sufficiently to enable me to say definitely on what basis the duty is assessed, although I presume that it would cover half the amount of the joint account. Unless the Commissioner has discretionary power in the matter, a great many difficulties will arise in the future for families, although a man in cases of the kind I have cited would only be doing his best for his family. </para>
                    <para>Finally, where a gift is made and a return is not lodged within one month, double duty is charged. The Commissioner has power to waive the penalty, but I know of the case of an old-age pensioner who inherited some money, and paid ##Â£##1,000 to his wife, and because he had never heard of the Gift Duty Act, he did not lodge a return. The Commissioner said that ignorance of the act was no excuse, and he charged the pensioner double duty, which amounted to ##Â£##60. </para>
                    <para>I have said sufficient, to . make it apparent to the Government that in the operation of the act, real injustice is done to many people. They are forced into the position of being charged with attempting to defraud the Government when they are doing no more than their moral duty on behalf of their families. </para>
                    <para>As the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> is at the table, I should like to deal with the problem of housing; but as many honorable members wish to take advantage of Grievance Day to bring urgent matters to the notice of the Government and the time allotted for the debate is restricted I shall postpone my remarks on that subject. </para>
                    <para>Mr..FADDEN  (Darling Downs- Leader of the Australian Country party) ##[##4.14##]##. - I bring to the notice of the House a matter which I and every responsible Australian believes to be of extreme importance, namely, the appalling housing position generally throughout Australia; and, at this juncture, I shall draw particular attention to conditions in Queensland. On the 28th February last the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> stated - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">And present indications are that this position has not altered materially. Six months ago, in order to draw the attention of the Government to this problem, I made a formal adjournment motion. On that occasion I made six suggestions to the Government for meeting the appalling housing shortage. The Government has adopted two of those##'## suggestions, namely the abolition of the permit system up to a certain value, and  ##"##the definition of responsibilities as between the Commonwealth and the States. The Government cannot regard lightly its responsibility in this matter, nor escape blame for its neglect of duty, by ##"## passing the buck ##"## to the States as it has done on so many previous occasions. Under the co-operative agreement, the States are supposed to build the houses, and the Commonwealth supplies the money, repayable over a 53-year period. Does the Government##'##s handling of the problem inspire confidence? Prom April, 1944, to December, 1945, a period of twenty months, 3,077 homes were built in Australia. Of these only 2.99 were built in Queensland, a State with a population of over 1,000,000.  The result has been alarming, and, in some cases, shocking. In many instances, severe overcrowding has led to the transmission of contagious diseases. Leprosy, diphtheria and paratyphoid cases were reported to the health committee of the Brisbane City Council in overcrowded homes, of which these, a re typical : A house at B##'##righton-road, West End, suitable for six, was occupied by seventeen; another at Beard-street, Auchenflower, suitable for housing five, was occupied by twenty, including four families, three of them ex-servicemen##'##s families. Should honorable members imagine that I am relying only upon isolated cases, I have here more than 1,000 Lette##'##rs from people in Brisbane who are in urgent need of homes. A friend of mine advertised a furnished house to let last month. In reply to his advertisement, which appeared once in one newspaper, he received 1,064 replies. I exhibit those letters to honorable members. They are convincing evidence of the  appalling  position in Brisbane, which, nevertheless, is better served than any other capital city in Australia, so far as housing is concerned. These letters tell a piteous story of husbands separated from their wives and children, of ex-servicemen tramping the streets, of whole families living in - ingle rooms and on side verandahs, and of unfortunate families facing ejectment and unable to obtain alternative shelter. There is no need for me to elaborate. I shall let the people themselves, some of the th.ousand.-odd who answered this advertisement, tell their own story. </para>

                    <para>The appalling state of affairs which I have described is not confined to Queensland. It is nation-wide. In New South Wales, the housing shortage has reached alarming proportions, and there is every indication that, twelve months hence, hundreds of people will still be seeking homes in that State. In Victoria, it was estimated a few days ago that S0,000 homes are needed to overcome the present shortage. In South Australia, 1,000  persons answered an advertisement offering a five-roomed furnished house in Adelaide, while in one day, 200 to 300 persons replied to an advertiser who wanted to sell a house for ##Â£##1,050. </para>
                    <para>During the war, the Martin bombe##"##r plant in Maryland, United States of America, needed 1,800 homes for its workers. They were erected in an average time of 35 man-hours. The wall material was made by applying coatings of cement and asbestos to both sides of  a slab of celotex, made of sugar-cane fibre. Thus the various elements of a wall - studding, plaster, lath, sheathing, siding, ##&amp;##c. - are rapidly combined in one piece. In other areas, box-girder construction with plywood bonded to hardwood frames, has been used successfully. It is stronger than steel and permanently waterproof, and is similar in principle to the construction of the Mosquito bomber, which is now being made in Australia. </para>
                    <para>In other countries, we read of modern methods used to overcome the housing shortage. Using the maximum of unskilled labour, manufacturers turn out prefabricated panels complete with prefitted doors and windows, electric cables, plumbing and insulation. Munitions factories, no longer needed for war, are ideal for conversion to this type of production. One famous designer, Norman Rel Geddes, has designed such a house containing only 27 basic prefabricated units. It can be assembled by six men in <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> S-hour day, and admits of eleven different variations in the type of heme Although this method of construction is a potential source of thousands of homes, I have in my possession correspondence indicating that machinery capable of producing 6,000)000 square feet of plywood annually has been held in Sydney in its original cases since 1941, and that it still is not available for home building, solely because of Government bungling. I have taken this##'## matter up with the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction but I have not been able to obtain any satisfaction, nor has the firm which owns tha material-, yet the Government professes to be satisfied with the present housing position. If for no other reason, this Government stands condemned in the eyes of every responsible Australian citizen because of its failure to provide adequate shelter for the people of this country. </para>

The Social Security Committee investigated the housing problem throughout the Commonwealth and reported upon it in its fourth report presented to Parliament on the .20 Idi May, 1942. That report stated - </para>

                        <para>Although  in the past housing has generally  been  regarded as .the province of private enterprise, it is obvious that the return to be de-  rived from low rental type cottages has been insufficient to induce Birch interests to undertake this class of house building to any considerable extent. Because of this, and also the extreme difficulty - in most States impossibility - of the worker being able to secure finance for a home at less than a 10 per cent, deposit even from the Government or semi government al authorities, the shortage of ##'## dwellings for low wage earners has been much more significant than for the more costly higher  rental  types in the provision df  which  private enterprise has, mainly, concentrated its activities. Indeed, there is  ample  evidence to indicate that the immediate needs of the nation would be met by an adequate supply, of the former types. </para>
                        <para>The inheritance at this early stage of Australian development of such a serious dislocation of social and living conditions as a direct result of inadequate and low standard housing indicates a  serious  defect in housing policy in this country. It demonstrates either unreadiness or inability of existing housing  authorities or private interests, to keep pace with normal housing demands or to make any provision for the cleaning out of slums and rehousing of their present occupants. </para>

                    <para>As I have said that report was made in 1.942  -  three years after the outbreak of war - and the acute housing shortage indicated therein was the inheritance of the Labour administration from the Government of which the Leader of the Australian Country parry was a member. Conditions similar to those that the right honorable gentleman says exist in Queensland to-day are paralleled in all States. Everybody knows that houses are in short supply all over the Commonwealth  and the civilized - world. The position is deplorable, but had anti-Labour administra-  tions made- a realistic approach to the problem conditions to-day would not be nearly so bad as they are. The shortage of homes was greatly accentuated by the suspension of building operations during the six years of the war. It is futile for the right honorable##'## member to indulge in a tirade against the Government because of the present state of affairs. I venture to say that had the administration of which the right honorable member was a member remained in office during the war, our housing standard would now be akin to that of the Japanese. </para>

Let us examine what has occurred in the Australian Capital Territory, for which the Commonwealth Parliament is entirely responsible. When I was first elected to this chamber in 1934, I took an interest in Canberra and the housing of its citizens. At that time there were 300 or 350 people waiting for homes. To-day the figure is hearer 500. But what of the record of the Government of which the right honorable gentleman was a member?

                            <para>- I have no desire to screen the present Government from blame, but at least I. can say in its favour that, during the course of the war, bouses could not be built because labour and material##'##s were diverted almost solely to war purposes. It is true that during the term of office of the Scullin Government Labour and materials were plentiful, bat that Government could not provide the requisite finance to undertake housing construction. How comparatively easy it became later to find millions of pounds every day to finance the exigencies of the war! Every honorable member to-day##'## receives heart-rending letters from servicemen and others recounting their difficulties in securing, not a home, but even a place of shelter. We have inherited the legacy of the failure of past governments to plan for the future housing needs of the people. Private enterprise, being influenced only by the profit motive, has contributed little to the solution of the problem. being interested only in construction which yielded a high rate of interest on the capital investment. One of the effects of the bad housing position  has been the phenomenal growth of slums, not only in the capital cities but also in the provincial towns, and, let it be said to our discredit, even in Canberra. Honorable members opposite cannot absolve themselves from blame for the state of affairs that exists to-day and  charge this Government with having neglected the needs of the people, in view of the fact that during the 25 years the governments they supported were in office, nothing was done. </para>

                    <para>I propose now to deal with the price of ice-cream.For a long time I have been making representations to the Prices Commissioner relative to the surcharge  of -Jd. on the retail price of packed icecream, but so far have been unable to influence him to remove this unfair and excessive impost. One has only to look at the balance-sheet of one of the largest manufacturers of ice cream in Australia, namely, Peters American Delicacy Company Limited, and -examine its disclosed profits, to discover how this surcharge is inflating the annual profits of that concern. The company was registered in September,##'## 1920, with a nominal capital of ##Â£##3,050,000, issued in 1,500,000 shares of 14s. each. According to published figures the paid-up capital of the company was ##Â£##834,383, issued in 1,079,144 shares fully paid and 169,247 shares paid to 9s. -4d. In June, 1922, the published accounts of the company disclosed that its profits amounted to ##Â£##25,647, and that a dividend of 13^ . per cent, had been declared, ##Â£##10,647 being passed to reserve, reducing the deficit to ##Â£##14,594. In the year ended the 30th  June, 1932 - ten years later - the profits amounted to ##Â£##22,779, a dividend of 10 per cent, was declared, and ##Â£##42,583 was passed to reserve, making the total of the reserve fund ##Â£##480,360. Written-off investments accounted for ##Â£##12,435, and there were unexplained additions amounting to ##Â£##19,434. In 1943 we find that the company made a profit of ##Â£##83,825 and paid a dividend of 9 per cent. In that  year an amount of ##Â£##8,730 was passed to reserves, making a total of ##Â£##376,230 in the reserve fund. For the financial year 1944-4##'##i the disclosed profits amounted to ##Â£##S6,166, and a dividend rate of 9 per cent, was declared. An amount of ##Â£##11,071 was. passed to reserves, making the total of the reserve fund ##Â£##455,534. The figures I have cited are##'## the net figures after making special provision for tax reserves. On the position disclosed by skeleton balance-sheets published, it is interesting to note the long run of satisfactory dividends, sweetened by the issue in 1940 of bonus shares on the basis of one bonus share for each share held, which make distributions since that date equal to double the declared rate on capital as it stood before the gift. Not only was this company able to pay the dividends to which I have referred, but in 1940, while the war was on, it was able to make an issue of bonus shares. Thus, the divi- dend of 9 per cent, paid the following year really amounted to 18 per cent, on the invested capital, and this was achieved partly by robbing the children who bought ice-cream . packs. I understand that last year the company was unable to meet the demand for##'## its. product. Despite its difficulties it appears to have achieved satisfactory results, and notwithstanding further advances in costs, and much more than usual being set. aside for taxation, plus ##Â£##12,402 allocated to the staff fund, the net earnings were ##Â£##86,166. This was equal to 10.3 per cent, on the paid-up capital of ##Â£##834,283, as compared with dividends of 10.2 per cent., 10 per cent., 8.4 per cent., 9.2 per cent, and 10.5 per cent, for the previous five years. The dividend this year remained at 9 per cent., leaving ##Â£##11##&gt;##071 to be put on the shelf, together with ##Â£##20,000 previously overpaid in taxation; which increased the reserve to ##Â£##455,534. </para>
                    <para>Despite these disclosed facts, the Prices Commission still persists in allowing the extra half-penny to be charged for icecream packs. It seems to be robbing the children for the .benefit of a firm that is admittedly doing very well. I have a grievance against the Prices Commission on this issue. I am prepared to give credit to the Commission for its work during the war, but in this particular instance it has failed to give satisfactory replies to my letters. It has evaded my questions, and supplied me with irrelevant statements. A review of the price of ice-cream, which to-day is regarded as a wholesome product, is long overdue. I should not have raised the matter here but for the continued evasions of the Prices Commission. The fact that the price of an ice-cream pack is <inline font-style="italic">3id.</inline> forces children, who have only 3d. to spend, to buy something else with it. Although I have a grievance about the price charged by the company, I freely admit that it puts up a very wholesome product, one that is both tasty and nourishing. I am not able to say that the present pack is smaller than that put up before the war, but I believe that it is. If that is so, then the company is not only getting the extra half-penny on each pack, but is making bigger profits because that pack itself is smaller. </para>
                    <para>I trust that what I have said on the subject to-day will be brought to the notice of those responsible in the Prices Commission. I object very strongly to the way in which my representations have been received. If the Prices authorities arc not prepared to reduce the price they should say so, and give their reasons. Instead of doing that, they evade the issue, and attempt to brush me aside, but I am not prepared to be brushed aside. I want an answer. The company, admittedly, has been making big profits, and although considerable sums have been paid in taxation, I believe that it is still receiving more than it is entitled to. I know that it can be argued that all companies engaged in the manufacture of this product are not so prosperous as this one. If that is so, then it is too bad, but I do not think that the Government ought to stand idly by and allow this particular company to make a huge rake-off at the expense of the children of this country. </para>

He has referred to letters which he claims to have received from persons who have made application for a five-roomed cottage, partly furnished, and situated on a tram route, at a rent of ##Â£##1 17s. 6d. a week. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable gentleman does not know where the cottage is situated. I challenge him to give the exact address of it. If a house of such a character were advertised, there would be 100,000 . applicants for it. The right honorable gentleman has presented the most fantastic case I have ever heard. Even were there no housing shortage, there would still be as many applicants for a house of that character at that rent. In bringing forward these letters, the right honorable gentleman has indulged in nauseous repetition in an endeavour to reflect on the Government. He has to be reminded of the background of the matter. Throughout the years during which honorable members opposite composed the Government, their administration did not build a single house for any one in Australia, nor did they pay any attention to the housing problem, as they are doing now because it is a convenient party political ##"## stunt ##"##. Had housing been properly attended to in earlier years, there would have been a surplus of houses during the war period instead of the acute shortage that existed. The right honorable gentlemanshowed to me a letter concerning a firm which has a large quantity of material for the production of p re-fabricated houses. He did not say, although he knew, that that is lend-lease material which is owned by the American authorities. All the information in possession of the Government indicates that the authorities in Washington intend to invite tenders throughout the world for the purchase of it. Australia has no more right to it than has any other country, and if our tender for it is not high enough, it will be sent out of Australia. We have no control whatever over it. For paltry I arty political purposes, the right honorable gentleman endeavoured to misrepre- sent the position to this House. Not a government in Australia concerned itself about the housing of the people until after the war. </para>

At the outbreak of the war, public opinion was by no means convinced that housing was a function of government, apart from the provision of concessions in relation to  finance,  such as those provided by the New South Wales Savings Bank scheme. One proof of that statement is that the unofficial housing council of New South Wales, a propaganda and research body of which, as I have said, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stewart was the  chairman,  devoted itself to the improvement of housing conditions. At the meeting that it held in 3939, it decided that the moment was inopportune for reform in the nature of slum clearance and intervention by a government housing authority, and went into recess, lt has rot since held another meeting.

                            <para>- I refer to houses covered by the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and State Governmen s. The agreement provides thai 50 per cent, of such houses shall be made available to ex-servicemen,- and shall be distributed on a needs basis. The demand for houses is so great that completed buildings have##'## to be balloted for. The increased cost of houses makes the economic rent more than many home-seekers can afford to pay, and, accordingly, the agreement provides that the Commonwealth shall pay three-fifths, and the State Government concerned two-fifths, of the difference between the economic rent and the rent which the tenant could afford to pay - approximately one clay##'##s income. The agreement provides, further, that if the tenant becomes sick or unemployed, the rent may be reduced to as low as 8s. a week. So far, 60 per cent, of government-sponsored houses have been allotted to ex-servicemen. Considering the dearth of materials at the time that the scheme was launched, the achievements to date constitute a remarkable record. Honorable member##'##s surely have not forgotten that the whole of the resources of this country were requisitioned for war purposes, so that when the war ended there was a shortage of bricks, timber, and other building materials. Yet, in the face of those facts, honorable members opposite continue to say that Commonwealth and State Governments should have done more. If honorable members who express those views were to consult the master builders in their electorates they would obtain confirmation of what I have said. The truth is that Opposition members are using the housing shortage as political propaganda in the hope that they will secure some additional votes at the next elections, but their tactics will be of no avail. The total number of houses erected under the government-sponsored programme 3ince its inception in April, 1944, to the 21st February, 1946, was 3,33S. During that period, the number of houses erected privately ##'##was 10,000. Between the 1st July, 1945, and the 2lst February, 1946, government-sponsored houses erected in the Commonwealth totalled 2,292. In the same period privately built houses to the number of 4,200 were erected, making a total of 6,492 in less##'## than eight months. Ar the 21st February last, S/704 houses were under construction, consisting of 5,004 government-sponsored homes, and 3,700 private homes. The figures in relation to homes privately built have been obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician and cover the period from the 1st July to the 31st December, 1945, only. They, therefore, understate the number of houses completed and under construction on the 2.1st February. Later figures are not available. As during the war 2,566 homes for war-workers were erected, it will be  seen  that <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the 21st February, 1946. 16,104 homes were completed, that number comprising 2,566 war-workers##'## hom.es, 3.53S government-sponsored homes, and 10,000 homes built ##"##by private  enterprise.  Tn addition, S.704 homes were under construction on the 21st February, making a total of 24,80S homes either erected or in course of construction from April, 1944, to the 21st February, 1946. It must be borne in mind that that excellent result has been achieved notwithstanding grave shortages of materials and man-power. I agree that the housing situation is still desperate, and I fear that, regardless of the government in office, the demand for nouses will continue for a further ten years before the shortage is overcome. I repeat that the extremely serious position which exists to-day is the result of the policy followed by private enterprise in the days before the war, when there was no restriction whatsoever on the building of houses. Those were the- days when land was bought by the acre, and sold by the foot, when houses were built in rows and terraces which to-day are eyesores. The slums which now exist had their beginning in the days when men with the same political outlook as honorable members opposite governed this country and ##"##allowed jerry-builders to erect for human beings buildings which were not fit for pigs to live in. That is the heritage left to us by antiLabour governments. Honorable members opposite do not care a ##"## halfpenny dump ##"## about the housing position or about how people are to get houses. They are simply interested in kicking a political football about. If, by some extraordinary misfortune, the people were stupid enough to return an anti-Labour government to office at the next elections they would find that that government would have little interest in the shortage of houses. </para>

                            <para>- Because of the failure of the Government even to consider those amendments the act now in operation is sadly deficient in many important respects. Unfortunately workable machinery has not been put into operation tq enable ex-servicemen to re-establish themselves. In consequence of this I made representations to the Minister for Labor and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway)</inline> on the 12th November last, in respect of two specific cases. Only to-day I received a reply from the Minister, dated the 19th March, with regard to one matter that I then raised. The case involved a soldier who had served as an army electrician. On his demobilization he was unable to secure a trade union ticket, and so he has not been permitted to work as a qualified electrician. On the 14th November last, I placed before the Minister a similar case, and I have only now received a reply which unfortunately is quite unsatisfactory. Ex-servicemen are, in fact, being debarred from obtaining trade tickets because they have not served the required apprenticeship. After months of delay, I have now been advised by the Minister that the matter has been referred to a State government department for consideration. </para>

                    <para class="block">It must be obvious that the situation is entirely unsatisfactory to ex-service personnel. It is apparent now that even the degree of preference that was accorded to men and women who served in the last war has been withdrawn from them. Sixty per cent, of the members of the Australian Country party are ex-servicemen, and if the amendments which we desired to incorporate in the Reestablishment and Employment Act had been agreed to, the position would have been very much better. They were reasonable suggestions intended for the benefit of ex-servicemen, and if they had been implemented they would have guarded against, most of the disabilities now being experienced. This half-baked measure provides rehabilitation facilities for all sorts of people other than ex-servicemen, who receive very little preference in fact. For instance, the benefits of war service homes legislation have recently been extended to merchant seamen who served in Australian coastal waters during the war. It is wrong and unfair that they should be given the same benefits as are applied to disabled ex-servicemen. It is also anomalous that these seamen should be given preference for which land army girls are not eligible. The Government has been neglectful of the rights of ex-servicemen in limiting to seven years the duration of the preference legislation. After the war of 1914-18, legislation enacted by an anti-Labour government provided special preference conditions for ex-servicemen without any time limit. Those laws were enforced until the Re-establishment, and Employment Act wiped them out. Exservicemen also have reason to complain of the lack of vocational training facilities and other re-establishment aids which, the people of Australia want them to have. No provision was made for vocational training during the war, in spite of the example of another government during the 1914-191S war. On that occasion, vocational training courses and soldier settlement schemes were inaugurated before the cessation of hostilities, so that men who were discharged even two years prior to the armistice were able to receive the assistance which they needed. During the war which has just ended not one government in Australia, with the exception of the New South Wales Government, developed any rural area for the purpose of the settlement of ex-servicemen. The Commonwealth Government made no effort to initiate its scheme until hostilities had ceased, and even now; the necessary land has not been selected. Earlier to-day, I asked that the State governments be assisted in their settlement schemes by obtaining the services of New Zealand surveyors to proceed with the surveying of blocks. Over 6,000,000 acres of grazing land in western Queensland is awaiting development. This land reverted to the Crown and was set aside for post-war development. Half of it is to be provided for the ^establishment of ex-servicemen, and the remainder is to be available to the public generally. </para>

                            <para>- I . agree with what the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> said this afternoon regarding unnecessary delays and inconvenience associated with providing homes for ex-servicemen. We know that housing is a world-wide problem at present, but the inactivity of this Government is largely responsible  for the present acute shortage in Australia. The Minister for Works and Homing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> has told us that the Government##'##s housing scheme is progressing according to schedule. Nevertheless, although the Government has first priority for supplies of building materials, very little progress is being made. ##'## Private individuals wishing to build homes have little chance of doing so for a long time. . Illegal strikes in industry are aggravating the position. For instance, there is a shortage of galvanized iron as the remit of an industrial disturbance. During my last visit to Queensland, I was told by building contractors that they are being delayed because of the shortage of nails caused by another strike. A further strike has been allowed to develop in the Lysaght organization, and it may extend to other establishments associated with the production of building materials. Strikes of this nature should be banned. The seriousness of the situation demands such strong action in the interests, not only of ex-servicemen, but also of the general public. I hope that the Government will give more serious consideration to the many urgent requirements of men and women who are being discharged from the armed forces than it has done in the past. It should give to this House an opportunity to discuss in detail its treatment of ex-servicemen. Such a debate could be conducted in a non-party atmosphere, and honorable members could assist the Government by revealing anomalies which should be corrected in the interests of the men -who fought for the safety of the nation. </para>

                        <para>. - I have read with interest the report prepared by the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson)</inline> on his visit to the Northern Territory. I fully concur with many of the suggestions which he has made in the report. The Northern Territory has for too long been regarded as too remote from the rest of Australia to be worth while developing. People who for years struggled hard, earning a bare livelihood, in order to develop that part of the Commonwealth, have riot received the measure of support from various Commonwea##'##lth Governments that they have deserved. This lack of interest in the Northern Territory dates back to the time when South Australia handed over control of the area to the Commonwealth Parliament. The needs of people in the distant parts of Australia have been overlooked because of their very isolation from the more settled areas. However, their isolation strengthens their claim on the Commonwealth Government, for the provision- of amenities and modern means of communication and development. Honorable members will agree that this vast expanse of country, over 500,000 square miles in area, is capable of tremendous development. The report of the Minister for the Interior, stresses, as do other reports that have been submitted to Parliament, from time to time, the importance of making a careful scientific analysis of the potentialities of the Northern Territory with a view to##&gt;## exploiting them to the fullest possible degree. The development in the Northern, Territory to meet war needs shows beyond, doubt its tremendous possibilities. It behoves the people of Australia, especially the members of the National Parliament,, to ensure immediate action to develop and. populate it. Its development is essential to the welfare of Australia, but particularly to the welfare of the settlers who have struggled against tremendous odds and adverse conditions - conditions that should be altered at the earliest possiblemoment - to produce the food that this nation needs for home consumption and; for export to Great Britain and othercountries that face starvation as theresult of the war. </para>

                    <para>South Australia is the gateway to theNorthern Territory, but although bitumen-, roads have been built in the territory for war purposes, there is no satisfactory link, between central Australia and South: Australia. The Commonwealth Government should assist the Government of##"## South Australia to build such a road. I recently travelled over the roads in northern South Australia and saw their bad condition owing to the floods.. The Government of South Australia has not the money to do the jabwithout Commonwealth aid. We pay only lip service to the task-of populating our country when we neglect the development of the Northern Territory that isits due. The people who under adverse conditions have pioneered and developed the pastoral areas that produce the food! for which the world is crying out deservegreater consideration than they have hadThe women there have given yeoman, service and ought to be rewarded with: the amenities enjoyed in more settled##'## areas. They are entitled to telephones or wireless telephones of the type lately developed, refrigerators and electric lighting. If they cannot afford them the Government as a mark of its appreciationof  what  they have done, should subsidizethem. The principle of payment of subsidies where warranted has already beenrecognized by the Commonwealth. Inthe outback families are isolated to a degree almost beyond the comprehensionof any one who has not travelled through  the country and seen the way in which the people there struggle for existence. Homesteads are from 50 to 150 miles from each other, and it is little wonder##'## that women so isolated from other women suffer nervous breakdowns. Only a few weeks ago I met a man on a station whose wife is in the metropolitan area trying to regain her health. Sometimes there <inline font-style="italic">Are</inline> only the proprietor or manager and his wife and family on a holding, which means that with him out on the run, miles from home, if something goes wrong at the homestead or with himself, there is no means of communication, because the mother is often either alone or with small children. The inevitable result is the collapse of the health of the women. I am given to understand that a body called the Australian Development Committee, which is representative of pastoral, water, mining and ##"##engineering interests, has been set up to investigate and report on this important part of Australia. But we have had reports on it before. Several have been presented to Parliament, pigeon-holed and forgotten. For instance, the Payne report, one of the finest ever presented to the Parliament, was filed and forgotten. Had some of the recommendations contained in some of those reports been carried out, the Northern Territory would not have been so sparsely peopled and undeveloped, and the amenities that I want to see extended to it would have been already provided.. </para>
                    <para>A legislatively- created federal soil and water conservation service, such as I suggested in this House some time ago, would more effectively deal with soil conservation than would any other committee that could be set up, if it were given the widest powers, not only to investigate the problem, but also to apply an effective policy. Ever since I have been in this Parliament I have preached the urgency of providing counter measures to the erosion that is rapidly destroying the heritage of unborn generations. . The recent drought had one good result, in that it convinced even the most reactionary State Ministers for Agriculture of the necessity for an effective Commonwealthwide soil conservation campaign. At that time some members of the South Australian Parliament were inclined to ridicule my statements. They said that the drought was not nearly so bad as I claimed. However, all that I said on that occasion has been borne out in fact. According to a report published in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of the 12th March last, the Minister for Agriculture in South Australia, speaking at a conference of the Agricultural Bureau at Jamestown, warned the farmers that despite the good rains that had fallen soil conservation was still a great problem. I agree with that view. Throughout Australia, _ and particularly in the northern and central areas, unprecedented falls of rain have been recorded; but no effort was made to conserve water. We must undertake schemes on a national basis to conserve water and arrest soil erosion. This problem is of vital importance to our people as a whole. </para>
                    <para> It was reported in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of the 25th January last that, as the result of recommendations by the Agricultural Council, the Premiers Conference had decided to establish a standing committee on soil conservation, composed of representatives of the Commonwealth Department of Commerce and Agriculture and the Council for Scientific ##'## and Industrial Research and seven other members, including the heads of each State Soil Conservation Service and the Commonwealth Soil Conservation Service. This proposal is constructive, and follows very closely the lines of the scheme which I put forward on a previous occasion in this House. However, so far as I have been able to discover, the Commonwealth Soil Conservation Service has not yet been established; or, if it is in existence it functions only as a minor offshoot of a department. The seriousness of soil erosion calls for far more effective action. I believe that the Commonwealth, in order to shoulder its responsibilities in this matter, must set up a permanent and separate organization and clothe it with full administrative power. </para>
                    <para>The territory under the direct control of this Parliament comprises an area of 500,000 square miles of country which varies from semi-desert to high rainfall tropica##]## forests. It is ridiculous to imagine that this huge territory can be  effectively  administered, and its soil and water resources properly conserved, under the existing system of control and organization. The Government plans to expend thousands of pounds in developing Darwin, on {he basis of a population of 30,000. Such a scheme must also envisage the development of the agricultural, pastoral and mineral resources of the hinterland of the Territory. The history of land development in Australia follows a tragically familiar course. The usual practice has been to set to work with no thought but for immediate production. The land has been mined rather than farmed, and wherever it has been used for grazing it has been ruthlessly overgrazed. Consequently, it is true to say that today there is no area in Australia##'## which has not been affected by erosion to some degree. That being the case, and with these examples before it, the Commonwealth Government has a responsibility to ensure that this tragedy is not repeated in the territory under- its direct control. </para>
                    <para>Therefore I urge the Government not to toy with this vital problem. It should immediately introduce legislation to set up a permanent and effective soil conservation service, clothed with the fullest authority and provided with ample means to discharge its liabilities to the future generations of Australians. The first essential preliminary to any scheme of land settlement and development in the Northern Territory is a soil survey. This must be carried out by officers of the proposed federal soil conservation service. As reported in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">. Advertiser</inline> of the 10th November last, the##'## necessity for this survey was recognized by the Minister for the Interior during his recent visit to the Northern Territory. Early action must be taken in this direction if we are to prevent the development of dust-bowls. </para>
                    <para>I implore honorable members of both sides of the House to approach this subject from a national view-point. In all my references to this matter I have endeavoured to do so. I am aware of other grave problems confronting the nation, but none is so fraught with danger as the threat of soil erosion. The soil is the  source of all wealth, and its fertility is the basis of all industry. Any force which threatens the life of the soil, strikes at the very root of national prosperity. I hope that the Government will realize its responsibilities by giving effect to the resolution passed on this subject at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. </para>

                        <para>.- For the current financial year, this Government budgeted to expend ##Â£##492,000,000, consisting of war expenditure of ##Â£##360,000,000 and non-war expenditure of ##Â£##132,000,000. Fortunately for this country, the war ended six weeks after the commencement of the financial year, and, accordingly, ample funds should be immediately available thus making a reduction of taxes . possible. But this country is still subjected to foolish, unjust and crippling taxes. Ex-servicemen##'##s prganizations, in their efforts to raise funds to build soldiers##'## war memorials, have experienced confiscatory taxation. . I shall cite one example, and ask the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to grant the necessary relief by waiving this iniquitous##'## claim. </para>

                    <para>At Beaudesert, in my electorate, the Returned Sailors,. Soldiers and Airmen##'##s Imperial League of Australia, with the assistance of the local amateur racing club, is endeavouring to raise funds for the erection of a soldiers##'## memorial hall. These two bodies held three special . race meetings, and agreed that 33 per cent, of the net profits of the first meeting, and 50 per cent, of the net profits of the second and third meetings should be allocated towards the : cost of the building. The hall, which would be erected by diggers, would perpetuate the memory and exploits of fallen comrades and others##'## who had fought in two great world wars and would also be a meeting place for ex-service personnel. Of the proceeds from the three race meetings ##Â£##450 was allotted to the building fund, and ##Â£##300 set aside for taxation because of a claim made . by the Taxation Department on the Amateur Race Club. That is confiscatory. Company tax was claimed as payable at the rate of 8s. in the ##Â£##1. This is the act of a brigand or a pirate. Even Ned Kelly, in his wildest dreams, would have shuddered at the thought of making a similar extortion. I ask the Treasurer to agree that money raised for the erection of soldiers##'## memorial halls shall be exempt from taxation. The principle- of exempting funds collected for the erection of such buildings was established by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> when he was Prime Minister by exempting from entertainments tax on all functions held to raise funds for the erection of memorial halls; but to-day confiscatory taxation is levied on money raised for this worthy object. The act should be amended in order to ensure that all efforts to raise funds for soldiers##'## memorial halls shall not be subject to any taxation. </para>
                    <para>Another matter of special importance is the plight of the Royal Australian Air Force personnel at Madang. I have just received from an- airman a communication which. I believe, deserves investigation on the spot. A Royal Australian Air Force camp at Madang featured prominently in the news about a month ago, when a petition was signed by many Royal Australian Air Force personnel stationed there, directing attention to the extreme dissatisfaction . in that area ##'##because the men were not being demobilized. My correspondent made an exceedingly grave allegation. He declared that the consensus of opinion in his unit was that high ranking officers had evolved a scheme to delay discharges, and evade the notoriety of the Madang complaints. The scheme is to move Northern Command from Madang to Port Moresby. That decision would affect hundreds of men, and entail almost as much work as would a move to the mainland. It would involve a substantial additional expense, and considerable waste. According to my correspondent, such a move could not possibly be reconciled with the declared policy of the Royal Australian Air Force of rapid discharges. I demand a searching inquiry. There must be no. obstacle to the speedy return of servicemen to civil life. </para>
                    <para>For .some time, most of the flying from Madang has been to places where Australian service personnel are stationed, including Rabaul, Torokina, ##'## Tadji, Lae and Finschafen. These camps are much more accessible from Madang than they are from Port Moresby, because a journey by air from Port Moresby in volves hazardous flying over the Owen Stanley Range. The aircraft that would be engaged in such a transfer would be much better employed in transporting service personnel to the mainland instead of making a double shift, first to Port Moresby arid, after a lengthy delay, to the mainland. Repeatedly, the Government has used lack of transport as its excuse for slow demobilization. When Northern Command is finally abolished, the entire transportation procedure will again be undertaken. This needless use of aircraft and unnecessary creation of work will inevitably delay the return of hundreds of men and entail considerable additional expense, and waste of time and money. Every available aircraft and ship should be commissioned to bring these men back to Australia. A glance at a map will convince honorable members of the stupidity of the moye. In the afternoon, the Owen Stanley Range often cuts off Port Moresby from the five bases which I have named, ##'##because bad weather makes the crossing of the mountains ait that time impossible. That was proved during the last war. Doubtless, the authorities consider that the unpleasant publicity given to Madang will be forgotten when all personnel are moved from that centre, but, in reality, it will be the same men, with the same complaints, who will be involved if Northern Command is moved to Port Moresby. I warn the Government that these men, who fought for their country, will not forget either the way in which they are being treated, or ##'## the Government##'##s failure speedily to discharge them. </para>
                    <para>The receipt of the Madang petition was followed by a hurried visit from the Chief of the Air Staff to investigate the complaints. He examined personnel, and heard their grievances. He represented that he was sympathetic to their proposals, and that the men would be moved as early as possible. That policy seemed to be given effect for a time, because immediately after, the visit of the Chief of the Air Staff, large numbers of personnel left Madang for the mainland. But other men, who were not transferred, and who have been idle for months, are disgruntled, because they believe that their retention at Madang is completely unjustified. </para>
                    <para>I now desire to refer to the housing problem. Housing is urgently needed, and every delay in discharging service personnel accentuates the difficulty.  Reference  has been made to this matter already to-day. The delay in repatriating Australian servicemen is having an adverse effect upon the housing programme, and upon the carrying out of. other reproductive work. The urgent need for houses alone warrants immediate </para>
                    <para>Steps to expedite the return of these men from the islands. I have been informed that it is the clear intention of senior officers stationed at such places as Madang and Port Moresby to delay the repatriation of##'## the men, so that they may retain their ##"## cushy ##"## jobs for a while longer. I urge the Minister to make a statement to the House on this matter to-night, and to make an immediate investigation with a view to ensuring that Australian servicemen still serving in the islands will be returned to their homes and families as soon as possible. </para>
                    <para>The honorary secretary of the Boy Scouts Association of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, George</inline> Rees, has sought my co-operation in urging the Government to allow donations to the association to be regarded as concessional deductions for income tax purposes. This request has been before the Government for a number of years, but a deaf ear has been turned to it. Surely a budget providing for an estimated expenditure of ##Â£##492,000,000, in the circumstances I have already stated, permits a reduction of taxes, and I suggest that this request by the Boy Scouts Association could be complied with. The sum involved will not be very great, but the granting of the concession would be of material assistance to the association. The Boy Scouts Association was established in 190S, and in. 1919 it was appointed by royal charter. According to that charter, the object- of the association is primarily to instruct boys of all classes in the principles of discipline, loyalty and good citizenship. It is urgedthat for taxation purposes the association be regarded as an ##"## educational##'## charity ##"## and that donations made to it be allowed as concessional deductions. In Queensland the association is recognized as an educational charity by the Queensland Stamp Duties Office - no doubt in accordance with an opinion obtained by the State Crown Law Office. In view of itslaudable objectives, the association isworthy of encouragement and supportIt is not merely a national organization,, but also an international organization, with branches in almost every country. Iii fact, if the principles of the association were adhered to by citizens of all countries, it would be the foundation of a new League of Nations. During the ##"## blitz ##"####'## on Great Britain the boy scouts did a noble job, and many were decorated by  His  Majesty the King for conspicuousbravery. Members of the association were enrolled to play an important part in our own air raid precautions work, but fortunately their services  were not required, because no Japanese ##"## blitz ##"## eventuated. On the grounds which I have specified, and others which time will not permit me to enumerate, I consider that the Boy Scouts Association, which plays an important part in our community life,, should be encouraged as a national organization, and I strongly urge the Government to exempt from taxation##'## the donations made to it. </para>
                    <para>There is another phase of taxation to which I shall refer. During the war many motor-car owners had their vehiclesimpressed by service or other authorities, and are now endeavouring##'## to replacethem. They find, however, that in makingpurchases chiefly through the CommonwealthDisposals Commission they haveagain to pay duty and sales tax. This double taxation is an injustice, and I have received from several car ownerswho were deprived of their vehicles during the war, requests for assistance insecuring the removal of this anomaly.##"## I ask ##'## the Government to examine the matter. </para>
                    <para>Again I direct the attention of the House to the serious menace of the buffalo fly to the dairying and beef cattle industries of this country. I make no apology for raising this matter again to-day.. These industries in north Queensland arebecoming seriously jeopardized because of the ravages of. this pest. I have brought this matter to the notice of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> on several occasions, and I again ask kim to honor his promise to visit north Queensland and inspect the affected areas. So serious has this menace become that there is a distinct possibility that instead of this country being an exporter of dairy products and beef, in the not far distant future we shall have to import these commodities from New Zealand. The Minister is doing a serious injustice to men engaged in those industries by not heeding the warnings he has received. The honorable gentleman also undertook to make supplies of DDT available as a means of curbing the ravages of the buffalo fly, but to date that promise. also has not been fulfilled. The buffalo fly has been a pest in the Northern Territory for 100 years, <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> because the Commonwealth has failed to take steps to control it in its own territory, it has now spread across to north Queensland. To a considerable degree, the economy of this nation depends upon the export of primary products, and if the export of beef and dairy produce cannot be continued, our entire economy will be adversely affected. There are many commodities that Australia has to import from overseas, and it can only pay for those imports by maintaining its export industries. What confidence can those engaged in the dairying and beef cattle industries in north Queensland have in the Government .in view of the Minister##'##s failure to fulfil his promises to visit north Queensland or those in southern Queensland that are likely to be affected by the spread of the pest, and to make available supplies of DDT? Unless some worthwhile action be taken in the immediate- future, many holdings may become worthless because of the depredations of this pest. The Government has many sins to answer for, and the people in the country districts of Queensland will deal seriously with it unless it heeds the appeals that are being made in this chamber from time to time on their behalf. I appeal to the Minister to lose no time in honouring his promise to visit northern and southern Queensland and discuss with dairymen##'##s and graziers##'## organizations the most effective means of combating this pest. </para>

                        <para>.- Throughout my electorate are established many small but nevertheless vitally important industries. Included among them is a modern knitting mill in which is installed some of the most up-to-date knitting machinery in South Australia-. The company concerned has also incurred considerable expense in installing one of the most modern buttonhole machines in Australia. The company##'##s operations, however, are greatly restricted by the shortage of yarn. It has already considerably increased the number of its employees and if adequate supplies of yarn could be obtained the existing staff could probably be doubled. This ready means of providing useful and profitable employment should not be lost sight of, having regard to the desirability of encouraging secondary production in South Australia. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping to ask his colleague to look into this matter with a view to seeing whether the company##'##s requirements of yarn can be met. </para>

                    <para>During the debate this afternoon the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> flayed the Government for what he described as its failure to tackle the problem of providing houses for the people. The provision of housing for the people, however, is a matter which falls within the province, not of the Commonwealth Government but of the governments of the States. Bo##'##.h the right honorable gentleman and the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> have predicted the fall of the present Government following the next elections, on this very issue. I remind them, however, that the stocks of the Country party in Queensland are so low that that party recently lost East Toowoomba, formerly a strong Country party seat in the State legislature, to a member of the Labour party. The Leader of the Australian Country party referred to the experience of a constituent of his who having advertised for letting a five-roomed house-fully furnished and fronting a. tram-line, for 37s. 6cl. a week received 1,000 applications from people anxious to rent the property. I am surprised that he did not get 2,000 or 3,000 applications from people willing to pay ##Â£##2 to ##Â£##3 a week for the house. Honorable members opposite know only too well that the control over building materials exercised by the Commonwealth  is limited to those not commonly produced in all States; the remainder are controlled by the States. As critical statements have been made by members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party blaming the Federal Government for not immediately providing houses for the people, it is only right that the people should be informed of all the facts relating .to the housing shortage. Twenty years ago the then Nationalist Government told the people that ##Â£##20,000,000 had been made available for the erection of new homes. But what became of the money? Only ##Â£##1,500,000 was expended, and nothing further was done. When moves were made, to secure for this Parliament, power over housing, the- Leader of the Australian Country party and his followers opposed them with vigour. I suggest that the right honorable gentleman should say to the thousand applicants ##"##for the home about which he told us to-day ##"## I opposed the referendum that would have given power to the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate for the housing of the people; therefore I am. responsible for your inability to secure a house##"##. When the right honorable member for Tarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> was Prime Minister he appointed a committee consisting, amongst others, of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Herbert</inline> Gepp and Professors Brigden, Giblin and Hytton to inaugurate a plan of works to provide jobs for the unemployed. The committee submitted a list of works which included the construction of workers##'## homes. The banks, however, being the masters of finance, refused to make the requisite money available and the proposal was abandoned. In 1934, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> promised to assist in the building of homes in order to abolish slum areas; but after the elections he refused to do anything. In 1936, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> despite ##'## his election pledges, said that the government could not do anything in the matter. In 1938, the right honorable gentleman said that it was quite impossible for the United Australia party government to take part in any programme of home construction for the abolition of slum areas. In 1939, the present Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> came into the picture as Prime </para>
                    <para class="block">Minister, and in May of that year refused to make money available for a re-housing plan for the people. The right honorable gentleman then said that this country was at war and that the exigencies of .the war would prevent him from saying whether or not we could build houses, but that the outcome of the war would determine the matter. We should endeavour to secure what we have, been able to hold as the result of the magnificent efforts of our fighting services, and I firmly believe that if the people stand by the##'## present Government at the next elections all their troubles will be ironed out smoothly and quickly. For years prior to the war, religious bodies, the Labour party and other organizations urged the government of the day to make provision for a national housing scheme. They drew attention to the appalling conditions in which people were living, and detailed the horrors of slum areas. During those years thousands of people were out of employment and material was cheap, but successive governments supported by honorable members opposite, by whatever name they were known at the time, remained adamant and refused to assist in any way. Had they done so there would not be such an acute shortage of houses as there is to-day. Honorable members opposite will gain little prestige by telling the people that the present Government is responsible for the housing ills that exist to-day. The people know only too well that when honorable members opposite were in power they could not agree among themselves and were forced to hand over the reins of government to a party which could speak with the voice of unity. Labour took office in the darkest period of Australian history. At that time Japan entered the war and we found ourselves totally unprepared and threatened with invasion. I recall to the memory of honorable members opposite the threats made by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> that he would resign from the government of which ##'## he was a member because he was dissatisfied with the manner in which that government was preparing for war. The honorable gentleman gave effect to his threat. Later the Labour Government organized Australia and in doing so had to place every available man in the forces to stop the downward march of the Japanese. Would any sane man suggest that the Government should have released men from the Army, and provided materials that were urgently required for defence purposes when we were fighting for our very existence? It is known that the Americans at first established their head-quarters in Australia, and that we had placed on us the obligation to provide them with whatever accommodation we could make available. This, of course, accentuated the position ; but it was unavoidable. The Government, however, was. fully aware of the housing shortage. In conjunction with the Governments of. the States, it inaugurated a plan for the erection of thousands of homes in the post-war period. In passing, perhaps it is necessary to remind the people that the Commonwealth Government has not power under the Constitution to build any homes except war service homes. That is an inescapable fact. Despite the position in which we were placed, 115,000 homes and fifteen hostels, which are accommodating 4,600 persons, were built during the war. All that it can. do is to make finance available for the building of homes by other authorities. Since the present administration has been in office, ample funds have been provided for home construction. What I am now about to say may be of interest to the people. Between July and December last, 6,000 homes were erected by the Government and private enterprise, and 8,000 were in course of erection. To-day, the number -is substantially greater. Unfortunately, there is still a shortage of building materials, and this prevents the more rapid erection of houses; but it is being gradually overtaken, and there is every hope that the number of homes erected weekly will increase in the future. I repeat that had the United Australia party, as one of the parties opposite was then called, carried out its pre-election promises, and had it considered the welfare .of the people who were living in deplorable conditions, the position would not be so serious as it is to-day. Having done nothing, it now has the audacity to try to attach to. the present Government, the blame for the lack of houses. This Government has endeavoured to assist the States in every possible way. The responsibility is now on the States to utilize all the resources they can marshal and allocate materials to  the most necessitous cases.. There are various house-building organizations in the different States. It is not my intention to quarrel with what has been done by any of them. I merely . emphasize that the whole of the responsibility for housing the people, apart from the provision of war service homes, now rests with the States, and it will be futile for honorable members opposite to try to convince the people that the Commonwealth is the responsible authority. Housing is undoubtedly a national problem. The people are entitled to decent homes. But it was just as much a national problem in the pre-war period as it now is in the post-war period. This Government realizes that and, in consequence, in conjunction with the State governments, is doing its utmost to alleviate the position as -rapidly as possible. The problems that confront us will be solved only by facing the facts, not by trying to besmirch an opposing political party. I assure honorable members opposite that South Australia is not now under any illusions as to which authority has been responsible for the issuing of permits for house construction and the pro-  vision of the necessary materials. We shall prove that we have endeavoured to do everything possible to alleviate the position. </para>

                        <para>. ##'## - I have listened with interest to the apology of the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Sheehy)</inline> for the complete failure of the Government to achieve anything in regard to housing in the Commonwealth. According to him, the responsibility for the present position rests not on the Common wealth but on the States. This afternoon, we were treated to an amusing spectacle by the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini),</inline> who cannot get any houses built. The former Leader of the Australian Labour party in New South Wales, the Honorable J. T. Lang, has pointed  out- that the Government of that State is bringing down what he has described as ##"## brick bills##'####"## ; but there areno bricks. That is the position, in which the Commonwealth Government stands. It brought down legislation to grant aid to the States for the purpose of house construction, and laid down certain conditions that had to be observed. It is not my intention to discuss the failure of the Government to build houses. I merely point out that the housing scandal embraces not only. its. failure to build houses but also its failure ##"##to police the administration of the States in respect of the manner in which prospective tenants of houses that have been built are being treated. I have before me the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Kilgour,</inline> of Murrurundi, who about eighteen months ago made application for one of the houses that had been built by the New South Wales Housing Commission. In her application, she stated her circumstance in plain terms, indicating the amount of income that was coming into the home, and said that she would not be able to pay a high rent. On two occasions in the last eighteen months, while in Sydney, she called on and interviewed the assistant secretary of the Housing Commission who informed her that, on account of her circumstances, she would not have to pay a rent of more than about 8s. or 10s. a week. On the 19th November last, she drew one of the houses in a ballot, and three months later, on the 26th February of this year, received telegraphic advice that she could sign. a lease and take possession of the house. When her representative went to Sydney he was informed that the rent of the house would be ##Â£##1 13s. a week. </para>

                        <para>. - It is evident from this debate##'## that the Opposition finds it impossible this year to deal with any subject without introducing party politics. Realizing that there is to be an election this year, one can understand the anxiety of honorable members opposite to turn every subject to their own political advantage. Even the foreign policy of their own country is not exempt from their despicable tactics in an endeavour to gain a party political advantage. The Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> is to be commended on the work that he did overseas in establishing Australia##'##s right to have its voice heard in the counsels of the nations. But evidently that does not please the members of the Opposition, because they have never put their own country first. They are trying to make the next election a khaki election, and make it appear that the Labour Government is anti-British. In their view, to be pro-Australian is to be anti-British, but that is a proposition to which I will not subscribe. The Minister for External Affairs secured representation for Australia on various international bodies, but the Opposition, while admitting that the Minister enabled the voice of Australia to be heard in the councils of the world, chose to doubt that this would be to the advantage of Australia. As a matter of fact,  the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> made this statement - </para>

                    <para class="block">Perhaps it may be necessary, even at the risk of evoking adverse criticism from -the Opposition, to correct a false historical assumption. To-day, Australia is not regarded, as part of the British Empire, but it is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Ever ##'## since the Balfour declaration of 1926, and since the ##'## passing of the Statute of Westminster, Australia has the power to make decisions in respect of external affairs. Therefore, honorable members opposite who continually refer to Australia as if it were still a colony subservient to some authority overseas, are doing a disservice to this country. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition said that there ought to be prior consultation between members of the British Commonwealth of Nations before the holding of international conferences so that a measure of agreement might be reached. That proposal is quite satisfactory, and the practice is, in fact, followed by the Government. We endeavour to consult with other members of the British Commonwealth in order to see if there is a common basis upon which to approach international bodies, but if Australia finds itself unable to accept the British viewpoint it is not bound to do so. Australia has the right to express its own opinion, and thus it is well for Australia. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition divided his speech into two parts. He first tried to belittle the efforts of the Minister for External Affairs, and he then availed himself of the opportunity, as have conservative interests in other parts of the world, to whip up the fervour of the people in order to get them ready for another war. In view of the dreadful consequences of another war, all the peace-loving elements in the community and all democrats ought to be alive to what is happening. They should warn the people of the danger confronting them because, without the support of the people, no war is possible. The ex-Prime Minister of Great Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill,</inline> recently made a speech, and immediately the Leader of the Opposition rushed in and said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> had spoken for Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> cannot speak for Australia any more than, can the Leader of the Opposition. What both those gentlemen have to learn is that they were defeated at the polls, though it seems to be extraordinarily difficult to make them understand it. The Leader of the Opposition lost his Prime Ministership away back in 1941, but he cannot realize that he is not still speaking for Australia. The only man who can speak for Australia to-day is the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> who is also the leader of the Labour party. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> spoke for the old tories of Great Britain, but honorable members opposite have tried to make it appear that we cannot criticize the actions or utterances of a public man in Great Britain without being anti-British. That is ridiculous. If some one in Great Britain were to criticize the Leader of the Opposition in Australia we should not regard that as being anti-Australian. We should regard it as good common sense. The old tory section in Great Britain has a good deal to answer for, not only in regard to world conditions generally, but also in regard to the responsibility for the last war. There were elements in Australia as well as in Great Britain who were anxious to strengthen the dictators in Europe, to give them support and to finance them, even while they were breaking treaties, because they believed that, at all costs, the Russians should be kept down. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Minister for External Affairs was seeking to appease the Soviet Union simply because he is not prepared to play the game of the Conservatives; because, in fact, he is anxious to preserve world peace. We know that it is the people who make the sacrifices in time of war, and we are more concerned about the wellbeing of the people than about the commercial interests represented by honorable members opposite. I deny that there is any justification for the accusation against the Minister for External Affairs that he is seeking to appease the Soviet Union, or that he has a bias against Great Britain. However, it is evident from an examination of the facts that the Conservative element, both before and during the war, was not prepared to cooperate with the Soviet, even when we were in desperate need of its help. In order to show that the Leader of the Opposition has always -been opposed to the Soviet Union, I quote the following paragraph published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the -31st January, 1944: - </para>

The statement which I have just quoted has a very similar ring to the recent speech of the ex-Prime.

                        spoke honestly when he said that, because ever since the Russians changed their form of government, and decided to establish a different social economy in their country, they have met with growing hostility from antidemocratic forces from one end of the world to the other. The Leader of the Opposition asked why the Soviet Union is extending its frontiers, and, if, as the Minister for External Affairs says, the Soviet is following such a policy for defensive reasons, against whom is the Soviet preparing to defend itself. ##'## That is a pertinent question; but we might also ask why Prance, Britain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Belgium entered into the Locarno Pact in 1925. It was called a peace pact; but it was a pact among those nations against the Soviet Republics. I also remind honorable members of our experience of the League of Nations. The League of Nations was established after the war of 1914-18. Why did it fail? I have never had any great faith in international bodies composed of representatives of nations representing different ideologies. I am not optimistic about them, whether they be termed United Nations, or a League of Nations. I know that the great majority of the nations which formed the League of Nations never sincerely desired peace. They failed to prevent aggression. When Japan broke the League Covenant and the Nine Power Pact, what action did the League take to protect the Chinese? The Chinese were left to their own resources to defend themselves. 1 remind the honorable member for Barker that, to be neutral in the Sino- Japanese conflict was the least we could have expected of an Australian government, but a government of which he was a member was responsible for the action taken by the British Conservative government in closing the Burma Road to prevent supplies being sent to the Chinese. Those conservative governments did that in order to appease the Japanese. Those whom they represented were more concerned about their commercial interests in China, and they did not care whether the Chinese people were sacrificed in the process of protecting their investments. Then, we come to the Abyssinian war. We were told that at last the League of Nations was going to make a  a stand against aggression, that sanctions were to be imposed, and that the league was going to help the unfortunate Abyssinians. Sanctions were applied, but some one had the ##"## audacity ##"## to say that sanctions should extend to oil. Undoubtedly, sanctions in respect of supplies of oil would have brought that war to a swift conclusion ; but those interested in the oil traffic protested with the result that no sanctions were applied in respect of oil. Then came the  Hoare-Laval  pact. Italy had been declared by the League of Nations to be the aggressor, but Great Britain and France gave way to Italy and recognized Italian conquests in Abyssinia. Then we come to the Spanish war. It is very interesting to hear some honorable members opposite talk about the Atlantic Charter. What is the Charter and to whom are its provisions to extend? Is it to apply to all nations? What do honorable members opposite say with regard to the rights of the Spanish people to determine their own form of government. Not one  honorable member opposite has said one word against the Franco Government which is just as much a dictatorship, as the governments which have been deposed in Germany and Italy. Let us see what happened in the Spanish conflict. There was a non-intervention pact, which many honorable members thought would bring that war to a conclusion; but whilst Great Britain and France observed that pact, Germany and Italy were pumping supplies into the forces opposed to the democratically elected Government in Spain. The British and French Governments persisted in denying supplies to the Government forces. Franco let loose 150,000 Moors against the unfortunate Spanish people, but not one word of protest against Franco was voiced by governments which honorable members opposite supported. Honorable members opposite who are now very concerned about a few Formosans being crowded on to a vessel, did not say one word on behalf of the Spanish people when the dictators were preparing for world war by trying out war equipment in Spain. Appeasers in this country and abroad were afraid to take action against them. The same thing applied in regard to Sudetenland, yet this ##"## old Briton ##"##, the honorable member for Balaclava
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline>
                        talked about the ##"## role that they have always played ##"##. I have the greatest admiration for the British people, and a deep sense of gratitude for the sacrifices that they have made, hut I have the greatest hatred and contempt for the old Tories and Conservatives of England, because I know that they financed and assisted Hitler to re-arm. In 1935, unknown to their ally France, they allowed the Germans to tear up the Treaty of Versailles under the Anglo-German naval treaty, thereby allowing the Nazis to get ready for war. Yet because we criticize those actions we are accused of being anti-British. I remember when
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline>
                        whom the honorable member for Balaclava applauded, was negotiating with Hitler. In an effort to prevent war, he made a personal visit to Hitler. I believe that if wars can he prevented by negotiation, they should be prevented. But what I object to is not that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline>
                        went to confer with Hitler but that while he was prepared to confer with Hitler, he sneered when a suggestion was made in the House of Commons that he should confer also with Stalin. That was a deliberate affront to a country to which we eventually owed so much for having saved us from German aggression. During this debate, members of the Opposition have stated that the Russo-German pact was actually signed while British representatives were in Moscow negotiating an agreement with the Soviet. .The fact is that the British were prepared to negotiate on the highest ministerial level with the Nazis, but sent to Moscow the equivalent of a second-rate clerk to negotiate with the Soviet. So we can see that Russia had every reason to feel that##'## a studied insult had been inflicted upon her.
                    </para>
                    <para>Let us be fair about this question .of responsibility for the present distrust which exists. Three great nations - Russia, Great Britain and the United </para>

All three shared in the struggle, and bore common sacrifices. I ask honorable gentlemen opposite, would not it tend to create suspicion if one party to the agreement suddenly##'## discovered that the two other partners were -withholding from it some vital information about, atomic energy? Some honorable members contend that the encroachment by the Soviet Union upon other territories ##'##can be construed only as a threat against the United States of America and Britain. Is it not only right to assume that if America and Great Britain withheld the very important information concerning the atomic bomb from the Soviet, they did so simply because they believed that at some time in the future, somewhere, they would have to use this great- instrument of destruction against the Soviet? Would not that lead to suspicion? And that is exactly what has happened ! </para>

                    <para class="block">That aptly sums up the attitude of the British conservatives at the commencement of the last war. The Opposition is afraid that capitalism is crumbling, and already those who control international finance are moving in ari endeavour to repair the damage that has been done to their cause by the return of Labour governments throughout the world. What is troubling Conservative interests to-day is the fact that the people, as they term it, are ##"##moving to the Left##"##. They are electing Labour governments, and Labour governments are a real challenge to the right of capitalism to carry on as it did before the  waT.  So we find that even now, honorable members opposite would be prepared to sell the self-determining rights of this country and its self-governing powers, and to agree to the setting-up of a dictatorship if they believed it would serve the vested##'## interests which they represent in this Parliament. . I warn the people of this country that they should be mindful of this talk by the Opposition because members of it and its leader believe in dictatorships. As honorable members are aware, the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> who is  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, was a member of the New Guard, and as such was opposed to constitutional government. The very basis upon which that organization was formed was that the use of armed force was justified .when it was necessary to secure the overthrow of Labour governments. It is well known that the New Guard stored up arms in this country, and that this revolutionary organization was on the point of insurrection. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition would not object to a dictatorship so long as it was a dictatorship of the ##"##Right##"##. The Leader of the Opposition shows conclusively that he resents Labour##'##s strength in this House. He believes that Labour. men who seek the implementation of Labour##'##s policy have no right to be here. We think differently. I conclude by affirming that in framing our foreign policy we must ensure that the voice of Australia shall be heard an the councils of the world, and that it shall not be the mere echo of the voice of some other nation. It is true that as a nation we are small in numbers, but the day has long passed when people in any other part of the world can make decisions for this country. If Australia is to go to war. the decision should be made by this Parliament. Australia must assert its right as a nation, and in that regard, the Minister for External Affairs is to be complimented upon the work he has done overseas. These puny Australians who sit opposite are anti-Australian in outlook, and it is unfortunate for this country that some of them were born here. They are so narrow in their international outlook that they believe that Australians should bow their heads when they appear in the councils of the world. ##'## I am quite satisfied that when the people of Australia have an opportunity to pass judgment upon the foreign policy enunciated by this Government, they will approve in such an overwhelming manner that even the ignorant and stupid members of the Opposition will be able to understand it. </para>

The outstanding features of the speech made by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> who has just returned to this country after presiding over the initial meetings of the Security Council, were misrepresentation and failure to give credit where credit is due. In view of the Minister##'##s recent experience overseas, one would have expected him to have exhibited a broad international outlook, especially when dealing with matters of such immense moment as the peace and security of the world; but let us examine some of the statements that he made. He quoted a speech made by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> a former Prime Minister, on the 28th September, 1938.##'## in which he supported the British government of the day in its efforts to avoid the war which at that time appeared inevitable.

                    <para>I come now to ##"##the speech of the Minister for Transport. As I have said, that honorable gentleman quoted long extracts from speeches of some notable, and other not so notable men, made before the war. It is all very well to be wise after the event. Despite the Minister##'##s criticism of Great Britain, and his sneering reference to the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> when Russia was attacked on ##'## the 22nd June, 1941, the fact remains that on the 23rd June, the British Prime Minister announced that Britain was with Russia to the last. That is the answer to the Minister##'##s jeers at the Tory party of Great Britain, and its alleged desire to see Russia go under. But this is the important, point. When the war was still being waged, when Poland was conquered and lying desolate at the feet of the conqueror, when Europe was virtually in the hands of Hitler, there were a few people in the world, including the British Empire, who said that the time had come to call a halt and to negotiate a peace with Hitler. Among them were Mosley and his Fascist crew in Britain, and they were promptly and rightly interned. But there were others in Australia, too. . In November, 1939, the Minister for Transport, who has just walked out of the chamber and will not listen to what I have to say, declaring himself in favour of virtual surrender to Hitler, said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That appeasement statement, that rotten surrender to Hitler, was made two months after the war had- started, by a man who has walked out of the chamber rather than listen to what I have to say. Though we have had enough of these recriminations, it has been necessary for me as one of the spokesman of the Opposition to lay by the heels the foul charges made by the honorable gentleman who is a responsible member of the Cabinet only a few moments ago. During the whole of his speech the Minister said not one word in favour of Great Britain or of the British Empire; from beginning to end his speech was an apologia for ##"##Stalinist##"## Russia, and for all that Russia is doing to-day. The honorable gentleman accused the democratic powers of having incited Russia to aggression. I say that the issue before the House is very clear following the notable speech of the Minister for External Affairs, and it is this: ##"##What is the policy of Australia in fulfilling its obligations to the United Nations? We find  ourselves  in a position very similar to that which confronted this country and. the democratic powers in September, 1939. At that time we found increasing encroachment by Hitler, notwithstanding his repeated declaration that he had no more territorial ambitions in Europe, and that Czechoslovakia was his last annexation. We find to-day, if not a parallel position, one at least somewhat similar. We find Russia defying the Security Council of the United Nations in respect of its relations with Persia. Persia is only a small country; but I point out that Abyssinia, too, was only a small country. There were beginnings from the occupation of Abyssinia which may very well be repeated as the outcome of the occupation of portion of Persia by Russia. I hope that as a result of the United Nations using its moral voice, not because of armed force, but because of the weight of world opinion, Russia may be halted in its imperialisticand expansionist programme. We,  as one of the signatories of the United Nations Charter, are bound to take some action to bait an aggressor, whether it be Russia, the United States of America, or any other power. Unfortunately the Security Council is unable to halt a great power. It .could halt a small one, but it can do very little when it comes to one of the five big nations. The veto power of the Security Council could be exercised by any of the five big nations to prevent military operations being taken against it. We must accord- ingly depend upon mobilizing world opinion and the moral forces of the world against a would-be aggressor. But it might happen as perhaps the greatest and final tragedy of civilization that we may have again to go to war. That possibility is always in the background. We hoped in 193S that war would not be necessary, and we hope just as fervently in 1946 that it will not be necessary; but if it is necessary to take up arms against Russia where would the Minister for Transport stand? The speech which the honorable gentleman has delivered to-night- leaves us in no doubt on that question. If ever it were possible .for a man to be a Communist without having a ticket in the Communist party, I should say that man stands before us in the person of the Minister for Transport. </para>
                    <para>I wish now to draw particular attention to a matter which was raised by the Minister for External Affairs, namely, the proposal to hand over to the Trusteeship Council our mandate over New Guinea. What is the necessity for Australia to place its only vital mandated territory under the control of anybody but ourselves? It has been stated by the Minister for External Affairs that certain safeguards will be taken before this is done. The right honorable gentleman has described the council as an expert body. I do not know how it will be constituted. </para>

He has pointed out that the difference between the old mandate and the new trusteeship system is, that the right of fortification will . be, granted. Are we to ask for this right,,##'## which has been won for us with the blood and sacrifices of our soldiers in New Guinea? Shall we have1 to* go to the representatives of some nation which has not the slightest interest in New Guinea, and suggest that we be given permission to establish bases there for our own protection? The proposition is so utterly out of step  with Australian public opinion and sacrifices that it ought not to be entertained for a moment. We do not know of whom the Trusteeship Council may be composed. The whole of the terms and conditions in connexion with the handing over of New Guinea, if that be the intention of the Government, should be placed before  and be approved by this Parliament before, such a step is taken. </para>

What was the attitude of the Minister and his Government when the British Government wanted Australia to send troops to help to reopen and defend the Burma Road? He adopted a craven attitude. If words could have opened the Burma Road, and the Minister had been instrumental in its opening, there would##'## have been a highway there as broad as the Alaska Highway: The last persons who ought to talk about the Burma Road are those who did not have the courage to face up to its opening. </para>
                    <para>There are three points of foreign policy which this country has to keep in mind, despite the contribution to the debate- of the Minister for Transport. They are these : First, we must maintain solidarity in the British Commonwealth of Nations. We must maintain our membership of it and, if necessary, be prepared to play our part in defending any other member of it against aggression. That is the best security we could have at the present, juncture in a world in which might is still right. The second point is that we must be prepared##'## to exert every effort to hold that portion of New Guinea over which we hold a mandate and to establish bases in it. We must also provide our American allies with satisfactory bases in the areas with respect to which we have mandates. There is a further point which has not been elucidated by the Minister for External Affairs. If Australia holds a mandate in respect of New Guinea, and has conferred on it by the- Trusteeship Council, which it must approach for the purpose, the right to establish bases, can it in turn confer on the United States of America the right to establish bases which, from the standpoint of our security, would be equally as important as the bases we had established, or would both countries have to apply to the Trusteeship Council for permission to establish bases ? </para>

                            <para>- I would raise a force by means of compulsory training throughout Australia. Then, every man would have to play his part. That is the only way in which Australia will bo able to play its part in the Security Council, and only by such means will it have a real voice in the direction of the affairs of the world. Failing that, Australia will be no stronger than Haiti, Cuba, or any other country which has population  but is without power. We must be prepared to back up our words, as Russia is prepared to support -its policy. The Minister -for Russia in Australia in a recent public statement in this country, said that Russian foreign policy is based on the strength of the Red Army. He could not have spoken more truthfully. That is why Russia can draw an iron curtain across the whole of central Europe, march into Persia,##'## and defy the United Nations. The democratic powers, in turn, instead of singing ##"## Johnny must come home from the wars ##"##, and dissipating the military strength which it has taken so long to assemble, will have to be prepared to meet aggression should it come. Despite anything that ##'##might be said in this debate, I repeat that there are three salient, points, namely, that we must maintain our connexion with the British Commonwealth of Nations and keep it united; that we must retain control of New Guinea at all costs; and that we must revive and strengthenour defence policy in order that ##'##we may have an effective voice in the councils of the nations of the world. </para>

                    <para>. --I regret that the limited time allowed for the ##"## Grievance Day ##"## debate this afternoon did not allow some honorable members to participate in it, and therefore, I take this . opportunity to support the plea of the honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) that the Government should continue the potato control for another year. I do so because of the insufficient time allowed for the various State governments to implement legislation for the orderly marketing of the coming year##'##s crop. As pointed ##'##out by the honorable member for Darwin, the sowing of potatoes in Tasmania will commence in June, and earlier in the other States. It is regettable that hundreds of tons of potatoes are rotting in the ground in Tasmania because of the inability to secure shipping to supply the interstate markets. Unfortunately, those potatoes are deteriorating rapidly because of second growth. I urge the Government to -make every endeavour to secure shipping to enable potatoes to be sent to the mainland markets. Although we cannot secure ships to convey much needed produce to markets, Dutch ships are held . up because of the desire of the  waterside workers to dictate the foreign policy of Australia. </para>

                <para>I have already made representations to the Commonwealth Government, as well as to the Government of Tasmania, for the establishment of a comprehensive  scheme of financial assistance to primary producers who have lost heavily because of adverse climatic conditions. Severe losses have occurred to the stone and berry fruit crops from frost, hail, bush fires, and other causes. , The result is that not more than 50 per cent, of the normal crop is likely to##'## be harvested. Many growers have lost80 per cent, or 90 per cent, of their crops, and unless some financial assistance be granted to them they will be obliged to leave their holdings. The value of the fruit industry to Tasmania is estimated at ##Â£##350,000 a year. The following statement sets out the value placed upon various crops produced in Tasmania :  - </para>
                <para class="block">
                    <graphic href="186331194603212_51_0.jpg" />
                </para>
                <para>Production costs in the stone and berry fruits industry have increased by 150 per cent, since pre-war days, whilst the prices of those fruits have increased by only 50 per cent. The employment provided by the industry is . astounding. In the harvesting of the crops alone approximately 5,000 persons are employed, whilst the processing of the fruit provides employment for an additional 1,000 persons in factories.  Upwards of 400 are occupied in providing furnace wood and in driving vehicles. I urge the Government to give favorable consideration to a comprehensive scheme to be controlled and financed jointly by the Commonwealth and the State Government. I admit that the State has a responsibility in this matter. I understand that the Tasmanian Government will approach the Commonwealth Government in relation to this matter in the near future. </para>
                <para class="block"> The growers of pears and apples in Tasmania are greatly perturbed at the prospect of a big crop of apples- being allowed to rot owing .to the inability of the Government to secure sufficient refrigerated shipping space to export the fruit to the United Kingdom. Whereas in normal ##'##years several millions of bushels of apples were exported to the United Kingdom, only a small quantity is likely to be shipped this year. In 1943-44 Tasmania produced 7,500,000 bushels of apples and 590,000 bushels of pears. Unfortunately, the difficulty of providing vessels for the carriage- of fruit makes it impossible for Australian growers to dispose of their produce overseas. There is great difficulty in securing ships to supply even interstate markets. In the circumstances, I urge the Government to continue the apple and pear acquisition scheme for##'## another year, or until more normal conditions return. The scheme has been of great value to the fruit-growers of Tasmania. </para>
                <para>I pass on to deal with some of the shortcomings of the Government. I suggest that a true test of a Government is its ability to secure the happiness and prosperity of all the people. The three things which the man in the street places above all other interests are happiness and contentment, future security through being assured of employment, and adequate housing. In respect of those three essential items the Government has failed miserably. It promised that there would be employment and security for all, and that houses for both servicemen and civilians would be provided. Although it claimed to have a panacea for all ills, it has failed lamentably to keep its promises. To-day, large numbers of Australians are unemployed, and the  unem- ployment  figures are increasing almost daily. There .are not sufficient homes for the people, and there is evidence of serious shortages of food, tobacco, beer, tea, sugar and other essential commodities. The inability of the Government to keep the wheels of industry moving has resulted in a shortage of sugar and the loss of fruit valued at many thousands of pounds. There is also, a shortage of clothing, and moreover what is available is of poor quality. Pew, if any, tailors will accept orders for the early delivery of suits. I believe that Australian mills are capable of manufacturing suiting of high quality, but during the war many of them produced poor quality material, not because they wished to do so, but because an incompetent administration, thought that it was more economical and would save man power to produce shoddy material. Some good quality material was produced, but apparently it was too good for Australians, and most of it was sent to New Zealand. But for this stupid policy of manufacturing rubbish, returned soldiers to-day would find if easier to obtain suits. </para>
                <para>On the subject of employment, the Government, some time ago, issued a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Back to Civil Life,</inline> in which the following principle was laid down: ##"## Suitable jobs in the right place under the right conditions, and as soon as possible ##"##. Apparently, however, the Go##'##vernment believes that the right job for returned soldiers is a labouring job, because that is all that is offered to them at the present time, as can be demonstrated by looking up the records for Tasmania. The Government##'##s policy of preference to unionists complicates the matter. Many unions to-day have closed their books, and refuse to admit returned servicemen. Consequently, there is no job. for the man who fought for his country. He is turned adrift, and in this policy the Government acquiesces. The ideal state is one in which every worker owns his own home, and I say that notwithstanding the opposition of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> to the principle of home ownership. The short-sighted policy of the Government regarding man-power is responsible for the housing shortage today. The Government deliberately inflated the number of those in the services, .and paid no regard whatever to the needs of the home front. Manufacturers and farmers appealed for manpower to enable them to produce essential materials and to grow more food. The Government, however, ignored their appeal, although thousands of men were bored stiff in camp, and never even left Australia. This was not the fault of the men, but was due to the stiff-shirt attitude of the Government. Is it any wonder that there is a shortage of building material, house fittings, ##&amp;##c, as well as a shortage of food? As for building materials, the##'## housing departments of the State governments are hoarding materials and fittings to the detriment of private enterprise. They hold supplies far in excess of their requirements, while private builders have the greatest difficulty in getting any at all. The same difficulty has arisen in regard to the disposal of surplus army materials. All the best vehicles are being acquired by the State governments. Only recently, out of 24 army vehicles made available for distribution in Tasmania, the Government of Tasmania took 23. Man-power should have been made available during the war for the production of essential building material and for the production of food. I claim that home building should have been given the first priority. The Government, instead of hampering private building, should encourage private enterprise to build homes as the quickest and cheapest way of solving the present housing shortage. The food position has been bungled badly by the administration of befuddled officialdom. The authorities acquired all the lambs in Tasmania, with the result that farmers were obliged to kill or sell breeding ewes, and without breeding ewes it is impossible to produce lambs. As a result of this stupid policy, not a- single lamb is available for export this year. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not intend to make a window-dressing speech, because I believe that the Government is so firmly entrenched that it would take more than dynamite to shift it. I desire to bring to the notice of the Government a matter which I believe is of national urgency, and is certainly one of great importance. It should arouse, not##'## only the keen interest of the Government, but should also enlist the support of the members of the Australian Country party: As a representative of a rural constituency, I am concerned with the difficulties which beset the man on the land, and I realize that certain desirable improvements are beyond the financial capacity of the average wool-grower. The  woolproducing  industry is of primary importance to every man, woman and child in Australia. It is now threatened with the competition of synthetic fibres, and by the steadily declining quality of the wool produced. Eighty per cent, of the wool-growers produce less than 40 bales of wool a year, so that it must be obvious thatmost of them cannot afford to buy the good quality rams necessary to improve the standard of wool. Therefore, I appeal to the Government to operate stud farms for the production of well-bred stock, so as to improve the quality of our  wool,  of our fat lambs##'##, and of our beef. I urge that stud stock be sold  to  legitimate growers only, and not to persons for resale. I also urge that rams be sold at a price within the means of the average farmer, say, from 30s. to ##Â£##2 a head. I am aware that my proposal will be viciously criticized by interested persons. It will be contended that such a venture will cost the country thousands of pounds, but I contend that, in the course of a ##'##few years, the improved quality of our stock, and the increased returns to farmers, will result in an increase of revenue amounting to millions of pounds. At the same time, the quality of our primary products will be improved. In particular, the quality of wool will be improved to such an extent that synthetic fibres will have no chance of competing with it. This matter is of great importance at the present time, when thousands of returned soldiers are about to begin life on grazing and farming properties. The adoption of my proposal would ensure to no small degree their undoubted success, and in consequence. I petition the Government to give the matter its immediate sympathetic considerati on. </para>

                    <para>. - Early in August, 1945, the Department of Post-war Reconstruction, Secondary Industries Division, issued a notification to inquirers regarding the Commonwealth plywood factory at Alexandria, New South Wales. This official notification stated that the Commonwealth had erected buildings and installed plant at a##"## cost of ##Â£##68,000 at Bowden-street, Alexandria, New South Wales. It proposed to install in the buildings certain plywood fabrication plant including a hot press and dryer and other equipment valued at approximately ##Â£##62,000 whereby up to 6,000,000 square feet of plywood could he produced per annum, based on one shift working. Alternatively,##'## the plant could produce bonded plywood. The notification further stated that the Government, after full consideration, had decided that the buildings and plant should be operated as a plywood factory by way of a contribution to the housing programme. It further stated that the factory was to be available for experimental production of fittings for prefabricated houses as might be ordered by the Commonwealth departments concerned. The notification then proceeded to invite proposals from business interests to operate the factory for the Commonwealth by way of lease management fee or share interest in an operating company. The latest date for the receipt pf such proposals was stated as Saturday, the 11th August, 1945, and the proposals were to be addressed to the Director, Secondary Industries Division, Department of Post-war Reconstruction, Degraves-street, Melbourne. </para>

                    <para>. - The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> to-night reports that the Director-General of Information, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> G. Bonney, has, in effect,decided that the people of Australia must not know what the Department of Information broadcastson their behalf to the world through Radio Australia. My department knows from experience that the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> will not publish replies that rebut its silly and dishonest reports, and I am, therefore, making this statement to the House so that honorable members shall know the facts. </para>

                <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Herald##'##s</inline> report is based on a refusal by the Director-General of Information to supply it with copies of all scripts broadcast by the short-wave division since 1st January, 1946. The Director-General, when questioned by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald##'##s</inline> Canberra representative, said that the Department of Information was very busy doing a national work and was not employed to serve any newspaper group. He also stated that if the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> wished to establish itself as the inquisitor of the short-wave division, there was nothing to prevent it from buying a short-wave set and engaging a special officer to monitor the broadcasts over Radio Australia. He might have added that the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> has, in fact, recently inspected many of our shortwave radio scripts and has caused the director of the short-wave division to waste precious hours in patiently passing on to other inquiring <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> reporters short-wave information which the newspaper has not used. The Department of Information is anxious that as many Australians as possible should know the type of material it is broadcasting to the world and would welcome newspapers publishing a fair selection ofRadio Australia broadcasts instead of, as some of them have done, high-lighted unrepresentative extracts so as to place a distorted picture before the Australian public. The time of the staff of the short-wave division of the Department of Information will not be wasted in future on any more queries submitted by the Murdoch press monopoly. I have given instructions to that effect. </para>

                    <para>.- bring. to the notice of the Government the difficult position a great many poultry farmers throughout Australia find themselves in as the result of two facts, first, the ceiling prices on poultry, farm products, such as eggs and poultry for the market which have remained for more than a year completely rigid, the prices having been fixed, of course, by the Prices Commissioner, and, secondly, the rise of the cost of poultry food and material, which has been appreciable over the last eighteen months and, particularly the last six months. The figures that I propose to give will show the Government exactly the position in which poultryraisers find themselves. The most used diet for fowls is wheat. A year ago the poultry-farmer paid for his wheat 3s. l0d. a bushel landed on the farm. Less than a year ago all feed for poultry was brought under control. Supplies were reduced, and this resulted in an appreciable reduction of poultry flocks owing to the fact that poultry-farmers could not obtain the necessary feed. The reduction of flocks amounted to between 20 per cent, and 30 per cent, on an Australianwide basis. The reduction of the wheat quotas led to demands for all sorts of grain, particularly maize. The situation now is that neither wheat nor maize is available in large quantities. The quantity of wheat used by the poultryfarmer throughout Australia is estimated at 20,000,000 bushels annually. Due to the difficulty of obtaining wheat and the general rise in costs throughout the Commonwealth, merchants were forced in December last to raise the price of wheat to the poultry-farmer from 3s. lOd. a bushel to 4s. Id. a bushel. A few months ago the Government itself raised the price by ls. a bushel bringing the total cost of wheat to the poultry-farmer to 5s. 2d. a bushel, which is the present price. Thus, over the last eighteen months the price of wheat to the poultryfarmer has risen by 32 per cent., which, expressed in the cost of production of eggs, amounts to an increased cost of. production of Jd. a dozen. That increase is due to the increased price of wheat alone. It has been suggested that since wheat is in short supply poultry-farmers might use other sorts of grain. That suggestion has come from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully).</inline> It has been suggested that the poultry-farmer might use oats; but on a nutritional basis the price would work out at 5s. Sd. a bushel, against the price of wheat at 5s. Id. a bushel. On the same basis, the price of barley would work out at 6s. lid. a bushel and the price of maize at 10s. a bushel. Thus, all these suggested alternative foods will be more expensive to the poultry-farmer than wheat. The same observation applies to mash, which is made of bran and pollard; but during the last twelve months it has been impossible for the poultry-farmer to obtain either bran or pollard. The alternative is wheatmeal, but the cost of wheatmeal to the poultry-farmer is ##Â£##10 a ton, compared with ##Â£##7 a ton for bran and pollard, representing an increase of cost in respect of mash of 42 per cent. I need hardly mention the rising costs of other essentials required by the poultry-farmer in common with other primary producers, such as wire-netting, corrugated iron and wire. Over the whole range of products, whether fodder or supplies of materials, costs to the poultry-farmer have increased considerably. </para>

                        <para>- That is the crux of the position. The point I am making is that the price of eggs has remained fixed for a period of eighteen months, the winter price to the producer being 2##Â°##. a dozen. Out of that 2s. the producer has to meet the -following charges: - Stabilization price Id., commission ##Â£##d., candling, grading and accounting Id., and losses in transit, ##Â¼##d., leaving a net return to the producer of ls. 9d. a dozen. The contract price to the producer for export eggs in the shell is ls. Sd. a dozen, whilst costs incurred by the producer prior to shipping amount approximately to 4d., giving him a net return of ls. 4d. a dozen for export eggs. My point is that whilst costs have gone up in the way I have indicated by 42 per cent, in the last- eighteen months, the net price of eggs to-day to the producer is ls. 9d. a dozen for the home market, and ls. 4d. a dozen for the export market; and those prices obtained eighteen months ago. That position cannot be allowed to continue. I urge the Government to give the matter further consideration. The ##'##internal price should be raised from 2s. to 2s. 3d. a dozen in order to cover increased costs to the producer. That is only fair, if we are to keep the poultry-farmer on his holding. At the same time, it is suggested that the retail margin allowed at present by the Prices Commissioner should be reduced from 4d. a dozen to 2d. a dozen. . With regard to export eggs the present price paid . by the United Kingdom in Australian currency of ls. 8d. a dozen should be increased by 6d. a dozen. I understand that the price of eggs which are being imported into the United Kingdom from Canada is 2s. a dozen, or more, and the price of eggs being imported from the United .States of America is 3s. a dozen. I have not been able to confirm those figures, but from what I know of price levels in the countries mentioned they seem fairly accurate. It is extraordinary that the United Kingdom should be paying a lower price for our eggs than it is paying for eggs imported from other countries. </para>

                        <para>- Not twice the price ; but my point is that on the basis of the present prices he does not make up his increase of costs. I suggest that the export price might well be increased. Failing that, although I do not particularly like the idea, the Government  might consider granting a subsidy of 6d. a dozen on export eggs for a limited period to the poultry-farmer. ##"##Whilst I do not like the principle of . subsidy, I realize that when primary producers are losing money and have no way out of their difficulty, assistance by way of subsidy is better than nothing. I also point out that the price of poultry has remained fixed at ls. Id. a lb. for the last twelve months; and that price does not compensate the producer for increased costs. I ask the Minister to bear that point in mind also when he considers my representations. </para>

                    <para>The Re-establishment and Employment Act is applicable to all members of the Australian forces except enemy aliens serving in some employment companies in the Army labour units, who were enlisted from volunteer aliens who had taken refuge in Australia, and among them is a number of men considered Stateless by the Department of Immigration. They are men who left central European countries in the years between 1932 and 1939 and sought, and were granted, asylum in British countries. </para>

                    <para>These Stateless aliens, who are either applying for or have been granted naturalization papers, served in the Australian forces to the best of their ability within thelimits prescribed for their service - that is, they were permitted to serve only on the mainland. We were anxious to take advantage of their services during the war and Cabinet has decided that these Stateless aliens, provided they apply for naturalization, shall be eligible for reconstruction benefits oh the samebasis as other servicemen. </para>
                    <para>It is absolutely untrue that any of these men had been granted accelerated release to take places in universities that should be reserved for Australians as all are continuing courses commenced before the war. </para>

                    <para>With further reference to your telegram of 21st February, 1946, relative to ex-German nationals of the 8th Employment Company, I now wish to advise that inquiries have been made into this matter. </para>
                    <para>I am advised that enemy aliens are not eligible for benefits under the Commonwealth Reconstruction . Training Scheme. Stateless aliens who have applied for or been granted naturalization papers and who served in the forces are eligible for reconstruction benefits on the same basis as other servicemen. </para>
                    <para>Every man in the Australian forces who was eligible to enter second-year university classes was given the right to apply for accelerated release. To ##'##date 837 members of the forces, including 21 Stateless aliens, have been released for second or subsequent year study at Australian universities. </para>
                    <para>I would add that none of these men have taken any places that should have been given to an Australian as no applicant who was eligible has been refused his discharge. </para>

                <para class="block">It is not correct to say that all men who have completed a year##'##s study at the university have now been released to com mence their second-year course. For example, a brilliant student of the Melbourne University, who is now serving in the Royal AustralianNavy, studied law before his enlistment. But there is some qualification that if a student failed in a subject, he is not regarded as having completed a year##'##s study. Consequently, that young man is doomed to remain in the Navy for an indefinite period. At the same time, aliens who never served outside Australia take precedence over him. Doubtless, members of the Australian Country party know of similar cases. A youth in my electorate, who was dux of a. great grammar school in Melbourne, was a brilliant linguist and took an honours course after matriculation. Because he had not commenced his studies at the university when-he enlisted, he is not eligible now for release in order to begin a university course. Yet he has served in the forces for four years, including two years . in New Guinea. His father, in a letter to me to-day, stated that he had sent a registered letter to the Minister three weeks ago, but had not received a reply. That is serious. No one denies that the highesteducation possible should not be given to any one residing in Australia, whether hebe a refugee##'##- alien or an Australian national, but the best facilities should not be withheld from our own young men. I urge the Minister to re-examine this matter. I also sent to him a letter . on behalf of twenty members of the Royal##'## Australian Air Force who are still overseas, and all of whom are qualified to attend the university. But because they had not commenced a university course at the time of enlistment, they have not been granted their discharge. </para>

<para>(a) Yes. The Commissioner of Taxation has, however, recently reviewed the question of the taxation of these allowances and has ruled that the expenses (other than living expenses) incurred by the holder of the scholarship in fulfilment of the terms under which the allowances are paid to him, such as fares in travelling to the university overseas, tuitionfees, text-books, equipment, ##&amp;##c, are deductible from the allowance.
