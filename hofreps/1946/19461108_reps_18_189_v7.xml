                        <para>- I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government has financed Caledonian Collieries Limited to an amount of Â£12,000 for the purpose of re-claiming Aberdare Central Colliery, in which a fire had occurred. Since this colliery has been made secure, have the workers been informed that it is to be closed down? Has the company I have mentioned also closed another colliery, despite the existing shortage of coal supplies? If 1 have stated facts, will the right honorable gentleman take action to ensure that Aberdare Central Colliery will remain open, and thus help to provide this country with the coal that it needs? </para>

I have not examined the details, but my recollection is that the Commonwealth Government gave some assistance to the company in order to rehabilitate the mine. Following upon the representations made by the honorable member, I have asked the Minister for Supply and Shipping, under whom the Coal Commissioner exercises his functions, to have an examination of the matter immediately, and I shall endeavour to let the honorable member have the information desired by him as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Prime Minister read the reports in the Sydney press to-day of allegations that electoral rolls to be used in the Ashfield by-election to-morrow bear the names of more than 1,000 persons who do not live in the electorate? As the right honorable gentleman knows, Ashfield is a part of the Commonwealth electorate of Parkes, and at the recent general elections the Labour candidate won that seat by 164 votes. Has the Prime Minister read the charge that many of the 1,000 non-residents on the rolls had never been known to be residents of the district, that some were enrolled as living in non-existent houses, and that others had been dead for five years? If so, will the right honorable gentleman have the closest investigation made into these allegations of irregularities, and if the charges be proved correct, appoint a royal commission to make the fullest inquiry into them? Will he empower the commission to make recommendations to ensure that the election of members of the Commonwealth Parliament shall be effected by a true and proper ballot of persons entitled to vote? Will he also empower the commission to determine the effect which such irregularities had upon the return of candidates for certain federal seats, and make recommendations as to whether the necessary steps should he taken to declare invalid the elections in respect of seats which, in the opinion of the commission, are left in doubt by reason of irregularities or improper practices? </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs a question about the contraband tobacco which was recently seized in Brisbane. Why have no charges been made against the owner and occupier of the premises, namely, Thomas Alfred Foley, Secretary to the Department of Health a.n&lt;l Home Affairs in Queensland, regarding the contraband tobacco contained in eight or nine corn-sacks which were stored for about a week, and from which delivery was actually being made when the place was raided by excise officers? Has pressure been brought to bear on excise officers to prevent the laying of charges against Mr. Foley under section 1.17 of the Excise Act, and, if so, by whom ? Were any representations made to excise officers of Brisbane urging the withdrawal of the charges against Albert Henry Pianta  and Edward John Goldfinch, and, if so, by whom? Why did the prosecutor on three occasions request the adjournment of charges in the Brisbane Police Court against Albert Henry Pianta and Edward John Goldfinch alleging breaches of section 117 of the Excise Act in connexion with the possession of 545 lb. of contraband tobacco? </para>

                        <para>- This, I think, is a question which I should answer, because the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs may not have had an opportunity to study the details. As a matter of fact, the matter did not come to my notice until last week, when statements made by some of the officers concerned were placed before me. No action has been taken by any member of the Government to prevent the law from taking its course. Since the appointment of the new Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Courtice) he has discussed the subject with me, and I made it clear to him on behalf of the Government that no one, no matter what position he may hold in the country, is to be shielded from penalties to which he may be liable for committing a breach of the law. Therefore, there will be no shielding of any one by the Minister or by the Government. I am not familiar with the details of the case referred to by the honorable member, and I make no attempt to say who is guilty or not guilty. That is a matter for the courts to determine, and the law will take its course. </para>

A. Foley? It is evident from information given to the House this morning by the Prime Minister that the Government is in possession of all the facts; but, although questiontime is nearly over, no statement on the matter has been forthcoming. As the Prime Minister has stated that the Government does not intend to shield anybody, and in view of the urgency of this matter and its importance in Queensland, will he ensure that before the House adjourns to-day, a statement of all the facts "will be made? </para>

I must confess that I am not in possession of all the facts of this matter. As I indicated earlier this morning - I have no doubt that this is the intention of the Ministers concerned - whatever action the customs officers, in the course of their duty, believe should be taken in accordance with the law, will be taken. There will be no shielding of anybody by the Government. I do not know whether it is the duty of a Minister, on demand, to present to this House all the details of a matter such as this. I have read certain statements by customs officers; but I do not know whether or not they represent all the facts of the case; I shall consult the Minister for Trade and Customs to ascertain whether some statements should be made to the House but, in normal circumstances, the matter would be in the hands  of the Crown Law authorities, and whatever statements had to be made, I take it, would be made in the court where prosecutions were being conducted. I shall examine the matter, but I shall not make any promises about having a detailed statement prepared whilst the matter is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice.</inline></para>

Has the Minister anything to do with the allocation of priorities for air travel? Does he know that, owing to the acute shortage of shipping, many servicemen have been trying unsuccessfully to obtain air passages home for themselves and their wives? Is he also aware that there is a racket in connexion with priorities, and that commercial companies are accepting bookings from Australia of wives and friends of newspaper owners who are masquerading as journalists and travelling overseas on glamour tours, and returning to this country with great facility, whilst soldiers and their wives still wait wearily for transport to their new homes? </para>

                            <para>- I have read press reports of mannequins having been flown to Australia, but I have not seen any reports announcing their return to Europe. I imagined that they liked Australia so well that they had remained here. The Government has nothing to do with the allocation of priorities to persons who desire to come to Australia ; that is a matter for the overseas companies. Some months ago an announcement was made, with my authority, that the Government had discontinued priorities in respect of air travel from Australia, except for Ministers of the Crown, judges and such persons ; and even in such cases priorities are arranged by request and not by any order from the Government. I have no knowledge of what has been done in connexion with the air transport of the wives and friends of newspaper owners and others, but I ask the companies to allocate preferences fairly, so that ali classes of citizens may travel to and from Australia in the order in which they lodge their applications. </para>

I do not know of anything that I have said on this subject that was not in accordance with what I should think was the practice of successive Treasurers for many years. Since I have returned to Canberra from the storm, and fury of the election campaign I have examined not only figures of which I had some knowledge, but also those connected with statements made during the election campaign, with a view to ascertaining what degree of accuracy there was in such statements. I am sorry that I cannot promise to give detailed statements from time to time.

                        <para>- The circumstances surrounding the film <inline font-style="italic">Indonesia Calling</inline> have been a matter of a great deal of representation to the Government. As the Minister for External Affairs indicated yesterday, consideration was given to the question -whether the film should be allowed to be exported. The exhibition of the film in Australia is a matter for the State film censors. Some State censors have authorized its exhibition, while others have, I believe, refused approval. As representations had been made to Ministers as to whether or not, because of its propagandist character, the film should be allowed to be exported, I accepted responsibility for arranging for members of the Cabinet to view it. As the film was likely to be the subject of discussion I desired that Ministers be visually informed of the points at issue, and accordingly I requested the Minister for Information, whose department has the necessary screening equipment, to make the film available for snowing to members of the Cabinet. </para>

What amendments, if any, does the Government propose to make to existing legislation, in view of the recent High Court decision on the subject of preference to ex-service men and women in the Commonwealth service? Does not the Minister consider that the Government should set an example, by granting preference in Commonwealth employment without any reservation or restriction? </para>

                            <para>- I shall answer the question. In the case mentioned by the honorable gentleman the High Court held that, although the Commonwealth and its departments are bound by the reinstatement provisions of the Re-establishment and Employment Act, the procedure involving criminal liability on the part of the Government or its departments is not applicable. There is no decision affirming that the Commonwealth is not bound; on the contrary, it is quite clear that the Commonwealth and its departments are bound. Action can be taken by other procedure. An application may be made against a Commonwealth instrumentality for specific relief. Actually, a case of that character in relation to preference is pending in Sydney. The decision of the High Court has no relation whatever to the general principle that Commonwealth departments are bound. </para>

Agriculture whether any State Labour government has yet passed the complementary legislation rendered necessary by the passage through this Parliament of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act. If not,, will the honorable gentleman endeavour to explain to a. curious House the reason, for the reluctance of State Labour governments to do so? </para>

Answering the second portion of the question, I inform the honorable gentleman that the Government of Victoria found itself so overwhelmed by the  neces-Si tv  to pass legislation which had. been neglected by the previous Liberal' administration that it could not proceed with the wheat legislation earlier. </para>

                        <para>- I have received several complaints from the relatives of deceasedservicemen, particularly of men who had been prisoners of war in the Netherlands East Indies, that they have been advised that the bodies of those men have been exhumed and reburied in other places. The Minister for the Army may have read in the Press of a proposal that 'the bodies of Australian service personnel who died on Hainan Island shall be buried in Japan. The relatives of those men are most indignant.. Some have received advice that the transfer of the bodies has already been made, and that in some cases the identifications have been lost. Will the Minister inform me whether the proposal for the reinterment of Australian service personnel in. Japan has been abandoned?. Who authorized those transfers? Will the Minister ensure that in future, no such rebu rials shall be carried out without prior consultation with the relatives of the deceased ? In fact, the bodies of some Australian soldiers who died on the mainland have been reburied without the prior knowledge of the relatives. </para>

I can only say that the incident is most regrettable.. Inquiries are being made to ascertain who was responsible for the re-interment of the bodies of Australian soldiers in Japanese cemeteries. If the opportunity occurs at some later date to enable us to re-inter in an Australian cemetery the bodies of all Australian- soldiers who are bui'ied in Japan, I am quite confident that the Australian Government will attend to it. </para>

If. so, will he instruct the committee to examine the extra costs that have been incurred during the last two years of drought which has affected a large part of the dairying districts in Australia? Will it be possible to make retrospective any increase of payment.? If so, will the Minister make an announcement to that effect so that dairy farmers, who are now suffering severely from the drought and who are paying heavy charges for fodder, shall be encouraged to retain their cattle instead of selling them for beef? </para>

Some time ago, the matter was referred to Judge Sugerman, who, after examining the case, requested  a Conciliation Commissioner, Mr. Wellburn, to call the parties together. I have been informed that a Mr. Fowler, one of the officials associated with this company, is endeavouring to induce all other employers of the same type of labour to boycott the men who were previously employed at that dock. It is also stated that the Commonwealth Employment Service is doing the same thing. I wish to make it quite clear to the honorable member and to the House, that the Commonwealth EmploymentService will employ any man who can do a job that is available to him, without asking any questions about his history. </para>

                        <para>- -When the Commonwealth  child endowment scheme was introduced, income tax deductions formerly allowed for dependent children, other than the first, were abolished. It has now been represented to me that people coming to Australia from Great Britain find that as the child endowment legislation provides for a residential qualification of twelve months before payments can be made, they are in the position of being unable to secure child endowment or rebates of income tax. That, I believe, was not the intention of the Parliament, and I ask the Prime Minister to have this anomaly examined with a view to introducing amending legislation. </para>

                        <para>- My recollection is that, when the child endowment scheme was introduced, income tax was being levied separately by the Commonwealth Government and the State governments. The honorable member for Fawkner himself introduced the child endowment legislation, which excluded from taxation concessions all children in a family other that the first child. Later, when I brought down the provisions relating to uniform taxation, the concession in respect of the first child in a family was retained and additional concessions were allowed in respect of other children in an endeavour to compensate for the loss of the concessions which had been given under State taxation laws. I must confess that the matter which the honorable gentleman has mentioned has not previously come under my notice. However, I shall take steps to have it examined immediately. I understand that he claims that people with children who come to Australia from Great Britain receive neither the endowment nor the benefit of the tax concession. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs a question, <inline font-style="italic">upon notice,</inline> relative to the seizure by the customs authorities of certain parcels bearing the name of the wife of a former Minister for Trade and Customs. I asked for information regarding the interrogation of a Miss Rosetta Kelly and for the names of the persons involved. I received an answer that the Government proposed to submit the matter to the Crown Solicitor for advice as to whether a breach of the law had been committed. I now ask the Attorney-General to tell me when the matter was submitted to the Crown Law authorities and what action he has taken with regard to the matter. Does he propose to file charges immediately relative to the cases that have been presented to him? If not, when can we expect to receive some information regarding this matter? </para>

                        <para>- Does the Minister for Works and Housing approve of the policy that is being adopted by his department, with particular reference to Queensland, under which the allocation of roofing material is made on the basis of the nature of the soil on which the house is being erected rather than on the merits of the application? In other words, is material supplied for buildings that are being erected on black soil? Can he say whether one landlord is able to have dozens of houses built .for renting purposes whilst urgent cases are being neglected ? Does the Government intend to pursue such a policy, and not have regard to the merits of each case? </para>

                        <para>- In view of the discussions that are reported to be now taking place in London in respect of Empire reciprocal tariffs, is the Prime Minister able to give the undertaking that appropriate representatives of certain great Australian primary industries - for example, canned fruits, dried fruits, sugar, dairying and meat - which would be very gravely affected were there to be an alteration of the system of reciprocal tariffs which has prevailed for some years, will be consulted before the Government finally determines what attitude it will adopt towards any proposed variation of preferential duties within the Empire ? </para>

                        <para>- Before the Australian delegation went abroad, I spoke to its leader, Dr. Coombs, as did also the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman), in whose department he is employed, and asked that arrangements be made prior to the departure of the delegation for discussions to be held with representatives of those interests which might be affected by any decisions at the gathering in London. That course was adopted, and the secretaries of two organizations have thanked me personally for having given them that opportunity to place their views before the delegation. I think that I can safely say that when the delegation returns, and there is an opportunity to place all the facts before the interests concerned, the Government will be prepared to give to their representatives an opportunity to state their views. </para>

The allegation is made that, despite the prohibition applied during the war years in respect of comic strips, the importation of that material continued, and even new comic strips were introduced. Why did. not the Government enforce the prohibition? How did the newspaper proprietors obtain the dollars required for the purchase of that press material, which included not only comic strips, but also other articles of an inferior quality? </para>

They also made certain representations to me regarding the importation of comic strips and syndicated material of various kinds, and they have left several samples with me for examination. Six or seven months ago I met a deputation representing the association in Sydney, and quite recently Mr. Geoffrey James, representing the deputation, saw me again about the matter. I have asked him to set out in writing what is considered to be the grievance of the journalists regarding the importation of this syndicated material. When he does that I shall have the matter examined, and perhaps I shall ask Cabinet to consider the policy generally with regard to importations of that character. I cannot for the moment recall the amount in dollars made available for the importation of this material, but dollars have been provided to a limited extent for quite a number of matters associated with newspaper work. This aspect will be investigated, and the honorable member will be supplied with the information for which he has asked. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I take this opportunity to report  to  the House on four international matters  in  which Australia is particularly concerned. First, I shall refer to the progress achieved  in  the making of  the  peace settlements. The first group of  the  settlement deals with the enemy countries  of  Italy, Bulgaria, Rumania, Hungary and' Finland. Secondly, I shall deal with the main business now before the United Nations Assembly, and the operations of the bodies associated with the United Nations organization, so far  as  they relate to the business now before the Assembly. I shall then refer to certain matters of primary importance to Australia in connexion with the Pacific area first, the administration of Japan; and secondly, our security and welfare  in  relation to the southwest Pacific. In the course of my remarks I hope to reply adequately to the question asked by the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> regarding Manus Island to which he referred yesterday. Finally, I shall suggest to the House some general trends and principles which can be discussed by it for the assistance of the Government and of Australia. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The first matter to which I shall refer is the making of the peace settlement. The background of that is of some importance and. I invite the attention of honorable members for a few moments to an analysis of what that background and history have been. During the war, the control of the strategy of the United Nations was almost exclusively in the hands of the three big powers - Britain, United States of America and Russia. In the course of the war, as. was discovered in piecemeal fashion, and on one or two occasions belatedly, commitments were made which related, not to the control and supervision of the war effort, but to the peace settlement. One example is the declaration made by the leaders of the three nations at Cairo, which laid down certain broad settlements which were to be made affecting Japan, and, to some extent, other Pacific countries. As is well known, that declaration was made without reference to other active belligerents against Japan, but the situation had to be accepted at the time because of the war position. There are other examples of the same kind. Towards the end of the war, an arrangement was made under which Soviet Russia obtained important territorial concessions in the Far East. This is another illustration of the kind of arrangement which did not relate solely to the war effort of the United Nations as a whole, but to the final peace settlement, and it was entered into without prior consultation with other countries concerned, such as Australia and New Zealand. </para>
                    <para>The opinion of the Government is - and in this I do not think it differs materially from that of parties not represented in the Government - that whatever was done in the actual management and control of strategy, and in the direction of the war, it is essential that belligerents which took an. active and sustained part in the fighting should participate effectively in the making of peace settlements. The war effort of Australia was not confined to the Pacific. In the early part of the war Australia was one of the few countries which took a prominent part in the fighting against Germany, and we have consistently contended for the principle that this fact gives us the right to participate in the framing of peace terms. </para>
                    <para>The first positive step taken by the nations towards the actual making of peace treaties was the establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers by the Potsdam Agreement. This agreement was entered into, not by the representatives of the Big Three only, but also by the representatives of China and France. The procedure laid down under the Potsdam Agreement wasthis: The Council of Foreign Ministers was to draft peace  treaties; in the first instance with Italy, Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Finland, and afterwards the drafts would be submitted for consideration by the representatives of other countries which had been at war with those five nations. This, it will be understood, represented a departure from the principle that countries which had taken an active and sustained part in the war were to participate in the peace-making. Therefore, when the Council of Foreign Ministers assembled in London for the first time last year, we suggested that countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa should be associated with the Council of Foreign Ministers for the purpose of drafting treaties; alternatively, that whatever decisions were reached by the council should be submitted to a free and open conference of all belligerents, which would have power to modify the decisions of the Foreign Ministers. As a result of this request, it was decided by the Council of Foreign Ministers that there should be a meeting of the representatives of nations which had been belligerents against the satellite enemy countries, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Rumania and Finland. However, the proposed procedure was regarded by the Commonwealth Government as open to grave objections.  The conference which met at Paris consisted of the representatives of Great Britain, the United States of America, Russia and France - China being omitted from the Council of Foreign Ministers for the drafting of these peace treaties - and seventeen other countries, including Australia. This conference of 21 powers was to consider the draft treaties, and to make recommendations regarding them to the Council of four Foreign Ministers, which would make the final draft. Thus, there was no certainty that the conference would have any effective authority whatever in the making of treaties. Indeed, it was to be an advisory body rather than a peace conference with full power to settle the terms of peace. We realized, of course, that what was to be aimed at was unanimity. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that. On that particular point, there was much controversy. The Council of Foreign Min isters proposed to the conference at Paris a certain procedure regarding voting,, namely, that only if the conference decided by a two-thirds majority to amend any clause in a draft treaty would that decision, in the form of a recommendation, gobefore the Council of Foreign Ministers. In other words, it was necessary to get fourteen of the nations out of 21 to agreeto a recommendation before it could even be submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers. </para>

                    <para>Honorable members will agree that, although our interest in the European settlement is not so close as is our interest in the settlement with Japan, Australia nevertheless has a definite interest in the European settlement. In any case, it waspossible that the same procedure might be applied in the preparation of the Japanese treaties. It was important that the interests of Australia, and of other countries in a similar position, should be protected. Therefore, we objected strongly to the procedure. Australia proposed that a decision reached by a simple majority of the conference should be sufficient to send a recommendation back to the Council of Foreign Ministers. In other words, that eleven out of the 21 nations represented at the conference should have power, not to alter a treaty in any vital way, but to recommend an amendment for consideration by the Council of Foreign Ministers. </para>

                            <para>- As the right honorable member for Yarra remarks, we asked that a majority of the conference should have power to make a recommendation for a variation of the treaties, not that they should have power to decide upon a variation. The value of the recommendation would depend in part on the strength of the nations which made it and their war effort. We objected to the two-thirds rule on the ground that, in respect of any clause of the five treaties to which, for instance, Soviet Russia objected, it was impossible  to get a two-thirds majority because certain countries, at the Peace Conference would vote together on most issues. Instead of a statement of obvious facts being the basis of discussion, there was a tremendous objection to the facts being pointed out. My own belief was that the only way to proceed was to point out the position, not with a view to altering the treaty in any specific way, but in order to get a procedure which would give to the belligerent countries at least the right to have their views considered by their co-belligerents. In respect of Italy it can truthfully be said that the contribution to victory made by some British Dominions was probably equal to that of two of the four principal powers. There is no doubt about that. It is my viewthat not much progress can be made by burking facte. The fact is that the efforts made by countries like Australia, New Zealand and South Africa in the days before Soviet Russia was at war with Italy and after Prance had ceased to be in the war nt all, were of crucial importance. </para>

                            <para>- At the beginning of the war the Menzies Government directed Australia's war effort; later, the task was undertaken by the Curtin Government. J arn sure that the honorable member for New England- does not wish to divert me from the main point. We proposed that a simple majority of the 21 nations should be sufficient to carry a particular recommendation back to the Council of Foreign Ministers. That proposal led to a tremendous lot of discussion because it was strongly objected to. Finally, by a two-thirds majority, the conference agreed that a simple majority recommendation would be sufficient to carry a. matter back to the Council of Foreign Ministers. But here another difficulty of procedure, or pre-arrangement, arose which it is most important to bear in mind. It had been agreed by the four powers that if any one of them objected to any clause in a draft treaty the four of them would oppose any recommendation being sent back for modification. I hope that the House realizes the implications of that arrange ment. I repeat that prior to the conference it was agreed by the Governments of the United Kingdom, Russia, France and the United States of America that all of them would oppose any recommendation at the Paris Conference unless all of them agreed to the proposed modification. Thus, the rule of unanimity applied not only at the last stage of final drafting; it applied also at the stage of the Paris Peace Conference. </para>

                            <para>- It extended to all matters, great and small, as to which they had agreed, in respect of any of the five draft treaties. It, did not, extent to certain clauses, such as the clause affecting Trieste in respect of which there had not been any agreement, but it did extend to  90  per cent, of the matters to be considered. The effect of that agreement was that it was impossible, for all practicable purposes, to get, a recommendation through the Paris Peace Conference. I shall use the same illustration in order to make the position clear. I do so not to cause offence to any nation but in order to state the facts fairly. If, for instance, Soviet Russia objected to any modification whatever, Britain, the United States of America and France were bound to oppose that modification, not only at, the final stage, but also at. the Peace Conference. It meant, in effect, what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> described yesterday as a veto exercisable by any of the four powers, not at the final point, but at the preliminary point of recommendation. </para>

                            <para>- I would put it more strongly than that. Let us consider it in relation to reparations. The proposal brought forward by the Council -of Foreign Ministers in the draft treaty, and agreed to by the four nations, was that Soviet Russia would receive from Italy 1.00,000,000 dollars, from 'Rumania 300,000,000 dollars', from Hungary 200.000,000 dollars, and from Finland ;500,!000,000 dollars. Our view was that, before reparations could be determined, there should be an assessment of damage and also .of assets, and that there should be an apportionment of those assets to the belligerents which had suffered. Soviet Russia had suffered because of depredations by two Italian divisions which at -one stage of the war had ta.ken part in the fight against Russia at Stalingrad. The war effort of Soviet Russia was magnificent, but it was directed mainly against Germany, not Italy. Our view, based on what we regarded as elementary justice, was that there should not bt a guessing at figures hut a thorough investigation and a proper allocation. Accordingly, we put that view forward. We obtained support for it from four or five nations, but Britain, United States of America and France, as well as Soviet Russia, opposed it in the conference and in the committees. They were bound to do so. They were not free to review their own recommendation. I shall state frankly the justification for that attitude. 1 1; was said that it had taken so long to get draft treaties that unless a solid front were presented there was no certainty of any final treaty at all. That argument is not easily answerable, but it seemed to the Australian delegation at Paris, to the members of which I pay a high tribute, that such an attitude at the Peace Conference was not good enough for those countries which had participated in the war. It would have been better in some respects if the big nations had said : " We will stick to the draft treaties. You are free to accept them and sign them ". They did not do that in form, but it is fair to say that that is in effect what did happen. We contested that issue strongly in the belief that a similar position might arise in connexion with a settlement with Japan, where Australia's interests are more directly concerned. I shall refer shortly to the proposals we made. I do not propose to elaborate them because a full report on the Peace Treaty will be presented to the House, and the subject will be considered in detail before the treaty is ratified. </para>

                            <para>- All the clauses were reviewable in the formal sense. Each clause was considered carefully, and every country was entitled to set down amendments to every clause. But in effect and in substance what happened was that it was impossible in practice to secure agreement in respect of some clauses requiring the consent of the four hig nations. Difficulty was also experienced in connexion with boundary problems. Agreement upon certain boundaries had been reached by the Council of Foreign Ministers. However, if a disputed boundary, that is, a boundary to which one adjoining country objected, came before the Peace Conference, we proposed that there should be an investigation of the facts in relation to it. We regarded as the dominating factor the desire of the peoples concerned. In my limited observation, the tragedy of Europe is the old trend of thought that some adjustment of boundaries here and there means the settlement of Europe. The view put forward by some countries that there should be wholesale taking up and shifting of people from one place to another, ignoring the human side of the problem, struck all of us very forcibly. The proposal we made in regard to the solution of that problem was the first submitted by us. We also made :i proposal regarding Trieste. That has a bearing upon the point dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> in another connexion yesterday. Trieste is a port of great importance ; the Yugoslavs wanted it but Italy wished to retain <inline font-style="italic">it.</inline> It was suggested that there should he a form of internationalization of Trieste and its hinterland ; to that principle we gave our support. We thought that a genuine attempt to govern it internationally in the interests of the people, without giving control to either the Italians or the Yugoslavs, might :be successful; but the agreed clause provided that the territory should be guaranteed by the </para>

It was impossible for the Council to ensure the integrity of the territory. In lieu of the agreed clause we proposed that a clause agreed to at San Francisco and inserted in the United Nations Charter should be incorporated in the treaty, namely, that all parties to the treaty should undertake to respect the integrity of Trieste. In our view a governor may never be appointed, or the candidates may be so dealt with that finally an unsatisfactory governor may be appointed. The treatment of enemy colonies was another vital matter from our point of view. The draft treaty considered that the method of government, and the administration of I talian colonies should be determined by the same four principal nations in the Council of Foreign Ministers. Their view was that if they did not agree within twelve months the problem should be referred, not to the countries which had been in the war against Italy, but to the General Assembly of the United Nations, consisting at present of 50 nations, but totalling, perhaps, 60 nations by the time iiic disposition of the colonies will be referred to it for settlement. We thought that no country had a greater right to ii voice at the preliminary point of consideration - which might be the final point - than countries like Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. We put that view forward, and we at least obtained the result that it was agreed that we should be consulted. As everybody knows, consultation may vary from something perfunctory to something which means real participation. When we put that proposal forward, the rule of the foul- was again operative and we were met with an impossible position in our attempt to obtain even a bare majority recommendation. Another matter on which we suggested amendments to the draft was the problem of human rights. As to that I should like to make quite clear to the House just what is involved in the proposal which we made. The proposal was simple in principle. Each of the treaties with the five countries had a clause similar to that inserted in the treaty dealing with Rumania, which reads - </para><quote>
                        <para>Rumania shall take all measures to secure to all persons under  Rumanian  jurisdiction, without distinction as to race, ses, language or religion, the enjoyment of human rights and of the fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression, of press and publication, of religious worship, of political opinion and of public meeting. </para>

                            <para>- That is a different point. These rights were to operate in the countries which were parties to the treaty, such as Italy and other enemy countries. We put forward two proposals. We said, first, that these were human rights and that they should also operate in territories which were ceded from enemy countries, and that, consequently, some tribunal should be established to enforce them against nations which infringed them. In this country we are familiar with orders made by courts in respect of such matters. </para>

I admit that, in the last resort, we would have to depend upon the public opinion of the world. There was never a case where a demand of the International Court made during the period between the two wars was not given effect by the defeated litigant. At any rate, there was some basis for the view that if agreement were reached for the establishment of such a tribunal, the agreement would be effective. </para>

                            <para>- It did not deal with political action, or movements of forces, or threats to move forces, because such matters were not clearly legal matters; but in all matters susceptible to legal decision the court had jurisdiction, and it still has under the San Francisco Charter. Finally, admitting all these difficulties, and the need to provide machinery to get stabilized treaties, we said, in effect, " If you cannot agree to this because of your arrangements, we think it is desirable to make provision in the treaty for a review of it under certain conditions and safeguards ". That was a reasonable proposal, but itmet with the fate of other proposals. We got the conference to accept the establishment of a Reparations Commission, but without interference with the precise amounts to which I have referred, because they were agreed to; and certain minor modifications were made. The importance of the position from the point of view of Australia is that what looked to be a question of procedure became a question of vital importance. The majority rule did not mean that a mere majority could effect, a modification of the treaty. Ultimately, such a treaty must be made either separately or unanimously ; but it was the procedure that affected us greatly, because of the possible repercussions upon the Pacific settlement. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; however, the machinery for trying it may be improved. But is was impossible to do that in the fullest sense at the stage when the Council decided to call a conference. The view put forward by the British Government was that unless the major powers agreed to support each other there \i ould be no conference at all. The broadest answer to that is that it is better not to have a conference at all than to have a conference which cannot be effective. </para>

                            <para>- Even that procedure has been known to produce change, regardless of party. The difficulties can well be understood by the House; but there are also rights to be considered. That is the view which we put, having in mind Australia's contribution to the Allied victory, and those are the proposals I have summarized, which I submit were quite reasonable. The position now is that the treaties have not been signed. They are back before the Council of Foreign Ministers which is dealing on a inly, almost exclusively, with claims which had not been agreed to by the council before the conference. The council is now sitting at New York for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- Australia is continually in touch with the United Kingdom representative, but it is not quite practicable to deal with the matter in that way. We discussed these matters, for instance, at the conference attended by the Prime Minister when he was in London. Certain aspects of Italian colonial questions were raised there, and no difficulties were found. The difficulty in the way of the British Government is that unless it accepts certain things which we do not like, we shall not he able to get the things which we prefer. It becomes a compromise, which is inevitable in a peace treaty, but in a discussion positive suggestions to overcome difficulties would be of value. </para>

Australia is represented there, and one of the main proposals wc have brought forward is to reconsider the application of the veto. I have shown that the veto was incorporated in the proceedings at Paris; but in the Charter of the United Nations there is express provision for the exercise of individual veto by any one of the five powers, not upon enforcement action, but upon conciliation  action  to settle a dispute - conciliation action not by an order operating against the parties, but by recommendations. The view we put forward at San Francisco has previously been stated publicly. Undertakings were given that there would not be a capricious use of the veto power. Of course, turning it around, the veto principle means the principle of unanimity of the powers, and it is always so described by its advocates. It is said that the veto means, in effect, that the five countries which have the right to exercise the power of veto have to agree; but to say that five people have to agree is not to tell us anything about the way in which they are to agree. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Exactly. When there are differing points of view, the dispute is submitted to the Security Council, and I believe that it is fair to say that, in some respects, the Security Council ought to exercise a quasi-judicial authority and ensure a. fair settlement of the dispute. The object of the veto power is that the Security Council should not order some thing to be done, but should suggest solutions to the parties. That attitude is not unreasonable. The proposal that we put forward at San Francisco that, for conciliation and peaceful settlement, there should be no veto, is absolutely reasonable. If necessary, in the emergency that has arisen, because we must avoid the breaking up of the organization, we should retain the veto in relation to enforcement action. Otherwise, the organization might be completely destroyed in the early stages of its life. But what is the point of the veto in relation to conciliation? Conciliation should not be the right of the Security Council to exercise as it thinks fit. It should be the duty of the Security Council to conciliate, and suggest ways of settling disputes. </para>

                            <para>- The view is that it means, in effect, that the five nations have got to agree and that, therefore, the veto will encourage them to 'agree. I have 11Ot found any evidence of that. On important questions which have arisen in the last ten months, I have not found any indication of a prior attempt even among, the five nations themselves, to suggest how the matter should be settled : I do not like the idea of attempts to reach agreement among themselves for this reason. The Council consists of five big countries that are the permanent members and have the right of veto, and six other countries which are elected. Australia is one of latter. These six countries have their rights on the Security Council, and they have a duty to the countries which have elected them to put their points of view. </para>

The result is that the Security Council is in this appalling position that nothing may be done about a dispute which has come before the organization. From the beginning, you know that nothing can be done about it. Bitter speeches are made, this way or that way, and you are always conscious of the threat that, at the end, the next business will be called and no recommendation or suggestion can be made by the Council. </para>

                            <para>- Provided the veto applied to enforcement action, I think it is quite probable, but that is speculation. Certainly at San Francisco, the nations were extremely anxious to sign the charter. Some feared that if particular proposals were put forward, such as Australia's proposal to give the Assembly wider powers of discussion and recommendation, a particular country would leave the conference. However, I believe that that view did not really represent the intentions of the countries concerned. As I stated, the power of veto may not be removed unless each country possessing the right to exercise it consents. Cuba has put forward a proposal to amend it. What Australia has done has been to raise the question in an endeavour to get a resolution expressing the opinion of the nations that the veto should not be used in respect of matters relating to peaceful settlement and adjustment. </para>

                    </continue><para>The next matter which is before the Assembly, is the report, of the Atomic Energy Commission. As to that, the question of the veto again arose, but in a somewhat different form. The United States of America has been criticized for its attitude towards atomic energy and the possession of the atomic bomb. Three countries contributed to the development of atomic energy for the purposes of war, namely, the United States of America, Great Britain and Canada. When matters relating to atomic energy are being considered, the Security Council of eleven members, and Canada, constitute the Atomic Energy Commission. The United States of America has submitted a proposal which I may explain in this way: " We .are prepared to give up the use of atomic energy entirely for the purposes of war. and destroy our stock piles, provided it is done in an orderly way and with proper timing, and provided, above all, that every nation agrees not only that it will not use atomic energy for purposes of destruction, hut also that it will submit to an international system of inspection and control for the purpose of ensuring that atomic energy shall not be so misused ". This relates to the particular problem of disarmament, and I do not consider that the attitude of the United States of America is unreasonable. Seldom in the history of the world has an attitude of that kind been adopted by a country which, like the United States of America, possesses a monopoly of a particular weapon. It is not as if this particular weapon alone is the likely cause of war. Many weapons of tremendous power were invented during World War II., and the atomic bomb is only one part of the supreme problem of preventing war. However, this was a step forward, and the Assembly,  when  it met in London, asked the Security Council, with the addition of Canada, to investigate this matter. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Yes. In the mandated territories which Japan controlled, no right of inspection was permitted for the purpose of seeing whether the Japanese were fortifying them. In any case, what objection could there be? At this stage, I should like to pay tribute to the scientists, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Briggs</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Oliphant,</inline> who were advising us at New York. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Oliphant,</inline> who is an Australian, is now a professor at Birmingham. He was one of the inventors of the radar system, which was so important in World War II. The scientists say that, if the raw materials, uranium and thorium, from which atomic energy is derived, are controlled, it is practicable to have a system of control and inspection which will effectively prevent the misuse of atomic energy and enable the energy to be used for the purposes of peaceful development, particularly in connexion with power. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lilienthal,</inline> who is associated with the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States of America, was closely connected with this problem. The scientists believe that, for the expenditure of the amount of human energy that took place. during World War II. it will be possible, within four or five years, to have atomic energy for commercial purposes. </para>

                            <para>- That is a question that I have endeavoured to have answered. One reason is the contribution made by the United States of America to the development of the atomic bomb. However, the right honorable gentleman can take it as a fact that the United States of America has a monopoly of this information. It will have that monopoly for only a limited period, of course, because scientists of other countries will be busy on atomic research. </para>

                            <para>- The view which I have put is that expressed by the United States of America to the Atomic Energy Commission, and, broadly speaking, that view was supported by all countries represented on the Commission, with the exception of Soviet Russia and Poland. Russia's view was that we should start off by having an agreement between nations never to use atomic energy for warfare. Such an agreement, of course, would operate immediately against the interests of the United States of America, because of the monopoly of atomic energy knowledge to which I have referred. The United States would not accept that proposal, and considerable criticism of America has been voiced because of that refusal. However, America's attitude that any agreement in regard to a weapon of this character should be negotiated in conjunction with the establishment of a system of impartial, international control, seems to be reasonable.

                            <para>- I am glad that the honorable member has raised that point. At the Paris conference, Russia also raised the question of disarmament, and one of the matters discussed was the disposal of the Italian fleet, some of the vessels of which were divided amongst the four great powers. Australia suggested that the question of the disposal of the Italian fleet, over and above that portion of it to be retained by Italy, should go to the United Nations for determination in accordance "with the Charter, but that proposal was rejected. Russia has supported, and is supporting, any step that will lead to disarmament on a basis that will give security - real security - and lessen the enormous burden that the people of the world have to hear. That matter has actually been considered by the Assembly, and will be submitted to the Security Council for determination. </para>

                    </continue><para>I shall not delay the House further in connexion with that important meeting. Our views on that subject are generally known and appreciated. Our sole object has been to make the Charter workable. It is useless to have the Security Council debating matters publicly at great length without reaching any result. Nothing could be worse than to permit speech after speech on a particular issue, and then to allow the matter to be dropped without obtaining the considered judgment of the Council, or some precedent or guidance for the future activities of that body. That view is gaining ground throughout the world. Most nations are in favour of some modification such as we have suggested. </para><para>I shall now describe the form of control operating in Japan. There are two controlling bodies. One is the Far Eastern Commission, which sits in Washington. At first, ten nations were represented on it, and in December last Soviet Russia came in as the result of a decision reached in Moscow by the Council of Foreign Ministers. There again the veto intrudes. No policy decision can be reached at Washington except by agreement of the four great powers. Any one of the four can prevent a decision hy exercising its right of veto. In this case France is excluded, but China is included. What happens in practice, of course, is that the veto is not exercised. Agreement may be reached amongst ten of the eleven members of the Far Eastern Commission, but the eleventh, may say, " We cannot accept the proposal at present". In these circumstances, the threat of the veto hangs over the deliberations of the commission, and a country possessing the right of veto can always have a matter adjourned for a considerable time because the commission does not wish to see the veto power exercised. I attended meetings of that body last year when it agreed upon the general policy for Japan, which I  endeavoured to sum up before the previous Parliament. I think the commission aimed at the establishment of a really democratic Japan, and its proposals were, in fact, accepted in a preliminary way by all who 'attended the meetings. However, although that policy came before the commission after it was reconstituted in January - ten months ago - it has not yet been issued to General MacArthur, who, as Supreme Commander, administers the occupation of Japan. General MacArthur is bound by the policy decisions issued from Washington, which, in my opinion, are not issued frequently enough. The general policy is not yet fixed. That places a special burden on the Advisory Council at Tokyo, which can do no more than advise General MacArthur. The council consists of a representative each of America, Russia, China and Australia. The Australian delegate also represents Great Britain, New Zealand and India. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- That is so, but I am not dealing with the technical distinction between the two. These are the facts. The absence of policy direction from Washington, or the delay in it resulting from the system which I have mentioned, is embarrassing to the administrative body in Japan, which is supposed to deal with the detailed execution of policy. That policy should be settled by the Far Eastern Commission at Washington. </para>

                            <para>- The policy governing the occupation of Japan, which is binding on General MacArthur, is determinable by the Commission at Washington. The advisory body at Tokyo is merely there to advise the Supreme Commander as to the details of the policy, which should be settled, and settled fairly promptly, at Washington. Therefore, delay in the determination of that policy means that the advisory body has much less to do than it would otherwise. It deals with administrative and executive matters, as distinct from policy matters. </para>

                            <para>- The answer to that question will be an excellent illustration of the position. The constitution was not referred to the Japanese people; it was made by the Japanese Diet. Certain aspects of it were objected to by countries represented on the Far Eastern Commission, but the United States representatives said very strongly, in effect: " Well, we must make a start in this business. Let the constitution operate." Other countries, including Australia, said : " Yes, but let there be a provision in the constitution that the Japanese people may review it after some years of operation." The fact is that the constitution has been formally promulgated in Japan without the additional provision for a review having yet become operative. However, we hope that it will be made operative. In other words, the machinery which I have mentioned causes delay, which tends to prevent the  full operation of the decisions of the overwhelming majority of members of the Ear Eastern Commission at Washington. </para>

                            <para>- I propose to deal now with three matters relating particularly to the South-West Pacific: first, the matter of regional security, with particular reference to Manus Island; secondly, the welfare of the native peoples of that area ; and thirdly, the particular problem of the administration of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. </para>

                    </continue><para>With regard to the general problem of Pacific security: Having regard to the experiences of the war, it has been the policy of the Government - the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has announced it, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> did so previously - to secure some satisfactory regional system which would not exclude the system of security to be provided for by. the United Nations Organization, but would be supplementary to it. Manus Island furnishes an illustration of the problem, and I shall therefore refer shortly to it. Manus Island is in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. A base was established on it by our allies, the United States of America, during the war, and that base was of great importance. With regard to the use of the base in these post-war years, two extreme views have been put. One is the extreme view, expressed in some quarters, that the war is over ; the United States of America did this as a part of its war effort in the Pacific; the island is under Australian control, and there is no further function for the United States of America to perform. The other view is equally extreme, namely, that although the security of this Admiralty group of islands, of which Manus Island is the main territory in question, has been gained in part by the efforts of Australian troops - and not this island only, but also the whole area of New Guinea, is sacred soil to Australians - Australia should say that if the United States of America wants to have control of Manus Island, it may have that control. That would be an impossible position in point of international law and practice, because Australia is a trustee or mandatory over it, and the matter could not be settled in that way. The Government has taken neither view. We have had consultations with the British Government and the New Zealand Government, in relation not to Manus Island only but to the whole matter of Pacific regional security. We have said, in substance, that we should like to continue, in time of peace, that co-operation with the United States of America in the security of this region for defensive purposes which we enjoyed during the war, and that therefore we would be prepared, in conjunction with the other British countries concerned, to enter into an honorable, self-respecting arrangement which would provide, among other things, for - by way of illustration - the reciprocal use of bases in that area. Under such an arrangement - again by way of illustration - it would be possible for the American Navy to use facilities at Manus Island, but not control them. In the same way, our Navy and Air Force would be able to use facilities that are controlled directly by the United States of America, the matter of finance and of the proper places to be selected to be determined after the principle had been agreed upon." I submit that, if that intermediate view found acceptance, it would do justice to the tremendous effort of the United States of America in the Pacific, and would also maintain the position of Australia in the SouthWest Pacific. Much has been published in the newspapers, proceeding from some committee or other which does not speak with the authority of the Government of the United .States of America. But broadly, this view commended itself to the British Government, to the New Zealand Government, and to those American authorities with whom I discussed the matter. I do not want to say much more about it, because, so far as I know, negotiations are still in train; I have no reason to think otherwise. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I do not think so. There may have been a withdrawal of some of the forces that had been there. The honorable member surely would not support the proposition that, although this territory is under Australian control, and although Australian forces have contributed unstintingly to its security in their efforts for the common defence of these parts against Japanese aggression, we should relinquish control at the dictate of another country! The United States of America, I am certain, would not wish that Jo be done; and I am sure that the Australian people would not tolerate it. That involves no criticism of the United States of America, but it is a frank statement of our position. </para>

                            <para>- We have never been a trustee of the territory. The mandate system remains until a new trustee system is established. I would not regard a unilateral entry of any country as a satisfactory solution of a problem which is not confined to Manus Island as a base. This is only a part of the Pacific picture, and it cannot be isolated from the other areas in the Pacific. The two extreme views that I have mentioned are always cropping up. One has been expressed in this House by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who played such an important part in Australia's obtaining control of New Guinea. He would not tolerate any mutual agreement. On the other hand there is the view, which seems to me to be equally extreme and wrong, that we should say to the United States of America, " Here it is. Incidentally, it is not ours ; we are only a trustee or mandatory over it. Do what you like ". Prom the conversations that I had with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Byrnes,</inline> Admiral Nimitz, and others, I had every reason to suppose that a satisfactory arrangement would be come to, not aimed against any country but with a view to sharing the necessary expense and the heavy obligation imposed by the defence of such a vast area of the Pacific. I have no reason to suppose that some such arrangement will not be come to. Perhaps it has been postponed because of the tremendous concentration of the American State Department on the other international problems to which I made reference this morning. Manus Island is only one of the places that are involved in a proper regional plan for the reciprocal use of bases. Also involved is the use of other bases, including British possessions such as Fiji, possessions held jointly such as Canton, and New Zealand possessions. I believe that to be the way in which the burden of defence can bie shared by peace-loving nations, not aimed against any country but for defence purposes only. </para>

                    </continue><para>The second matter to which I want to refer is the welfare of the peoples of this vast area. I only want to point out that, in accordance with an agreement that had been made with New Zealand, the Prime Minister and I, at the Conference of Prime Ministers, sought the co-operation of the British Government in the establishment of a permanent advisory commission for the South Seas which, dealing not with political or boundary matters, but with the most important matter of all - the welfare of the native peoples of  Melanesian  and Polynesian areas throughout the region - would endeavour to meet regularly and have a permanent organization for the exchange of information, and whose members would afford help . to one another. The idea of such a commission has been approved by the Government of Great Britain, and the Governments of Australia and New Zealand conjointly have invited the United States of America, Great Britain, France and the Netherlands to a conference to be held in Canberra in January. I am sure that those countries will participate in that important part of the south-west Pacific welfare work. </para><para>On the 7th August last, reference was made in this Parliament to the trusteeship proposal in relation to New Guinea. The <inline font-style="italic">Government is</inline> committed to the principle of international trusteeship of dependent territories, by which a country in control of an area subject to a trusteeship is bound to give an account of its stewardship to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations. The draft agreement which we have put before the Assembly of the United Nations in New York was set out in the statement made in this chamber by the Prime Minister on the 7th August. The substance of the statement was that Australia, as the sole mandatory power, would continue to be the sole trustee, and that the furtherance of the welfare of the natives of New Guinea would be the main purpose of the trust. It was provided that Australia should have control over New Guinea in conjunction with Papua, and have greater power in respect of the defence of those territories than was given under the original mandate. Under the proposed Article 7 of the trusteeship agreement, Australia would have authority to take nil measures considered desirable for the defence of the territory and for the maintenance of international peace and security in that area. </para><para>Some criticism has been heard in New York that countries have been loth to carry out the principles of the. Charter of the United Nations in relation to trusteeships. That is not correct as far us British countries are concerned. It cannot truthfully be said concerning Australia and its administration of New Guinea, of New Zealand with regard to Samoa, or of Great Britain in respect of its Pacific possessions. The administration of New Guinea will continue to bc vested in Australia, as though this territory were part of the Commonwealth itself, but we shall be bound year by  year  to supply answers to relevant  questions  as to whether we are carrying out he terms of the trust. Some countries are setting out dozens of obligations in their draft agreements which would be impracticable with regard to New Guinea. If Australia is to be entrusted with .the administration of New Guinea, it must be trusted to administer it in accordance with the spirit and letter of  the  Charter. </para><interjection>

Although two charges were made to that effect, the Japanese Government, denied the allegation and the denials were  readily  accepted. It was stated recently that the United States of America intended to put a proposal to the United Nations Assembly that that country should have sole trusteeship of those two  areas.  Without the matter having been dealt with in particular by the Commonwealth Government, I would say, broadly, that it would welcome the granting of the trusteeship of those islands to the United States of America. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. That is why, under the proposed trusteeship in respect of New Guinea, we desire to have the right to fortify that territory in the interests of international peace. I have no doubt that the United States of America will expect a similar right in the Marshall and Caroline Islands. This matter of security areas cannot be dealt with by the United Nations Assembly. </para>

In the proposal which Australia puts forward for a trusteeship in respect of New Guinea, Australia asks for the right of defence. The proposal in respect of the Marshall and Caroline Islands has been published in the press only within the last 48 hours.

                            <para>- Only in the loose sense of the term. I understand that the  proposal  is that the United States of America should he the sole administrative authority, and would have to give an account of its stewardship year by year, as Australia does with regard to New Guinea. Having accepted an international obligation in respect of New Guinea, I consider that there is a great deal of good in the idea of giving a report from year to year to an international body as to what is taking place in those territories. Had that been done more directly with regard to the Japanese mandated territories, the facts would have been discovered much earlier than they were, and the conditions of the native peoples in those areas would have been better than they have been. </para>

                            <para>- There are limited powers to send to the trust territories under conditions to be agreed upon, visitors consisting of an equal number of administrative authorities and nontrustee authorities. They would have no power to take away trusteeship, but the force of public opinion and discussion would be relied upon to improve the conditions of the native peoples, if they were dissatisfied. So the position of Australia with regard to New Guinea is important. This agreement is a contribution which it has been proper to make in accordance with the spirit of the mandate, which 1 claim Australia has carried out faithfully and well over a long period of years. I have endeavoured to cover a vast field, and I am much indebted to honorable members for their patience. To sum up, let me say that we shall continue to make the fullest contribution possible to the work of the United Nations according to the principles laid down in its Charter and in the Atlantic Charter. Emphasis on security alone is not enough. We must take our place with others in an attempt to deal with economic problems. Australia is not a member of the Economic and 'Social Council, but it is a member of the principal commissions established by that council. However, we believe that it is wrong to multiply unduly the number of international organizations. One by one they have come into existence, and ' there is a danger that there will be eventually too many of them. They should be brought into close association with the United Nations organization itself. </para>

Indeed, Australia and New Zealand may be regarded as trustees for British democracy, particularly in the western Pacific. That is not to say that we should not, or cannot, play a part in other regions, as in promoting a Euro pean settlement. The principles laid down in one set of treaties tend to be accepted in the formulation of other treaties. We have had an eye to the Japanese treaty even when treaties with European countries were under consideration. All this does not mean that we do not intend to maintain the closest consultation with the Government of Great Britain. That suggestion has sometimes been put forward, but there is no basis foi it. The relations between the Governments of Great Britain and the Commonwealth are as close, if not closer, to-day that at any time in our history. That is not to say that we are necessarily in agreement on every point. The characteristic feature of the British Commonwealth of Nations is that it is possible for its members to disagree, "but that there Ls certainty of agreement on all major issues. We have been working in particularly close association with New Zealand. Anything which Australia has been able to achieve at the various international conferences has been due, not only to the hard work of our own delegations, but also to the unfailing assistance received from the representatives of New Zealand. </para><para>It should be understood that when I criticized the exercise of the power of veto, I did not wish to indicate that an impasse had been reached in international affairs. I have stated my own viewsfrankly, and although members of the Opposition may not always agree with them - particularly with those I expressed in regard to Soviet Russia early in theÂ§ year - I believe that it would be a mistake to proceed on the assumption that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> United Nations will not, and cannot, succeed. It has been in existence only since last January, and the first meeting of the Assembly took place in London. In San Francisco, we struggled very hard to obtain, as a counter-balance to the veto, recognition of the principle that the Assembly should have full power to discuss every point raised. I believe that the discussions now taking place will help to remove many of the causes of ill will. As Soviet Russia has exercised the veto, and is the only permanent member of the Council to do so, the tendency is to concentrate criticism upon the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, it would be wrong not to recognize the enormous contribution which Russia made to the victory of the Allies in the war. </para><interjection>

A country which lost between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 people killed during the war must necessarily have proved itself a great ally. Various phrases have been coined in discussions on this problem. There are those who would say, " Don't get tough with Russia ". I suggest that there is an equally important principle which Russia must, observe, namely, not to get tough with the democracies. We have stated openly our views on the veto. Those expressions of opinion have sometimes been received with a resentment which is difficult to understand.

The worst policy is to state that certain principles must be adhered to, and then, after the lapse of a few weeks, to give them up. Such action merely causes suspicion and misunderstanding. It has been truly said, of course, that a country like Australia cannot expect to have an organization of its own choosing, but I have always kept firmly in mind the contribution which our servicemen made in both world wars. We must do everything to preserve peace. Reference was made this morning to the regulation of armaments. It is not a matter of regulating armaments. The atomic bomb is one thing which must be considered, but we do not want just a new set of Marquess of Queensberry rules for the conduct of war. If the atomic bomb is outlawed, what about the 12-ton block buster? The real enemy is not the atomic bomb, but war itself. It might be said that the real enemy is not even war, but the economic and social injustices which lead to war. We are now doing our best to achieve, after victory in war, something that is even harder to obtain, namely, peace associated with political, social and economic, justice.

                        <para>.- I take this opportunity to refer to alleged irregularities reported in the press in connexion with the electoral rolls to be used for the Ashfield byelection in New South Wales, which is to take place to-morrow. In addition to the overall allegations, a final allegation has been made which casts some reflection upon myself in relation to my occupancy of a seat in this chamber as the representative of the electors of the division of Parkes, which includes the Ashfield sub-division. In order to illustrate what reliance can be placed on statements on this subject published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> I point out that I had an awareness of what was taking place, and accordingly submitted to those two newspapers what I believe was a fair and honest explanation of the situation, but neither of them published it. In the circumstances, I feel justified in asking the House to hear what I consider to be a fair statement in relation to what, to my mind, appears to he the widely exaggerated testimony of the Liberal party organizer who is trying to establish an alibi in connexion with the death of liberalism in the Ashfield district to-morrow. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> R. Burton, who is organizing secretary of the Liberal party, has alleged that more than 1,000 namesare on the electoral roll for the Ashfield constituency by some trick or mischance. He is reported to have said that - </para>

                    <para class="block">The statement is full of incidents and coincidences. The death of those people five years ago occurred .about the same time as the death of the party now known as the Liberal party, when the Labour party, led hy the late John Curtin, came into power in the Commonwealth sphere. Their weak ghosts still haunt this chamber, but the Liberal party is dead. There is nothing new in a charge that 1,000 electors .are enrolled for a district in which they do not reside, lt is easy for that number of electors not to live in the district for which they are enrolled; but that does not necessarily mean that they are fictitious. Owing to the absence of men with the fighting services it was -difficult to maintain an adequate staff to deal with the rolls. Moreover, it must be remembered that many of the rolls for the recent federal elections were sent to the printers as early &gt;as May of this year. There is a continuous revision of the rolls by the electoral authorities. This Liberal party organizer, who was brought in possibly because he was a good salesman of soft soap, is not an authority on the compilation of rolls; he does not know anything about the job. He has given a gratuitous insult to the electoral officers, who are both efficient and impartial. There is no doubt a simple explanation of the matter to which such prominence has been given. </para>

                            <para>- It appears that no check has been made of this ridiculous statement. There has been no intention to check it. The Liberal candidate for the Ashfield by-election to-morrow is the same man whom I defeated in the recent election for  the Federal Division of Parkes. This accusation of wholesale irregularities looks like a last-minute attempt to explain why after to-morrow's by-election he will again be left out in the cold. No charge against either the political morality of the people of the Division of Parkes or the efficiency and impartiality of the electoral officers for that constituency can be sustained. That charges of this nature should be given such wide publicity is only a part of a campaign against me by two newspapers for whom I have had the distinction of working and the common sense to leave their employment. It may be that I have a sense of martyrdom in this matter because I cannot get any rebuttal of these charges published. That is due to the censorship exercised by those two newspapers of any statement submitted by me on behalf of the 60,000  electors  whom I represent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burton</inline> went on to say that - </para>

                    <para class="block">I should be glad if that investigation did take place, and I say in all seriousness that I would be loath to occupy a seat in this House through any misrepresentation. The campaign in Parkes was hard fought, but it was fair and above-board. I have the distinction of having wrested from the Liberal party one of its blue-ribbon seats. I have held that seat for some years; I hold it now, and I shall hold it in the future. I have no fear of any investigation of this matter. The Liberals are annoyed because the prognostications of their leader, who was so definite that Parkes would fall to the Liberal party, were not fulfilled. They are sore, too, because their leader prophesied that, in addition to losing Parkes, the Labour party would lose Boothby and Lilley. Despite those optimistic predictions, those constituencies are still represented by members of the Labour party. I admit that my majority in the recent election was small - only 164 votes - but the election was won honestly. In all fairness, I  think  that I ought to say that that majority was contributed to by the presence in the Parkes electorate of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> on two occasions. I invite him there again at the earliest opportunity, because I would like him to strengthen my position in the electorate. I was gratified also to find that the British Medical Association, knowing of my association with the Social Security Committee and of the Government's intention to introduce certain social service legislation, did me the honour of opposing me. A distinguished, but tired, doctor, who works 865 days a year was impelled by a sense of duty to leave his scalpel, and disregard his duties to the. sick, in order to direct the campaign on behalf of my opponent. That was a splendid effort. I may even call it a noble Christian effort. The statement regarding the 1,000 votes may easily be explained. As f have said, the statement is made and given publicity notwithstanding that its accuracy has not been checked. Even Liberal party canvassers are not infallible. A good deal could be said regarding a number of votes which were not recorded. I refer particularly to the votes of ex-servicemen who were told by Liberal party canvassers that there was no need for any ex-serviceman to fill in any forms because no one could deny a vote to a soldier. I can produce statutory declarations to that effect. In the Parkes electorate as many as 2,000 ex-servicemen were denied the franchise because of the advice given to them by Liberals who knew that most ex-servicemen would vote for Labour candidates. Because of misrepresentation of the facts, many hundreds of ex-servicemen, who of all the citizens of Australia were morally entitled to vote, were denied the franchise and thereby deprived of one of the freedoms for which they fought. They were cheated out of their rights by political chicanery. That was the most serious aspect of the matter. Before I leave the subject of alleged irregularities, may I say that there is a certified list of electors available in all electorates. If the list be examined it will be found that the people who moved out of the electorate did so for only one reason. The electorate is a built-up area and there is little room to build additional houses. The thousand people who left that area, since the rolls were printed vacated accommodation in rooms and occupied houses built by the State Government. They would not have lived in the Parkes electorate but for the misdeeds of past governments of the political complexion of honorable members opposite. This story of irregularities in the Parkas election is hut a figment of the imagination, a good story conjured up in the minds of the campaign director for the Liberals, and as such should have been investigated by conscientious subeditors before publication. </para>
                    <para>There never has been in this country anything more undemocratic than the way the postal vote has been collected. If one looks at the figures one finds that unless the Labour candidate has been a resident in the electorate for many years he has no chance of securing his due proportion of postal votes. If I never held a seat in Parliament again, I would not allow one of my Campaign workers to put a pen in the palsied hand of a paralytic in order to secure a vote, nor would I do, as has been done in the Parkes electorate, put old ladies sleeping two a bed in order to influence a vote. These practices belong to the " jiggerypokery " of a defeated party. Such tactics are contemptuous and I would have nothing to do with them. Since allegations have been made in relation to irregularities at Ashfield, may I point to some irregularities that have occurred in relation to the postal vote. </para>

If in an electorate of 63,000 people the margin of votes was so close that I or another candidate obtained a majority of only one in 550 electors, one would say that that was a close contest, that it was ideal and democratic where the people indicated by their vote that their elected member  would need to keep on his toes and do a good job. If, however, in the counting of the postal votes in my electorate, in which 63,000 people voted closely for myself and my opponent, il were found that the majority against me was 12 to 1, even such an ignorant man as the honorable member for New England would agree that there was something wrong in the state of Ashfield and points west. The whole question of postal voting must be looked into. I gladly  accept the verdict of the electorate; I have no complaints to make, no squealing, nr, moaning at the bar. i say to that protagonist of lost causes, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">.(Mr. Harrison),</inline> that 1 would be prepared to race on the same course again. The question of the postal vote is a serious one indeed and sooner or later the Government must come to the realization that by the postal vote we get not a democratic vote, but a biased and influenced vote. </para>

                        (Wentworth) [3.0'J.- I would not have intruded into the private fight of the honorable member for Parkes
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline>
                        had he not mentioned my name. When I asked a question this morning relative to the electoral rolls in the subdivision of Ashfield, my sole purpose was to endeavour to elicit information of benefit to the people. The honorable member for Parkes must not believe that his explanation means the end of these inquiries; it is really only the beginning. No doubt he will be placed in the unfortunate position in the future once again of having to make an apology, or of having an apology made on his behalf, for having made statements that cannot be verified. The honorable member has had an unfortunate experience in that regard in the past. What he did not explain was how it came about that dead men were able to vote for him, nor how certain people who were no longer domiciled in his electorate did likewise. With a grand flourish he said, " We believe that the postal vote is not as it should be. We would not place a pen in the palsied hand of a paralytic ". But he did not explain why the facsimile signature on a vote which is now in the hands of the Criminal Investigation Department has been denied by the person whose signature it purported to be, and that the person who represented himself to be the justice of the peace who witnessed the signature was not in fact a justice of the peace at all. The honorable member surely does not believe that by a mere cursory explanation he can get. away with that. There is considerably more to it than appears on the surface. The voting in Parkes will bear close investigation.
                    </para>
                    <para>I propose now to say a few words with regard to service votes. In order to enable servicemen to exercise the franchise a form was issued to them and after they had certified that they had been overseas and had previously lived in a certain part of an electorate they were permitted to cast a vote. I discussed the manner in which this exercise of the franchise was administered with the Divisional Returning Officer for Wentworth who informed me that the serviceman's vote was, in broad terms, an " open slather ". He said, " We did not check whether the soldier had been overseas or whether he had actually resided in the electorate he claimed to have resided in prior to going overseas ". I said to him, " A serviceman may have actually lived in Bondi-road but claimed to have lived in Burwood and by  thi3  means have secured a vote in both electorates." The Divisional Returning Officer said, " He could do more than that; he could vote in Bondi, Burwood, and even in the electorates of Martin and New England if he liked ". In endeavouring to cover up irregularities, the honorable member for Parkes does nothing for the advancement of democracy and does a disservice both to himself and to the country. Such an attempt is contrary to our great democratic principles. When <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> seeks to dispose of these irregularities merely by some cursory explanation he reflects no credit on himself. I do not wish to deal further with the matter at this juncture, but I shall have something more to say about it later. </para>
                    <para>My main purpose in rising is to draw attention to allegations of very great importance. Some time ago I received information which caused me great concern, namely, that in Sydney three trunks had been seized by customs officers, the trunks bearing the name of an ex-Minister of a previous Labour Government. Those trunks contained jewellery, cosmetics and other articles which were dutiable, and some person sought to have them passed through the customs without payment of duty. I pursued my investigations and contacted the Comptroller of Customs, who satisfied me that the facts were as stated. There happened to be employed by Australian War Supplies Procurement at Washington a Miss Rosetta Kelly, who was offered a position in Australia in either the Import Procurement Division or the Customs Department at a salary of something like Â£600 a year. She came out to Australia and brought with her 30 pieces of personal luggage. Three of those trunks were seized by customs officers. I knew that this woman had been interrogated, and had been sent back on the <inline font-style="italic">Marine Falcon</inline> whilst the offer of employment to her in Australia was not effected. I also knew that certain high officers within the Division of Import Procurement were suspect in the matter. I immediately made a public statement upon the subject, as I felt it my public duty to do so, challenging the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to deny these allegations. The Prime Minister with an almost friendly gesture replied that I must know that every Minister who returns to Australia must declare his luggage. Of course, I knew that. He said that the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> had to declare his luggage, and also that a certain Labour senator had made a false declaration and the Collector of Customs in Sydney had been told to deal lightly with him. Like the flowers that bloom in the spring, the Prime Minister's reply had nothing to do with my charges, namely, that certain trunks were seized, that these contained goods which were dutiable, that the trunks bore the name of a very prominent ex-Minister, that an inquiry had been held and that Miss Kelly who would have been a very important witness in any subsequent court proceedings was shipped aboard the <inline font-style="italic">Marine Falcon</inline> and sent back to the United States of America instead of being kept in Sydney. </para>

                    <para>The implications of this matter are very serious indeed. According to the answers supplied, Miss Kelly was employed by Australian War Supplies Procurement, at Washington, which is a section of the Division of Import Procurement. She was brought to Australia. She did not come of her own accord. She musthave been offered some inducement. She was offered the inducement of a secretarial position in a government department. Why was she offered that position? Because she was to be used as a " stooge " to bring to Australia certain goods that were dutiable but which certain officers were not prepared to bring out in their own luggage. My information is that the name which appeared on the trunks was not correct. I was told that the name which first appeared on them was that of "R. V. Keane"; whereas now the name appears as " <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. R.</inline> V. Keane ". Why ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Keane</inline> could have brought her own personal luggage; but it appears that Miss Kelly was used to bring out certain luggage, and that she was to be given a job in some department as recompense for bringing that luggage to Australia. Interrogation would reveal whether Miss Kelly was told that the trunks she was bringing out contained departmental documents. I believe that she was guiltless in this matter. I believe that she was told that she was bringing out trunks which contained departmental documents whereas the. trunks contained dutiable goods. Thus, innocent of that fact, she was used in an attempt to smuggle those goods into Australia. I say that some one in the department knew what those trunks contained, and knew that if they had been marked " <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. R.</inline> V. Keane " and were placed with her personal luggage the contents would have been disclosed immediately. I believe that some officer in the department marked those trunks and that Miss Kelly was told that they contained departmental documents; and that the officer concerned thought that he could obtain control of the trunks as they came through to the department. If my suspicions are not correct, why was Miss Kelly, who would be a most important witness if the Crown proposed to take action subsequently, allowed to leave Australia ? The department must answer that charge. Miss Kelly would have been a principal witness in any proceedings. She would have been able to say who placed the trunks in her control, what information she was given as to what the trunks contained, why she was offered a job in the Customs Department in Australia, why she was allowed to come to Australia, and, if she was not offered a job, who paid her fare. I do not believe that she came here for her own personal reasons, bringing goods of that description. The whole case is so involved that it must be subjected to the closest investigation. I should like to know whether the matter is now in the  hands of the Crown Law authorities. Although nearly three months have passed since the incident occurred, the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> informed me this morning that he did not know anything about it. He admitted that the case may be in the hands of the Crown Law authorities, but that he had no knowledge of it. Does the right honorable gentlemon mean to tell me that this incident has not been discussed by Cabinet? Does he expect us to believe that all the implications associated with it are not realized by the Government? I venture to suggest that the Attorney-General knows  the story, and I warn him that legal proofeedings are not likely to  suceed  if the principal witness cannot be brought into the court, interrogated, and subjected to cross-examination. This incident, happening in a department which peculiarly lends itself to these practices, must be thoroughly investigated. If the department of Trade and Customs is not a " clean " department, I must conclude that, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth Public Service, the Government is lending itself to the creation of suspicion regarding one of its principal departments. </para>

In the opinion of the honorable member for Wentworth, the only political party in Australia today which is infallible is the Liberal party, of which he is a member. </para>

                        after his magnificent victory on the 28th September last, and on the organizers of the Labour party's campaign.

On behalf of that gentleman, those associated with him in that campaign, and other supporters of the official Labour party in the Ashfield electorate, I declare that the Labour movement in that constituency Ls not associated with these tactics. This is just one more attempt by the Liberal party to gain votes for a very discredited person, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson,</inline> who is the Liberal party's candidate in the Ashfield byelection to-morrow. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Parkes defended himself so ably that it is hardly necessary for me to speak on his behalf. I point out, however, the low and despicable nature of these tactics, when newspapers, which declared him " black '* for their own personal and biased reasons, endeavour to deprive him  of the credit due to him and to the Labour party for holding Parkes, which was formerly a blue-ribbon stronghold of the United Australia party. In my opinion, these allegations represent an attempt by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson</inline> to gain a few votes by endeavouring to discredit our candidate and organization. He is attempting to bolster up his falling stocks with a new story.  His  purpose is to divert attention from the issues involved in the byelection.

                        will have to fight for his political existence. These charges are one more attempt on his behalf to divert the fire of the Labour party from him and the campaign generally by raising side issues. Let us consider
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson's</inline>
                        record of attendance in the State Parliament. By comparison, the coal-miners, waterside workers and other unionists, whom he constantly attacks, have a 100 per cent, record of attendance. While
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson</inline>
                        was member for Ashfield in the Parliament  of  New South Wales in 1944-45 and 1945-46 he attended only 18 out of 55 divisions in the House, and 37 divisions out of 68 in committee. Generally speaking, his record throughout his whole parliamentary life, and particularly in recent years in New South Wales, has been one of gross absenteeism. Therefore, I do not wonder that this individual is particularly anxious that the electors of Ashfield shall not have time to read his sorry record of attendance in the State Parliament.
                    </para>
                    <para>When honorable members opposite ask for an examination of the postal votes in Parkes, they should also ask for a scrutiny of the postal votes in Swan and other electorates, where the anti-Labour candidate had a majority of only 200 votes. The real explanation of these charges is that honorable members opposite cannot " take it ". At the last elections, they were almost annihilated, and now, they snatch at straws in an effort to " get away " with one more seat. They had to rely on a new member of the  House  to take their fight for them into the Labour party's camp. When their allegations are answered concisely and clearly, as the honorable member for Parkes and others answered them, they still cannot " take it ", and their outcry continues. I say to the people of Australia, and to the electors of Ashfield, that the allegations contained in the Sydney press this morning have no foundation. The honorable member for Parkes put up an excellent defence. The Labour party knows the outstanding qualifications of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peters,</inline> who is carrying its banner. Respectable people will not be associated with this deliberate attempt to discredit him. The honorable member for Wentworth demanded inquiries into the various allegations by a royal commission, but the whole of his information rested upon unsubstantiated statements of the organizers of the Liberal party. I am gratified to have had this opportunity to speak in support of the honorable member for Parkes, and to expose the individuals who are supporting the interests of the Liberal party in- the Ashfield by-election. I am pleased to be able to expose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richardson's</inline> sorry record in the State Parliament, and to place on record my regret that he has to stoop to such tactics in an endeavour to gain the votes of the people. </para>

                        <para>. -  I direct the attention of the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> to a matter of serious consequence to former members of the Royal Australian Air Force, and particularly the Air Force Association. Correspondence which I have received from a number of branches of this organization in my electorate point out that the Commonwealth Government proposes to take Â£400,000 from the Royal Australian Air Force Canteens Fund and to place the money into Consolidated Revenue. On behalf of the Air Force Association I protest strongly against that proposal. In the first place, this large sum of money should never have been amassed by a welfare organization. It was built up only by charging high prices for the goods sold in the Air Force canteens. When it became apparent that funds were accumulating, prices should have been reduced so that Australian airmen serving in all parts of the world would havebenefited and increased amenities should have been provided. However, the fund is there, and the question now arising is the manner in which it is to be disbursed. As I have said, the Government proposes to appropriate Â£400,000 now in the fund and to place it in Consolidated Revenue. I regard that as a most unjust method of dealing with a canteens fund, and I ask the Minister for Air to make a full and prompt statement on this preposterous proposal which is causing great concern. The wishes of members  ofl  the Air Force Association should be given the fullest consideration. They believe that some of this money at least should be made available to the dependants of deceased airmen who are in necessitous circumstances and that assistance should also be given to men whose disablement on active service has prevented them from resuming their normal avocations, or from earning a reasonable livelihood. To this end a trust should be established in each of the States. This is only the first shot, and I ask that a full statement of the facts be made now or at least as soon as the House resumes next week. </para>

                            <para>- I shall certainly use it again later if a satisfactory answer is not forthcoming. I was in the Royal Australian Air Force, and I know that canteen prices were not as low as they could have been. That is generally admitted, but Royal Australian Air Force personnel believed that the accumulating funds would be used to assist families of deceased or injured airmen, and to provide such services as technical training and educational benefits for returned airmen. That was done after the last war with the Army canteen funds in conjunction with the McCaughey bequest. Funds provided under the will of a wealthy grazier, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> McCaughey, together with accumulated profits of Army canteens were used to educate thousands of dependants of ex-servicemen, some of whom were given university courses. Here we have a grand opportunity to perform a similar service far the dependants of some of the 180,000 men of the Royal Australian Air Force. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> and the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> are not the only members who have raised the matter of the Royal Australian Air Force Welfare Fund with me. Within the last two or three days I have received in my office numbers of letters similar to those which have been sent to honorable members on both sides of the House asking for information on this subject, and making statements which are somewhat in line with those made this afternoon. I say to the honorable member for Balaclava now that I would prefer to give detailed answers to his questions next week, after I have had time to consider them, so that he will he satisfied that the matter is being thoroughly investigated. Judging from the letters forwarded to me, there seems to be a misapprehension that the Government has decided to make what is termed a "grab" of funds which do not rightfully belong to it. I do not believe that there is any justification foi that belief. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but a great deal has been said, apart from the mere request for information, and I should like to consider the matter in detail. Any assumption that the Government intends to misuse funds raised on behalf of members of the Royal Australian Air Force through canteen profits is, in my opinion, without any justification whatever. Further than that, I would say that consideration has been given to the handling of canteen funds on a service basis. Whilst it has been alleged that Royal Australian Air Force members may suffer as a consequence of such action, I consider that they will benefit, because canteen profits obviously must have been greater in a service that was numerically much stronger than the Royal Australian Air Force. The matter has been investigated with a view to determining the best course to follow in the interests of relatives of persons who have been disabled or placed at a disadvantage as the result of their war service. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what the honorable member means by "shuffling". If the answers to the ques tions do not cover the position satisfactorily I shall certainly make a statement as well. I have no objection to doing so, but, unlike the honorable member, I do not want to make a statement without  a  proper warrant for the information which I supply to the House. </para>
