                        <para>- <inline font-style="italic">by leave-</inline> The future of the cotton-growing industry in Queensland has been the subject of an investigation by the Tariff Board, the report of which body has been received by the Minister for Trade and Customs and very carefully considered not only by him but also by the expert officers in his department who usually deal with assistance to this industry. Further, it was the subject of an agendum that was placed before Cabinet yesterday. </para>

                    <para>The Raw Cotton Bounty Act will expire on the 31st December, 1946. The Commonwealth Government has decided to submit legislation during the present sittings of the Commonwealth Parliament for the purpose of extending the Raw Cotton Bounty Act 1940-1941, so that producers will be guaranteed a net return of 15d. per lb. for raw cotton above the grade known as "strict good ordinary", produced in Australia during the calendar year1947 and during each year until the 31st December, 1951. Such guaranteed net return will be computed after taking into account the net return from the by-products of raw cotton. Raw cotton of "strict good ordinary" or lower grades will continue to receive bounty at one-half the appropriate rate tinder the existing Raw Cotton Bounty Act. This is in accordance with what was sought by the Queensland Government and the Queensland Cotton Board when the existing legislation was being framed. The total sum available for the payment of the bounty will be £170,000 per annum, and any portion of it unexpended in any year will be available for bountypayments in later years,in addition to the £170,000 provided for each of such years, making a total of £850,000 for the five year period. </para>
                    <para>The bounty has been extended, subject to the Queensland Government using every endeavour to implement certain under takings that were given during 1939-40. These were, that it would take energetic steps to improve the efficiency of cotton-growing by arranging for, first, the quickest possible conversion  of cotton production from dry-farming toirrigation by the most economic means for each selected locality, secondly, the inauguration of a special campaign to ensure the adoption by cotton-growers of the best cultural methods; and, thirdly, the acceleration of scientific work on plant breeding, soil tests, measures to combat insect pests, and plant diseases, and the new problems that are likely to be encountered with production under irrigation. The objectives covered by these undertakings were designed to create the utmost efficiency in the industry, with a corresponding reduction of production costs by improving the quality and the yield per acre of the cotton grown. </para>

                        <para>- I have been told by several ex-servicemen that they have been allotted a tobacco quota by retail distributors but, because they moved to another district some miles away, they are unable to get tobacco there, and have to rely on supplies from the original retailer. Can the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs say whether it is a fact that the administration of the National Security (Tobacco Rationing) Regulations, underwhich ex-service personnel are granted a tobacco ration, passed from his department to the New South Wales Tobacco Trade Distribution Committee on the 1st April? Is it not a fact that these regulations state that ex-service personnel may change their retailer when they move to another district, but that the committee has refused to observe this provision? If these are facts, will the Minister state under what authority this provision has been ignored, and why ex-service personnel transferred to another district for business reasons are not allowed to change their tobacconist? </para>

                        <para>- Government rationing of tobacco was abolished, I think, on the 1st April last, but I do not know the wording of the regulations which had been in force up to that date. There had been many complaints that government rationing was an unjustifiable interference with the tobacco trade and was, indeed, responsible for the current shortage of tobacco and inequitable distribution. Now the controls have been lifted. The honorable member himself urged that this should be done at the earliest possible date, leaving the trade to look after its own business about which, he said, it knew more than did the Government. I shall look into the complaint that certain ex-servicemen are not receiving a fair quota of tobacco under the present system, and shall prepare a reply for the honorable member. </para>

Since then, some of the cigarettes have deteriorated, and have  been destroyed.

I did know that amongst the advertisements that were to be published were some of the character mentioned. I must confess that I had not at any time thought that an advertisement containing political propaganda would stir the breast of any person as apparently this particular advertisement has stirred the Leader of the Opposition. This advertisement is addressed to the intelligent section of the community, and people who read it will have no difficulty in realizing its nature and purpose. In my opinion, this political propaganda, is much fairer, if the word "fair" can be applied to any political propaganda, than many of the statements that have been made about the Government from time -to time in this House and outside of it. </para>

                        <para>- The method by which the work will be financed has not yet been determined. The Government regards the proposed work as a part of its rehabilitation plans for the territory. Some criticism which has recently been levelled against this proposal may have led, in my opinion, to a false impression that the construction of this model native village in New Guinea will in some way hamper the programme of home construction in Australia. I assure honorable members that all the materials and all the labour for the native village will be supplied from local sources, and in no way can this project affect the building of houses on the mainland. </para>

If so, will the Minister inform the House whether the true position regarding these exports has been kept secret because it is realized that the Government cannot honour its obligations to Great Britain in particular, and because the production of meat in Queensland has declined by more than 35,000 tons as the result of strikes?

The countries which were invited to send observers to watch the experiments, of which Australia was one, will bear only the expense associated with the presence of its own observers. On the general subject of the control of atomic energy and the materials used in the manufacture of atomic bombs, a conference has been sitting for some time. The Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> is representing Australia. I am not in the position to say officially what final decisions are likely to be reached, but the general  view has been expressed by this Government, and Has been submitted to the conference, that the control of atomic energy should be placed under the  United  Nations. Having regard to the dreadful possibilities of the misuse of uranium and other ingredients in the  production  of atomic bombs, and to the  future  peace of the world, our belief is  that  this new discovery should be developed to produce  industrial  power and not bombs for war purposes. The Minister for External  Affairs  is making this clear R the  conference. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of any lack of cordiality between the Dutch and Australian peoples. I am, of course, cognizant of a certain degree of feeling between representatives of the Dutch Government on- the one hand and  myself  and the Minister for External Affairs on the  other hand, in consequence of statements that  have been  published by Dutch Ministers. I do not consider that that has disturbed in any way the good feeling that exists, between, the Dutch people and the people of this country. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Parliament has approved of the allocation of £250,000 a year among the States to assist in preventing the spread of tuberculosis. The Commonwealth had earlier agreed to provide £50,000 a year for diagnostic treatment, on the condition that the States would subsidize the amount £1 for £1, and a further £50,000 a year for after-cure treatment, on the same basis. It has now agreed to provide a further £250,000 a year to meet the circumstances of necessitous cases, such as the granting of assistance to the dependants of the head of a family suffering from the disease. Due to the nature of the drafting, it was found difficult to administer the provision. This Parliament will be asked to pass amending legislation to make the provision more workable, and to enable the money to be paid to the States on a basis to be determined by the Minister for Health in the light of all the circumstances. The matter has been discussed with State Ministers for Health, but I cannot say that a definite agreement has been reached in regard to the method by which the money shall be distributed. I shall make inquiries in relation to that aspect. The Minister for Health will make any further explanation that may be needed when the amending legislation is introduced. </para>

                            <para>- Never at any time did I give instructions that the purchasers of rabbit skins should deduct the amount of the export levy. The only persons who pay the levy are the exporters. Rabbit-skin prices have risen to the world record of 258d. per lb. and, in addition to that, the exporters have to pay a levy of 1s. 6d. per lb. Any rabbit-skin buyer who deducted the amount of the levy from the price he paid would be dealing, unfairly with the trapper. </para>

If so, in view of the extreme difficulty being experienced by civilians and ex-servicemen in securing a suit of clothes, what action does the Minister intend to take so to regulate exports of cloth that our own people will be able to purchase much needed suits? </para>

                            <para>- I have not seen the statement, but I remember that the gentleman mentioned by the honorable member made some rash statements early in the war about the need for rationing clothing. The Government exercises no control over the distribution of cloth. That is solely a matter for the manufacturers. As I have explained previously in this House, the quantity of cloth suitable for Australian requirements that is exported is small, amounting to about 2½ per cent. of the total production. The only hope of more cloth being made available to the Australian community, including ex-service men and women, lies in increased production in the mills, and over that the Government has no control. </para>

If the attention of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has not already been drawn to the matter, will he examine it with a view to making an early statement on the case in the House? </para>

Later I hope to be able to make a statement on what was accomplished there. I have had brought under my notice a series of articles written for the Murdoch chain of newspapers by Air Vice-Marshal Bostock. The articles appear to have been syndicated. They are published under big head-lines in several newspapers, apparently to enable Air Vice Marshal Bostock to air his personal grievances over a wide area. The articles are lengthy and cover  many  aspects. I am examining them for the purpose of determining the necessity for a reply and the nature of the reply that I should make if one is necessary. </para>

If so, what is the outcome of that investigation, and what compensation does the Government propose to make to A.C.I Jones for the pay which he forfeited while he was in detention awaiting trial? Is it a fact that many members of the Royal Australian Air Force have been kept waiting months for trial by court martial? Did a spokesman of the Air Force estimate  that one airman, L.A.C. Smith, of the Care and Maintenance Unit, Narromine, was kept waiting for more than 100 days for court martial? What action does the Government contemplate to ensure that personnel shall not be kept waiting for long periods before they are brought to trial? </para>

                    <para class="block">I have referred to this matter in the House on numerous occasions, but a notice of motion is the only satisfactory way in which a private member can direct attention to an important subject. If the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> will permit me to proceed with my motion to-morrow, I do not think that the debate will be protracted. My request is justified, because, acting upon advice, I placed this item on the notice-paper some time ago. If the Prime Minister insists in postponing the consideration of this business at  thi3  stage, he will be treating me with unnecessary harshness, and will cause grave disappointment to those who believe that honorable members should hear the merits of the case. The Opposition supports unanimously the terms of the motion,, and many Ministerial members are in favour of it. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that if the Prime Minister realized the degree of injustice that is being inflicted upon the dependants of deceased servicemen he would readily accede to the request that has been made by the honorable member for. Balaclava. This Parliament will shortly expire by the effluxion of time, and it is urgent, in my view, that the motion of which the honorable member for .Balaclava has given notice should be debated without delay. A serious injustice is being done to servicemen's widows who are seeking to secure homes. The housing position in Australia is deplorable. I therefore ask the Prime Minister to allow the motion of the honorable member for Balaclava to be debated. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill, which is designed to amend the Meat Export Control Act 1935-1938, is to provide for the re-v constitution, of the Australian Meat Board, and to grant to the board additional powers necessary to enable it to carry out work in. relation  to the long term purchase agreement covering meat for export, entered into between the Commonwealth Government and the Government of the United Kingdom. The Australian Meat Board, under the amending legislation now submitted, will consist of twelve members, including a Commonwealth Government representative, who will be appointed by the Governor-General. Bte will be employed full-time on the business of the board and will be the  chairman.  Of the remaining eleven members, seven members, constituting a clear majority of the board, will be representative of producer interests. </para>
                    <para>Producer members, comprising four representatives of the lamb and mutton producers, two of the beef producers, and one of the pig producers, must themselves be bona fide producers,, and must be persons nominated by producer organizations constituted on a Commonwealth basis. The members appointed to represent the meat-exporting companies are to be appointed after consultation with representative organizations of meat exporters. The member appointed to represent - the employees will be appointed after consultation with the Federal Council of the Meat Industry Employees Union.. The member appointed to&lt; represent, the publicly owned abattoirs and freezing works will be appointed by the Governor-General. </para>
                    <para>Producer organizations have repre, seated, that the  chairman  of the board should be a producer member, nominated by the producer representatives on the board. During the period that the. long term purchase arrangement for the sale of Australia's exportable meat to the United Kingdom continues, the board will handle annually Commonwealth Government finance amounting to more than £20,000,000, and in these circumstances the Government considers that it should have the right to appoint the  chairman. </para>
                    <para>The bill also gives the person presiding at a meeting the right to. dissent from, any decision of the hoard. This right is also necessary because of the Commonwealth Government's financial interest in the operations of the board. It is essential that the  chairman  shall have the right to bring to the Minister's notice immediately any resolution which he considers may involve the Commonwealth Government in any way on a point of principle or, what is more to the point, on a question of financial losses or gains. The Commonwealth Government's financial interests in the meat industry in the immediate future are such that it is considered that these interests should bc safeguarded by a clause such as .that which has been included in this amending legislation. </para>
                    <para>It will be appreciated that it ia not practicable to have represented on. the board all interests connected with the meat industry, and that it is necessary and desirable that the membership, in terms of numbers, be limited. In order, therefore, that all sections of the industry may be in a. position to present their views on matters affecting the industry, provision has been made for the setting-up of State committees. It will be competent for any duly constituted. State organization representing a section of the meat industry to apply for representation on the State committee. </para>
                    <para>As it is proposed that the administration of the long-term purchase agreement for meat, entered into between the Commonwealth. Government and the Government of the- United Kingdom, will be a function of the board after the expiration of the National Security Act,, provision has been madefor the powers of the board to be extended to include the following: - </para>

                        <para>.- Ipointedout lastFridaythat the idea that the people should be educated to take an interest in the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament,by means of broadcastsof those proceedings, was a very good one. But Ialsostated that two fundamental conditions should be imposed: first, thateither the wholeof the proceedings, or none at all, should be broadcast; and secondly, that all the peopleof Australia should have anequal opportunity to listen to the broadcasts Having established those fundamental principles, the next question would be whether thenecessarytechnicalfacilities were available to give effect to them. If they were, the matterof broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament could be debated on its merits. But if there is to be discrimination, either in the selection of thedebates to be broadcast or in the  number of listeners, the proposal has quite a different complexion. According to- my information, although the Broadcasting Committee considered that it would be possible to cover practically the whole of the proceedings during the limited number of days on which the Parliament sits, the Government took the contrary view. The bill does not make that provision, but stipulates that there shall be only a partial cover, which in the last analysis will be determined by a committee to be appointed by the two branches of the legislature and may be selective and quite partisan. If it be agreed that on account of the present technical position it is not "possible to cover the whole of the proceedings, at all events- the debates chosen should be such as to permit of the whole of them being broadcast. If that were done, practically all the clauses dealing with the functions of the committee could be deleted. Any infringement of the general principles I have enunciated would at once have an effect on the maintenance of parliamentary privilege, which is possible only if every member of the Parliament has the right fully to express 'his view. The law has been thus expounded on many occasions by British jurists. At page 108 of May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> this statement is made - </para>

                            <para>- My aim is to maintain the dignity and the privileges of this Parliament. The honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein),</inline> like a " snide " lawyer, tries to raise technicalities. I wish to make certain that the rights of the people of Australia shall be preserved. This House will act very unwisely, in respect of the freedom of this country and its protection, if it impairs in any way the traditions of this Parliament and the British Parliament. If the bill, when passed, establishes a new privilege, by means of which the speeches of only one section of the House may be broadcast, it would be advisable to withdraw all parliamentary, privileges and leave to the courts of the land the decision as to whether or not a member bad outraged the rights of any person outside the Parliament. A matter of privilege can be raised in the Parliament. When I did so on one occasion the only member of the ministerial party who supported me, even though a fundamental principle was involved, was the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> who views such matters in the light of what is proper and just rather than what is partisan. It would be a bad day for every British country if that principle were allowed to fall into desuetude. In such an event, all matter broadcast should be actionable in the same way as non-parliamentary matter. That would make members very much move careful of what they said, and would prevent them from impugning the character of others without justification. </para>

                    <para>The bill is being considered haphazardly. Its implications are not being debated with any regard to our international relations. In view of our international understandings, and especially our international misunderstandings, we should consider the matter very carefully. While I sat in the British War Cabinet as the representative of Australia the question arose as to whether there should be a broadcast of a speech that was to be made in the Blouse of Commons, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> upon his return from a meeting with the late  President  Roosevelt, in which he was to deal exhaustively with the war situation. The British War Cabinet agreed unanimously, the Labour members of it being most emphatic, that such a broadcast would be exceedingly unwise in view of possible repercussions. lt was pointed out that even one interjection during the course of a speech might provoke an unconsidered retort that could imperil relations between nations for generations. We in this country have a White Australia policy' to which all parties subscribe. It was fought for in Parliament and outside it, and is now accepted by all Australians, but to some neighbouring nations it is a matter of concern. During a-debate on this subject in Parliament, statements could be made which, if broadcast, might lead to serious difficulties with other nations. This is just one instance. </para>
                    <para>One of the functions of Parliament is to provide an opportunity for honorable members to talk to their constituents, and to show them that the views of the people are being put before Parliament. This applies to Ministers no less than to private members. I cannot see that any good purpose would he served by broadcasting speeches of that kind to the world. For instance, the other day, we were invited to listen to a recording of the proceedings in Parliament, and I heard the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> delivering a speech which, from the point of view of his constituents, was a very good one. He was dealing with conditions in the coalmines on the south coast, and some of the proposals he was making have since been put into. effect by the miners.  His  speech was unexceptionable so far as his- own electorate is concerned or, indeed, so far as the people in other electorates in Australia are concerned, because they understood why he was making it, but it is important that a speech of that kind should not go out to the world as an indication of what Commonwealth Ministers are thinking. The English language is not spoken all over the world, and some of those who might listen to broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings will have but an imperfect knowledge of the language, and so might misunderstand the true import of what was being said. This was brought home to me by a remark made by Philip Snowden after, an international conference in Paris during the depression. He said, " although we used the same words, I found that we did not mean the same thing". Every language has idioms of its own with which people speaking other languages are not familiar. I particularly urge .that no short-wave broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings be made unless the greatest care is taken to prevent them from causing international misunderstanding. </para>
                    <para>The Government . should not proceed immediately with this proposal. The technical processes are not available to give a complete broadcast of proceedings. Furthermore, the question of privilege  has not yet been cleared up ; and, finally, the danger of creating international misunderstanding is such that the Government should defer the passage of the bill until it has bad time to consider the matter further.. The  bill has already been passed by the .Senate ; but it is evident that the Government has had many second thoughts regarding it, judging by the sheaf of amendments which- havealready been circulated in this House. For all these reasons, I urge that more time betaken to considerthe proposal in all its aspects. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I desire to expressmy regret to the honorablememberfor Watson(Mr.Falstein) for anythingobjectionablewhich I may havesaidofhim in the heat of debate. </para>
                    <para>Mr.FALSTEIN(Watson)[4.36].Thisbill has been preparedas a direct result of the reportfurnished by the Standing Committee onBroadcasting. The decision to broadcastthe proceedings of this House and of the Senate in part only wastaken because of technical difficulties. </para>

I may be permitted, as a lawyer, to say to the right honorable member, who is a member of another profession, that I should prefer him to confine his remarks on. technical matters to subjects of which he has some knowledge. In particular, I suggest that he should refrain from discoursing on matters of law about which, to judge from the citations he has made, he has no knowledge at all. </para>

I hope to convince honorable members that there is no substance in 'his amendmentwhich would warrant serious consideration. I hope to show, also,that thepoints raised by the honorable member come strangely from one who, enjoying the absoluteprivilegeof a court of law, made a most unwarranted attack upon the Minister for Information(Mr. Calwell) during the hearing of a case in which the Minister claimed damages for libel against a newspaper for the publication of certain matter which was highly defamatory. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member's foreshadowed amendment proposes, in sub-clause 2, that the privilege of honorable members in Parliament shall be considered in rela tiontostatements oftruth, and tostatements ofuntruth; and he says that, in the caseof statements of truth, noaction shall lie.It istrite knowledgethat, in commonlaw,noactionshall lie in respect of a true statement made in the interest of publicbenefit, and, of course, it wouldnaturally followthat any statement made in Parliamentwouldbe made in the interest of publicbenefit. It is obvious,therefore,thattherewas no need for the amendment specifically to give privilege to statements of truth. The honorable member for Warringah must know that in England it is a sufficient defence against a charge of libel or slander to , provethat the statement was true and made for the public benefit.It is not necessary to invoice any further defence of privilege.So much for statements of truth. The honorable member then directs attention to untrue statements, which he divides into two classes - statements which are untrue as such, and statements which the person making them knows to be untrue, and the honorable member adds " and words spoken maliciously "'. </para>
                    <para>Whilstitmaybe desirable to make some provision regarding privilege in such cases,I pointout that it is proposedthat theproceedingsof Parliament shall be broadcast, notin their entirety, butin part only. Moreover, it ispossiblethat some technical defect might cuta  speaker  off the air, and that,aftersuch an interruption, hemight be putontheair again without his knowing it. In regard to words spoken in the Parliament,andnot broadcast, no action could lie, becausethe member would enjoy absolute privilege ; yet, ifthe same words were broadcast he might he liable. There will benothing to stop wordsSpoken maliciously andwith a knowledge oftheir falseness,being published in a newspaper, provided the report is a fair and substantial report of words spoken in Parliament. Doesthe honorable member propose to restrictthis privilege inregard to newspapers in the same way as he proposes to restrict it in regard to broadcasting? </para>

                        <para>.- I am not  enamoured of the provisions of this bill. Indeed, I feel most unhappy about its implications. Any measure that does not provide for the whole of the proceedings to he broadcast cannot be satisfactory. As far as I am aware, the only parliament in the British Empire whose proceedings are broadcast is the Parliament of New Zealand. The proceedings of the House of Representatives of that Dominion have been broadcast in full since. 1936. Indeed, for six hours every sitting day the proceedings are broadcast. That is approximately 24 . hours a week, which covers all the proceedings. Broadcasting times are varied to suit the sitting times. The system has given general satisfaction, although many people have ceased to listen to the broadcast. "When the novelty of listening to the parliamentary debates passed the number of listeners dropped considerably. The proceedings in the Legislative Council of New Zealand are not broadcast. I realize the difficulty of broadcasting both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament at the same time. That would involve the use of additional stations and considerable extra expense. It is for technicians to advise in this regard, and it has been suggested that perhaps the proceedings in one House could be recorded and broadcast at some other time. That would probably enable the proceedings in both Houses to be broadcast. Despite the assertions of the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein),</inline> the Parliamentary Committee on Broadcasting recommended unanimously the broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings of the Parliament.

                        <para>We suggest that provision be made for overall control to be vested in the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives as regards broadcasts from their respective chambers; that during the experimental periods the whole of the proceedings in the chamber concerned should be broadcast from the main national stations and from the regional stations, as well as from the short-wave stations, except during the short periods when "straight" news sessions (that is, excluding commentaries or observers' stories) are normally on the air. </para>

                    <para class="block">That language is unequivocal, and if the honorable member for Watson cannot understand it, he should obtain a legal opinion with which to fortify his mind. There was a minority report, which suggested that overall control should not rest with the  President  of the. Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, but that is not germane to this debate; The important fact is that the Parliamentary Committee, after having heard evidence and having deliberated for a considerable time, recommended the broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings. The broadcasting of a portion of the proceedings would definitely be at variance with the committee's report. The attitude of the committee itself, which I endorse, is that all or none of the proceedings should be broadcast. As the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> pointed out last week, a most unsatisfactory position will arise if only a part of the debate is put on the air. For example, one honorable member may attack another while the proceedings are being broadcast. The person so attacked may have a most effective reply to the charges, but when he rises to defend himself, the broadcasting of the debate may have ceased. Justice demands a fair and impartial presentation of the debates to the whole of the people, and that will not be achieved by broadcasting of portion of the proceedings. " Jockeying " for position, rushes to speak while the cham-' ber is on the air, and a dearth of speakers when the broadcast is not taking place will be experienced. That will bring about a most undesirable state of affairs. </para>

                    <para class="block">Last week the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> discussed the dangers of this clause in a most informative manner. Every one agrees that in this chamber honorable members should have the right to express their views without fear of incurring legal proceedings, and the protection which is afforded to their remarks is quite satisfactory. But citizens also require protection from slanderous attacks made in this House. Clause 14 gives to honorable members absolute licence to make- false and malicious statements, and defame citizens, who- will have no redress. That licence, if taken advantage of, would bring the Parliament into disrepute; no one would have respect for the parliamentary institution. The granting of licence to slander is quite unnecessary. The wording of the clause means  that any person - that expression in itself^ is very wide- can take a small paragraph from an honorable member's speech, divorce it from the context, and broadcast' it, for the purpose of creating in the minds- of the listeners a- misleading and untrue impression, but he would be immune from proceedings, for libel.. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the bill, and welcome this proposal to broadcast proceedings of the Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and other legal practitioners in this chamber gave honorable members most informative addresses on the possible legal consequences of broadcasting the debates. They also expressed grave concern that only a portion of the proceedings would be on the air. It is true that the ideal would be the broadcasting of the whole of the proceedings, but the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers)</inline> has already explained the reasons why that is impracticable at this juncture. If my speeches are not broadcast, my position will be no worse, regarding publicity, than- it is to-day. Some time ago, I delivered in- this chamber acarefully prepared speech on housings and! three honorable members opposite complimented me upon it. But the South Australian newspapers' did not even mention that I had participated in. the debate. Whether or not that .omission was intentional, I do .npt know. Most honorable .members have .their own ideas upon that subject. Later, I secured the ad(journment of the debate on the War Service Homes Bill. Seven or eight. days later, when the House again considered the bill, I submitted in my speech a. number of valuable and practical suggestions for accelerating the construction of war service homes. </para>

                        <para>-It. seems to be idle to debate, .at this stage, the merits and -demerits of this bill, for the. Government, consistent with its usual methods, has already incurred great expense .and made all provisions for initiating the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings; Having behind it the decision of caucus, and a clear majority of members in this chamber, the Government (has .npt seen fit to wait for parliamentary .approval before incurring substantial expense in preparatory -work. W.e have, in fact, been presented .with -.an accomplished fact. This bill -was initiated in the Senate, where certain amendments were made to it, but  sinGe  .it has come before this House numerous other amendments have been foreshadowed, in the hope rather than the conviction as far as the members of the Australian Country .party .are .concerned, that they will .have reasonable consideration by the Government. I understand that already an .expenditure of  about £10,00!0 has: been incurred in preparatory .work, without troubling1 about the need for .parliamentary appr.ov.al. This procedure, unfortunately, is in accordance with the pattern that  legislation  has followed since this Government .has been in office, although it was unknown previously, It was quite improper for the Government to anticipate parliamentary approval in this way, particularly as an urgent need exists for the provision pf technical apparatus qf this description for other purposes. The Government should have given some consideration to more urgent needs of the community. We all recognize that broadcasting is desira'ble, and that the application of it to parliamentary proceedings is in accordance with present-.day movements for the adoption of scientific methods. Procedures acceptable in years gone by 'have become outmoded to-day. Broadcasting is a scientific method of communication which should be applied to parliamentary proceedings in order that the people may be enabled to inform themselves in an up-to-date way of the doings of their elected representatives. But the incurring of an expenditure of  thousands of pounds, and the use of large quantities of technical equipment for this purpose, which could have been applied to the provision of new country telephone services or to increasing the efficiency cf established services, would have been far preferable, at least until legislative authority had been, obtained for the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. At this period of our history the Government should have been devoting all the resources at its disposal to the promotion, of ways of increasing the productivity of the country and improving our  economic  conditions. I am informed that an expenditure of £50,000 will be necessary to provide even the partial parliamentary broadcasts which the Government1 envisages. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I believe in a policy of " first things first ". The crying need of Australia to-day is a reduction of governmental expenditure as the forerunner to a reduction of taxation. A reduction of taxation would stimulate production. With an increase of production revenue from taxation would increase even if the rates of tax were reduced, as they should be. I disapprove of the proposed expenditure of £50,000 on a partial broadcast of parliamentary proceedings at a time when country people find it impossible to obtain telephones because of the lack of cable and technical equipment. No doubt a great deal of the material that has been used for the broadcasting installations that are being made in this building would have been suitable for the installation of tele-, phone services. The installations here will serve mainly city dwellers or those in the more developed parts of the Commonwealth. Each capital city already has two national stations, and regional stations have been established in various parts of the country. For this reason people in these areas will reap the maximum benefit from the parliamentary broadcasts, but those living in the outlying areas, who should be given improved amenities, will reap no benefit whatever from these broadcasts. I received a letter yesterday from a resident of Clifton- Shire complaining of the lack of telephones. I was asked to support requests made for additional telephone services on behalf of twenty to 25 farmers residing in the shire, at various distances from the township. In some cases deposits had been paid for over six months, but the hold-up was said to be due entirely to the lack of technical equipment. </para>
                    <para>In the electorate of .the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> which is by no means remotely situated in relation to some parts of the Commonwealth, the people cannot obtain any satisfactory service from existing regional stations, and very few people in the electorate of the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann)</inline> reap any advantage from them. I have .been informed that it is not the intention of the Government to broadcast parliamentary proceedings through Dalby, where one' of the most powerful regional stations in Australia was constructed by the previous Government in order to give an improved broadcasting coverage to people residing in Western Queensland and central South Australia. </para>

I informed the Broadcasting Committee that I believed in the broadcasting of parliamentary debates, but I did not consider that the' system should be instituted for the benefit of city dwellers, at the expense of the country people, nor did I consider that partial, indefinite, and incomplete broadcasts would be satisfactory. I am favorable to the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings in accordance with the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee.

                        <para>I agree that it is desirable that the debates of the Parliament should be broadcast. I have given some thought to the matter, and realize that there are debits as well as credits. </para>
                        <para class="block">On the debit side, there would be the tendency to stifle debate. I say that from my experience as the leader of a party. Even to-day in order to obtain publicity, some members are not prepared to speak at a certain hour of the night, but prefer to postpone their contribution to the debate to the following day, when they can be reported by the press. In recent times, we have had the experience of debates collapsing long before they rightfully should because some members were not prepared to proceed as the setting was not favorable to the gaining of publicity. That position would lie aggravated by the broadcasting of debates, because only a limited number of hours would bo favorable to the gaining of publicity and everybody would not be able to speak during that period. On the credit side, the broadcasting of debates would induce members to engage in greater research and to pay more attention to the composition of their speeches. These would not be so spontaneous as are speeches made from a few notes. Nevertheless that is a very desirable aspect. On the other, hand, broadcasting of debates would probably prevent members from. making certain charges which to-day are made under privilege. They are informed by correspondence that certain things are going on, and in all conscientiousness put forward those views ,on the motion for the adjournment of the House. If they were to be subjected to an effective reply by n Minister fully informed of the facts, that practice would probably break down. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> referred to the broadcasting of questions. Those who have sat in opposition know that very often a question is more effective than a speech from the " parish pump " point of view in an electorate. It is easy to obtain a reply from the secretary to a Minister, but from a political point of view that is not always desirable because the member must let his informant know that he is pressing the matter in the House. Questions without notice probably could be broadcast,- but what about a question upon notice? A member places on the notice-paper a question relating to a matter that is probably of national importance, with respect to which he genuinely desires to obtain information, and the reply is furnished at a much later date. The mechanics of the matter rather condemn the practicability of the proposal. The experience in New Zealand has been cited. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has said, the conditions in New Zealand are entirely different from those in Australia. In the first place, that dominion does not differentiate between national and regional stations. I approach the matter from the standpoint of the Australian Country party. In ail the capital cities there are two national stations. What would be the position of the people in the country, who have to depend on regional stations, if debates in the Senate and the House of Representatives were broadcast simultaneously? Has anythought been given to the difference in times between the eastern States and Western Australia V How would that be overcome? I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> stated that more legislation would be initiated in the Senate, in order to overcome the objection that that chamber does not deal with the matter when it is fresh. The most important debates we have had in recent months have been those on the banking bills. These were originated in the House of Representatives and were debated for days, almost every member participating. Who would listen to a broadcast of a debate on them when they went to the Senate ? Then we have the budget, the basis of the whole of our constitutional authority. Obviously, it must be initiated in the House of Representatives. It is debated for days, mid eventually finds its way to the Senate. Who would listen to a repetition in the Senate of all that had been said in the House of Representatives. Those are pertinent considerations in determining the desirability or otherwise of broadcasting parliamentary debates. It must be realized that, of necessity, most of our legislation must first pass through the House of Representatives, because the Senate is a house of review. There are only a few measures which could be initiated in the Senate with a view to obviating the repetition there of what had been said in the House of Representatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> political experience and knowledge of Standing Orders are much greater than mine, but I am sure that he will agree with me that there are only few measures which could be fresh news in the Senate. Could the proceedings of the Parliament be broadcast by the -Australian Broadcasting Commission with its existing facilities? It would be all right for the city-dweller, who has two national stations, but the countryside is entirely dependent on the regional stations. Licence-holders might listen for a while to political debates broadcast over regional stations, but would they consider it more important than listening to entertainment? The amenities of people who live in the country are few. How many additional stations would bc needed to give a complete cover to both Houses continuously during the sittings of the Parliament? Whatever stations might be used, there would be a period of overloading and a period of unemployment, because the Parliament does not sit continuously throughout the year. Because of exceptional circumstances it has sat since February of this year. If stations are to be specially erected in order to overcome difficulties during peak periods, when both Houses are sitting and a full cover is needed, what will be the cost of the unemployment of those stations while the Parliament is not sitting? Whilst agreeing that it is desirable to have Parliamentary debates broadcast, I am not so enthusiastic in regard to the practicability of the proposal, having regard particularly to the cost. I should be opposed to fixation of the order of debates; in that respect I agree entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> If that suggestion were adopted, constituted authority would bc infringed; because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> has said in no uncertain terms, in his eyes every member has an equal right to the call . whatever may be his oratorical qualifications or his ability to handle the subject. That right has to bc preserved unimpaired. I also agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> that if you were to pick out the " high lights ", or choose the man best qualified to discuss them, you would break  down the democratic feature of responsible government. You have to consider whether the debates are to be artificially planned or delivered in a natural atmosphere from a democratic centre. The solution is yours. I would be totally opposed to the broadcasting of debates in any sectional form. Unless everybody could have the same right to listen in, I would not favour the proposal. I would also oppose the addition of one penny to the liabilities and responsibilities of the taxpayers. There is also another aspect of which we must not lose sight. The Commonwealth Parliament is not the only Parliament in Australia; there are also the six State legislatures. </para>

                    <para>Any layman who has taken an interest in this debate must have been impressed by the warnings and cautions of legal members of this House. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has stated in concise and understandable language all the disadvantages, difficulties and dangers, from the point of view of privi-lege,  that would attend partial broadcasts. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> also has given to us the benefit df his expert knowledge. The honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> took the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> to task for having ventured into the realms of legal interpretation without being qualified to do so. He also stated that truth is an absolute- defence; if the matter be true, the defence of privilege does not arise. I remind him that that statement is not in accord with the law of libel and slander in Queensland; there, any matter published must be not only true, but also for the public benefit. As the honorable member himself is not fully acquainted with the law, he is not qualified to take, the right, honorable member for Cowper to task for having ventured to interpret the law of privilege as he understands it. Last week, .the honorable member for New England asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to state hi3 legal responsibility, and that of honorable members, as well as .the operators of the broadcasting equipment, in certain circumstances. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> replied that he had just received an opinion from the Solicitor-General, and that he would make it known to the House in due course.. The present is an opportune time to let us have the benefit of the opinion he has received. By clause 14 the Government is endeavouring to protect any person who broadcasts any portion of the proceedings of either House of the' Parliament. I understand that the, broadcasting equipment is the property, not of the. Australian Broadcasting Commission, but of the Postmaster-General's Department ; that there is a definite partition between the" mechanical facilities and the human element. </para>

                    <para>This is' not the right time, nor are the circumstances appropriate, for the making of this experiment. The broadcasting of parliamentary debates must come; but when it comes it must be undertaken completely. The proposal placed before the Parliament and the country is too incomplete and partial to ensure that value will be obtained from the' expenditure. Public money should not be expended wastefully. The first essential at the moment is the reduction of govern-  mental expenditure so as to effect desirable reductions of oppressive taxes. If the Government sincerely desires to give to- the people the benefit of modern means of communication - with which I agree - it should provide for not only a full cover of the proceedings of the Parliament but also the reception of it by every citizen of Australia. There must not be either partial broadcasts or partial reception. There are people in Australia who' have not the- benefit of listening to national stations, and they should receive whatever amenities may be available in these modern times. .Too much consideration is paid to the city dweller at the expense of ' the real wealthproducers in the country districts. The basic consideration in all circumstances should be the provision of amenities for people in the remote parts of the continent, whocannot avail themselves of existing channels of communication as cheaply and as readily as can those who live in the more densely populated -areas. Having regard to- the expense involved in this- experiment of partial broadcasts, the Government would be well advised to defer the experiment and .await a decision on it by the people, at the next elections, after which the new Parliament could deal with it. </para>

                        <para>.- It is important that the people of Australia should be given every opportunity to become acquainted with parliamentary proceedings, particularly at this time when the country is faced with many difficult problems. .Some newspapers, unfortunately, do not devote to their reports of the parliamentary debates as much space as one would expect. It is important that the people should know how the Government and the  Parliament are handling the many difficult problems with which the nation is confronted. If that U to be achieved by the broadcasting' of parliamentary debates, adoption of the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee, which investigated the matter, is essential. It recommended unanimously that the whole of the parliamentary debates should be broadcast. May I refresh the minds of some honorable gentlemen who may not have read the report?

If the broadcast were interrupted for the purpose of changing over to the Senate, and returning to the House of Representatives later, I do not think that anybody - would be satisfied. I have said that in order to give equitable treatment to both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the initiation of legislation should alternate between the two Houses. In any event, the Parliament should not surrender to the Australian Broadcasting Commission or any other authority the right to determine when its proceedings should be broadcast. </para>

That right has to be preserved unimpaired. I also agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> that if you were to pick out the " high lights ", or choose the man best qualified to discuss them, you would break down the democratic feature of responsible government. You have to consider whether the debates are to be artificially planned or delivered in a natural atmosphere from a democratic centre. The solution is yours. I would be totally opposed to the broadcasting of debates .in any sectional form. Unless everybody could have the same right to listen in, I would not favour the proposal.

                    <para class="block">The proposals before us are modelled to some degree on the practice in the New Zealand Parliament, where broadcasting has been in operation for the last ten years. Both political parties in New Zealand supported .the' broadcasting of the proceedings, but the underlying principle insisted on was that the whole of the debates should be broadcast In this Parliament, the Broadcasting Committee recommended a full broadcast of the debates, and this was approved by the  President  of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party, but the Minister for Information, who represents the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> in this chamber, now supports the appointment of a committee which could arrange for the broadcasting of' only certain portions of the debates. Parliamentary privilege could be preserved only if the debates were fully broadcast. The only fair and impartial way to broadcast speeches in this Parliament would be to publish the views of honorable member's on both sides of the chamber. If the broadcasting occurred for limited periods only, honorable member's might be subjected to unfair attacks by their opponents and be prevented from having their replies broadcast. In view of the cunning tactics of some members of the Ministry, who might have inside information as to broadcasting times, supporters of the Government could conceivably make wild attacks upon the Opposition and prevent their opponents from being heard over the air in reply. If democracy is to survive, and there is to be fair play in this matter, it is essential that the debates be broadcast impartially. The Postmaster-General's Department should make adequate technical facilities available to enable the debates to be broadcast over the widest possible area. With the development of frequency modulation, it will soon be possible to give broadcasting services in country areas similar to those available in the large cities. That work should be undertaken with despatch. The Government is under an obligation to pay heed to the recommendations .of the Broadcasting Committee. By reading paragraphs 33 to  49  of the committee's eighth report, honorable members will be able to appreciate some of the technical problems associated with the broadcasting of the debates in this Parliament. The Government seems to have rushed into this proposal hopelessly unprepared for its adoption. If it were implemented without the amendments foreshadowed by the Opposition, the scheme would wreck completely the organization of the national broadcasting stations. For an hour before and an hour after the broadcasting of parliamentary debates, the services to Queensland, South Australia . and Western Australia- over the national network would be disrupted. That is the advice of the experts of the department. The Australian Broadcasting Commission would -then be blamed for having failed to provide the broadcasting programmes promised, and would be subjected to endless irritation. The Government should withdraw the bill, recast the whole proposal, and implement the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee on the lines of the system adopted in New Zealand up to the present. The Government has rejected all advice that has been tendered to it. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened with a great deal of interest to the debate on this bill, and to the reasons or excuses advanced against the acceptance of the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for ' Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender).</inline> So far as the broadcasting of the proceedings of Parliament is concerned, the question, I am convinced, is not " to be or not to be". Definitely, it is "to be". The broadcasts will take place, and the only purpose in debating the measure lies in the remote possibility that we may be able to improve it. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The bill is a simple one designed to give effect to the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee. That committee recommended that the entire proceedings of Parliament be broadcast, and it is unfortunate that the recommendation cannot be given effect. It cannot be done because Parliament consists of two Houses with equal rights, and the time available must be divided between them. For that reason, it was inadvisable to proceed with the proposal until it was possible to give effect to the committee's recommendations in their entirety. .The committee was appointed to take -evidence and upon that basis to advise Parliament, but on this occasion the Government is departing from the committee's recommendations. </para>
                    <para>The weight of the evidence heard by the committee was to the effect that the broadcasting of the proceedings of Parliament " should not be done in such a way as to make for the aggrandisement of any member or party. It was interesting to hear the evidence tendered in support of the proposal to broadcast. Many seriousminded persons believed that broadcasting would tend to raise the tone of- debates. That is a worthy objective, and if the broadcasts have that effect the money which they cost will be well spent.  Quite a lot of people seem to have the idea that the public are awaiting with impatience zero hour so that they may turn the knobs of their receiving sets, and avail themselves of the great boonwhich it is proposed to confer upon them. </para>
                    <para class="block">That idea seems to represent, in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Johnson,</inline> " the triumph of hope over experience ". </para>
                    <para>It was certainly not the intention of the Broadcasting Committee that the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings should confer upon unauthorized persons a licence to broadcast statements which, in ordinary circumstances, would be regarded as libellous, and therefore actionable at law. I support the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable member for Warringah to clause 14 of the bill. The clause reads - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>No action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">There is nothing ambiguous in that language. If the Minister for Works and Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> were here he would agree with me that the words " any person " meansany person. He has frequently said, when referring to the wording of a clause, that it means what it says. The purpose of the amendment is to limit strictly the number of persons who can claim what amounts to parliamentary privilege. In the ordinary course of events, this privilege is enjoyed by members of Parliament only. As the clause stands it would be possible for any unauthorized person to make a record for broadcasting, and to say that so and so said this or that, and then to broadcast it. I cannot see why any one should object to the amendment, and if the objection is persisted in, such persistence will merely strengthen the belief that clause 14 is intended to have the effect which we suspect. The amendment, if accepted, would not detract in any way from the merits of the Government's proposal, and it would make the position perfectly clear. I do not like to use the term "pig-headed"; but it is a very expressive one, especially when applied to opposition to an amendment which could not fail to improve the bill. This afternoon we listened to a lawyer on the Government side defending clause 14 as it stands. Are we to assume that, in the eyes of the legal profession, any provision that is fool-proof is not a good one? </para>

Clause 14 will not affect me because I am not likely to abuse the privilege, but I am afraid that the same cannot be truthfully said of every member of this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Then let us amend the clause to make it more specific. The proposed amendment meets with the approval of the Opposition, at any rate. I, as a member of the BroadcastingCommittee, do not want to be forced into the position of voting against something which the committee recommended. We certainly did not recommend anything corresponding to clause 14, and if it remains unaltered I shall have to vote against the measure because, in its present form, it represents an abuse of the committee's recommendation. I urge the Government and its supporters seriously to consider the advisability of amending the clause so that, while not withdrawing a privilege properly enjoyed by members of this House, the public may yet be sufficiently protected. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree that the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast. However much some people may despise the Parliament, and there are many people who do despise the Parliament, its legislation, nevertheless, does command swift obedience on the part of the subject. I have said that people may despise the Parliament. Many do. It is quite common to hear members of the . electorate holding forth in a diatribe against members of Parliament, as though members of Parliament were a class apart. "Well, I have not found that they are a class apart at all. I have' always understood, as the result of long experience, that members of Parliament are drawn from common and ordinary people. Looking round this chamber, I would not conclude that its members, particularly those of the Opposition, belie that impression. In any case, as I have said, broadcasting is the only way to assure the people of a complete record of the parliamentary proceedings. And I have already said that the Parliament, however much some may despise it, does in fact, command swift obedience. Whatever is put into the statute-book generally commands respect. Indeed, is is remarkable how great a respect there is for law, and my experience is that people have a great respect for it. One has only to observe the respect that exists for the law of compulsory voting. I find that there is a very shrewd disposition to respect the law which makes for compulsory voting, although we have proof that it is  easy  enough to .make excuses for failure to vote. That is my experience, and I am quite sure that it is the experience of others. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> said that we must not slander people under privilege. Well, like him, I think I am not accustomed, as a practice, to use my privilege in Parliament to slander others. I am not conscious that I regularly do that. On the contrary, I think that, speaking with the responsibility of a member of Parliament, I avoid, as one is required to avoid, extravagant statements, reflecting upon others. But I find that this complaint is made, amongst others, by newspapers, in some cases enjoying a circulation of 120,000 daily, or, at least; claiming to do so, which, perhaps, is a different thing. Well, I would venture to point out that these newspapers, which make this complaint against members of the public, enjoy a privilege which, in fact, can never be overtaken, under which reputations of individuals are constantly assailed, and numbers of others outside the Parliament, who do not even enjoy the slight protection that members enjoy, are slandered vilely and to the utmost. Yet editors make these strident complaints in the columns of the daily press against members of Parliament, because they, it is said., slander other individuals to whom no opportunity to reply is vouchsafed. Members of Parliament, are subject to very strict rules asto their conduct, and those rules are often applied in a summary manner, A single vote on the part of the majority of the House can turn any honorable member out of this chamber. A single vote on the part of the majority of the House can suspend an honorable member and deprive him of the privileges which he has won at the ballot-box. In a number of ways, although apparently a member of the Queensland Parliament seems to have been .able to dodge such treatment, honorable members are subject to various forms of discipline. I have been long enough in this House to remember an honorable member being expelled, unjustly, I think; but he was ejected nevertheless. And, although the requirements of democracy are that such an honorable member may still submit himself to the electors, it is historic that in many cases - I mention, for instance, Wilkes and Bradlaugh - he has been obliged to submit himself repeatedly for re-election before he established his undoubted democratic rights, because the term of a parliament is not such as to encourage honorable members to disregard its disciplinary rules. I have sometimes succeeded professionally in marking down the newspaper slanderer and have required him to withdraw and &lt; apologize, a fact of which I am not a little proud. It is very seldom that one finds 'the withdrawal, or the apology, published in a position even corresponding to that in which the slander itself was published; but the fact remains that one is able sometimes to mark down the slanderer and require him to make tardy amends. When he does attempt to make amends he does so with very bad grace, and I have had occasion to point this out to many of my newspaper friends. Newspapers employ men of different types in their work of circulating news and, like members of Parliament, some of these men are scrupulous whilst some are utterly unscrupulous. I speak as one who has had a long experience of the newspaper world, and I have found that newspapers are not always particular, but I hope that the time will never come, and I ask honorable members opposite to support me in the view that it should never come, when the ages-old and very important privilege of Parliament shall be destroyed. This privilege lies at the base of popular rights. It rests upon the rights of individuals to come to the Parliament, where alone they may utter the thing that is in them because of the right which they draw from the people. The individual is returned to the Parliament, and it is his proud privilege, but not so proud as it might appear, to say in the Parliament what he cannot under any circumstances say in any other place. As I said, that right is drawn from popular rights. Sometimes the individual says something that may be unjust, but, in all circumstances, it is much better that he should say the thing which is unjust than . that he should be prevented from saying it. He says the thing - in my opinion, very properly - that he thinks should be said. Sometimes, perhaps, the statement should not be made, but the fact remains that he, at that time, considered that it should be made, and it is better that he should say it in Parliament rather than that he should bottle it up and say it privately to individuals because that might do more harm than the original publication in the Parliament would do. </para>
                    <para>The opposition to this bill has a political motive. The purpose of honorable gentlemen opposite is to stall off the' broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings with the true and certain knowledge that they will get consideration in the daily press. That seems to be the general view. The press of the metropolis and the country districts gives to them a much better deal than it habitually gives to members of the Labour party. The Opposition derives much more support electorally from the press than do honorable members on this side of the chamber. Wealth is on their side. I remember the extraordinary propaganda inflicted on the people which resulted in my nevertobeforgotten defeat. </para>

                            <para>- Oh, no. The individual who comes into this Parliament and abuses parliamentary privilege should be dealt with by the Parliament and the electors. . I certainly do not believe that the newspapers, which in the past enjoyed a larger measure of privilege than is accorded to members of this Parliament, should be permitted to continue to enjoy that privilege unchecked. The Parliament would do well to see that the privilege of its members in respect of the words spoken in the Parliament is retained. I say this because I have heard of 'some cases in which members of the Parliament have been denied the right to express their views. I support the bill! </para>

                        <para>. - In studying this bill some events come to one's mind; two of  which are comparatively recent. During this debate we have heard a lot about parliamentary privilege; yet when we returned here on the 18th June we found that, without any prior consultation in the Parliament, all sorts of arrangements had been made inside this chamber for the broadcasting of the debates. If ever there was a serious and reprehensible breach of the privilege of Parliament it was the action of the Government in setting up these microphones we now see before us. No authority whatever has been given by this Parliament, either to the Government or to anybody else, to install this equipment. </para>

                    <para>The next event happened in the- Senate to-day. The matter that I want to canvass is the reliability of the news broadcasts of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to-day. I have been informed that one of the best speeches ever made on a certain aspect of foreign relations, whether one agreed with it or not, was made to-day in the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong.</inline> Yet, apparently because the honorable senator made bold to make certain critical remarks in regard to the handling of the Spanish situation by the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> not one reference to the speech was made in the <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> o'clock news broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to-night. </para>

                            <para>- What was omitted from "the news broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission to-night provides some justification for a closer acquaintance by the electorate with what is taking place in this Parliament. I am not opposed to broadcasting the proceedings of this House. I believe that the more closely acquainted the electors become with the truth of the position in this House, the better  will  it be for good and sane government. But I am not able to convince myself, and nothing that I have heard from the other side has helped to convince me, that the elector will be better informed by partial broadcasts of the proceedings of each House of the Parliament. I stand firmly in support of the contention of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> that, if the electorate is to be fully informed, or is to have the- right fully to inform itself, either the whole of the proceedings, or none at all, should be broadcast. I see no half-way house. </para>

                            <para>- I see no reason why they should not be made simultaneously, the people having their choice as to whether they shall listen to the House of Representatives or the Senate. The debates in the two Houses are of equal importance. The members of the Senate, unlike the members of the Legislative Councils of the Australian States and New Zealand, the Senate in Canada, and the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, are elected. by the same people as elect members to the House of Representatives. Consequently, the electorate is entitled to be fully informed in regard to the proceedings in both Houses. But under this bill it will not be. A committee is to be set up. Doubtless the members of at will go very carefully into the time that should be allotted to each House, and, in their wisdom, with the aid of that redoubtable " <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Majority</inline> ", who decides so many questions in this world, will determine when broadcasts shall be made of the debates in the House of Representatives, and when they shall be made of the debates in the Senate. It may be that certain debates will be initiated in this House, but will not be concluded before the switch-over is made, with the result that listener's will b'e deprived tff their right to bear subsequent speeches oh a' matter in which they are interested. The Government is not  able to c'anva'ss the matter of expense, which do'es not seem to worry it in' the slightest degree. We have had before us other bills, one of which provided for the expenditure of ,a mere £800',000 on a national university which I am quite sure is n6t needed and will never be used. If the Government is prepared to  incur  the expense of broadcasting the proceedings of this House little additional expense would be involved in broadcasting also the proceedings of the Senate, particularly as that chamber is known to sit on fewer days and for shorter periods than does the House of Representatives. In these modern times we hear a lot about democracy. Not a very good set of definitions of democracy is available. There was a time, when democracy, in other parts of the world,- functioned in a way very different from that in which it functions here. In those days the free men of .the tribe met and decided, by argument if possible and, if not, by more forceful methods, what was to be done. </para>

                        C AMERON.- Does the honorable member refer to forceful methods? The law does not permit them to be used ; otherwise^ many decisions might be made much more quickly than they are made by argument. Those days' ii.i'e gone, perhaps never to return, at all events ill our time. We have reached the stage at which, with the spread of population, the great units  of which democratic countries are composed to-day demand some form of representative government. It is only meet and just that the people who are governed from Canberra, for whom laws are made and in whose supposed interests they are administered by nineteen Ministers, should know just how this Parliament and those Ministers approach the problems with which they   are  confronted. My desire is that the people should become- better acquainted with the doings of this Parliament, if that
                        <inline font-style="italic">hp</inline>
                        possible. But against that I put this i: The interests of the people, their tastes an'd1 their views, a're very diverse; consequently,' the parliamentary broadcasts will have to compete with other broadcasts. Competition will be met from both the national stations and the commercial stations'. I should say that the commercial stations- will be by far the more formidable competitors, because they broadcast such items" as the  " Quiz Kids  " and radio  plays - to  which  I seldom listen except under duress; I have not heard one in which there was not a murder at least every half -hour, to. say nothing of a little gun-running, and other odds and ends of adventure. Musical people will, of course, adhere to the programmes that cater for their tastes. Is it likely that a very large percentage of the electorate will desire to listen to parliamentary debates? That' is the first question we have to resolve.  The second is whether it is likely that a very large percentage of that small percentage will be  able,  and willing if  able,  to listen to a  debate to its conclusion; They will be in no different condition from others who pick up a volume of
                        <inline font-style="italic">Ronsard,</inline>
                        or who happen to visit . this House, coming" in and going out when they like. I suspect that there will be occasions on which the elector will be only too happy to turn the knob, cutting off his or her reception of the parliamentary broad-1 cast and getting on to something that is more interes'ting and congenial. Furthermore, whatever may be their desires, a great part of the electorate will not be able to afford the time to listen for lengthy periods to 'what the Parliament is doing in regard to any important  matter.
                    </para>
                    <para>Much as we may desire to have our debates broadcast, the taxpayers have certain rights, but I doubt whether, under the present governmental set-up, they are considered at all. Therefore, we should be well advised to postpone this proposal until after the general elections. It would' not be a" good thing if our debates were put over the air for the first time just as the present Parliament is about to expire. The scheme if acceptable^ should commence when the new Parliament assembles. The closing days of the session will riot afford the electorate the best idea of h'ow Parliament functions. There is" bound to be a rush of business towards the end. In some parliaments the 'end is rather sudden and, perhaps, undignified. It may be so on this occasion. There may he  disappointment  on the part of the people, if they regard this Parliament :as a forum where only first-class orator's may find a place. "When our debates go- on the air, no doubt the electors will have their minds disabused of that idea. I agree with the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> that the Parliament cannot be much better than the people who elect it. I remember one member saying to me that in his view no 'Cabinet could function successfully if more than one-third of its members were -first-rate men. In the case of the present Ministry, nothing like one-third fall within that category, and the best seem to be going overseas at an unprecedented rate. The surprising thing to me is that the Ministry faces the contest ahead of it with equanimity. </para>
                    <para>A good deal may be said in favour of postponing the adoption of the scheme until television is in operation. If to the benefits of broadcasting we could only add those of television, the electors would be perfectly informed of the proceedings in this Parliament. Now and again&gt; under the stress of circumstances, I move about the country a little, and I suspect that with television in operation it might be thought by the electors that they were setting a vision of some animal munching hay. It has been said that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard'</inline> dresses up our .speeches in such a way that' we ourselves cannot recognize them. With the honorable member for Deakin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hutchinson)</inline> I was listening to one of my friend's opposite during a trial broadcast. He has a weak voice, but I assure honorable members that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> has never done to any member's speech a better job than the microphone did to the voice of my friend opposite. It sounded like that of a first-class orator, so he has nothing whatever to fear from broadcasting. </para>

I ha've listened to debates in -this chamber for twelve, years, and one of the things I have noticed is the increasing tendency on the part of honorable members practically to read speeches rather than deliver them. </para>

                            <para>- I would be begging an answer from the honorable member for Batman, but I am afraid that if I did I should not get one. The matters to which I have referred ought to be considered before the measure is approved. I doubt whether the Government had given to the bill, before its introduction, the consideration which the issues at stake demand. No sooner had the bill reached this chamber from the Senate than the Minister in charge of it forecast certain vital amendments relating to privilege. I believe in the maintenance of parliamentary privilege and the rights of honorable members, but I am doubtful whether on certain occasions during this Parliament the right  course was taken. I can understand that courts of law in British countries will accept the principle of parliamentary privilege, but the broadcasts of parliamentary debates will be heard in other than British countries. Once they are put on the air they will be heard in Dutch, French and American possessions very close to us. What will be the position if an honorable member were to say something that was regarded as defamatory by a Dutchman or Frenchman or American? I have heard things said in this House from time to time- </para>

                        <para>.- I favour the broadcasting of parliamentary debates - for better or for worse. Parliament is at present too remote from the people, and the broadcasting of debates will bring it nearer to them. The isolation of Canberra tends to create a false impression in the minds of the people regarding what happens here. For instance, any one listening to the proceedings in this chamber last Thursday night might be pardoned for thinking that they were taking place in a stadium. At the present time, the reporting of Parliament is dependent upon the press and <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard.</inline> The newspapers give to the proceedings of Parliament as much space as they can afford, having regard to the various items of interest which compete with parliamentary news. We may believe that we are uttering here pearls of wisdom, but the newspaper reports are often very much condensed whilst an unseemly incident in the chamber will be recorded at length and in overtones. That is a pity. On the other hand, the proceedings of Parliament are fully reported by the <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> staff which takes great pains' to record our speeches. However, the circulation of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is, I understand, only about 14,000, and I believe that all the people, whatever their political opinions may be, should be able to hear the debates. I do not often find myself in agreement with the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> ; but I believe with him that many persons despise Parliament, and criticize the democratic way of life, because their opinion of Parliament is based on a misconception. They have not had an opportunity to see the Parliament at work, but if they were able to listen to broadcasts of proceedings they might form a better opinion of parliamentary institutions. Members of Parliament form a cross section of, the people, and reflect1 the shortcomings and attributes of the people. After all, Parliament does matter. It is the national forum, the value of which is, unfortunately, limited by the fact that members of the Labour party are shackled by caucus discipline so that, in open Parliament, they are not permitted to speak freely. The government in office at any time is really an executive committee appointed by the most powerful party. What it decides becomes law, and the laws affect the well-being and happiness of every person in the community. If there had been a democratic governmentin Germany in 1938-39, such as that which was set up after World War I., the last war would probably never have occurred. We know that in Russia, neither now nor at any time for the last  25 years, has there been democratic government. In the eyes of the Russians, their government is democratic, but there is no political liberty there .because no political opposition is tolerated, and in elections the people may vote for the candidates of only one party. In a democracy, on the other hand, the people may vote for whom they like, and their representatives in Parliament are free to say what they choose. Therefore, * it is important that the people should be provided with an opportunity to hear their representatives in Parliament. That is what will be achieved by the broadcasting of proceedings. In this instance it will represent the application of science for a beneficial purpose instead of, as so often happens, for destructive purposes. Judging by the experience in connexion with broadcasting parliamentary debates in New Zealand, nothing but good can come of the innovation. Broadcasting should have the effect of raising the tone of debates in Parliament. A member will think twice before behaving in a disorderly manner when he knows that he can be heard by listeners all over Australia. The broadcasts should also have the effect of improving the diction of  honorable members. There are so many other things' for the radio listener to hear that he will not give his attention to members of Parliament who talk twaddle, or whose manner of speech he regards, as unbearable. I believe that, on balance, good will result from broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. Our national and commercial broadcasting stations are of good standing, as anybody knows who can compare them with overseas broadcasting services. It is the limitation that the Government is proposing to which I object. I do not see how the Government can possibly provide that only parts of debates shall be broadcast. Although I have a motion on the notice paper for to-morrow, I shall not be able to debate it then, because the House has resolved at the instance of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> that Government business . shall take precedence. Under the system that is developing in this chamber, as private members on both sides know, Ministers make long, wearying statements at the table. And it may be that their statements will take up most of the broadcasting time, with the result that the listening public will not hear the ebb and flow of debate, and will thus not be able to form their own m conclusions. A thorough inquiry was made into the proposal that the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament be broadcast, and the recommendation of the committee was that -all the debates should be broadcast. For ten years all the debates in the New Zealand House of Representatives have been broadcast. The proceedings of the Upper House in N.ew Zealand are not, I concede, broadcast, but the set-up there is different from that of the Australian Senate, which is elected on the same . franchise as is the House of Representatives. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> suggested to the Broadcasting Committee that it recommend that the . proceedings in both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament be broadcast, and to enable that to be done you proposed a simple arrangement of the programmes of both Houses in respect of the origination of legislation. Yet the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> declares that the proceedings in both Houses cannot be broadcast. , </para>

The  President  of 'She -Senate <inline font-weight="bold">('Senator Brown)</inline> recommended the broadcasting of all the proceedings, and the Broadcasting Committee, on which the Labour party is represented strongly, recom-' mended it. Labour members of the committee are the honorable member for Bourke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bryson),,</inline> the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers),</inline> the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins),</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour.</inline> They subscribed to the recommendation that the whole debate be broadcast. Yet the ..Government brings down this bill, which runs counter to the recommendations of its own supporters on the "Broadcasting Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 'Speaker</inline> and the  President  of the Senate, and to the practice followed successfully for ten years in New Zealand. This' is an emasculated, inadequate proposal. What the Government proposes is that a committee shall say how much of the debate shall be broadcast and how many speakers shall  be broadcast. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. To broadcast only a part of the debate will be undemocratic. The people have a right to know what is happening here, but if a mere fraction of the debate is to be. broadcast or the vilification of an individual is to be broadcast without the reply to that vilification being broadcast, they will not be able to enjoy thatright and will be given only a distorted picture of the proceedings. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot believe that the honorable member, a former Attorney-General, will be prepared to sit back in silence if he is elbowed off the air by others whom the proposed committee might think more worthy of the right to have their thoughts broadcast. Sooner or later, he will object if that happens. Parliamentary committees have not always been the success that they should have been. I concede that many of them work in earnest and produce good results, but if the proposed committee should decide that certain groups !of Ministers should monopolize the air at the expense .of other honorable members who have something important, not parochial, but national, to say to the electorate through the broadcasting system, that would be most inappropriate. I appeal to the good sense of the Govern - ment to realize that the scheme put forward in this tbill is not . workable. Members of the proposed committee will not be able to agree on the subjects that should be broadcast or as to who should broadcast. Now is 'the time 'to put the service on a proper basis. I consider that honorable' members would unanimously approve if- 'the Government decided to have all the proceedings broad- " cast. The troubles of Australia are manmade. This nation escaped almost unscathed during the war. Blessed by all the resources of Providence, it has no real problem that cannot be -solved if only the political parties get together. If parties dropped their party bias and said, "We will settle these problems ", what a subject that would be to broadcast, but, narrow-mindedly, the Government says, " No, all the proceedings will not be broadcast - just snippings, clippings and excerpts ". That is robbing the people of a part of their heritage. At the cost of,  I believe, £10,000 a forest of microphones was installed in this chamber during the recess, indicating to honorable members that the Government intended to carry out the recommendations made to it by providing for the broadcasting of all the proceedings'; but this inadequate, bill, under which a committee will decide how little of the proceedings shall be broadcast, will cause the people to say that the money has been ill spent. I advise the Government to look into the matter again and to agree that the whole of the proceedings shall be broadcast. Nothing  short of that will receive the approval of the people. </para>

                        <para>. -  This bill reminds me of the decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Roger</inline> de Coverley in. a famous judgment, immortalized by Addison in the <inline font-style="italic">Tatler.</inline> But, levity aside, there was much to be said on both sides. I am rather diffident about supporting this bill because, not being a gifted speaker, I should be at a great disadvantage in having my speeches broadcast in comparison  with ,some honorable members, particularly men on the front benches, natural orators, "who would have a greater appeal to listeners. But- in addressing' myself to the bill 1 am fortified by the knowledge that, although my' electors will be delighted to . listen in to the debates, the people generally are not so interested in the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings as honorable members imagine. I have very good reason to believe that they are not. That does not refer to my electorate, because the people" there are. politically minded. They have no legislature, no legislative council, not even a town council. They must be federally and politically minded, because they look to me, as their representative, to solve or try to solve, all their problems, whereas people in the -States have their State legislatures, municipal . councils, roads boards and so on to occupy their attention, and they will not be greatly interested in 90 per cent, of the purely domestic matters that are debated in this House. I admit that the " hill-billys " of Kings Cross, the Yarra Bank, the Sydney Domain and such places will be almost diving into their radio, sets to listen to the riotous matter that so often emanates from honorable gentlemen, but they will not be interested in the really sensible speeches that are never even reported in the press. I am delighted when my speeches are not reported, because I know that that indicates their excellence. I remember clearly that when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom was with me as an independent member of this Parliament he made, one morning, an excellent speech, one that was full of oratory and common sense, but not one word of it was reported in the press. He was disgusted. I mention this for the benefit of new members, and I advise ill em not to be surprised if the press does not report their speeches. Usually, that is a sign that an honorable member has made a good speech. If I had the oratory of Lord Rosebery, I should never be in  difficulties. I could indulge in his mixed metaphor of which I call to mind the following example : " I smell a rat. I see it floating in the air. I shall nip it in the bud ". And I am not .able to emulate Charles Lamb in the use of the long sentence. If I. were, I should be worth listening to. That master of paradox, G. K. Chesterton, says, " There are some people who look upon the big things as little things, but men mistake little things for big things ". That observation </para>

                            <para>- We should pay due regard to our privilege as members of the Parliament. We should refrain from abusing.it to the detriment of people outside who cannot speak for themselves. However, an honorable member fails in his duty if he does not exercise his privilege to expose some evil which he knows to exist. Any honorable member who fails in that respect does so because he. is not gifted with intestinal fortitude, but has the physiology of a snipe. I believe that the benefits to be derived from broadcasting proceedings in Parliament will not be commensurate with the expenditure involved. Serious-minded people, who would elect a sane government, prefer to read of parliamentary proceedings in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> Honorable members are allowed a free issue of only 35 copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I should like to see that number increased even to 3,600. I do not believe that any honorable member would have any difficulty in distributing that number. Already, my list is full, and in addition I subscribe for copies which I make available to various people. If the Government, wished to induce seriousminded people to read <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> it would instead of broadcasting proceedings in this chamber in some hill-billy fashion, advertise the fact that -the yearly subscription to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is 4s., and that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> may be obtained from the Government Printer, Canberra. I know of very many people who are hardly aware that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> exists. They certainly do . not know where to obtain it, and they do not know its price. If this 'Government were anxious to serve the needs of seriousminded people in this matter it would advertise <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and encourage the public generally to read it. The printed report of speeches in Parliament will always be more serviceable than the broadcasting of speeches, because radio listeners will receive muddled impressions of what happens in this chamber. Honorable member's opposite seem to be very anxious to confine the broadcasting of proceedings in Parliament to stations which serve the capital cities and more densely populated centres. I am astonished at the Government's objection to the suggestion made by the right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> that the regional station at Dalby should be used for this purpose. Apparently, no provision is to be made to enable residents of Moresby, Darwin, Alice Springs and the sparsely populated areas to the north of Australia to listen to these debates. I understand that the military authorities are about to relinquish control of eight stations at Darwin, Moresby and other northern centres, which they took over during the war. if the privilege of listening to proceedings in Parliament over the air is to be given to people in the more densely populated areas, it is incumbent upon the Government to make similar facilities available to people in the outlying areas which I have mentioned.  The Government, if necessary, should allow the people of Darwin to purchase the local station and operate it on a community basis as a regional station. The residents of New Guinea have no representative in this Parliament. They look to me to represent them, and to voice their needs in the difficult task of rehabilitating themselves after their awful experiences during the war. I urge the Government to provide a station at Darwin. It has been said that honorable members should say what they mean and mean what they say. If they follow that rule the broadcasting of proceedings in Parliament- may be of some benefit to the public. However, having regard to the words often spoken in heat in the course of a debate, the written -report of -proceedings is preferable to the broadcasting of speeches. Most of us, I hope, will have something worth-while to say; and I hope that most of us will mean what we say. However, maty honorable members opposite speak with their tongues in their cheek. From a national point of view I hope that they do; but from the point of view of party politics I hope that the reverse is the case, because out of their mouths will they be convicted.' I refer honorable members to Professor Walter Murdoch's delightful essay, entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Art of Writing.</inline> The Professor explained that for many years he had been delivering to university students lectures on the art of writing. He had advised them regarding the proper positions in a sentence of commas, semicolons, emphatic words, and the like. The idea of saying, what we mean, and meaning what we say, will have a direct bearing upon the desirability of broadcasting the debates of this Parliament. Professor Murdoch wrote - </para>

                        <para>Say what you mean - how easy it sounds, how hard it really is! It is, in fact, an ideal, never to. be completely realized by mere mortals. Let me illustrate by a figure of speech which I may have thought of for myself or found in some book or other. (It seems too good to be mine.) There are various ways of getting eggs to market. One way is to put them in a basket and carry them; this is a slow and laborious method, though a fairly safe one. Another way, an up-to-date and expeditious way, would be to put them down the muzzle of a cannon, find the range accurately, take good aim, and shoot them to market. Assume, for the sake of argument, that they would arrive; but in what condition would they arrive? Well, the whole art of writing is the art of getting our eggs to market without breaking them; that is, of getting our ideas to the mind of the reader without changing them beyond recognition. If you can so write that your thought reaches the reader's mind exactly as it was when it was a thought in your mind, you are the perfect writer. But there has never been a perfect writer. If the spirit of Shakespeare could look into our minds as we read Hamlet's soliloquy,he would say, "No, no; that wasn't exactly what I meant; you've got it wrong! " </para>

                            <para>- That must be the explanation. Honorable members opposite have not been able to address themselves to the provisions of the bill with any sense of responsibility. The tower of Babel never heard more diverse tongues than those spoken on the Opposition benches on this bill. We witnessed the extraordinary spectacle of members of the Broadcasting Committee, which made recommendations on the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament, repudiating their own signatures. I shall hot allow those honorable gentlemen to escape so lightly as they hope. The vice-  chairman  of the committee is none other than the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis),</inline> who presented to this chamber the Eighth Report of the Broadcasting Committee. </para>

The proposed Australian service is canvassed in para- . graphs 15-17 of the report, the legalaspects are considered in paragraphs 18-39. and the extent of the proposed Australian service is mentioned in paragraphs 20-32. In paragraph 34 the committee commenced to grapple with the problem. It stated that it had canvassed the possibility  of  using the whole  of  the 22 national stations for a simultaneous broadcast of the proceedings of both chambers, the course recommended by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> and other honorable gentlemen during this debate. 'The committee made the following observations-: - </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Were it not' for the high expenditure involved, -the ideal arrangement would be the provision of .a  network  of ,22 national  medium wave stations  /capable -of serving nearly all the populated  portions  of .Australia. Equipment alone, however., would entail expenditure in the  neighbourhood  of £500.000. But apart from the cost, there ar.e insuperable difficulties owing -to the shortage of radio channels, unless the licences .of some commercial stations were not renewed at the expiration of their annualperiod of tenure, to enable their channels to be allocated for the purpose, or unless recourse is made -to the sharing of channels to -a greater extent than .at present, .with resultant degrading of service to listeners on account of the clash of simultaneous transmission fromstations operating on the same channel. </para>
                    <para class="block">That w.as the unanimous opinion of themembers of the Broadcasting Committee. When it w.as found that because of the insuperable difficulties encountered, ' and the large expenditure involved, the proposal to use the 22 national stations was impracticable, the committee set out to discuss other .suggestions for the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament. It mentioned a fifth proposition. Paragraph 3S - and ' again this was unanimously agreed to - reads - </para>
                    <para>A fifth proposition is to use the second national stations 'in the capital cities and Newcastle. This idea would result in the service being withheld from country districts  which  rely on their local regional station for national broadcast reception. On the other hand, if these regional stations were included, listeners in areas which rely on such stations exclusively for broadcast service would not have an alternative national programme. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Broadcasting Committee then proceeded to discuss the merits of a sixth proposition, involving a .combination of three possibilities, viz., the use of the second national stations in each capital city and Newcastle, the use of short-wave stations to augment the service for listeners in the country and remote areas, and the use of selected country commercial stations willing to sell time. It rejected the sixth proposition however, and came back to the decision which it finally reached which is reported in paragraph 45 as follows : - </para>
                    <para>The only remaining proposition under present conditions is the use of the main national stations in the capital cities- and there are in each of the capital cities two national stations, one the main station, and the other an alternative station - and the national regional stations in the country districts supplemented by short-wave service to remote areas. </para>

It was accordingly decided that a committee consisting of members of both Houses of the Parliament should be established. Provision for that is included in the bill. In his reservation to the report, the honorable member for Wilmot suggested that in the case of the House of Representatives a committee consisting of the  Speaker,  the Prime Minister, another Minister nominated, by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the "Leader of the Australian Country ' party should be appointed to determine matters relating to the times of the broadcasts and other matters affecting the privilege of members.

The Broadcasting Committee unanimously recommended all that is con tained in this bill, and the honorable member apparently does not know what he signed, has forgotten what he signed, or does not care what he signed. -And any one of these, is equally reprehensible.

                        <para>We do not consider that, it would be advisable at this stage to specify particulars of the service in legislation, as experience may disclose a need for modification of the detailed arrangements initially decided upon. It would therefore be preferable, as regards this particular subject, to prescribe the details in regulations under section 107 of the Broadcasting Act, as they could be altered more readily by amended regulations than under the processes involved 'in. amending them if they were set out in the act. Any such modifications would  still be subject to the sanction of Parliament under the procedure laid down for making regulations. </para>

                    <para>The Government has decided not to hand over to anybody outside the Parliament the right to make regulations controlling the broadcasting of the debates of the Parliament. It has decided to set up a joint committee of the Parliament for that purpose. Clause 12 of the bill provides - (1.) The Committee shall consider and specify in a report presented to each House of the Parliament, the general principles upon which there should be determined the days upon which, and the periods during which-, the proceedings of -the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be broadcast. (2.) The Committee shall, in accordance with general principles specified by the Committee and adopted by each House of- the Parliament, determine the days upon which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of either House of the Parliament shall be broadcast. </para>
                    <para class="block">Thus honorable members will be given an opportunity to debate the principles recommended by the committee and if it is thought that the committee has recommended a procedure unacceptable to  the House, objections can be made. There is nothing to prevent the committee from deciding that once a bill is initiated in either chamber of the Parliament it shall be broadcast through all stages until the debate is concluded. There is nothing to justify the suggestion that there will be a partial debate or that some members will be given advantage over others. Before this bill came before the House, the Broadcasting Committee was in agreement with the general principles outlined in it, but some members of the committee apparently cannot understand the draftsman's way of interpreting their ideas; I assure them that what the Government has done in this bill is even better than most of them desired. </para>

                            <para>- No. The privilege granted by the Constitution, which protects the members of this Parliament, is a privilege that ' has existed from the earliest days of colonial legislation. In the legislation of the parliaments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia there are provisions somewhat similar to that which appears in the Australian Constitution; but  they give to members of the State legislatures- no more protection than is accorded to members of the House of Commons. It has remained for- an honorable member, who is not here to-night to move his amendment in committee, to rise in his place in this Parliament to suggest during the earlier stages of the bill, that the privileges which have existed in this country under all forms of representative government for over 90 years .should now be diminished. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> in making his contribution to the debate, said this - </para>

                        <para>I have for a long time been convinced that quite apart from the aspect of broadcasting, there is a need for the establishment of a committee of privileges, consisting  of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition, which, upon an honorable member rising in his place and claiming that parliamentary privilege has been abused, should have power to discipline the offending member, and, in extreme cases, te impose "penalties even as drastic as suspension from the service of this House for a. long period. . . . </para>
                        <para>The absolute privilege which applies in this House springs from ancient times.

                    <para class="block">That is what Hitler said, and what every dictator has said. It is always said by those who .desire to whittle down the privileges of the Parliament so that wealth may bestride this country and dominate it. Honorable members are sent here by the common people, and they are protected in anything they say for the 'common good; but, if the honorable member for Warringah had his way, there would be no protection "at all, and certainly not for members of the Labour party. There are people in this country who think that it is a breach, of privilege to say that the present system of society is based on the lie that every citizen can get social justice and economic security. Certain honorable members opposite have developed strange ideas about privilege. The Leader of the Opposition said that the proper way to correct a certain matter affecting' privilege to which he had referred was " not by removing the privilege of the Parliament. That would be a tremendous step and a very dangerous step ". The honorable member for Warringah remarked - </para>

                    <para class="block">This is not a hill in which to make any alteration of the privilege of members of this Parliament, because the measure will be administered by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron).</inline> He is not the Minister to deal with questions of members' privileges.- Therefore, much that the honorable member for Warringah has said in his contribution to the debate will probably not be .considered by the House at all. He has foreshadowed an amendment which fully complies with a definition given by the late Alfred Deakin, in describing a speech made by one of his political opponents, when he said, "It consists of a necklace of- negatives ". I have no doubt that the honorable member's amendment will be rejected at a later stage. I have quoted from paragraphs 43 to .49 of the report of the Broadcasting Committee, to which the honorable member for Moreton referred, and have pointed out that the signature of the honorable member was appended to the report. I quoted the appropriate reference in the. report regarding the privilege, which should be given to the members of the committee to be established under the bill and any other persons engaged in broadcasting the debates. That covers the employees of the commercial .stations and. any short-wave stations- which broadcast speeches made- in this, or the other  House of the Parliament from the floor, of the House. I hope later, that we- may  have a. joint sitting, of. both branches of the legislature to hear the Prime Minister of Great.  Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Attlee.</inline> Perhapshonorable members opposite will object to . that. </para>

It is true that the committee can:vassed all possibilities of broadcasting the proceedings of' this. Parliament, and the Minister took up most of his time in reading- the comments of the committee. But" the recommendations rather than the comments are the meat of this report. The committee was charged with the responsibility of inquiring whether the broadcasting of parliamentary debates is desirable, and', if so, to what extent should' such broadcasts be undertaken. In answer to that I turn to the recommendation which I claim is meat and not comment. The recommendation of the committee to which I consented reads - </para>

                        <para>. -  The amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> raises in a neat form one of the two principal matters debated on this bill. I have risen not merely to repeat what I said on the second reading, but to say that when the debate began I was under the impression that this was a non-party measure, that it concerned the relation of outside public authorities to the Parliament, and I therefore express my profound disappointment that we should have been treated at the end of the second-reading debate to a purely party political outburst on the subject. The question before the committee is not to be determined by arguing about what the Broadcasting Committee said. Its views are in print, and we all have had the opportunity of reading them and we know what they are. The question involved in this clause is whether we should broad- cast the whole or only a part of the projeedings of the Senate or the House of Representatives. Some attempt has been made to suggest that honorable members on this side do not want to have the proceedings of the Parliament broadsast. Why honorable gentlemen opposite should deem this to be so I do not know. For one, I am very keen on having the proceedings of the Parliament broadcast, and I do not imagine that any more harm will come to one side than to the other as the result of their being broadcast. But the real question, to my mind, is whether we are to broadcast only a part  of the proceedings. That is a matter which concerns all honorable members, regardless of the party to which they belong. It is not a matter of government or opposition. If only a part of the debate is broadcast, we are conceding that the public may receive one side of an argument or one side of an exchange, and not the other. </para>

Nor can it incur the expenditure of £500,000 in tying , up 22 national broadcasting stations, because that is what is involved, instead of six national stations, one in each capital city, and a seventh in Newcastle, andsuch other regional or short-wave stations as the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings decides. It has been suggested that the short-wave and regional stations are not to be used for the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. No one has. any authority to say that. The committee will decide that, and if I understand the temper of honorable members aright, it is almost unanimously desired that the regional stations, as well as the national stations  in  the capital cities and in Newcastle, shall be given the opportunity of broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. We must start somewhere, and we are making this experiment in the way in which the Broadcasting Committee itself recommended. The amendment cuts right acrosswhat is recommended, and the Government cannot accept it. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister has departed from his contention that the Broadcasting Committee did not recommend that the broadcast of parliamentary proceedings should bein full, andnow argues that the proceedingscannot be broadcast in full becauseofthe costs. The matter before us concerns not. only whether the proceedings should hefully or partially broadcast, but also whether partial broadcasting willgive immunityto the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In his second-reading speech, the Leader of theOpposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said that there was an obligation on the newspapers to publish a fair andaccurate report of the proceedings in theParliament, butwhat will he the position of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which will be broadcastingonly a part of the proceedings? Will the commission have the necessary privilege conferred upon it to broadcast only part of a debate? Libelous statements may be made and the broadcast stopped before they can bereplied to Itm ay happen that only one side of a debate would be broadcast. Thatwould not be a fair presentation of the cases presented in the House. The Government seeks to meet that point by providing immunity to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In my second-reading speech I raised the point as to whether a special privilege should be granted to one section of the community in respect of the broadcasting of speeches in the Parliament. It is unjustifiable to grant immunity in respect of a broadcast which covers only part of a debate. The Minister, seeking to rely on privilege in this respect said that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> under a special act, enjoyed immunity; but <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports coverthe whole of the proceedings in the Parliament. Therefore, the immunity enjoyed by <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is fair; it cannot be comparedwith the immunity to be provided in respect of the broadcast of only portion of the proceedings,which might contain libelous statements to which replies made in the Parliament are not broadcast also. This matter involves more than the point as to whether proceedings in the Parliament should bebroadcast for the benefit of the people generally, or whether the whole, or onlypast, of the proceedings should be broadcast. Underthis provision the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to be given the privilege  of  broadcasting only a portion of proceedings which might be libelous. That is a privilege that  is  not enjoyed by the press. Any newspaper which published only portion of proceedings which contained libelous statements and failed to publish the whole of the proceedings, would lay itself open to action for damages for libel. This provision is fundamental to the whole proposal. As the amendment seeks to rectify the position I have indicated, I support it. </para>

Earlier in the debate be said that the Broadcasting Committee had never agreed that all of the proceedings in Parliament should he broadcast; and in support of that statement he quoted extensively from. the committee's report. However, the Minister cannot have studied the committee's recommendations thoroughly because in paragraph 53 of its report it states -   . . but wo are of the opinion that in Australia complete broadcasts- of the actual proceedings should be tried at the outset, leaving the question of modification for consideration in the light of experience. </para>

                            <para>- I .appreciate the. difficulty, because of shortage of material, in the way of broadcasting' the whole of the proceedings in. each ' chamber. However, the Government should' implement the. recommendation of theBroadcasting Committee that proceedings should be broadcast exactly asthey 'occur- in the normal transaction of parliamentary business, that is, proceedings in each chamber should bebroadcast from start to finish. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> cited the evidence which I gave before the Broadcasting Com:mittee. I do not retract that evidence. I said that there are. two Houses of theParliam'ent, and consideration should- be given to broadcasting proceedings in both Houses. I suggested that in' order to facilitate this course being followed, more legislation should be initiated in the Senate, thus giving that chamber legisla- tion to deal with before it became stalebecause it had been debated in this chamber: I also said that means might be found to alternate the introduction of legislation between the Senate and the House of Representatives. </para>

                            <para>- Yes;. and I take it that the honorable member agrees that proceedings in each. House should be'-, broadcast alternately? If that is his view, he should be careful not to vote for the amendment, because it proposes that the. whole of the proceedings) not the proceedings on any one day; in the Senate and the House of Representatives should be broadcast. The only way to broadcast the whole of the proceedings in each, chamber is to commence broadcasting from the moment the session opens to the closing minute of the session. Therefore, the amendment which proposes that the whole of the proceedings in the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be broadcast means that the  whole of the proceedings in both Houseswould have to be broadcast simultaneously, that is, from the moment each House met until it adjourned. The. committee did not. make that recommendation. Some comment has been passed, about the expenditure to date upon the  arrangements for- broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament ;; but; I invitehonorable' members to heed the observations of: the committee about the- technical.  difficulties which the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> has apparently overlooked. </para>

I should like to see whether those members of the committee who signed the report will now support the amendment which is entirely opposed not only to the reasoning in the document but also to the recommendations. If we adopt the amendment of the Leader of the Australian Country party we shall be. obliged to broadcast the whole of the proceedings of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. I could understand the reasoning of the right honorable gentleman if he contended that the broadcasting of a debate, once commenced, should be continued until its conclusion, but the amendment provides, as I stated, for the broadcast of the whole of the proceedings of both chambers. That proposal is opposed entirely to the recommendations of the committee. If we adopt the proposed amendment the whole of the system of broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament as now proposed will be abandoned, and the suggestion of the Leader of the Australian Country party will be substituted for it. That will involve an expenditure of  £500,000 and will cause an unspecified number of commercial broadcasting stations to cease to function. </para>

That point is clear, and the attitude of honorable members on this side of the chamber cannot be misunderstood.

The Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> and the report have made it clear that, at this juncture, the whole of the debates of both chambers cannot be broadcast simultaneously. </para>

                            <para>- Even the honorable member for Dalley has misread the report. For the expenditure of £500,000 we should have a complete cover of the whole of Australia on one channel. The cost of a complete cover on two channels would be nearly £1,000,000. Therefore, the Parliament is really driven to decide whether we shall concur in the' broadcasting of a part of the parliamentary proceedings. The test there  is not whether we desire the whole or a part of the debates to be broadcast, but whether we want to achieve for the people of Australia by a partial broadcast a fair presentation of the debates. Throughout the history of the institution of Parliament meticulous attention has been given to ensure that, once individuals have been elected to the Parliament and have assembled, each shall have an equal and unrestricted opportunity to express himself on every issue that arises. Now, the purpose of this bill is to embrace within the audience practically the whole population of Australia. If it is proper to provide this privilege for every honorable member within the Parliament, the same principle must apply when the representatives of . the people address themselves to the wider audience. Every honorable member can recall occasions when a certain impression would have been left with listeners if a debate had ceased at a particular point;  but the  continuance of the debate, and replies  to  the earlier remarks completely changed the impression that had been created. All honorable members have heard persons in the Parliament and outside  it  maligned and traduced, and quite frequently we have heard their names cleared by subsequent speeches. That is  the  picture of the Parliament functioning freely, as it is intended to do. If this clause be agreed to in its present form, these deliberations will be extended to an audience consisting of practically the whole nation, but the broadcasts will cease at &gt;a certain stage  of the debate. Every one of us knows that if that occurs there will very frequently be left an impression in the minds of the listening audience which would have been changed had they had an opportunity to hear the subsequent portion of the debate. We all know that only too frequently the reputations of persons are besmirched in this Parliament, but that the imputations against them are withdrawn by subsequent explanations. If such explanations do not reach the audience which listened to the early part of the debate a grave injustice is done. Surely none of us is prepared to support that state of affairs.  Whilst  I proclaim myself openly in favour of the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings, if I am confronted with the" choice as to whether I approve of this partial broadcast with the results I have just pictured, or, alternatively, of having no broadcast at all, I have no hesitation in saying that I distinctly favour the latter. Again, if I were asked to make a choice as to whether I would have no broadcast at all, or broadcasts of the proceedings of only one house of the Parliament, I should unhesitatingly choose the former. I remind honorable members opposite that not long ago the Senate comprised 33 supporters of the then anti-Labour government and three representatives of the Labour Opposition. Suppose we have a repetition of that state of affairs and the debates on a certain issue are to be broadcast only from the Senate. . Would honorable members opposite then feel the same about it? Would they agree to permit a state of affairs to continue in which 33 members were permitted to put the case for one side and only three to put the case for the other? It therefore becomes obvious that in order fairly to convey the deliberations of this Parliament to -the listening public of Australia it is necessary to broadcast fully the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament. But this is both financially and physically impracticable at the present time. The proposal now before us is immature; it has been brought before us at a time when the Government can not afford to do the fair thing financially nor is the country able to do it physically. I wish to make it quite clear that if the amendment moved by- my leader be carried I am under no illusion that that would result in both Houses of the Parliament being broadcast simultaneously. I know only too well that, for the time being, there would be no broadcasts at all. I want to be perfectly straight-forward in this matter. If I am confronted with thechoice between no broadcasts and a distorted broadcast - because a partial broadcast could be nothing but a distorted broadcast - then I am against broadcasting altogether, and I support the amendment moved by my leader. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> put the case admirably when he stated that the matter boiled down to a question whether there should be a partial broadcast, with all its imperfections, ineffectiveness and consequent waste of money, or a full broadoast of the proceedings of both Houses when money and facilities are available. That is exactly what I had in mind. The present is not an opportune time to incur the enormous expenditure that would be necessary for a completely effective broadcast of the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament. On the other hand, I am firmly of the opinion that money should not be extracted from the public purse for what must obviously be merely a partial broadcast, with all its imperfections and mechanical disabilities. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> went from the sublime to the ridiculous when -he drew attention to the fact that the Broadcasting </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Committee stated that the ideal arrange- . ment would be the. provision of a network of 22 additional national medium-wave stations capable of serving nearly all populated portions of Australia, the equipment for which alone would entail expenditure of somewhere in the neighbourhood of £500,000. That envisages the most complete and perfect system of full broadcasting of the parliamentary debates of which Australia is capable. The Broadcasting Committee did not contemplate such a grandiose scheme in the initial stages of parliamentary broadcasting. Such a proposal envisages serving the whole population of Australia. The proposal now before us does not go nearly as far as that. I have already pointed out that there are many people in remote' parts of Australia, including those in the electorates of Kennedy and Wilmot, who will never have an opportunity to listen to the partial broadcasts proposed by 'the Government. And even the broadcasting of the proceedings of both Houses fully would not, in the initial stages, necessitate the utilization of the 22 additional stations. These were envisaged by the Broadcasting Committee as necessary only to ensure a complete and perfect system. </para>

The honorable gentleman has also pointed out that the Broadcasting Committee recommended, further, that the facilities should not be used for any other purposes when Parliament is in recess. </para>

Representatives of this chamber and of the Senate would have to be brought to,gether to arrange the important detail as to when the proceedings of the House of Representatives shall be broadcast and when those of the Senate shall be broadcast. The Government suggests that the committee will also arrange all the other details. I hope that honorable members will know precisely the proposal for which they are voting. The Leader of the Australian Country party . <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> has made his position demonstrably clear. If the whole of the proceedings of both Houses are not to be broadcast simultaneously, he -wants no broadcast at all. The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> does not want any broadcast. He said that the money proposed to be expended on such broadcasts should be applied to the erection of more national regional stations throughout Australia, and that the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast when the whole of the programme of the Postmaster-General's Department has been completed. That was merely an attempt to sabotage the bill, just as the right honorable gentleman sabotaged the Commonwealth Bank years ago. I do notthink that the Government would accept such a proposal. </para>

He has side-stepped that issue until now. I have asked the Government to declare its intention, but it  is  not prepared to do that. I have asked the Minister many times to declare exactly -what the Government proposes under this legislation. I have sought from him the assurance that, a debate having been commenced in this chamber or in the Senate, it will be kept on the air until it has been concluded. The Minister will not intimate that he proposes to do that. </para>

                            <para>- What has been put by the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> can be answered very simply. If the Government proposes to broadcast the whole of a debate, arrangements to that end can be made. If it were decided that the debate on an amendment which was likely to last for some time should not be broadcast, . the Australian 'Broadcasting Commission could easily carry on with alternative programmes in the meantime. If the Government had made' up its mind to broadcast the whole of a debate from the beginning to the end of a bill, so that everybody would have an equal right to participate in the broadcast, and to treat the Senate similarly on a future occasion, I should be in favour of the bill. That is the recommendation of the Broadcasting Committee, of which I am a member. But if the Government will not give that assurance, then I take my stand with the Leader of the Australian Country party. If the Minister desires to secure my vote, let him give me an unqualified undertaking that he will do what the Broadcasting Committee has recommended - that no provision will be made" for any pre-arrangement of speakers for any time, and that there will be a " straight " broadcast of the proceedings exactly as they occur in the normal transaction of parliamentary business. If he will not do that, I shall have no faith in the bill and shall support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has been a member of this Parliament long enough to know that it would be impossible for the Minister to give the assurance that he seeks. The honorable gentleman has said that unless the Minister assures him that a debate having been started in this chamber it will be continued to its conclusion, he cannot support the bill. The honorable gentleman has had long parliamentary experience, *and knows that no committee could forecast when a debate will conclude in this chamber and be commenced in the Senate. Frequently, a second-reading debate appears likely to finish before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, but a new line of -argument arouses other thoughts, with the result that the debate is continued and at the end of the day has to be adjourned until the following sitting. In order to give the assurance desired by the honorable gentleman, the whole of the proceedings would have to be conducted to a timetable. </para>

                            <para>- I tell the honorable member, as I told the Broadcasting Committee, that the order in which speakers are called rests with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> not with any party or a committee of any party. If it were sought to give to the proposed committee the right to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> that he should call upon a certain number of speakers from each side, the Standing Orders would have to be altered very considerably. The question of the choice of speakers does not arise. The bill provides for the closest possible approach to the report which the honorable member has signed, and in order to induce him to vote for the measure I wish to convince him of the absolute impossibility of the Minister giving such an undertaking as that asked for by the honorable member. The duties of the committee will have to be most elastic. It must be capable of being easily called together in order to fix a programme of broadcasts in both branches of the legislature, perhaps from hour to hour. To attempt to forecast at present exactly what would happen would resemble optimism on the jazz. </para>

                        <para>.- Surely the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> has raised unnecessary difficulties. He has omitted to mention that there will be a compere watching the proceedings and that he will take his cue from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> The public can follow the debates in the newspapers, and . surely they will be able to follow them as the result of the broadcasts. The honorable member for Dalley spoke of the expenditure of  £500,000  being necessary for a complete broadcasting service for Australia in respect of parliamentary proceedings, but we have witnessed the expenditure of much larger sums for purposes of less value to the people. I suggest that we should consent to a complete broadcast of our proceedings with such facilities as are available. We cannot force the people to listen to the proposed broadcasts. Many do not wish to hear them, but those who desire to follow the debates intelligently, and do not get all the information they want from the newspapers, should be able to hear the debates broadcast over the various networks. One can well imagine the unseemly jostling that would occur around the forest of microphones, under the proposal contemplated in the bill. If the proposed committee were abolished the scheme could be approved unanimously. </para>

                        <para>.- The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> sought to give us the benefit of his advice, as presiding officer in this chamber, as to how the system would function. If I had need of further argument to convince me that I should oppose the partial broadcasting of the debates, his speech provided it. He pictured a committee which would not be bound by regular hours of broadcasting, or any predetermined schedule, but which would decide from time to time when the debates were to be broadcast and for what period. It is quite impossible to decide such matters as that without bearing in mind whose speeches are to be broadcast. The parliamentary system which we all claim to cherish has its whole virtue in the completely unfettered freedom of every honorable member to speak, bound only by the Standing Orders, as and when he thinks fit. He should be able to avail himself of the forms of the House and formally move the adjournment of the House in order to direct attention to urgent matters of public importance. I submit to those honorable- members who claim to be guardians of our system of parliamentary government that under this bill an important step is proposed in the direction of destroying that system. It will inevitably lead, if not to regimentation in the chamber - and the honorable member for Dalley has told us that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will have a free choice in saying who shall speak - regimentation of honorable members in their party rooms. </para>

                            <para>- No. Take a broadcast in which a Minister had stated a case for the Government and the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Australian Country party had secured the adjournment of the debate till the next day. Then,  a3  a result' of some act of governmental "administration, a private member desired to avail himself qf the forms of the House in order to direct the beam of publicity on some act of policy, which is an . inherent right of honorable members under our parliamentary system. Unless that privilege  i3  to be preserved we may as well have a general election to decide who is to govern the country and then let the government continue without an opposition until the next election. -In the circumstances of which I speak, imagine the pressure that would be put on a private member who desired, perhaps, to move the adjournment of the House.. Every honorable member knows that if this, system were introduced it would lead to pressure being imposed on private members in party rooms to limit their freedom <inline font-style="italic">Pf</inline> action in the chamber. That, .would he* a most deplorable attack on the principal virtues of the parliamentary system. </para>

If the purpose is. to prevent the Government from participating fairly in the broadcasts, the amendment certainly achieves it. It would effectively counter and frustrate the decision 'of the people at the last elections, and the Government cannot agree to that.

Honorable members opposite seem to have something weighing heavily on their minds. They would not divide the committee on the question of broadcasting both Houses of Parliament simultaneously, although I had hoped they would, because I was curious to see how many of them would support the proposal. The present amendment, if accepted, would destroy the whole purpose of the bill, and would prevent two-thirds of the members of this Parliament from being heard over the air. We are not going to help the Opposition to destroy our bill, nor to achieve anything so undemocratic as is proposed in the amendment. The amendment was not circulated before the committee met. It was an afterthought, and the Government cannot accept it. </para>

                        <para>.- The committee has before it an ill-conceived and illdigested measure. We have been told that the bill is based on the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee, but none of the Government members on that committeehas anything to say about it. It appears that the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> who is in charge of the bill, has not even read the report of the committee. Nevertheless, we arc asked to accept his sayso, and he and the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear),</inline> are the only two on the Government side who have given any explanation of the bill at all. I suggest to the Minister that he should report progress now, and consult caucus about the bill to-morrow. He should say, "Look, boys, I forgot to tell you about this committee that it is proposed to appoint". But for this obnoxious provision the Government might well have had the bill before this. </para>

                        <para>.- I have taken part in this debate only because, for the time being, I, as  Speaker  of the House, am the custodian of the rights of honorable members, and am charged with the duty of administering the Standing Orders. I pointed out that the things which honorable members opposite seem to fear will not take place because the Standing Orders will prevent it. Because I said this, the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> said that my speech convinced him that the bill was designed asan attack upon the privileges of honorable members. Although the honorable member for Indi and his leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> sleep in the same bed, they do not dream the same dreams. The honorable member for Indi is concerned about the rights of private members. He expressed the fear that the tendency would be for parties to select speakers to state their case while Parliament was on the air; that pressure would be brought to bear on other members not to speak during those times. The honorable member for Indi was afraid for democracy and demanded that every member of every party should have equal right to be heard, but now his leader moves an amendment, the purpose of which is the exclusion from the air of one-half of the Government supporters. </para>

                            <para>- First, it was claimed that if the broadcast of a debate was started, it should be continued till it finished.I know of no standing order or provision of this measure that says that when the Opposition side runs out of speakers the Government's side shall not be allowed further speakers. At the last general elections 26 members were returned on the Opposition side ; 49 were elected to this side. Now the Australian Country party says that, once the broadcast of a debate starts, that debate must be broadcast through to the end. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Indi talked about the rights of individual members. Everything in the bill is viewed with suspicion. Members are to be gagged. They are to have pressure placed on them. Therefore he fears this bill. Yet his own leader has moved, not that members be gagged by their own leaders, but that, when the Opposition side runs out of steam, we must also run out of steam. I do not call that democracy. </para>

                        <para>.- When I first looked at this amendment,. I agreed with the Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> and the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear).</inline> If this measure provided for the full-time broadcasting of the proceedings of this Parliament the honorable gentlemen would be correct. But their contentions now distort the facts, because the broadcast is to be only a partial broadcast of four hours a day, and it is impossible for 75 men to speak in that time. </para>

                        indicates that his party, is working on the assumption that the proceedings' of the Parliament will be broadcast for only about four hours or some other limited time each day. There is no justification for that assumption. It will be possible for the proposed committee to decide that the proceedings of the House of Representatives should be broadcast for a whole day or two days. The Senate does not sit so frequently as does the House of Representatives. The proceedings in the House of Representatives must be broadcast all the time the Senate is not sitting. The Australian Country party's proposal is that the proceedings shall be broadcast for a certain length of time, and that thereafter the Labour party speakers shall go off the air. That is absurd. First, the Australian Country party argued for a complete broadcast of both Houses. The amendment means that the Australian Country party does not want all the proceedings of the House of Representatives broadcast during, say, a week when the Senate is not sitting. They say now " Oh, well, we have changed our minds. Although we can have the House of Representatives on the air all the time it is sitting and the Senate is not sitting, we do not want it, and the Government supporters can have only a portion of the time ".

                            <para>- That will be a matter to be decided by the joint committee. I do not know who the members of that committee will be. It may not convince the Parliament of its views ; but if the members of it act as reasonably as members of the Broadcasting Committee have acted in this matter, it should be able to bring in unanimous reports. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the  President  will be members of the joint committee, and the Leaders of the Opposition parties in each chamber, or their deputies, will also be members of it. I ask honorable members to facilitate the establishment of the joint committee and thus enable it to get to work. It will be time enough, when that committee presents its report, to raise the matters of the kind now raised by honorable members opposite. The right honorable member for Darling Downs said that the Government was putting up " Aunt Sallies " ; but that is exactly what he is doing.  His  proposal lacks' merit. This is the first time in the history of the Parliament that government supporters have been asked to stultify themselves in order to suit the whims of members of the Opposition when they could not carry a proposition which, because of its impracticability and the fact that it involved excessive cost, was rejected by the Broadcasting Committee on which the 'Opposition parties have four representatives out of a total personnel of nine members. </para>

                        <para>.- The remarks just made by the Minister for Immigration. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> convince me that he does not understand the measure. He said that-he does not know what proposals will be put before the joint committee. The Broadcasting Committee recommended that full debates should be broadcast. That proposal has been rejected by the Minister in favour of broadcasts of only portion of the proceedings. That being so, the right honorable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> has moved an amendment with the object of dividing the time allotted to these partial broadcasts equally between Government supporters and Opposition members. That is the amendment in a nutshell, and any one who believes in- fair play should support it. The Minister has said that he does not know how much time will be allotted to the broadcasts. That' is another reason why the amendment should be carried. If the broadcasts are to last for, say five or ten hours the time should be divided equally between Government supporters and members of the Opposition parties ; but, in the case of full-time broadcasts, honorable members should be given such time as they consider necessary to enable them to deal fully with the particular subject under consideration. The Government has refused our requests for full-time -broadcasts and proposes to have partial broadcasts; but the Minister cannot tell (us what the duration of those broadcasts will be. In these circumstances, it is the duty of all honorable members to urge the Government to be fair by dividing the time equally between Government supporters and members of the Opposition parties. </para>

                        <para>. I have an open mind on this matter. I have listened with interest to the remarks of all honorable members who have spoken upon it, but I wish the Minister to clarify one point. It has been stated by some honorable members opposite that the normal procedure will be followed during the period of broadcasting. The normal procedure as I have observed it since I have been a member of this chamber is that, when a bill is before the chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "Speaker</inline> calls upon honorable members alternately from the Government side and the Opposition side, and the debate proceeds until the Minister in charge of the measure sums up after the last  speaker  has addressed the House. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> has implied that that procedure  will not be followed in respect of debates being broadcast, .but that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> will continue to call speakers from the Government side. </para>

                        <para>. - The issue is simple. The Leader of the Australian Country ' party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> contended that if any attempt is to be made to broadcast the debates the whole of the proceedings of the Senate and the House of Representatives should be put on the air. .We recognize that if the Government has 50 members and the Opposition has 25 members, the Government should derive the full advantage of its numbers. We have never attempted to. resist that. We have always been in favour of it. However, the committee rejected that proposal and decided that  the proceedings of the Parliament shall he broadcast for only a limited period and on selected occasions. In the circumstances of this extraordinary and novel decision, the Leader of the Australian Country party contended that we should insert in this legislation a provision to ensure that the Government and Opposition shall share equally the period allotted for broadcasting in order to present their views. That is all. As soon as the Leader of the Australian Country party moved his amendment, the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> interjected that the proposal would destroy the whole purpose of the bill. </para>

                            <para>- The whole purpose of the bill, as envisaged by the Labour caucus. The Minister spoke of the meetings of the committee to decide the. period of broadcasting. In his innocence, he does not know what the period will be. It has never crossed his mind. He does not know who will be appointed to the committee, but he knows that its decisions will be fair to the Government and Opposition. I do not believe it. I am quite sure that when the Labour caucus decided that the Government should introduce this bill; it had before it a clear picture of the political effect on the Labour party. Having regard to its political background, I am not so innocent as to believe that the Labour party, would agree to. the introduction of this kind of legislation without having examined minutely the- possible political repercussions. With that thought in my mind, I join with my leader in attempting to insert in the bill a precaution to ensure that both sides shall have equal access to the air. When a division is taken, we shall see who are prepared to cast a vote to- ensure, as the rejection of the amendment will ensure, that the Government shall have a partial monopoly of the air to- broadcast its political propaganda". We seek no advantage. ' We ask merely for an equal opportunity to state our case. </para>

                        <para>.I am surprised at the attitude which the Opposition is adopting. The clause is clear. It provides that the proceedings of the Parliament shall be broadcast. All honorable members know that under the existing system of broadcasting in Australia, the whole of the proceedings of both chambers cannot be broadcast simultaneously. This bill provides that as much of the proceedings of both chambers shall be broadcast as is possible wilh the existing equipment. The suggestion of the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> is so much eye-wash. The right honorable gentleman began by raising all sorts of objections to the bill. He then read evidence which he had given to the Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee. It contradicted the speech that he was then making. He turned somersaults, and attempted with one amendment to provide that the whole of the proceedings of both chambers shall be broadcast simultaneously. .Of course, he is aware that at present it is impossible to carry out such a proposal. When that amendment was defeated, as he knew it would be, he submitted the proposal now under consideration. He is attempting to show that the Government is trying to " put over " some trick to gag the Opposition in debates. If the proceedings of this chamber are broadcast for four hours, six hours or twelve hours in any one day and the rules of debate are observed as they have been in the past, the Opposition will always have its opportunity to be heard. Since I have been a member of this Parliament, I have listened to considerably more speeches from members of the Opposition than from honorable members on this side of the chamber. </para>

                    <para>In my opinion, the object of the Leader of the Australian Country party is not to improve the bill in any way but to obstruct its passage, and attempt, as far as he can, to make it unworkable. The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> reveals a similar attitude. Earlier, he was whole-heartedly in favour of the broadcasting of parliamentary debates, and signed a recommendation to that effect. Since coming into this chamber this evening, he has changed his mind about eight times, and has reached the stage when he does not know whether he is standing -or sitting. He is so muddle-headed about the whole matter that he has forgotten what the purport of the bill is. </para>

Other clauses provide the method whereby those broadcasts, shall take place. There are no tricks in the bill. We have not put up any "Aunt Sallies."

                            <para>- The honorable member is not capable of reasoning. This amendment will test the sincerity of the Government. The Minister can accept it without loss of prestige, although he stated that it would destroy the purpose of the bill. I was prepared to accept this as a half-baked but reasonably fair bill to bring the Parliament closer to the people. To the Minister for Information, who claims that the proposed amendment will destroy the purpose of the bill, I can only say that if that be so its purpose is one of illintent. Let us put the amendment to a vote and thus provide an opportunity to test the sincerity of honorable members opposite. </para>

                            <para>- It is obvious that honorable members opposite are suffering from a bad attack of pre-election jitters. The Broadcasting Committee as a whole approved of certain recommendations upon which this bill is based. But since the bill has been before us it, has become increasingly obvious that the whips have been cracked over the heads of those honorable members opposite who put their signature to the Broadcasting Committee's report. Can there be any other explanation of their hostility to the bill? It is admitted on all sides that a full and complete broadcast of the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament is impossible at the present time. Therefore the object of the amendment can be no other than to destroy the bill. </para>

                            <para>- At the last election the people of Australia were asked to decide to what party they should entrust the reins of Government, and by their votes they returned to this Parliament twice as many representatives of the Labour party as of the parties in Opposition. Honorable members opposite, how mentary debates will not alter the procedure normally adopted by the Chair ever, have the audacity to claim that despite their numerical inferiority speakers for the anti-Labour parties should be allotted broadcast time equal to that allotted to members who sit on this side of the chamber. I pointed out that the broadcasting of the Parliament in calling members alternately from the Government and Opposition sides as far as it is practicable to do so. It does not always happen, however, that members of the three parties represented in this chamber are alternately called. I recollect that during a recent debate in this chamber the honorable members for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann),</inline> Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> and Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) successively received the call from the Chair. I have invariably found that more speakers rise from the Opposition than from the Government side: I fail to see any merit in the amendment, and I shall vote against it. </para>

                        <para>.It is well to realize that there is a certain significance in this proposal. The bill  33  it now stands provides for equal representation of both Houses of the Parliament on the committee that is to be appointed to consider and report upon certain matters. Under the British bicameral system of government, the fundamental principle has been accepted that there shall be no subordination of one branch of the legislature to the other. I am sure that none of the existing procedural processes of the Commonwealth Parliament would enable one chamber to exercise authority over the other. I understand the purpose of the amendment to be to restore -the constitution of the committee to that which was provided for in the bill when it was introduced in the Senate. The Senate, taking the attitude that it should not in any circumstances be subordinated to the House of Representatives by having a minority representation on a joint parliamentary committee, insisted Upon having equal representation. I am prepared to uphold the important principle of equality of the two Houses in our parliamentary system. The Government should not submit an amendment designed to give to the House of Representatives majority representation on a joint parliamentary committee, the purpose of' which is to  exercise authority in respect of a matter affecting the, two Houses, It is taking a serious and an unprecedented step in pursuing such a course.  </para>

                        <para>. - I accept my share of the responsibility for the proposal to ask the Senate to amend its decision in regard to the composition of the proposed committee. I do not accept the view put forward by the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> McEwen) that equality of representation of the two Houses on parliamentary committees has always been an accepted principle. Let us consider the composition of the joint committees appointed by the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Broadcasting Committee, upon' whose report largely this legislation was based, is composed of three senators and six members of the House of Representatives.  A  motion proposing that  representation was passed by both Houses without protest in either. . The Public Works Committee consists of three members of the Senate and six members of the House of Representatives. I have not heard of any protest having been made by the Senate in regard to its representation on that very important body. </para>

                            <para>- I am not questioning that. The Public Works Committee examines works projects of the Commonwealth Government, and makes recommendations to both Houses of the Parliament in relation thereto. The Social Security Committee, upon whose recommendations most, of the social services legislation of this Government and the last Administration was based, consists of three members of the Senate and four members of the House of Representatives. The War Expenditure Committee has on it two  members  of the Senate and .five members of the House of Representatives. Those are the only Parliamentary committees that are now in existence. They have made importantrecommendations to different governments, and I' have not heard of any protest regarding inequality of representation. Equality of representation of the two chambers has never been an accepted principle. I stated in evidence to the Broadcasting Committee that it would have to make up its mind as to whether the broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings were to be regarded as having entertainment or educational value. The number of members of the House of Representatives is more than double the number of senators, consequently, this chamber ought to have greater representation on committees than has the other chamber. Those who sincerely believe that the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast must admit, that the broadcasts should be made of the proceedings of that House which will most appeal to listeners. In making that statement, I am not saying anything derogatory of the Senate. The interest displayed by visitors and residents of Canberra is a true criterion of the appeal that is made. Whenever there is an important debate in the House of Representatives, its galleries are filled to overflowing, whereas the galleries "reserved for strangers in, the Senate chamber are invariably empty-. That is generally the position. Politically minded people who will listen to parliamentary proceedings will be guided by the interest taken in the respective Houses in the past, and I consider that this chamber is entitled to the representation sought. I object to the argument advanced by the honorable member for Indi as to the right of the two branches of the legislature to equality of representation. In the selection of members of important parliamentary committees the two Houses have never had equality of representation.  </para>

                        <para>.We do not frequently hear the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> and we are reminded that he is no mean antagonist in debate. I recall that, when the Labour party was in opposition, he showed much skill in debate, and he has now demonstrated that he has not lost the art and some of the artifices of debate. One of the oldest tricks which he has presented is that of replying to a point which his opponent has not made. I claim that there is no precedent for any machinery, committee, or regulation enabling one branch of the legislature to exercise authority over the other on procedural matters. The honorable member for Dalley has shrewdly pointed out that the House of Representatives has a majority of members on the Social Ser-' vices Committee, the Public Works Committee, and t.he War Expenditure Committee, but those committees have nothing to do with the procedural conduct of debates in this Parliament. Had I not replied to the honorable member he might have "got away with" a shrewd trick; but it is not difficult to expose the fallacy, of his argument. He cannot challenge my contention that there is nothing in our parliamentary practice which enables one House to exercise authority over the other in- the procedural conduct of its affairs. .

It is abundantly clear that the purpose is to reduce the Senate to a subordinate position in the eyes of the people of Australia, thus getting nearer to realization of the policy indicated by the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> yesterday, who interjected that the Senate should be abolished. One step nearerhome ! But the honorable member lacked the courage to come out with a forthright policy. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> has admitted that he knows of no committee of this Parliament that has equal representation of the two chambers. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and each of the leaders of the three political parties in this cham- ber will no doubt be members of the proposed committee, there will probably be at least four members of this chamber on it. Surely the honorable member for Indi does not suggest that the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> or the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> should be left off the committee. He wishes to depart from the recognized practice, which is founded on the fact that the House of Representatives, having more than twice as many members as the Senate, should have greater representation than the other chamber on all committees. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not like the proposal to delegate the powers of the committee to a sub-committee consisting of two senators and two members of the House of Representatives. This seems to me to be a hole-and-corner way of doing things. We have restored the provision that the committee shall consist of nine members, and the present proposal seems to be. an attempt to go back to the principle of equal representation of both Houses as provided in the Senate's amendment. The clause provides that the committee "may" delegate power to a subcommittee, but we know that the "may" will become " shall " at the wish of the Government majority on the committee. It will be most unfair if a sub-committee consisting of four is authorized to make decisions which will, in effect, be regarded as the decisions of the whole committee. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The purpose of that is to allow the committee to function when the Senate is not sitting. Therefore, two honorable members representing the House of Representatives may form a quorum of the subcommittee of four. That does not say that the sub-committee shall be the same members always. The whole committee may refer to representatives of the House of Representatives the matter of determining day3 on which and times at which the proceedings of the House of .Representatives shall be broadcast, when the Senate is not sitting, and it is provided that two of the five persons from the House of Representatives shall form a quorum. The whole thing is obvious and is quite workable. I assure honorable members that the plan will not fall down because of the provision in the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - The amendment falls into two parts, and I should like to vote' on them separately. Sub- clause 1 is, I think, a proper protection to give to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, assuming that we accept the principle of giving privilege to partial broadcasts. I have said what I wanted to say on that subject. If that principle is accepted, the amendment seems to be reasonable. But the second part of  the  amendment, which is designed to alter the privilege of members of Parliament in relation to debate, is not one that can command my support. I should perhaps add a word to what has been said on this question of privilege, which is very important. There has been some confusion about it in the .course of the consideration of this bill. The problem is not one of the privilege of the member of Parliament. As I pointed out in my second-reading speech, the privilege of the Parliament rests on an entirely different basis, one that this bill does not touch. Whether an honorable member, is reported in a newspaper or in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> or is broadcast, it is still true that what he says in the chamber cannot be made the subject-matter, or cause of action against him. So the privilege of a member of Parliament we can set on one side. It is not touched. All that the bill proposes to do under clause 14 is to give a new privilege to a new publishing medium, the broadcasting medium. I pointed out before that th basic distinction is a distinction between, on the one hand, the qualified privilege that we give to the newspaper, a privilege attaching to only a fair and accurate report, which, in the case of attack and counter-attack, must be balanced if it is to enjoy that protection, and, on the other hand, the absolute privilege now proposed to be conferred upon the partial broadcast of parliamentary debates. I take the greatest exception to conferring the latter form of privilege. This does not concern members, except insofar as the creation of this privilege may actually damage a- member. It may have the result of conferring on the Australian Broadcasting .Commission privilege for the transmission to the public of a defamatory statement which, in other circumstances, would enjoy no privilege at all. </para>

                            <para>- I was coming , to that." I am taking the matter in two steps. This requires a great deal of thought. "We are creating this new absolute privilege for the broadcasting of only a portion of a debate. The Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> has foreshadowed an amendment to insert the word " re-broadcasting " in clause 14 after the word "broadcasting". So absolute privilege will attach not only to the original broadcast but to a re-broadcast of a portion of a debate, and the re-broadcast, of course, need not be a reproduction of all the matter in the original broadcast. It may be a re-broadcast of one speech or a fraction of a speech, and we are attaching abso-lute  privilege to that. That seems to me most unsound. The only protection would be that conferred in ' the foreshadowed new clause - 13a. - (1.) The committee shall have power to determine the conditions in accordance with which a re-broadcast may be made of any portion of the proceedings of .either House of the Parliament. (2.) No re-broadcast shall be made of any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament otherwise than in accordance with the conditions so determined. </para>

                    <para class="block">All that means is that we are putting into the hands of a committee the right to say under what circumstances a fragment of a debate broadcast to-morrow may be re-broadcast perhaps six months hence. I put it to this committee that there is no' occasion whatever for rebroadcasts except for the purpose of alinement of times on the interstate service. If the purpose is to provide, for example, that Western Australians shall be able to listen to the debates at a reasonable hour as if the State were an eastern State, that would be appropriate, but, apart from the need to meet the convenience of listeners in that way, I see no reason why anybody should be given permission to take a part of a partial broadcast and re-broadcast it. But whether that is done in whole or in part to-day or six months hence, it will  still  enjoy absolute privilege. I say, with great respect to everything that has been said, that that is something about which every honorable gentleman should think. It is not for ' the Parliament to  whittle away the privileges of ' the Parliament, but it is for the Parliament to protect its rights, and one of those rights is that its members shall be reported, if reported at all, fairly and accurately. It is no answer to say that some newspapers do not do that. Of course they do not. It is no answer to that to say that the qualified privilege enjoyed by newspaper reporters has been abused; of course, it has. But privilege is well defined in point of law, and they lose their privilege unless they exercise it according to the law. And that exists for our protection and the protection of the Parliament just as much as for the protection of the public. What we- are doing here is abandoning that protection by saying, in a rather light-hearted way I am afraid, that there will be absolute protection for the original broadcast, or for any  re-broadcasts,  of whatever section of the parliamentary debate is broadcast, or any fragment of it that may then be selected and approved. For that reason whilst I would support the first portion of the amendment as a second line of defence, my first protection is that clause 14 itself should be omitted, or, at the very least, that the privilege created by' it should be confined to the broadcasting of Parliament and should not extend to any re-broadcast other than that broadcast within a few hours for the purpose of synchronizing interstate services. </para>

                            <para>- Subellause 1 of the amendment proposes that no action or proceeding, civil or criminal, shall lie against the Australian Broadcasting Commission, its servants, agents and employees, for broadcasting or rebroadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. Clause  14  of the bill provides that no action, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament. Whilst the amendment seeks to provide that the privilege shall be enjoyed only by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, its servants, agents and employees, the clause itself gives a protection to any person who broadcasts the proceedings of the Parliament. An amendment which I propose to move later will extend the privilege to rebroadcasts of proceedings of the Parliament. It may be thought that at some time some commercial station should be allowed to broadcast a portion of the proceedings of the Parliament, for instance, a speech by the British Prime Minister during his visit to Australia. If the clause is limited to the employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission only, protection is not given to employees of any commercial station who may broadcast a portion of the proceedings of the Parliament. I desire to cover the whole position, and I suggest that honorable members agree to the clause which provides that any person employed in the work of broadcasting the proceedings of either House of the Parliament shall be protected. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister mentioned that the amendment would not extend protection to a  commercial  station which might broadcast, for in stance, a speech by the British Prime Minister in this building. The amendment is designed to place a responsibility upon the Australian Broadcasting Commission which is responsible to the Parliament by virtue of the .fact that it will originate the broadcasts. But if the provision is left in the broadest terms to cover any person, there will be nothing whatever to prevent a commercial station at some stage from extracting some portion of a speech and re-broadcasting it with complete immunity. We object to making the provision so wide. The point is that protection should be extended to a body which is responsible to the Parliament, but not to a commercial' broadcasting station that may broadcast some part of a speech made six months previously. </para>

                    <para class="block">This clause has given me a great deal of anxiety, particularly in relation tu the privileges of honorable members. I listened carefully <inline font-style="italic">to the speech</inline> made by the honorable member fo:- Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender).</inline> I heard his criticism and his alternative, and from my study of parliamentary privilege,. I should say that no proposition more damaging to parliamentary privilege has been made than that contained  in the amendment ' forecast and circulated by the honorable member when he spoke to the second reading. I note now that the honorable member has introduced another subclause into his proposition. I agree with everything that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said with regard to the danger of the. clause as it stands in the bill. The clause makes it possible for anybody, .not necessarily, perhaps, any bona fide commercial station, to tune in with a recording instrument to an " A " class station broadcast, if forewarned to do so by somebody who intended to make a dangerous, or malicious attack, and by mechanical means extract from that broadcast the more malicious part of it and rebroadcast it from any other station as often as he chose. He might even rebroadcast it between the time that Parliament was prorogued prior to an election and until polling day, and the person attacked would have no opportunity to defend himself on level terms. I have the greatest misgiving as to what could happen in cases of that description. As the Leader of the Opposition rightly pointed out, there is certain privilege in the publication of reports of Parliamen.ary proceedings; but when anything malicious is contained in the speech reported there is no privilege if the press, or pamphleteer, publishes the defamatory portion of the speech, or the whole- of it containing defamatory matter, and <inline font-style="italic">does</inline> not at the same time, publish the reply. No privilege at all applies' to such a publication. May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> cites many cases, particularly in Great Britain, of people having been mulct in heavy damages, notably newspaper proprietors and pamphleteers who used the method employed in those days ,to defame persons, namely by getting a member of Parliament to make a defamatory speech which they later published. No privilege attaches to that, but no limit is imposed upon the licence contained in the clause in its present form. An individual who is attacked has no means of protecting himself. Therefore, I viewed with grave misgivings the clause in its original form. I repeat that the purpose of the bill is to confer privilege upon the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its employees. It does not confer privilege upon members of Parliament, because that" is already provided. The proposal of- the honorable member for "Warringah is a strange mixture of ideas. First, he endeavours to introduce into the bill, which does not purport to deal with the privileges of members of Parliament, a matter entirely foreign to the intentions of the measure. He seeks to. overcome the danger which might result from broadcasting and re-broadcasting. Secondly, he introduces the matter of the individual privilege of members of Parliament. With me, this is not a personal matter, but if any honorable member has studied closely the subject of . parliamentary privilege, he will agree that this proposal makes one of the worst possible attacks on it. The Parliament itself decides a question of privilege if the occasion arises. Members of Parliament are privileged; but if, in the opinion -of the House, an individual member is guilty of a breach of those privileges, it may sit in judgment to determine, whether he has committed a breach of privilege, and, if so, the penalty for it. No one has ever recognized the authority of even the highest tribunal in the land outside of the Parliament to deal with the offending member. That right has always been jealously preserved by the Parliament. This Parliament has gone even further than that. On one occasion, it dealt with a member of the House for statements that he made outside the Parliament. Because it adjudged him guilty of a breach of privilege, it expelled him, and he never returned. </para>
                    <para>The second proposal of the honorable member for Warringah is inconsistent with the purposes of the clause, which confers privilege on the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its employees engaged in the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. The honorable member proposes to. abandon the privilege which the Parliament has always jealously guarded, namely, the right to deal with its own members for breaches of privilege. A perusal of the amendment will reveal that the intention is to make an honorable member liable to the jurisdiction of some authority outside the Parliament. The honorable member for Warringah would deprive honorable members of the privilege that they enjoy to-day, and allow some judicial authority to decide whether a breach of privilege had been committed. If that view were to prevail, the freedom of speech which honorable members now enjoy would be restricted by the fear that their statements in this chamber, which they thought were based upon excellentauthority and yet were untrue, would make them subject to the authority of a tribunal outside the Parliament. Their immunity from proceedings for statements made in this chamber would be removed. </para>
                    <para>Briefly, the proposal of the honorable member for Warringah, ' if adopted, will deprive the- Parliament of the right to determine privilege and exact a penalty for any breach. The honorable member is prepared to withdraw the amendment if a special committee - a "triumvirate - consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the Prime Minister and. the Leader of the </para>
                    <para class="block">Opposition, is constituted to determine what the House should determine, namely, whether an honorable member has committed a breach of privilege, and the penalty for it. In view of all the circumstances, I believe that that part of the amendment should not be tolerated for a moment. It represents the worst attack that I have ever known on the accepted principles of parliamentary privilege and the. manner of dealing with it. </para>

Earlier, I indicated that I could not support .sub-clause 2 of the amendment for reasons similar to those which have been stated, but I am in accord with the principle of sub-clause 1. In fact,. I prepared an amendment, suggesting that the words " any person " be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, " the Australian Broadcasting Commission or any employee thereof acting within the scope of his authority ". If the amendment is rejected, shall I then be in order in moving the amendment I have just indicated? </para>

                            <para>- That would be a comparatively modern period  of  time, having regard to the political ideology  of  the honorable gentleman from Warringah. At the commencement  of  every British Parliament since the reign  of  Henry VIII., it has been the custom for the  Speaker  to lay claim to the ancient and undoubted rights of th members  of  the House  of  Commons, particularly that their persons, estates and servants, may be free from arrests and all molestations, that they may enjoy liberty  of  speech in all their debates'; may have access to  His  Majesty's royal person whenever occasion' shall require; and that all their proceedings may receive from  His  Majesty the most favorable construction. I do not believe thai, forty-six years after the establishment of federation, this Parliament will agree to adopt the suggestion of the honorable member for Warringah, nor do I believe that such a proposition should be considered during the debate on a bill which establishes the right of Parliament to broadcast its proceedings and which vests in the  Postmaster-General  the authority to broadcast such proceedings. The Postmaster-General is not the proper authority to deal with the question of privilege. As a matter of fact the whole amendment might very well be ruled out of order. </para>

                    <para>Honorable members will find that clause 4 provides that the Australian Broadcasting Commission shall broadcast the proceedings of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It is the only body upon which a duty is imposed to broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament; certainly no right is conferred upon any other body to do so. That is why it is rather curious to find that, having provided in clause 4 that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to be the broadcaster of our debates, clause 14 then provides that no action shall lie against " any person " for broadcasting any portion of the proceedings. I believe that the giving of a privilege to a partial broadcast is wrong. I shall not labour that, as I have already stated my view; but if privilege is to attach it should attach only to the commission and its servants. It should not be given to people who are outside the commission. I see no reason why there should be re-broadcasts of portions of the debates in this House by commercial concerns. I do not understand that. If this bill is designed as a means of acquainting people- with what is being transacted in the Parliament, then the national broadcasting systemshould broadcast the debates to the people, and consequently my amendment is designed to confine the privilege to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the people who are carrying out the work for it. That, I believe, puts some limitation on the privilege conferred. It seems eminently reasonable and from my point of view it is the next best thing to having no privilege at all. I do not know whether it is contemplated seriously that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to make the broadcasts of Parliament available to commercial stations so that they may re-broadcast little bits of the debates as it suits them. I was under the impression that the idea was that we provide direct broadcasts of the debates in the Parliament. In fact I do nol know why the word- " broadcasting " does not cover the making of records and their replaying. The words " broadcast " and "re-broadcast " are not technical terms. We are using them in the loose sense; but there is little doubt that the whole broadcast itself might be made from records. If that were done it would still be a broadcast. - The real point is that it should be done only by a body which has direct _ responsibility, as has' the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Consequently, failing in my desire to see clause 14 omitted altogether, I propose the amendment in order to confine theprivilege to the commission and to itsemployees. </para>

                        <para>. - There has been a long-standing argument between the Postmaster-General's Department and the Australian Broadcasting Commission as to where the responsibility of one begins and that of the other ends. If it could, the commission would acquire the control of all of the technical side of broadcasting; but up to date- the Postmaster-General's Department has been able to establish with every government its claim that its authority extends right &gt;up to the microphone and that the authority of the Australian Broadcasting Commission begins only at the microphone. When the matter is one of re-broadcasting and the provision of land-lines, the officers of the Postmaster-General's Department become involved both directly and indirectly in the actual work of broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. It is true that only the Australian Broadcasting Commission is named in the bill as the authority that will broadcast the proceedings of both Houses of the Parliament. That was necessary because the Australian Broadcasting Commission is an independent authority which could refuse a ministerial direction to broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament. As a matter of fact, the Australian Broadcasting Commission offered to broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament. But the Government considered that the Parliament' should not be dependent upon the favour of 'an instrumentality of its own creation, and decided instead to introduce a bill which would enable a direction to be given to the Australian Broadcasting Commission to do certain things, and to apply compulsion should that body refuse to do what the Government and the Parliament wanted to have done. The officers of the Postmaster-General's Department are in a entirely different category. They are employees of the Crown, and, as such, can be directed to do certain things ; consequently, there was no necessity to make any provision in relation to them or the department except in the matter of  privilege and immunity from punishment. The words " any person " were used to cover -all the persons who could be legitimately employed in broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament. The proposal of the honorable member for  Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> so to narrow privilege as to embrace only the officers and agents of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is, in substance, what is now proposed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> The Government considers that everybody associated with the broadcasts should be given the same immunity and the same protection - not merely those who name the speakers and do other things incidental to malting the broadcasts possible, but also all other people who collaborate throughout the length and breadth of Australia in taking broadcasts or rebroadcasts into the homes of the nation. What the bill proposes is in accord with the provisions of the act of this Parliament, which grants immunity to those who record, print and publish the debates of the Parliament, as well as those who print and publish every other document that is issued under the authority of the Parliament. </para>

But there is" no inconsistency between that provision and the provision that any person associated with broadcasts of the proceedings of the Parliament, whether they be partial .or complete, should be granted immunity in respect of what he does under the direction of the Government. I hope it is not considered likely that there will ever be an abuse of authority by any of the employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission or of the Postmaster-General's Department. There may be technical faults. Climatic or other conditions may cause a breakdown of the broadcasting service, and that is a contingency against which we cannot guard against. Honorable members need have no fear of any abuse under this clause. It will be for the committee which the bill proposes shall be sat up to determine how many or how few broadcasts shall take place. I do not think that any honorable member desires that the clause shall be abused, and I am sure that the committee that is to be set up Will not allow it to be abused. </para>

I have no doubt that the honorable gentleman ha.? given very careful consideration to the possible effect of the clause as it stands. Provision for the protection of those who will he engaged in the broadcasts authorized* by the Parliament is essential. So long as the Minister is satisfied that the clause  as drafted does not go much farther than that, and confer on commercial broadcasting stations who make an unauthorized re-broadcast of portions of a debate, a licence to broadcast selected defamatory sentences, with complete privilege and immunity from punishment, then it will be all right. </para>

                        <para>. - We have just heard an extraordinary argument, and I do not profess to understand it. Are we to be told that the words " any person " are needed instead of a reference to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, because some employee of the Postmaster-General's Department may be held responsible for defamation if he lays a land-line or provides some piece of plant? I might as well be told that a newspaper company could involve a person who supplied it with newsprint in liability for an action for damages. The newsboy does not furnish such a good example, because he publishes the libel by selling the newspaper, but I have not heard it suggested that the person who supplies a newspaper with printer's ink may be held responsible for libels. Let us assume that the department supplies the equipment which makes this chamber resemble a petrified forest. Am I to be told that the operator of the equipment makes himself liable for what is spoken afterwards? The broadcasting of the debates will be done not by the Postmaster-General's Department but by the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its servants. The department will merely attend to the mechanical equipment. The commission will say, " Here is the microphone; we shall distribute .the debates to the listeners ". The privilege must be confined to those who would otherwise be liable, and they are the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its employees. It is all very well  for the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eraser)</inline> to say that he will be satis fied by a ministerial assurance, but if he agrees with me he will have an opportunity shortly to vote against the clause. </para>

                            <para>- What is the objection to including any person who broadcasts any portion of the debates? They are all subject to the authority of either the Postmaster-General or the commission. The original provision in the bill was copied, as far as it could be, from the relevant portion of the act, relating to the distribution of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and is in accordance with the recommendation of the committee that privilege should be extended to the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings in the same way as it is extended to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I urge the committee to vote against the- amendment, and to accept an amendment which I intend to move- later to provide for the power to re-broadcast. Proposed new clause 13a meets the objection of those who see the possibility that privilege might be enjoyed by persons not entitled to it. It is true that the man who supplies newsprint to newspaper proprietors does not know to what use the material will be put, but the Postmaster-General knows that when he provides equipment for the commission it will be used for the purpose intended. He knows that things may be said which would be held by some people to be defamatory. We might get some extraordinary judgments from the courts based on the provisions of the measure if it is amended in the way the Leader of the Opposition desires. . What honorable members have thought to be clear in respect of other legislation has provided an opportunity for the highest courts in the land to divide themselves and render judgments which seem to be beyond the comprehension of laymen. This clause was drafted by the legal advisers of the Government, who do not see the dangers feared by members of the Opposition, and there is no reason why the  Government  should reject the legal advice tendered to it. Extraordinary powers are possessed by the Postmaster-General to put stations off the air when he considers it necessary to do  so,  and he has the right to keep them off the air for. many months. That was done during the war in respect of the station controlled by the Jehovah Witnesses organization, without reasons being given. That proved that any station which attempted to flout the law when Parliament was not sitting could be quickly penalized. </para>

                        <para>. - The statement that the Postmaster-General has the power to put stations  off  the air is not quite correct, as the powers previously exercisedare now to be modified in certain important particulars. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rosevear)</inline> showed conclusively that for the protection of the privileges of the Parliament the amendment foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> should be accepted. Shortly afterwards the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eraser)</inline> took a similar stand. When two of the most acute minds on the Government side support the case presented by the Opposition, there are two courses open to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley).</inline> I prefer that he should tell the Minister in charge of the bill not to be so dogmatic to be, now and again, a little more reasonable. A further suggestion is that he should refer the matter back to caucus for further consideration. If this clause goes through in spite of the case made out against it by some of the Government's own supporters, the purpose of this committee will be stultified. When in committee we should consider measures, not in a party spirit, but in a desire to do what is right in the circumstances. </para>

                                <para>Apart from wives, dependants and fiancees of Australian servicemen it is understood that there are some 3,000 to 4.000 Australians in the United Kingdom awaiting passages to Australia. The number who have applied for priority passages on compassionate grounds is not known here. All applications for priority passages and the allotment of passages are dealt with by the Australian High Commissioner's Office, London. A considerable number of wives, dependants and fiancees of Australian servicemen have already been transported to Australia due to the efforts of the Resident Minister in London, who was successful in securing an allocation of SOO berths per month. The Resident Minister in London is doing everything possible to arrange transport to lift those in these and other categories still awaiting passages in the United Kingdom. </para>

                                <para>The Government has decided as a matter of policy that the work of the Department of Information should be continued and it is not the practice to discuss government policy in reply to questions. It will be evident, however, to honorable members that the Department of Information is carrying out work of high national importance by making Australia more favorably known abroad with a consequential stimulation of the demand for our primary and secondary produce, by interesting potential migrants in Australia as their future home and by advertising the Commonwealth as a field for the investment of oversea capital. To carry out this programme effectively it has been necessary to establish and maintain writing, short wave, film and photographic sections of the department in Australia and also publicity representatives at eleven oversea points, in spite of which the Commonwealth's national publicity service costs considerably less per head of population than those of any other progressive nation. </para>

                                <para>The comprehensive pools were established in concentrated areas with prolific production potentials. The objective was the maximum production of foodstuffs for the fighting services to fill urgent demands which otherwise could not have been met. Much of the machinery was entirely new to Australian farmers and Australian conditions and a considerable amount of demonstration work was essential. Moreover, in order to induce farmers to use the machinery it became necessary to fix hiring charges at levels which would otherwise have been higher. Further, the acute shortage of mechanical labour and repair facilities made it necessary to employ operators and mechanics for the whole year instead of on a seasonal basis. </para>

The results of this increase have not been apparent because of the Government's decision, following upon the easing of the heavy Service demands for vegetables and potatoes, toterminate its direct interest in these pools. The machinery in some of the pools has already been disposed of and action is being taken in respect of the remainder. </para>

                                <para>The hire-purchase machinery pooling system has been in operation since early 1944, and has developed strongly in Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania, and to a lesser degree  in  South Australia. The New South Wales and Queensland Governments, nave instituted their own machinery pooling schemes and have not participated in the system established by the Commonwealth Government. Following upon the Commonwealth Government's approval of 26th March, 1940, the New South Wales and Queensland Governments have, been given a further opportunity to join in the scheme, but have not so far signified their intention to do so. The additional funds provided by the Commonwealth Government in March were for the purpose of ensuring continuity of the hire purchase machinery pooling scheme already in operation ponding the development of a long term plan to be agreed upon between the Commonwealth and the States. These funds have been expended by way of advances to contractors in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania to enable the purchase of approved machinery to be used on a pooling basis and the Government will shortly be giving consideration to the question of the further extension of the scheme. In March the Government also approved of a three-year programme for the development of new types of agricultural machinery and the fostering of farm mechanization. Preliminary surveys have already been undertaken in respect of a number of mechanization problems, and in addition the Director-General of Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bulcock)</inline> who is at present overseas representing the Commonwealth Government at international food conferences, will be taking advantage of the opportunity to investigate some of the phases of agricultural mechanization in other countries. </para>

                                <para>These farms were established in 1943 at a time of special emergency in north Queensland in order to produce locally a proportion of the fresh vegetables required by Australian and Allied forces based on north Queensland. At the time shipping and land transport facilities were overtaxed and the establishment of the Commonwealth projects was undertaken at the direct request of the fighting services concerned. There were no Commonwealth vegetable farms of a similar nature elsewhere in Australia, although it is understood that the Army grew vegetables at a number of points in north Queensland and  Northern  Australia, and later in New Guinea and the islands. Further, by agreement with the New South Wales Government, the Department of the Army and my department cooperated with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in the large-scale production with prisoner-of-war labour of vegetables  at the Riverina Welfare Farm, Yanco, the produce being mainly processed for the use of the services. My department is not in possession of the figures of final expenditure and receipts for projects other than the north Queensland farms. </para>

                                <para>The newsprint rationing scheme does not go so far as to lay down a policy as to the matter which a newspaper proprietor shall, or shall not publish. That is a question for the newspaper proprietor himself, provided he keeps within the law to which he is subject. If all the subscribers to the newspapers to which the honorable member refers take the same view of these strips as he does, it is  probable that newspaper proprietors would at least consider whether they were acting wisely in continuing to publish them. I understand that the imported comic strips are being published throughout Australia, and not only in Sydney as the honorable member would suggest. The principal conditions which apply when a newsprint allocation is granted to a newspaper proprietor are that it shall be used in the production of the newspaper and shall not be exceeded. As regards the question raised concerning expenditure of dollar exchange on comic strips produced abroad and used in Australia, it should not be overlooked that their distribution is world-wide and this fact greatly reduces their cost to the individual publishers. Generally speaking, the cost of these imported strips is met in Australia in Australian currency and the proceeds used on services and goods acquired in Australia. Occasionally dollar remittances are approved for small amounts in respect of imports of comic strips received prior to the period of control. The aggregate amount would not be material. As a rule the imported: strips are re-drawn by Australian artists and fresh printing blocks aremade before they are used in Australia. Comic strips produced in Australia by Australian artists are likewise distributed in the United Kingdom and the United States and those countries share the cost of their production. </para>

In view thereof, it is not considered that the publication of these comic strips calls for any special restrictive measures by the Commonwealth Government. At the present time their importation is controlled by the Customs (Import Licensing) Regulations but there is nothing to prevent the importation of copies of the overseas newspapers in which these comic strips appear and from which they could be copied in Australia by arrangement with the overseas publishers. </para>

This was the basis of the case put up by the States for assistance, and it is not practicable to extend the scope of the scheme which was approved. </para>

                        <para>For the most part, trade union delegates travelling abroad have been sent as representatives to International Labour  Organiztion  conferences or committees. The general practice which has been followed for workers' representatives in such cases is to compensate them on the basis of wages actually lost during the period of absence from Australia on the business of the conference or committee, or £10 per week, whichever is the less. Under the constitution of the International Labour Organization, each member government is responsible for the travelling and subsistence expenses of its country's delegates. However, for delegates to industrial 'committees, as distinct from conferences, the International Labour Organization bears the cost of travelling and subsistence expenses for both employers' and employees' representatives. The member government bears only the expenses of the government representatives. In addition, all governments have from time to time made some contributions towards the expenses of trade union and other representatives- travelling abroad to attend important international conferences. As regards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thornton,</inline> this Government paid hig fare when he attended the first World Trade Union Conference in London as one of two Australasian Council of Trade Unions delegates. All other expenses were met by the delegates. For the second World Trade Union Conference, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thornton</inline> attended in Paris towards the end of 1945, as an Australasian Council of Trade Unions representative, no payments of any kind were made by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited was formed as a wartime storage and distribution measure at the request of the Commonwealth with a view to the most effective use being marie of bulk storages and as a means of conserving man-power and transport. The agreement then entered into provided that the " pool " should continue until six months after the cessation of active hostilities, which meant that the arrangement should have ended normally as at 31st March, 194G. </para>
                        <para>Because of difficulties then associated with the reversion to a system of competitive trading the member companies of Pool Petroleum Proprietary Limited decided to extend the life of the "pool" until 30th Juno, 1946; the companies have recently re-examined the position and in the light of continued difficulty with, drum supplies, transport, etc. the companies have decided upon a further extension to 31st December. 1946, with provision foi termination of " pool " at an earlier date upon due notice of such intention being given by any member company. </para>
                        <para class="block">The decision to continue " pool " trading; was one for determination solely by the oil companies and was taken  by  them alone. The industry did, however, give the Minister for Supply and Shipping advance notice of such decision and the reasons therefor; the reasons advanced in support of the decision to extend " pool " trading are regarded as valid ones and it is not felt that the continuation of "pool" is resulting in any disadvantage to the public. Whether ". pool " continues or is abolished has no bearing whatever ' on petrol rationing, which is a matter for Government decision solely and is considered in the light of the supply position alone. </para>
                        <para> The current prices of petroleum products have been based on a system of " pool " trading and I feel satisfied that 'the Prices Commissioner, who is in close touch with the oil industry, will have full regard to the present extension of " pool " trading in considering the price structure. </para>

Licences are issued in the various States and the total value of licences already issued is not immediately available. However, where quota-holders have not yet received licences up to the full amount of their quota, licences for the outstanding balance are available if applied for.  </para>

                                <para>There have been statements by quotaholders that there has been trafficking in the licences issued to ex-servicemen, but no instances of this alleged abuse of the licences have so far been detected by the department. Owing to the precautions which would be taken by traffickers to cover up their dealings, detection and proof of the offence would be very difficult. Insofar as watches are concerned, the qualifications of applicants for quotas have been the subject of more intense scrutiny for some months.  </para>

It te not considered proper to disclose details of an individual importer's business transactions. Consequently the amounts of the licences have been omitted. </para>
