                        <para> - I have repeatedly directed attention in this House to the extreme dangers of the inflationary tendencies that are evident not only in America but also in other countries, as well as to some degree in Australia, as the result in the accumulation of purchasingpower in the community. I do not know that I need make a lengthy statement concerning the dangers of inflation. What has happened previously in other countries, and what is happening to some degree in America to-day, is, I think, quite evident. From time to time during the past four or five years, the Government has done everything that it could do, by various controls, to prevent increases of prices, which, if unchecked, must ultimately cause inflation Probably, during the debate onsome measure that will come before the House before the termination of the present sittings, I shall be able to make a further announcement in regard to the matter, indicatingthe steps that have already been taken, and the desirability of continuing them with a view to preventing inflation in this country. </para>

                        <para> - I had not given any thought to the conveningof a conference of Premiers todeal with this matter. Some time ago, a conference of employers and employees wasproposed, but on account of circumstances that arose at the time the Minister for Labour and National Service informed me that both of the parties considered that the time was not opportune for such a gather- ing. I shall discuss with him whether an attempt should now be made to convene a conference on those lines. A meeting of Premiers will be held in August in conjunction with thenormal meeting of the Loan Council. I shall consider the honorable member's suggestion. </para>

                        <para> - As to the suggestion of the Leader of the Country party that the names of members of trade unions should be lodged with the Registrar of the Arbitration Court, that is a matter to which consideration will probably be given when a proposed bill to provide for amendments of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Actis receiving attention by the Government. Although it is perfectly true that some persons, who are leaders of trade unions, admit that they are Communists, it certainly cannot be said that the great body of trade unionists are dominated by members of the Communist party. The right honorable gentleman need only consider who are the leaders and secretaries of some of the trade unions in this country to realize that the majority of their executive officers are not Communists. </para>

                            <para>- From what I gathered, from the question of the right honorable gentleman, his impression  seemed  to be that, if one member of the executive is an admitted Communist, he dominates the whole organization. Personally, I do not believe that to be true. I could point to many unions to show that the great majority of the members of their executive bodies are not members of the Communist party,  and  are not even in sympathy with it. </para>

In view of that and Mr. Thomas's further statement that Communists and Communist  union officials were guilty of actions calculated to delay the building of homes, and that foremen and leading hands, appointed by Mr. McGirr  from lists supplied by the union  for  party purposes, stirred up strife among the men, will the Minister have an inquiry made as to the truth of Mr. Thomas's statement? If Communists and Communist sympathizers arc acting as alleged, will he take steps to have them removed from the positions they hold and from employment by the housing authorities? </para>

Originally, there was shipping space for only 18 tons, but subsequently this was increased to 33 tons. As a large quantity of the consignment will remain undelivered unless shipping space for it can be provided, and this will have a detrimental effect on the housing programme in Western Australia, will the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping confer with his colleague- with a view to having the necessary shipping space provided? </para>

                        <para>- Essendon Aerodrome has been closed because of excessive rainfall during the first half of this year, and because a concrete landing strip is being laid down. In the interests of safety it was decided to close the aerodrome, but it will be opened again as soon as possible, and I hope that it will never be necessary to close it again. Ths policy of the Government has been to construct air-ports, or to provide assistance for their construction, on trunk routes. What else it may do in this regard will be decided when its future policy is being drawn up. It is the wish of the Government to provide the best possible service, and the honorable member may be assured that when the Government's policy is announced it will be adequate to meet the needs of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The matter was brought to my notice this morning, but when I made inquiries, I found that no information, official or. otherwise, had been received by the Chief of the General Staff to support the report that a skirmish had taken place between Australian troops and troops of the Netherlands East Indies. I have asked that further inquiries be made, and I shall acquaint the honorable member with the result. On the 15th June, there were approximately 700 Australian troops at Morotai; 300 of these were  evacuated, leaving about 400 to guard equipment until landing ship-tanks could be made  available to bring it back to Australia. Six landing ship-tanks are scheduled to leave Singapore, four of them for Balikpapan, and two for Morotai, to lift troops and equipment. I have been assured that all troops will be out of those areas by the middle of September. The landing ship-tanks will be available on the 1st August, and will travel to their destinations immediately. The Government is anxious to  evecuate  the troops as soon as possible. </para>

Is it a fact that no new instruction has ye been issued to countermand the original general routine order that all illegal absentees prior to the 31st December 1945. should be discharged forthwith? Will the Minister now inform the House what is the real position regarding deserters? </para>

                        <para>- The only effect of the loan that I can foresee will be that the dollar position will probably be somewhat easier for Australia, although this country will not directly participate in the loan. Australia has agreed to take part in a conference to discuss world trade and employment. Imperial preference will, no doubt, be discussed before the end of the year by those countries which are parties to it, but just what effect this will have on the general talks about trade and unemployment I cannot say. On a previous occasion I informed the honorable member for Indi that Australia will do all possible to retain imperial preference. </para>

A further communication was forwarded to him yesterday seeking clarification of the situation, but no reply was received up to 2 p.m. to-day. When army personnel are concerned in incidents with the civil police, the normal procedure is to hand them over to their commanding officer, who is empowered to take whatever disciplinary action he deems necessary in the circumstances. H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Shropshire</inline> has left Gibraltar. If any incident such as was reported in a section of the press occurred, I have no doubt that Major-General Eather will already have inquired into it, in which event, a report from him may be expected soon, probably within the next 24 hours. </para>

Will the Minister examine this sample of Liberal party electioneering propaganda and measure it alongside the protestations of the Leader of the Opposition? </para>

                            <para>- The propaganda of the Liberal party will again make the people of Australia curse that organization. I recall also that in 1940 the United Australia party, now the Liberal party, published for propaganda purposes a libellous and lying poster stating, " While Labour fiddles London burns ", and urging support for United Australia party candidates. These are the people who in 1917 adopted the slogan " Ryan, too, spells  ruin ". Their propaganda methods are rather miserable at any time, and by comparison, the advertisement which appeared last week urging support for Labour party candidates was not deserving of condemnation or criticism. It was a healthy, clean and clever piece of satire, and the Opposition just " can't take it ". </para>

                        <para>- It is true that the honorable member has, on behalf of egg producers of New South Wales, requested me to confer with the Minister for Trade and Customs, who administers prices control, regarding the price of eggs. I have taken that course on previous occasions, and inresponse to the honorable member's request I shall do so again. Recently a deputation from the poultry farmers of the Newcastle and northern districts of New South Wales waited on me and made a similar request. Following the remarks of members of that deputation I found upon investigation that poultry producers in those districts were selling poultry feed mixtures of various brands at a price exceeding the cost of the materials in the mixtures. Poultry farmers who are being supplied with feed at reasonable prices are not in the same parlous position. </para>

The Commonwealth Constitution provides that Commonwealth properties shall not be rated, but some lessees of such properties have undertaken to pay rates to local governing authorities.

                        <para>- I have a very clear conception as to when the Minister for External Affairs should return to Australia. On the one hand there is a good deal of criticism if Ministers are not sent abroad to represent this country at important conferences, and on the other there is violent criticism when the Government arranges for Australia to be represented abroad by a Minister of the calibre of the Minister for External Affairs, who iseminently capable of dealing with general international problems as they arise from day to day. This criticism comes principally from those who seek to make political capital out of the absence of the right honorable gentleman or who are jealous ofhissuccess. When the Minister went abroad it was originally intended that he should remain overseas until the conclusion of the peace conference. The right honorable gentleman has always expressed his willingness to return to Australia whenever I desired that he should do so. However, I regarded the Peace Conference as of such importance as to warrant attendance by two Australian Ministers. Some delay has, however, arisen in the convening of the conference due to the protracted nature of preliminary deliberations of the Foreign Ministers of the major Allied powers. The Government decided that, until the date of the Peace Conference was fixed, it was desirable that the Minister for External Affairs should remain abroad to attend other international conferences. The Government's view is that the Minister should be present at least at the earlier sessions of the Peace Conference. </para>

                        <para>- When the Minister for External Affairs was present in this chamber, he was asked a question about the difficulties that had arisen regarding Spain. On that occasion, he gave the reply, which was the view of this Government, that the various allegations, charges and counter charges that had been made about Spain should be fully examined. Apparently, other nations took precisely the same view, and it was agreed that such an investigation should be made. The inquiry was made under the auspices of the United Nations. Therefore, the statement that the Minister for External Affairs made in this House did represent the views of this Government, namely, that all the claims and charges that had been made should be fully investigated. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Prime Minister inform me whether there is an arrangement between the Commonwealth Government and overseas governments for the supply of Australian manufactured goods which are in short supply here? I refer to such goods as rubber tyres and woollen textiles. If no such inter-government arrangement exists, I should like to know whether private manufacturers pay an export duty on such goods to equalize labour costs in the importing countries? Will the Prime Minister endeavour to have a chart prepared showing the relative cost of production of motor tyres and woven woollen - cloth in Australia and in each of the countries of the Pacific group, namely, New Zealand, United States of America, and Canada? </para>

In view of the fact that the published report of the Goodyear Tyre Company's balance-sheet reveals that the company has paid a steady dividend of8 per cent. on its 250,000 preference shares, and paid over the war years an average dividend of 2011/15 per cent. on its 750,000 ordinary shares namely: 19.40, 24 per cent.; 1941, 12 per cent.; 1942, 142/5 per cent.; 1943, 16 per cent.; 1944, 172/5 per cent.; 1945, 403/5 per cent. - does he not consider that the Australian motoring public and the primary producers are being grossly overcharged? Will he consult the Minister for Trade and Customs with a view to having the price of tyres reduced instead of increased? </para>

                        <para>- I shall be glad to discuss this matter with the Minister for Trade and Customs. I noticed the paragraph to which the honorable member referred and I made some preliminary investigations. I have been assured by officials of the Prices Commission that the profit position of the company was very carefully studied by the Commissioner and his staff, who, by the way, have done a magnificent job for Australia in the face of tremendous difficulties. One realizes this when one reads of what happened in the United States of America when price controls were lifted. It would be well to bear in mind that profit shown in the form of dividends on capital invested in a company can distort the true profit position in relation to capital actually employed. However, the complaint will be further considered by the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Prices Commissioner. It is the policy of the Government that an essential commodity such as motor vehicle tyres, should be sold to the Australian community at the lowest possible prices. </para>

A. Abbott, to the Millions Club, were a reflection on Mr. Abbott's own administration, will the Minister inform the House who was responsible for granting in 1942 to Alexandria Downs station, which  already held 10,600 square miles, or 6,784,000 acres of property, the lease of a further 400 square miles, or 256,000 acres of property, for a term of 42 years, after a grant of this choice land had been refused in 1941 by Mr. Abbott to a bona-fide selector who had £16,000, in cash to develop it?

If the Minister for Air (Mr. Drakeford) is prepared to move that his statement be printed, and thus enable it to be debated,   I  shall withdraw my objection. </para>

But I suggest that the Minister would do well if, having made his statement, he moved that it be printed ; because the matter is not of such a nature that it would necessarily be concluded when one statement upon it had been made. There may be, 911 both sides of the House, honorable members who desire to debate it. Therefore, the Minister should follow the normal practice in such circumstances, and thus allow a debate upon his statement to take .place either immediately or at some future date. </para>

                    DRAKEFORD  (MaribyrnongMinister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation). - Allegations of maladministration, and of unsound organization, of the Royal Australian Air Force during the war, involving charges of injustice done to Air Vice-Marshal Bostock, have been given head-line publicity on a syndicated basis by a section of the press. In a series of articles originating with the Melbourne
                    <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline>
                    and written by Air Vice- Marshal Bostock himself, strong endeavours have been made to create the impression that, as Minister for Air, I, together with the Air Board, have fostered and developed a condition of affairs out of which has grown a state of dissatisfaction that is detrimental to the interests of the Air Force, to' those serving in that force, and to the Commonwealth generally. On entirely false .premises, these malicious and unjustified attacks on the Government, the Air Board, and. myself, have built up for ulterior purposes what, without a factual reply, might be regarded , as a formidable indictment.' It is a matter for much regret that newspapers which have a wide circulation should take advantage of their privileged position in the community to belittle the efforts and achievements of an ad ministration responsible for a service which is acknowledged throughout the world, and particularly the English-speaking world, to have achieved a standard of performance which compares favorably with that of any other air force.
                </para>
                <para>These articles endeavour to make it appear that what has been accomplished - and no one appreciates more than I do the magnificent service given by the personnel in every branch of the Air Force - has been achieved in spite of the Minister and the Air Board. Let me .again, as I have frequently done in the past, pay great tribute to the heroism, skill and complete devotion to duty, very often in the face of tremendous odds, that have been displayed by members of the Air Force in the skies and on the ground in the operational zones. May I here also pay tribute to the work of the supporting organizations associated with the administrative, equipment, technical  maintenance, personnel, and like branches of the service. </para>
                <para>Throughout the period of almost five years in which I have held the portfolio of Minister for Air, I have conscientiously striven to ensure, in every way possible, that the rights and interests of the members of the service should be protected and preserved. I assert now, and shall prove later, that the main charges in the articles to which I refer were based on entirely false premises, and were presented by Air Vice-Marshal Bostock in a way quite obviously calculated to confuse the minds of readers regarding the matters discussed in them, and the real problems that confronted the Government and the higher command of the Royal Australian Air Force, as well as te detract from the splendid results that were achieved. Doubtless, however, some individuals with axes to grind will endeavour to maintain the clamour raised by these bitter articles. For that- reason, I shall reply specifically to what, comparatively, are the most important of the general .allegations. In doing so, it will be necessary for me to make public facts, the necessity for the disclosure of which I deplore. But as I am forced to defend ' not only my own reputation but also the reputations of officers who have given outstanding and loyal service, and who are unable to defend themselves publicly, by reason of their appointments and of </para>
                <para>I heir observance of the traditions and practice of the services, I give the. facts to the Parliament. </para>
                <para>In his introductory passages, preceding the main case presented in his articles, Air Vice-Marshal Bostock refers to his' version of the story of Royal Australian Air Force Command with this studied comment, which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 24th June - lt is most unlikely that it will find a place in the official history of the Royal Australian Air Force as prepared bv the Department of Air. </para>
                <para>To that taunt, I. make this reply: The official history of Australia's part in the war of 1939-45, including the Royal Australian Air Force's share, is not <inline font-style="italic">hema,</inline> prepared by the Department pf Air. It will be supplied by three writers, who will work under contract to the Commonwealth, and under the editorship of the general editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Official History.</inline> Subject to the reservation of technical  military  secrets, these writer? will have at their disposal all official documents, including those of Royal Australian Aif Force Command and the units comprising that organization. They have been given the same freedom from censorship as was given to the previous Commonwealth War Historian, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. C.</inline> E. W. Bean. Theappointment of each of them was approved by a committee of which I am not a member, but which comprises the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Ministers for Defence, External Affairs and the Interior. I proceed now to the proof of false premises. </para>
                <para>In his second article,' published in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> on the 24th June, Air Vice-Marshal Bostock raises the issue of a vital War Cabinet decision which defined the responsibilities in relation to the components of the Royal Australian Air Force, as assigned respectively to the Commander of the Allied Air Forces and to Royal Australian Air Force Headquarters. Let us here examine the words on which both Air Vice-Marshal Bostock and the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> rely as the " basic causeof the Royal Australian Air Force's difficulties in the Pacific war Printed in black type they read - </para>

                <para>He states in his articles that the words I have just quoted, and which are printed in black type, are important because - </para>

And that difference was the basic cause of most of the Royal Australian Air Force's difficulties in the Pacific war. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Here are the facts : On the 28th April, 1942, War Cabinet reached a decision concerning' the assignment of the Royal Australian Air Force service squadrons, and associated head-quarters formations to the Supreme Command. The relevant War Cabinet minute reads -  </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>On the recommendation of the Advisory War Council (Minute 910) the following interpretation of the decision relating to the assignment of Australian forces to the Supreme Command was approved - </para>
                    <para>With the service squadrons there is also assigned Royal Australian Air Force Area Head-quarters, Air Combined Headquarters, all Fighter Sector Head-quarters nml such Station Head-quarters as have been established for the operational control of Royal Australian Air Force service squadrons. </para>
                    <para>Operational control of the Royal Australian Air Force service squadrons and necessary Operational Head-quarters as indicated above is vested in the Commander of the Allied Air Forces. </para>
                    <para>The Australian Chief of the Air Staff will be responsible for all matters associated with Royal Australian Air Force personnel, provision and maintenance of aircraft, supply and equipment, works and buildings,' and training. These functions are not assigned to the Commander-in-Chief. </para>
                    <para>Now let me quote verbatim the relevant excerpt from my own minute to the then Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Burnett, dated' the 30th April, 1942, and referred to by Air Vice Marshal Bostock in his articles- </para>
                    <para>That fullest co-operation should be offered Lieutenant-General Brett in his tasks as Commander Allied Air 'Forces, -under which he would take over control of all .the service squadrons of the Royal Australian Air Force, as well as Area. Operational Head-quarters, Air Combined Head-quarters and Fighter Sector Head -quarters, which concern operations only, but that the Chief of the Air Staff would assume responsibility for all matters such as personnel, provision and maintenance of aircraft, supply and equipment, works and buildings, and training of the Royal Australian Air Force. it is to be noted particularly that my directions to the Chief of the Air Staff were in strict accordance, practically word for word, with the War Cabinet decision. Thus there is not a scintilla of truth in Air. Vice-Marshal Bostock's observation that I - -to quote his own words - "put an entirely different construction on the War Cabinet's ruling". I emphasize here that, having established beyond question the complete falsity of Air Vice-Marshal Bostock's basic accusation, I also provide proof that his own improper interpretation of such a vital decision by War Cabinet accounts for a succession of wrong conclusions, not only in his current attack through the press, but also in the actual performance of his highly responsible duties as Air Officer Commanding Royal Australian Air Force Command. </para>
                    <para>By his article on the 24th June, it is clear, as I have proved, that Air Vice Marshal Bostock deliberately quoted as the basis for his charge, not, as he alleges, my interpretation of War Cabinet's decision, but the interpretation placed upon that decision by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Burnett, the then Chief of the Air Staff to whom Air Vice-Marshal Bostock was deputy,  and contained' in a minute written by him on this matter on the 29th April, 1942, the day following that on which the decision was taken. That minute obviously was at considerable variance with the actual decision taken, in that it incorrectly stated that certain of the functions assigned by War Cabinet to the Royal Australian Air Force Head, quarters were allotted to the Commander, Allied Air Forces. On receipt of a copy of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Burnett's minute I immediately directed his attention, to the pre?cise terms of the decision as promulgated by War Cabinet. That decision was strictly observed by me and by the Royal Australian Air Force Head-quarters, and the directions that I issued following" its promulgation were in complete conformity with it. I may add that not in any instance have directions issued by me been at variance with any War Cabinet decision on this or any other matter. </para>
                    <para>As I have already stated, the spearhead of his whole attack is his accusation that the interpretation placed by me on this War Cabinet decision was - I again quote his words..- The basic cause of most of the Royal Australian Air Force's difficulties in the Pacific war ". It is most unfortunate that Air Vice-Marshal Bostock still obviously accepts <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Burnett's interpretation of that vitally important War Cabinet decision as the basis of the most vicious phases of his attacks, and disregards the actual official decision which itself is the comtplete answer to that particular, and his principal, charge. Apart from that fact, his apparent non-acceptance and disregard of the War Cabinet decision shows quite conclusively that Air Vice-Marshal Bostock has, since 19.42, been labouring under a definite misconception, which he appears to have fostered to the point of obsession, of the real functions of his command, and that that misconception was, to a large extent, responsible for flip difficulties that awe between him and the Air Board. I am fully convinced that if Air Vice-Marshal Bostock had observed and given the co-operation involved, whatever difficulties were experienced would have been considerably  minimized. The organization  of the Royal Australian Air Force, of which he is so critical, has proved efficient in some other services of the Empire, which is a clear indication that the disabilities of the Air Force .which are the subject of his attack can, in a large measure, be truly attributed to the matter of personalities.  His  irresponsible and unjust criticisms of others holding high appointments and carrying big responsibilities confirm this. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I must here make, it quite clear that, under governmental decision, the Air Board was the authority directly responsible to the Government, through the Minister, for all functions of the Royal Australian Air Force except operational control of the service squadrons and other formations assigned to the Commander-in-Chief, South-West Pacific Area. Air Vice-Marshal Bostock's disregard of that allocation of duties and responsibilities was itself the primary and major cause  of many of the difficulties to which he refers. I will show later that, as late as February last, Air Vice-Marshal Bostock asserted in a letter that, while he was Air Officer Commanding Royal Australian Air Force Command, he had no responsibility whatever to any Australian authority - that is his view. This is obviously erroneous, and his adherence to that attitude throughout his service was responsible for me having to  make  direct contact with, the Commander, Allied Air Forces, on the matter. </para>
                <para>The Air Vice-Marshal's introduction of the Barry Commission of Inquiry into his attack is also, for him, another very damaging aspect of his whole case. In his summing up of the causes of the trouble that arose within the First Tactical Air Force,' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barry,"</inline> K.O., had this to say: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>I am satisfied that the immediate cause of the applications for  permission  to resign their commissions by-- </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Here the Commissioner named the eight officers concerned - was dissatisfaction with the operational activities of the First  Tactical  Air Force. </para>
                <para>Elsewhere <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barry</inline> reports that the basic causes of the trouble were, first, the type of operations on which the Wings were engaged, and, secondly, the dissatisfaction with the attitude of the senior staff officers of the Tactical Force. It is significant that in the course of his articles on the subject Air Vice-Marshal Bostock, Air Officer Commanding Royal Australian Air Force Command, omits any reference to the primary cause of the trouble, lack of operational  opportunity, which was not the responsibility of Royal Australian Air Force Head-quarters. </para>
                <para>The Air Vice-Marshal further chose to make some cynical comment in his articles by comparing the men who fought the war from " cramped cockpits " with those in swivel chairs in offices thousands of miles behind the combat areas. It is interesting to note that while Air Vice-Marshal Bostock was in command of a formation the function of which was operational control, his Command Head-quarters was located in Brisbane, Queensland. It was not until March-April, 194-5, that an advanced echelon of that head-quarters was transferred to Morotai to control the Borneo operations. And so, his cynical references which I have quoted have equal application to the conditions under which he himself served for practically the whole period of the war. </para>
                <para>Another point I would emphasize is that quite obviously -many factors other than those he has covered in his articles and those of which he was aware, yet has not mentioned, had very important bearing on the decisions of War Cabinet, the Government and Royal Australian Air "Force Head-quarters during the war years having full regard to all Commonwealth war commitments. </para>
                <para>And now, I come to what perhaps will weigh most in the minds of all openminded observers and critics - I refer to the all-important question of responsibility to the Commonwealth. I therefore invite close attention  to this  extract from a .letter received from the Air Vice Marshal as recently as the 25th February of this year - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Upon my services being made available to the Commander, Allied Air Forces, he appointed me first as his Chief of Staff, and, shortly afterwards, when General Kenney took oyer from General Brett, as Air Officer Commanding Royal Australian Air Force Command. Iri both these appointments I was responsible, directly and only to the Commander, Allied Air Forces, for all the duties incumbent on the appointments. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Another excerpt from that letter reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Up to a date early in 1942 when I ceased to he responsible to the Australian authorities. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Those statements 1 have quoted come from a man who professes to have Australian interests at heart and who, in fact, commanded Royal Australian Air Force operational units consisting of thousands of Australian personnel. They como from one who was the senior officer of the Royal Australian Air Force serving with our allies; yet, according to his own words, he had no responsibility to any Commonwealth authority. That is his own declaration and it describes accurately his behaviour. And yet, when lie received the notice of his retirement - I ask the House to note this - this same officer made special written request that his retirement be reconsidered and that he be retained in the Royal Australian Air Force. Further than that, lie has even appealed for " redress of grievance " in respect of his retirement. Had his application to remain in the service been approved, it is clear that the articles' under reference would not have been written by him. I draw special attention of honorable members to this important point. </para>
                <para>Having persistently pursued a policy based on his own misinterpretation of my actions and those of the Air Board, Air Vice-Marshal Bostock will no doubt continue to draw his pay and serve the interests of his employers by contributing further columns of explanations and criticisms of. the competency and capacity of almost everybody who had, or still has, authority in the Royal Australian Air Force, except himself. "Neither I, as Minister, nor the Air Board has laid claim to infallibility. However, I take this opportunity to say that the Government has full confidence in the Air Board. </para>
                <para>Having proved beyond doubt that Air Vice-Marshal Bostock, who has received the equivalent of approximately nineteen columns of publicity in one newspaper, syndicated by other sections of the after noon press, which has been given him based his charges on false premises, I ask the Parliament and the public to treat anything further which flows from his facile pen as the partisan outpourings of a person who, having frustrated his ambition in the service by his own actions, finds satisfaction in belittling a force which has a proud record of servicefor Australia and. the Allied cause. </para>

                        <para class="block">I  looked in vain for some further tribute by the Minister to that efficient organization. As Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited pioneered the beam service in Australia, and has done much to maintain Australia's reputation in the field of radio-telegraphy, I thought that in his historical summary the Minister would have paid a high tribute to that organization for what it had done. He has failed to do so, except for the few lines to which I have already referred. Through its research activities Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has contributed much to the world's knowledge of radio-telegraphy, but now, at the very peak of its efficiency, its organization and its research officers are to be interruptedin their work. The history of telegraphic communications has been given by the Minister, and I do not think it necessary to add much to what he said in that connexion. It is true, as he pointed out, that this bill is the outcome of an Empire-wide plan which was recommended by the British Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference, held inLondon in July and August, 1945, and accepted by all the Governments represented, subject, of course to ratification by the various parliaments of the Empire. I understand that Australia is likely to be the first country to ratify the agreement. </para>

                            <para>- Although the ratification of the agreement appears to be highly desirable, various countries which subscribed to it at the conference are examining it closely before presenting it to their Parliaments for ratification. It seems, therefore, that good reasons exist why the bill should be discussed thoroughly in this Parliament, in order that we may understand how it will affect Australia and the Empire as a whole. The question before us is not so much whether the Parliament should ratify the agreement, but rather how best it can be implemented. That can be done in either of two ways, each of which is deserving of our careful consideration. First, there can be a complete merger of all the interests involved, namely, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, Cables and Wireless Limited, and the Postmaster-General's Department, under the control of the Commonwealth' Government. Secondly, effect could be given to the agreement by the formation of a new communications company, consisting of the companies now in the field and the Government, with control in the hands of the Government. Those alternative means of controlling communications were investigated by previous governments, and it was found -that each of them contained certain attractive features. Before we decide on any plan it may be well to consider these alternative schemes. The proposal contained in the bill provides for the setting up of a commission to control communications. The alternative scheme that has been suggested deals only with communications, and, therefore, it would naturally follow that that aspect would be segregated entirely from the commercial activities of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. In his second-reading speech the Minister said - </para>

                    <para>The Government proposes to retain its proportionate shareholding in the reconstituted company if the private shareholders ofAmalgamated Wireless ( Australasia.) Limited so desire. </para>
                    <para class="block">That raises the question of the Government's interest in the commercial aspects of radio- telegraphy. My firm belief is. that it would be better for Australia if the Government were to keep out of commercial enterprises. It is interesting to note that although the Government's policy provides for nationalization of industries generally, it proposes to consult the shareholders of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in this matter. At this stage it is impossible to say what the shareholders will decide, but, regardless of their decision, I strongly urge the Government to keep out of the commercial field entirely . </para>

                            <para>- No. If I had that in mind I should oppose this bill. I have, however, strong views on the use of the Postmaster-General's Department as a taxing medium. At present three organizations control communications, but it would be far more economical to merge them, under Commonwealth control. That would be best in the interests of the taxpayers and of those who will use the service. This proposal will have a tendency to eliminate approximately 4,000 miles of private telegraph lines that have been used exclusively by the two companies. These lines run parallel to lines of the Postmaster-General's Department and could be used by the department to further the interests of subscribers by providing additional services which otherwise could not be made available at present owing to the lack of equipment. Another important advantage will be that in time of war or national crisis, all communications will be under one control. This is most desirable for the application of censorship, and to keep a check on all communications reaching or leaving the country. At present, the Postmaster-General's Department controls approximately 91 per cent. of the traffic load of internal and external communications, the remainder being controlled by the two companies.. At least, that was the position in 1939 just prior to the outbreak of war. The overseas communication services include the following :  - </para>

                    <para class="block">So, of eleven services, seven are controlled by the Postmaster-General's Department, two by Amalagmated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and two by the Department of the Navy and the Department of Air. The important point is that 91 per cent. of the traffic load is carried by the Postmaster-General's Department itself. My next point - one to which the Minister referred in his second- reading speech - concerns the embarrassment that has been, and may be, caused to a government by the action of a company acting at variance with government policy. The 1929 "conference agreed that the opening of additional radio-telegraph services should be resisted, and honorable members will recall the importuning that occurred following the action . by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited to open up new radio-telegraph communications with the United States of America and Japan. An explanation of that matter was given by the Minister, but the fact remains that because of the desire of Amalgamated Wireless . (Australasia) Limited to open up new channels, embarrassment was caused to the then government in view of the 1929 agreement. Such a state of affairs could not recur under exclusive . governmental control. </para>
                    <para>Deep sea cables are of great strategic value, and under this proposal the security of these services will be safeguarded. There is, however, one matter to which I ask the Minister to give some attention, and that is the nature of staffs at the foreign cable terminals. In the past these staffs have been employees of private or semi-private companies; now, the terminals will be manned by government officers and I am wondering what will be the reaction of foreign governments. Cable services have proved to be the only secure method of transmitting messages in time of war. They cannot be disrupted easily, and should disruption occur, they can be restored with reasonable speed. On the other hand, beam wireless services can be subjected, to a great deal of interference,as the Minister has mentioned. Therefore, any action- that can be taken to ensure the security of cable services is worthy of consideration. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the .planning for future developments. Telegraph and wireless communications have been pioneered by private companies, and. the question that now arises is whether &gt;any government can carry out experimental work as efficiently as it has been done in the past. Governments are notoriously slow to act, whereas the private companies ' have devoted considerable time and money to research. They have a responsibility to their shareholders to provide an adequate return for their investment, and therefore are urged to operate efficiently. The Government is interfering with a highly efficient undertaking, and it should -be in a position to give an assurance that the great progress that has been made in the development of communications in the past shall be continued. The services might operate efficiently under a commission, but such a body, subject to ministerial direction, will of necessity be slow and may not be- able to ensure the development that would occur should the services remain under private control. Another disadvantage is that the Government may use this body as a taxing authority. The Minister said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The internal communication services are owned hy the nation in the national and public interest, and it is illogical to have the external services operated by companies whose first duty is to their shareholders. There are very obvious reasons why the profit motive should be dissociated entirely fr.om the conduct of these external  tele-communication  services. H excess revenues fl-re derived from their operation they should lie applied in reduction of charges to the public or in improving the services, rather than for the benefit of private  shareholders. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That is just a pious hope. We know that none of the immense profits, made by the Postmaster-General's Department has been used for the improvement of services or as a means ; of reducing charges. The department's profits have been paid into Consolidated Revenue, out of which the department draws its requirements from time, to time. The present arrangement whereby the department is required to submit yearly estimates in respect of its requirements is retarding the development of its services. When I was Postmaster-General I. was investigating a five-year plan of development, because I realized the need to give to .the department the opportunity to plan ahead for at least that period. The nature of the department's operations makes long-range planning imperative. Last year the department's surplus of £6,000,000 was transferred to Consolidated Revenue. That money was not used to improve departmental services, or to confer a single benefit upon telephone subscribers by way of increasing services or reducing existing charges. In view of that fact, the pious hope expressed by the Minister in this matter will not satisfy the taxpayers of Australia. The war-time increase of the postage rate by a half-penny and the increase of the telephone subscriber's charge by a farthing a call represented an increased income to the department of £2,000,000. I hope that the Government will abolish those additional charges when the Treasurer is framing his next budget. </para>

                            <para>-I do not deny that. I point out that the additional halfpenny was imposed as. a war-time measure. Now that the war is over, I sincerely hope that the Government will reduce the imposts. I said previously that none of the surplus of the department was "used in the provision of additional services. The need for such services is emphasized by the fact that approximately 80,000 applicants are waiting for telephone facilities to be made available to them. This position, may be due to a shortage of materials. I do not deny that such a shortage exists. These facts emphasize the need for the department to lay down a long-range developmental plan. Indeed, the Minister in his statement concurs with that view. However, he will not meet this need simply by giving expression to a pious hope. Definite action must be taken along those lines. I do hot support nationalization in the sense that the Government should take over indiscriminately services which arc not essentially national. However, the whole of our telecommunication system is wrapped up with the problem of defence. Indeed, these lines of communications are' the arteries through which flow messages relating to defence, and the Government must, in the interests of security, control them. For that reason I believe that the measure should receive the approval of honorable members, subject to certain undertakings being given by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I do not agree with the nationalization of airlines. I know that I shall be out of order should I attempt to debate that subject. However, when the Minister seeks to capitalize the suggestion which I have just made with regard to defence I shall not fall into his trap. Most thinking people accept the view that we shall be dependent upon Great Britain entirely for our existence should we he menaced. I know that honorable members opposite entertain inhibitions upon that subject. It is quite patent that the cable and wireless services should be almost a United Kingdom undertaking, and that telecommunications, because of our need to establish quick contact with other, parts of the Dominions in a time of crisis, should be controlled by the Government, in order to meet the need for frequent consultation with other members of the British Commonwealth on matters of defence as well as commercial activities, trade agreements, and all matters closely associated with the welfare of the British Commonwealth of Nations. These matters are highly secret, and secrecy in respect of them must be preserved. Therefore, a merger under one control is necessary. But which is preferable - control by the Postmaster-General's Department, or control by the commission which has been outlined by the Minister? We must study both these systems carefully and realize whither each leads. I am not one of those who believe that a commission of this kind is other than a job-finding body for some particular people whom the Government has in mind. </para>

                            <para>- That view is commonly accepted. I do not believe that a commission of this nature is other than a job-finding body. On the other hand, the Postmaster-General's Department, as I have pointed out, already controls 91 per cent, of the traffic load of telecommunications, both internal and external. The department has a highly qualified technical staff, and a research section which compares more than favorably with the research sections of similar bodies in other countries. The department also possesses, the necessary equipment and organization to give immediate effect to this scheme. Indeed, the commission which is to be set up will, take advantage of the department's existing organization. We are told that the three existing bodies involve wasteful expenditure of men and money ; but the Government proposes to appoint two authorities to- control telecommunications. That is equally wasteful. The commission, the Minister says, will work in close liaison with the Postmaster-General's Department. In fact, it will use almost the entire facilities of the department. It will use the department's staff, equipment, land-lines and research section. A commission is to be set up to run parallel with an organization that is efficient and is functioning well and controls 91 per cent, of the traffic. </para>

                    <para>With regard to segregation of tele- * communications from the other operations of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, I hope that the Government will get out of the commercial field. I do not think it should give to the private shareholders the right to determine whether the Commonwealth should retain its shareholding in the reconstituted company. The principle is wrong. Taxpayer's money should not be used by the Government to compete with taxpayers in commercial pursuits. Every commercial enterprise that the Government has undertaken has hopelessly crashed. That is shown by the consistent and continuous losses that they have shown over the years. </para>
                    <para>The Minister said that the Government was negotiating with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited relative to compensation. Whilst I believe that an efficient organization like that company should receive adequate compensation, I do not believe that taxpayers' money should be used unnecessarily to buy it off. There should be fair compensation. The Government is taking away the goodwill and services of an efficient company, which has all the facilities needed to handle radio telecommunications. The company will leave the. radio telecommunications field and concentrate on the other sections of its operations, but the Government is taking away the biggest means of the  shareholders  getting a return from their investments. That calls for adequate compensation, but only adequate compensation. </para>

                            <para>- It requires an employee to have served for three years exclusively in Australia. Marine radio officers did a good job during the war. I suppose some of the most outstanding deeds -were clone by marine radio officers on board the ships and at overseas terminal stations. They underwent hardships and dangers that cannot be exaggerated. Some of them have had twenty years of .service with the company, but they have not been engaged exclusively in Australia. But for the war many of them would have sought a shore job in udi sooner. Many will be precluded from taking advantage of that provision because of- their not having been exclusively engaged in Australia. There was an acute shortage of marine radio  officers  when Avar broke out and men wanting a shore job were prevailed upon 1o continue nt sea. They rendered splendid service and should be given full consideration by the Minister. I hope that if an amendment from, this side designed to protect their interests is not accepted by the Government the Minister himself will bring down such an amendment. The clause deals mainly with the employment of and preservation of the rights of the employees of the several companies: They will he given positions if positions can be found for them. Their status, seniority and superannuation rights are likely to be impaired, because they will not be taken over as a body by the commission. I understand that they have an agreement, . registered with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, for a period of two .years relative to seniority and conditions of employment and other associated matters. Compensation for loss of employment is not sufficient for these men. A job is not sufficient unless all accrued rights are preserved. It is a matter of justice that when employees are taken over by the commission their interests shall not in any way he harmed. They should be given the right to continue in their calling with all their rights preserved. The Opposition will closely analyse this bill in the committee stages, and will seek assurances from the Minister relative to the several matters to which I have drawn attention. Before the bill reaches the committee stage, however, I trust that the Minister will indicate specifically what the Government proposes in relation to the compensation to be paid to the existing organizations and their staffs who will be displaced as the result of the change-over. Finally, I urge that provision be made for the appointment of a highly competent research staff and the establishment of ample research facilities so that the new undertaking may function efficiently. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the bill, and I am pleased to note from the speech of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> that it is commended in other quarters. I congratulate the Minister on the very painstaking way in which he dealt with the measure during his second-reading speech, and for the manner in which he explained its complicated machinery to the House. The bill must indeed be an importantdocument to have caused the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition temporarily to turn Socialist and admit that he is prepared to accept this form of socialization. But I am sure that this defection from the well-known principles held by honorable members opposite will end rapidly when other measures of a similar kind are presented for consideration. This rather complicated proposal has very important features from the viewpoint of, not only the average honorable member, but also the average Australian. The Minister has traversed the series of complicated negotiations that took place in order that this measure may run, as it were, in tandem with similar legislation in other parts of the world and vest in the Government of the country control of telecommunications both in peace and war. Control of this kind is particularly important in the interests of Australia and of the Empire as a whole. In the change-over there must of necessity be vast movements of equipment and of those who operate it. The vesting of control of telecommunications in a commission seems to be a reasonable solution of the difficulties presented by the proposal. The establishment of such a control cannot be challenged even though the proposal will inevitably bring about, some displacement of the industry and those engaged in it. In this connexion the position of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited must be given very close consideration. As has been mentioned by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, we have to consider the important part played by that organization in the past, particularly during the war period. I accept, as indeed may the people of Australia,, the Minister's assurances, that adequate and reasonable compensation will be paid to existing organizations which will be displaced by the. commission. . Just compensation, -however, is not the only matter which should be considered. lt might be a graceful gesture on the pa rt of , the Government to make provision for a- special payment to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in appreciation of its splendid war effort. I am particularly interested in the continued welfare of the company, because its largest factory in New South Wales is adjacent to my . electorate, being situated in the electorate of my colleague, the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly).</inline> The experiments and research undertaken by the company in order to bring telecommunication services up to the highest level of efficiency have been admirably successful. On a recent visit to the company's factory I noticed many highly skilled technicians, who, a few years before the Avar, had been working in more or less unskilled avocations. As the result . of intensive research in the company's laboratories it was able to provide the most efficient wireless equipment for the troops in the South West Pacific during the Avar. As the result of the skill and ingenuity of its technicians the company was able to produce completely waterproof wireless equipment which played an important part in the amphibious landing iti New Guinea. During tests this equipment w.as submerged in water for twelve hours, and 30 seconds after being withdrawn from the water it waS found to be completely and efficiently operative. I am gratified to know that laboratory experiments of this kind will continue and that research, which is. the. essence of progress, will not bc interfered with.  An aspect of this proposal which . touches very closely honorable members on this side of the House, and honorable members opposite also, is the displacement of personnel that will be brought about by the change over -to Government control. I am glad to have the assurances' of the Minister that no employee </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Will be victimized in the process. Whilst a considerable number of those ]low engaged in the industry will be absorbed in the commission's activites' and by other activities of the company, provision should be made for other avenues of employment to he. found for those not so absorbed. Special consideration might well he given to those older men who have served telecommunications loyally in the past, particularly the former members of the Pacific Cable. Corps, who to-day are the forgotten men of the telecommunications, system. I remind honorable members that in the past, sometime before the commencement of the war just ended, and just after the 1914-18 Avar, these men represented the field force of the old Pacific Cable Board, a partially'- Government-owned institution. They  were  trained at Southport, Queensland, in the old system of cable-telegraphy. They  worked  in isolated outposts and gave splendid service. Possibly not more than half a dozen or a dozen of them are alive to-day. I trust that in considering the ramifications of this bill the Minister will not overlook their claims for consideration. </para>
                    <para>Another point which is, perhaps, more vital than either of the two I have mentioned, and which was dealt  with  briefly by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is that Ave must have control of telecommunications so that in time of war our defence secrets shall not have to he passed through the open channels of communication, and thus be in danger of being picked up hy fifth-columnists and members of organized associations of various kinds hostile to this country and to" the Empire. I agree with' that  view.  That is one of the major reasons why all 'the governments within the. Empire should' solve' without delay the difficulty of open communications during Avar-time. This bill sets the scheme in" motion, and", as the 'Minister-inf ormed us in. his- second-reading speech", it will be followed by other' legislation in other parts of_ the world ' to- effect the same purpose. But one begins to think of other dangerous material which passes over our telecommunications, and wonders what will happen eventually to it. What control. - I detest the word " control "-can be exercised over the exchange of cables between, countries ? Suppose the Government is faced with a position such as that which occurred recently in connexion with the "Gibraltar affray", as we have come to know it. Since last week-end, beam and cable messages reaching this country reported a fracas in Gibraltar, in which the flower of Australian manhood who had served in World War II., including winners of the Victoria Cross. Distinguished Conduct Medal and Military Medal, were alleged to have been involved in a savage assault on the police of Gibraltar, It was said that there was a drunken 'brawl, and that Australians had, without provocation, so far as could be seen in the cabled report, attacked the Gibraltar police and instituted a veritable reign of terror on The Rock. </para>
                    <para>Asa former Australian serviceman and journalist, I should not let the Gibraltar affair ' pass without strong comment. First, as an ex-serviceman, I do not believe that Australian soldiers are capable of committing brutal and savage assaults. I do not believe that the picked men who formed our Victory Contingent would molest pedestrians. Certainly, our men got mixed up in a brawl, but strangers in a strange place must always stick together. That is the inevitability of the matter. I should like to know who started the trouble. The cables do not tell us. But I shall show honorable members in a few words just how telecommunications are endangered when rumours of this nature, unsubstantiated or. <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements, are made to the dismay of the whole of Australia. I do not care very much what the newspapers print about the matter, because the trouble has not yet been sufficiently investigated. I believe that an inquiry will prove that somebody tried to " put something over " our boys, and they <inline font-style="italic">resented it. Then the</inline> "somebody." called the police, who wanted to arrest 'some of our men -without bothering tb find out the rights and wrong3 of the matter. Knowing the Australian ser viceman's love of fair play and his <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps,</inline> I can understand that those would provide the ingredients of trouble. If some of our boys were being hauled off to the local calaboose, and their mates felt the injustice of it, I can imagine the call that would be made for a task force to release them. I think that the party of Australians were well outnumbered, and a " free-for-all " in those circumstances could hardly be called a " brutal and savage assault ". However, the incident has been lavishly featured in all parts of the world by the. anti-British and anti-Australian press. </para>
                    <para>The first news to reach Australia of  Friday night's affray left Gibraltar on Sunday. The expressions " Australians' disgraceful behaviour " and " brutal and savage - assaults by Australian servicemen " are those of Reuter's correspondent. The whole of the report, which painted the Australians as a mob of hooligans who, apparently, left the ship with the firm intention of getting drunk and wrecking the town, and which in not one place mentioned the possibility of provocation or any other extenuating circumstance, is the opinion of Reuter's correspondent. I emphasize that" point. Telecommunications are endangered in that way just as . they are in war-time. According to the correspondent, our men were involved in. a disgraceful and heartbreaking incident. They have not had an opportunity to defend themselves. Even the Government has not yet received an adequate reply from the officer commanding those troops. I am sure that he will present to us a more balanced story than the one which has been published. But the correspondent's story is the important matter. We must understand that this news having been sent to all parts of the world, it cannot easily be overtaken by a refutation. </para>

What I arn trying to point out, am i I am sure the honorable member would not desire me to do anything else, is that the use of telecommunications to spread a story which can never be overtaken by a contradiction is a savage and cruel thing. We must "apply ourselves to the ethics of the position, but I suppose that the only thing that the honorable member for Barker can understand is the closing down of a broadcasting station. The slower and more tortuous, but nevertheless more democratic way of ethics is the real solution of this problem. </para>

                    <para>Before I leave this subject, I desire to" emphasize the danger inherent in telecommunications. When the cable from. Renter's correspondent reached Australia, experienced journalists throughout the country would have remarked. "We must verify this information". But before that could be done, in at least two. newspapers, there was a Sunday morning " scare ". Our men, about whom we had been filled with  pride,  and whose deportment in London had been praised, were reported as figuring in a vulgar brawl. Some newspapers did not even seek to discover- the cause of it. That is the danger of telecommunications. The Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> set out to discover the facts and its banner head-line on Monday read, "No Gibraltar Riots". During the war newspapers lathered the troops with their oily praise, because they were a good source of advertisement; now, the whole Victory contingent has been libelled, and some newspapers did not attempt to ascertain whether the story was in accordance with the facts. Would not any Australian worthy of the name say, " This is a serious matter. It is a reflection on my country and on the flower of Australian servicemen. We must check back on the contents' of this cable, with a view to ascertaining the full facts ". But so debased and debauched have the sub-editors and others associated with a certain section of the press become, that they regarded this cable as a "good story". They were not concerned as to whether it defamed Australia; They were not limited to the busy men at the subeditor's desks, who might.be pardoned for saying, " Here is a good story. :&gt; We shall '.run it ' for what it L;&gt;worth, and see what' happens in later cables ". The Fairfaxes and Packers, in editorials, described the troops as an " unruly mob which terrorized Gibraltar ". </para>
                    <para>This matter is most serious. I have used this opportunity to direct attention to it because it involves our overseas communications. To the honorable member for Barker I say that the censorship of communications is furthermost from my mind"; but in establishing the commission, power must be given to control all the canards and libels which, .after they are released, can never be overtaken. The public are not interested in subsequent apologies. The drama of the first story is the thing which attracts the people. There is a technique in journalism with which some newspapers are fully familiar.  They know that after they have printed a story any subsequent apologies are read by only a small percentage of the people who had previously read the libel. T again emphasize the danger to the teleinternational communications system of leaving it open, to people who, in their hearts, have a feeling of savagery towards Australia. God knows that it is difficult enough to get the rest of the world interested in Australia. Some Australians are disposed to worry about what people in other countries think of them. When anything happens here, the first reaction of the newspapers is : " What will the world think of us?" I can answer that question. The world is not thinking about us at all, except when we have a bushfire, earthquake or something equally disastrous. Then it is featured by the press throughout the English-speaking world, as has been this story about the conduct of the Australian contingent at. Gibraltar. Because sections of the press have built up a bad psychology, the Australian serviceman is featured as a basher and a bully. </para>
                    <para>We have made a dramatic forward move in our communications system, which will- play an important part in our future life. We have decided to place this system under' a form of control which will be adequate, sincere, and Australian in outlook. We have decided to safeguard the people whom this legislation will displace from their jobs, and we have also considered the position of others who were remotely connected with the undertaking some- years ago; I hope that the Minister will see' that they too are brought under his protecting  mantle. The bill is evidence of the honest application that will be made by this Government to other huge problems which, like telecommunication, are related to national defence. The subject is so important that one could talk at great length about it, but it is so involved that to do so would perhaps be only boring. The measure has many aspects which require careful consideration, and I hope that, in the committee stages, we shall discuss them fully but without heat. Finally, I say that, if we cannot do anything to control messages transmitted over the telecommunications system, we can «at least draw world-wide attention to the ethics involved and have a gentlemen's agreement with other nations that telecommunications shall not be used to sabotage Australia or to defame Australia's fighting men. </para>

                        <para>. -  This bill represents the culmination of years of effort by every Postmaster-General who has held office since 192S. The Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference of 192S; which was attended by representatives of all Empire governments, was convened to examine the situation which had developed through the competition of the beam wireless service with the cable services, and to formulate recommendations for the adoption of a common policy in the sphere of Empire communications. In 1934, the then Attorney-General prepared a draft bill, under section 51 of the Constitution, providing for the cancellation of shares held by the Commonwealth Government and empowering it to acquire compulsorily, on fair and just terms, such assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited as would be needed to carry on the communications service. Therefore, the broad principles of this bill have the whole-hearted support of the Australian Country party. However, I draw attention to a matter about which, strangely enough, the Minister has been silent, namely, the amount of compensation and the conditions of payment of compensation to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for the assets that 'are to be acquired by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- 1 shall tell the House what I have been told. The authorized capital of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia.) Limited is £1,000,000, of which £984,000 is subscribed capital. Of this, the Commonwealth Government owns 500,001 fully paid £1 shares. Consequently, the Commonwealth's holding is equal to one-half plus one . £1 share. Amongst the many and varied activities conducted, by the company are commercial broadcasting,, manufacture of valves, wireless sets, parts, &amp;c, and overseas communications principally connected with- radio-telephone terminals. An analysis which I have made from the meagre information available shows that communications revenue represents more than 50 per cent, of the gross income of the company, and therefore the communication services are the most remunerative portion of its business. . These services are operated under licence from the Commonwealth, and for this virtual monopoly the company pays precisely nothing to the Government. Substantial reserves have been built up out of this communications revenue, despite the fact that the company has consistently paid dividends- varying between 10 per cent, and 12^- per cent. As has been .pointed out, communications form but one part of. the company's" business. This is the portion which- the Government .now intends to nationalize. On book values, the assets to be taken over are worth less than £500,000, and of these the Commonwealth Government owns just over one-half. Despite this, I understand that the Government, proposes to pay out about £1,400,000, or one and a half times the whole of the subscribed capital of the company, to private shareholders, plus some: thousands of pounds for company reconstruction costs. If these' figures- are not correct, the criticism which I shall  express will lapse. However, I understand that the amount to be paid for the acquisition of the half-interest held by private shareholders and Amalgamated Wireless, (Australasia) Limited is £.1,400,000. Although it is a half-owner, the Commonwealth will not share in one penny of this £1,400,000 pay-off, which I reiterate, is for only one portion of the business of a company with a subscribed capital of less than £1,000,000. I submit that a fundamental accountancy error has been made and that, assuming the high valuation to be correct, the private shareholders should have been paid only one-half of the amount, namely about £700,000. It must be understood that the privileges which this company has enjoyed over the years have cost it nothing. If the Government proposes to pay out the huge sum which I have mentioned, it must have received, very bad financial advice. </para>

                            <para>- If rivals know it, I suppose that it must be true. I also point out that none of the money that is to be paid out for this huge accretion of capital will be subject to tax. .No doubt the reserves will he retained substantially by the reconstructed company in which, admittedly, the Government is interested ito the extent of 50 per cent. However, private shareholders have an almost equal interest and they will benefit far more than the Government has done in the past.' The company has been heavily subsidized by the Government for operating coastal radio stations maintaining a ship-to-shore service. If these subsidies were set off against dividends received' by the Government, there is little doubt that the Government would be shown to have benefited by only a few thousand pounds in more than twenty years from its original investment of £500,000. The simple fact is 'that, if this legislation is enacted, the private shareholders of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited', apart from ; receiving dividends on double figures, will have returned to them more than five times their share capital in the communications service and will still retain a substantial share in the manufacturing and other activities of the company, at no further cost to themselves. The result undoubtedly will be that the company will be able to undercut further every competitive manufacturer and commercial broadcaster in Australia. Consequently, this legislation will establish a most insidious form of semi-private monopoly, which cannot be condoned merely because the Government will own a half interest in it. Before it is too late, an expert committee should' be appointed to make a complete valuation of the assets on a proper accountancybasis. There is every possibility that if this were done there would be a saving of the taxpayers' money amounting to between £500,000 and £750,000. There is no need for me to emphasize the necessity to effect every possible economy in'1 governmental expenditure, 'in 'order that the. taxpayers may be given the maximum relief. This is demanded by considerations which affect the economy of Australia. Over-capitalization, through the purchase of these assets at an 'abnormally high price will have unfair international repercussions. The Commonwealth will still have to purchase .deepsea cable channels on Australian terri.ory from the Government of the United Kingdom, when that Government takes over the assets of Cables and Wireless Limited. The overall agreement which forms the first schedule to the bill has been so drawn that the resultant over-capitalization will react unfairly against the Australian taxpayer and against other national corporations which are to be established in the United Kingdom, the Dominions, and India. It has to -be remembered that Australia has to enter into a partnership with the United Kingdom and other units of the British Commonwealth, including India. If there be over-capitalization by virtue of the acquisition of our share of the pool on an unsound basis, we shall not be " playing the game " with our partners in the all-embracing scheme which the bill envisages. For this reason, also, the scrupulous care which a panel of experts alone could ensure, is necessary in the determination of asset values. Consequently, I urge the Government, in fairness to the other Dominions and to the taxpaying public of Australia, to adopt the suggestion that has been made. If my information is incorrect, my criticism will be pointless. But the House and the country must be given exact knowledge of the circumstances under which the Government is to acquire a halfshare in only, one of the five activities of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The Minister should make that explanation in no uncertain terms and, if .he can do so, justify the conditions that are to be attached, to the proposed acquisition. </para>

                        <para>.- This measure is of tremendous importance to the people of Australia. As the Minister for Immigration and Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> stated in his second-reading speech, and as the hill provides, the agreement is one between the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, India, and Rhodesia. It covers practically the whole of the British Commonwealth. I do not know of any legislation placed before this Parliament which has had such wide ramifications and implications. I take it that the operating company is to be adequately compensated. Indeed, if we accept the statement of the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is to be more, than amply compensated for the  assets that are to be acquired. The adoption of an anti-Australian view in regard to the problems of Australia and their solution seems to be commonplace among members of the Opposition. The Leader of the Australian Country party has just given us a demonstration of it. It may be argued that the proposed compensation for the assets that ' are to be acquired is too high. That, however, is a matter which can be decided only after investigation and assessment by competent persons. I accept the assurance of the Minister that the employees referred to by the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> will be properly protected and compensated. These may be regarded as the domestic aspects of the transaction. There is a much broader aspect. The bill provides that the assets of the operating company shall be acquired by the nation. An agreement is to be made between the countries I. have mentioned. </para>

                    <para>As previous speakers have pointed out, this subject was first canvassed as far back as 1926. In the intervening period, it has been considered by governments of all shades of political thought. The present La bour Government is once more making history. Ever since it has been on the treasury bench, it has tackled the internal and' external problems of Australia in a manner that has done credit to itself and given satisfaction to the people of this country. The bill is designed to deal mainly with communications within the British Empire. I should like the Minister, when replying to the debate, to state .what effect the termination of the agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited will have on the services that are now operated by that concern on behalf of the Postmaster - General's Department. These services increase its revenue, and concurrently add to the costs which have to be borne by the people who receive them. I have in mind the Flinders Island radio service, concerning which I have made representations to various Ministers over a period of years. A surcharge is levied on all telegrams to and from the island, and this imposes an unfair toll on the inhabitants of that isolated area who have had to use the service provided by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The injustice of the impost has been most apparent since the provision of a radio telephone service to the island. I should like to know what effect the termination of the agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited will have oh the people of that part of my electorate. Will the Postmaster-General's Department be able to control entirely its own business to that and other remote localities? Will the surcharge be removed, and will the residents of the island be placed on « basis similar to that of the great majority of the people of Australia ?  The bill seeks- -to give effect to an agreement that has wide ramifications. Australia has everything to gain and nothing to .lose by the Empire agreement -for which the measure provides.

The reasons actuating the Government in terminating this agreement, and the events that have led up to the introduction of this" bill, have been set out fully and clearly by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> in his speech on the second reading. Honorable members, therefore, are in a position to discuss the bill on its merits. </para>

In short, the bill proposes to nationalize the -oversea telecommunication' services of the Commonwealth. Honorable members will, however, note that the control of these services by the Commonwealth is limited by its partnership in an Empire commission, or conference, in which the Governments of Britain and the other Dominions have representation with voting power proportionate to their interests.

                    <para class="block">I do not propose to deal, except in a very general way, with this unified Empire plan, which all the responsible governments of the Empire have accepted in principle, and which, subject to ratification by their respective parliaments, will bc effectuated in due course. No useful purpose can be served by criticism of the underlying principles of a plan to which all the governments of the Empire are committed - and which, in view of the state of parties, is assured of ratification in this Parliament. I expressly re frain too from commenting on the criticism by the leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Fadden)</inline> of the terms and conditions of purchase of the interests of the private shareholders in the company, for the good and sufficient reason that, speaking as a director of the company, to the best of my knowledge and belief, these have not yetbeen settled. But about the termination of the 1922 agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, the events that led up to it, and the operations of the company, I feel that a more detailed review is called for. Let me remind the House that I was not only .a signatory to the agreement which this bill terminates, but also the man responsible for submission to the Parliament of the proposal to establish direct Empire wireless service. </para>
                    <para>Let me review briefly the events that led up to its establishment. Believing-, as I have always done, that the British Empire was a great living force, standing for liberty and peace, and that its strength depended upon the unity of its widely scattered parts, I submitted a motion to the Imperial Cabinet in 191S for such improvements in the means of communications as would ensure this. unity without limiting the plenary rights of the self-governing nations that composed it. We live in troublous but wonderful times, when revolutionary changes are the commonplace of our lives. In the years that have passed since World War L, the means of communication have made amazing progress. This applies to none more than to telecommunications. In 1918 wireless was in its infancy. In Australia it was confined to a- limited coastal service which the Government maintained and on which it was losing some £60,000 a year. The need for greatly improved means of communication had been brougHt home to the governments of the dominions during the first World War. They had been told of things the British Government intended to do - long after these had been* done, aud when nothing remained for the dominion governments but to accept them. </para>
                    <para>Our technical right to have an effective voice in shaping foreign policy had been proclaimed by Britain. We had been  accorded equal status with, the Government of the United Kingdom; but in practice, owing in many cases to the difficulties arising »out of our geographic circumstances, the voice of the dominions was no more than a belated echo of the policy which Britain had already  imple-  merited. In 1918 my motion, strongly advocating such improvements in communications as would ensure the unity of the Empire and give to the dominions an effective voice in shaping foreign policy, was debated by Cabinet at length and unanimously approved, but the Peace Treaty having been signed, dominion Prime Ministers returned to their homes before any steps could be taken to give effect to. its recommendations. However, when the 1921 conference met, it had before it the Norman scheme for the establishment of a system of wireless communication between the United Kingdom and various parts of the Empire. This scheme provided for a relay service from stations 2,000 miles apart, of which Australia was the most distant. I strongly opposed the scheme. Speaking on the subject in this House on the 7th December, 1921, I said that under the Norman scheme of relays, there were delays due to congestion, priorities, handling, atmospheric disturbances, and on the top of this a yearly loss estimated at £20,000. The net effect of these disabilities would, have given us a service that compared unfavorably with cable communication. The loss on wireless services in Australia operating <inline font-style="italic">before the</inline> Commonwealth's adoption of the proposal for co-operation by the Commonwealth Government with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited was about £60,000 per annum - this is a conservative estimate and does not take into account interest on capital or depreciation - with these items taken into account the annual net loss was close to £75,000. The Norman scheme was to be controlled wholly by Great Britain and the various dominions and run by the British Postal Department: that is to say, the service would be controlled and run by Britain as the major partner, and Australia would have no control and very little in-' fluence over rates for messages to and from this country. I also said here, then you have a service which, at best, has no advantages over existing cable communications, the dominant share in the control of which will be in Britain and the other dominions, and on which we shall certainly lose £20,000 a year. </para>
                    <para>The other dominion representatives, or most of them, approved the Norman relay scheme, but I obtained from the then Prime Minister of Great Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, the right to submit a scheme to the Parliament of the Commonwealth for direct wireless .communication between Australia and Britain and other parts of the Empire. I made my report on the Imperial Conference to the Parliament in September, 1921, and in it I stated that the Government proposed to enter into an agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited to establish direct wireless communication between Australia, and Britain. The report set out the main points of the pro-, posed agreement. The House was divided in opinion; the Labour party wanted direct ownership and control by the Government whilst some non-Labour members favoured private enterprise. Eventually, on my motion, a committee was set up to investigate and report to the House upon the best form of agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The committee was fully representative of all parties, and was composed of six members of this House - two nominated by the Prime Minister, two by the Leader of the Opposition, and two by the Leader of the <inline font-style="italic">Country</inline> party - and three senators. Separate proposals were submitted to the committee, one by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and two by the Radio Communication Company of London. The committee, after an exhaustive inquiry, reported - </para>

                    <para class="block">For the purpose of this discussion it is not necessary to deal with any of the alterations proposed by the committee other than that which provided for representation of the Commonwealth and the company on the board of directors. Under  theagreement as originally drafted, the Commonwealth had been entitled to three directors and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)Limited to four directors. The committee recommended that the Commonwealth and the company should each have three directors and that  a  seventh director should be chosen by the other six. After some discussion this was approved by the Parliament, and in duo course the Government executed the agreement. The new company was formed with a capital of £1,000,000, in £ 1 shares, of which the Commonwealth held 500,001 and the private shareholders 499,999 shares. I ought to add that following  a  refusal by the Government to accept a former director of the company as the seventh director, I offered to actin that capacity, if Parliament approved my doing so. No objection being raised, and the private shareholders having approved my appointment, I took my seat on the board. I have continued  as  seventh director ever since. </para>

Quite apart from the agreement, the proposal to launch out into the unexplored field of wireless was denounced as premature, reckless and doomed to failure. But the experience of years has splendidly vindicated the scheme, which ensures the co-operation of the initiative, resources and administrative capacity of private enterprise with the stabilizing and protective influence of the Government as a majority shareholder. It has been a wonderfully profitable investment.

                    <para class="block">The public has benefited greatly from reduced charges as well as from better facilities. Before beam wireless communications were established, 2s. 6d. a word was charged for messages to the United Kingdom, but under the scheme that charge was reduced to1s. 3d. a word to all parts of the Empire which formerly were not reached by direct communication from Australia, and charges for other classes of communications also were reduced correspondingly. For instance, the charge for press messages, which in 1927 was 4d. a word to the United Kingdom, was reduced in 1946 to1d. a word to any address within the British Empire. In 1938 new social greeting messages were sent at a charge of 5s. for twelve words, whilst during the war special messages to and from servicemen were sent at a flat rate of 2s. 6d. for each message. The effect of the scheme upon employment was marked ; it opened new avenues of industry which absorbed large numbers of our people. The number of employees in the company increased from 420 in 1922 to 6,000 in 1944. It is now about 5,000. </para>
                    <para>In peace, and in war, the scheme has given to Australia a service which compares favorably with that available in any country in the world. The company has given the country a most efficient service, pioneered many technical improvements, amply protected the public from exploitation, reduced its rates and provided many valuable facilities to service personnel and to the general community. The agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has been a most profitable investment for the Government; as a highly successful business enterprise its record speaks trumpettongued. </para>
                    <para>The Government has decided to terminate the agreement under which the wireless services have been opera ted and controlled for nearly a quarter of a century.

Amongst the employees of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited are several blind ex-servicemen who, through the sympathetic cooperation of the management of the company, are being rehabilitated in industry, and thus enabled to do a useful job for the nation and to live more in accordance with the standards of more fortunate citizens. It is indeed pleasing to find this organization taking an interest in the welfare of men who suffered injuries during their service with the armed forces." </para>

                    <para>By introducing this measure, Australia, is taking early action to ratify the Empire Telecommunications Agreement, and a point of interest is the effect that ratification of the agreement will have upon the manufacturing side of the activities pf Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. As honorable members no doubt are aware, more than 50 per cent, of the products of this organization are absorbed in the telecommunication section. The loss of this outlet for Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited products could have serious effects upon the company, but it is gratifying to know that an assurance has been given by the Minister that the rights of employees of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited will be safeguarded. The bill provides specific protection for employees in the telecommunications section of Amalgamated Wireless  (Australasia) Limited who have had three or more years' service, and I understand that those with even less service will not suffer by the passage of this measure. </para>
                    <para>The telecommunications section of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has been the main support of the organization's research laboratory by providing a ready market for the equipment produced. The laboratory with its staff of 800 'has been able to "produce equipment of a standard not excelled anywhere in the world, and I hope that under the new arrangement provision will be made for the granting of preference to the products of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited which can be used by the new telecommunications organization.  The government should put Australian products before imported articles. It is our responsibility to ensure that the equipment produced by this great establishment, that has been built up over the years, shall find a ready market. There should be some guarantee that the research laboratory will be able to continue the work which, in the past, has done so much to keep wireless development in Australia abreast of pro- ,gress in other countries which perhaps have a greater scientific background, and are able to devote much more money to research. </para>
                    <para>I understand that arrangements have been made for that work to continue. It is vital that the manufacturing side of the activities of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited should not suffer as the result of the loss of control of telecommunications, and I hope that a liberal preference will be extended to the products of this Australian organization so that loss of employment will not result and valuable experimental work may be carried on, I know that the position has, in a large measure, been safeguarded in the agreement, which is a further indi- ' cation of the concern of the Government for the welfare of those engaged in Australian industry. </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> said that the Government had been too liberal regarding the compensation which it had agreed to pay to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and he cited certain figures in support of his argument. I do not know where he got those figures, nor whether they are correct; but he claimed that the Government was proposing to pay about twice as much as it should, and he added that a select committee should be set up to review the matter. It is realized that the fixing of compensation in a case of this kind is a ticklish business, but it seems to me that the right honorable member failed to take into account the fact that the company had certain long-standing rights of an irrevocable kind, and the fact that the Government was able to negotiate successfully speaks volumes for the manner in which the representatives of the company met it. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> who is also Treasurer, would not idly throw away in compensation twice as much as was necessary, just for the sake of nationalizing an industry. Considering the assets of the company, and the rights which it possessed, it is somewhat surprising that it accepted so little. I am convinced that the new arrangement will not have a detrimental effect upon the progress of the company, or upon employment. The spirit of co-operation evinced by those associated with the company has helped the Government to conclude arrangements much sooner than if the matter had been fought out in court. The Government has protected the rights of employees, and has arranged for the payment of compensation acceptable to the company, and the whole matter has been carried through without material interference with the manufacturing rights of the company. </para>
                    <para>It was pleasing to note that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> for once agreed that certain enterprises ought to be nationalized, in the interests of the defence of the country as an example. I hope that in time he will .realize that the coal-mines,' the airlines, and all forms of communication should be also nationalized in order to make the country secure. </para>
                    <para>I hope that, before long, this agreement will be ratified by the parliaments of all the Dominions, and that the new arrangement will prove to be as successful as its sponsors expect. I also hope that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, operating under the agreement, will be . as successful in the years to come as it has been in the past. I foresee a great future for the company and Australian industry, and an opportunity for the improvement of telecommunications. </para>

                        <para>.- .The honorable member who has just resumed his seat is full of abounding hope. He hopes for this and he hopes for that. He praises Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, which has been condemned because his own Government proposes to sabotage it. He hopes that the  employees of the company will find other employment. I hope so too. I pay tribute to this company, which has done such excellent work  over the years. Under the bill, it is proposed to take over all cable and wireless communications, to place them under government management and ownership, and, by ratifying the London agreement of August, 1945, to make it apply throughout the Empire. The Minister for. Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> has traversed the history of the negotiations fairly enough. The matter concerns us closely in Australia because it is proposed to take over the assets of the companies which have maintained cable services, and to re-organize Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, a company owned partly by the Government and partly by private shareholders, the Government having a controlling interest to the extent of one share. By that arrangement there was an attempt to get the best of two forms of .control - to get the initiative and incentive of private control, plus all the resources of the Government. The same was done in the case of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. The organization of those two companies represented an attempt by the Government many years ago to follow a middle course,  and experience proved it to be successful. In listening to the paeans of praise which have been sung about this new arrangement we are apt to overlook some of the possibilities inherent in it. The speech of the Minister who introduced the bill contains this passage- </para>

It represents another step in the direction of the Government's objective of socialization. While it is true that the agreement was framed at a conference in London, it so happens . that it was entered into at a time when there was a Socialist government in Great Britain, a Socialist government in New Zealand and a Socialist government in Australia. Naturally, they got together and drew up this agreement. There is a trend towards government control of communications and transport, but government" control does not necessarily mean government ownership. There is a great distinction between the two. The interstate airlines of Australia could be controlled by the Government without ownership, but the Government contemplates ownership in addition to control. Would the Government pursue that to the end and take over every form of transport and communication? </para>

I do agree that there are degrees of socialism. The doctrinaire socialists, the fanatics who want to make a bureaucrats' paradise where every one is a servant of the Government, exist on the Government side. I do not think all honorable members opposite are as extreme. as that. Judging by his questions, I do not think the Minister would try to socialize everything. For example, motor transport is in the hands  of private enterprise. It employs more persons than all the Australian railways. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member did. I was present throughout, his speech. He said he was a. former journalist and that, he knew, all about the newspapers. It does not matter what the newspapers report, because their opinions differ, but we have a public that should be able to discriminate. This is not Russia, Germany, or Italy, but if we had the world that these people are looking for, where " every message was scrutinized by the Minister or one of his minions, we should be moving towards a socialistic state. In that domain the Communist can live. There is good in this proposal, but it must be carefully watched by those who value individual freedom, the freedom of the press, and who think private enterprise should flourish side by side with government enterprise. The Government should not be allowed to usurp everything. </para>

The. biggest organization involved in this amalgamation is Cable and Wireless Limited, a. British corporation. Every one who has travelled knows how efficient it is. Like the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, it has conducted extensive" research. It was to the forefront in the development of radar. It operated a television service in 1938, and Baird, whose death was recently reported, invented and made great improvements in television under the auspices of this private company, which has been sponsored by the British Government for many years. </para>

                        <para>This  great communications company  which  lias been built up over a period of 80 years has established itself throughout the world, has shown unquestioned efficiency and enterprise in serving the community, in the Empire in particular and the world in general and has become the largest communications system in the world and the envy of others. What then is the reason why it is to be disintegrated and its control passed to the hands of the respective governments? The answer to this question, we are told, is that some of the Dominions desire more control. We do not cavil, at that and we believe the situation could have been met where there is such demand by other means, without jeopardizing the system as a whole. With its long and successful experience, one would have thought the company might have been invited to make suggestions to this end. </para>

It has introduced .many cheaper classes of messages including social messages and has reduced the Empire press rate to a penny a word. We do not' desire unduly to emphasize actions taken by the company during the war purely on grounds of humanity. Namely, free messages monthly between parents and children overseas separated by evacuation; free messages for prisoners of war and for those engaged in battle on the seas. But these are some of the things which we have been proud to do for the benefit of the community. I venture to think it might, have been very difficult for governments to do these things without parliamentary authority and consequent delay. </para>

We should hesitate before too readily giving full powers to the Government. I believe in government control in tried instances, hut not the general control envisaged by those who would socialize everything until every member of the community became the servant of the State.

Yet today the postage charged  for  sending overseas a food parcel weighing 7 lb. is 3s. 7d. If a parcel happens to weigh a few ounces over the 7 lb. - and many housewives find it difficult to keep to the exact weight - the charge is raised to os. 10d., or the equivalent of no less than £60 a ton, which in some cases would be considerably more than the value of the goods despatched. If. such a charge were levied by private enterprise, the Prices Commissioner would very quickly intervene. Socialists who so fanatically believe that excellent results freely follow from government control should scrutinize these things. Let us not take it for granted that because the Government has unlimited funds it  must  be capable. of conducting the telecommunications service efficiently. I sound a note of warning about this proposal to sabotage a great Australian company, Amalgamated . Wireless (Australasia) Limited.

It is tragic that a great Australian company with such a splendid record over the last two decades is now to be put out of a'ction.

We have to watch these experiments with great caution. We cannot do otherwise than subscribe to the agreement because it has been assented to by other Empire countries; but let us at least ensure that the rates fixed are fair and reasonable, that the service provided is efficient, and that the commercial, broadcasting and patent-holding rights of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited are preserved.

                            <para>- If private enterprise were handling - our postal business the rates charged would be considerably higher than they are at present. The Post- - master-General's Department is rendering a national service to the people and is conducted as efficiently as any business organization in the Commonwealth. At the commencement of his speech the honorable member suggested . that we should take a middle-of-the-road course, but after staggering about from one side of the road to the other in the first ten minutes of his speech he found himself in a ditch on the right side of the road securely bogged by his antiquated ideas of private enterprise and government ownership. I welcome the bill and I am pleased that the dominion governments have been able to reach an agreement under which they themselves will control telecommunication services. I remind the House that with the exception of the honorable member for Balaclava, people generally accept the view that the Postmaster-General's Department is under the correct form of control and ownership when it is controlled by the Government. The honorable member is the only person whom I have ever heard object to that form of control. The Postmaster-General's Department has undertaken the whole of the telecommunication system in the past, and no objection has been raised by- any section of this so-called "wonderful private enterprise "'to the government ownership and control of the system. The reason is not difficult to find. In the early days the system had to be conducted at a loss; and private enterprise is not prepared to engage in an unprofitable business. The profit motive is always present. At all times, profits must be obtained by private enterprise. -But this bill provides for the extension of that communications system to the whole of the British Empire. Because of that extension, I welcome the measure. Our cable system .between Great Britain and the Dominions is a' most important public utility, particularly in war-time. That fact was emphasized during World War II., when our beam wireless could not be used for the transmission of the most important messages between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions, and the cable system had to  be employed. That system, being essential, must be preserved. If it is to be maintained in the best interests of the whole of the people of the British Empire, it must be owned and controlled by the respective governments before we can get the full value of it. </para>

                    <para>I propose now to examine .briefly the history of this intra-empire communications system. Prior to the introduction of overseas beam wireless, we depended for our communications upon our cable systems. But beam wireless proved to be much cheaper and the cost of upkeep much lower, with the result that the cable companies could not compete with it. Nevertheless, it was essential, in the interests of the British Empire, that the cable system should be maintained. The honorable member for Balaclava recounted an impressive story about the efficiency and success of Cable and "Wireless Limited. If the honorable member, will examine the facts, he will discover that, with the introduction of beam wireless, Cable and Wireless Limited was not able to make profits. Whereas formerly it had been paying dividends of 6 per cent., its profits disappeared 'completely. </para>

I do not say that that assistance was not necessary,' and I do not criticize the policy of the British Government in providing it. I merely mention those facts to show that Cable and Wireless Limited, when conducted by private enterprise, could not compete successfully with beam wireless. Because of the essential nature of the service, the British Government had to come to its aid. A company which has received millions of pounds from a government, cannot be classed as a very successful business undertaking. Any business can carry on provided the Government makes available £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 to cover losses. </para>

                    <para>I shall now examine briefly the history of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) </para>
                    <para class="block">Limited. Because of the essential nature of wireless communications between Great Britain and the Dominions, a former Commonwealth Government - it was not a Labour government - considered that it was necessary for it to assume some responsibility for the control of our beam wireless system. Accordingly, a company was formed, with the Commonwealth Government as the principal shareholder with 500,001 shares. Private enterprise took 485,000 shares. The honorable member for Balaclava stated that the Commonwealth Government had a controlling interest in the company. So far as the number of shares was concerned, the Government undoubtedly had a controlling interest, but the agreement governing the establishment of the organization provided that private enterprise should have four directors and the Commonwealth Government three  direc-tors.  Although the Government's money was at stake, it virtually had no control in deciding the policy to be adopted by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The four directors representing private enterprise always outvoted the three directors representing the Commonwealth Government. Incidentally, those honorable members who were in the Parliament at the time may know the reason, but I have never been able to discover why the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is a permanent director of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I have not heard him give to this Parliament any; report of its transactions. Apparently, he may attend directors' meetings, and may have some voice in discussions; but if he attempts to decide the policy that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia ) Limited shall adopt, he is in the minority, because a former government, when entering into the agreement, gave to private enterprise the controlling interest in the company. </para>

I mention those facts because I believe that we should examine what has occurred in the past to enable us to ascertain how private enterprise has  managed these organizations. I emphasize the fact that when one of these companies experienced financial difficulties the British Government provided financial assistance in order to enable it to' remain in operation. If governments are anxious that these public utilities shall be continued, arid if, in the interests particularly df Empire defence, our cable systems are essential, I consider that the governments, which must ultimately provide the money to recoup losses, should have control of the organization. If a government accepts financial responsibility for the cable and wireless services between Australia and other countries, it is only natural that it should control such services. </para>

Perhaps the honorable member overlooked that fact, because he could not associate those governments with any form of socialism. </para>

                    <para>The bill, so far as it goes, is a very good one. It is another step towards the nationalization of all the essential services of the Commonwealth, and, as such, I particularly welcome it. Our communications systems require nationalization, but, in addition, I believe in and shall continue to advocate the nationalization of many other public utilities in the Commonwealth. I hope that during the life of the next Parliament we shall be able to nationalize quite a few more public utilities. </para>
                    <para>There are certain omissions from the bill. Clause 18 provides, among other things, that a person shall not be appointed to a clerical office in the service of the commission unless he has, in open competition, successfully passed the prescribed entrance examination. I agree that entrance to the service of any government instrumentality should be on merit, as disclosed in competitive examinations. But I do not think that the clause goes far enough. I ask the Minister to consider an amendment to provide for admission to other than clerical positions by means of competitive examinations.  This matter has been raised on previous occasions. The Commonwealth Public Service Act provides for the holding of competitive examinations for appointment to almost every position in the Commonwealth- Public Service. When the Commonwealth Bank Bill was before this Parliament, provision was made for entrance to the service of the bank, in almost every instance, by competitive examination. Under the Australian Broadcasting Act, provision is made for entrance to the service of the Australian Broadcasting Commission by competitive examination. When staff regulations were to be framed, the Australian Broadcasting Commission proposed that appointees to certain positions should, be selected by it rather than be chosen as the result of a competitive examination. The Broadcasting Committee recommended to this Parliament the amendment of those regulations to provide that in all instances, where possible, admission to the service of the commission- should be by competitive examination. This bill should be drafted in accordance with previous decisions of the Parliament. </para>
                    <para>There are other omissions from the bill. It should contain a provision for the constitution of a disciplinary appeal board similar to that which has been incorporated in the Commonwealth Public Service Act since 1922  -  an act that was brought down by an anti-Labour government. There is a similar provision in the Commonwealth Bank Act, and the inclusion of one in the staff regu- lations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission has been recommended. The staffs of all government instrumentalities should have similar conditions and equal treatment. Provision should also he made for the constitution of a promotions appeal board. Such a provision is included in the Commonwealth Bank Act, and last year was embodied 111 the Commonwealth Public Service Act. It is also being included in the staff regulations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The amendment of the bill as I have suggested would ensure the avoidance of all favoritism in connexion with appointments to and promotions in the service of the Overseas- Telecommunications Commission (Australia) ; and if it became necessary at any time to discipline any members of that service, they would bc assured of a fair trial and would have conditions at least as good as those which this Parliament has provided for the Commonwealth Public Service and for Commonwealth instrumentalities under its control. I commend the bill to the House. </para>
                    <para>Mi-. ARCHIE CAMERON  (Barker)  [9.16]. -  No man can serve two masters. I do not think that that statement has ever been better exemplified than it has been in the history of Amalgamated "Wireless (Australasia) Limited and the Commonwealth Oil Refineries -Limited. These companies, like the average half-caste, have the vices of both parents and the virtues of neither parent. It has been my lot, in peace and in war, to be somewhat closely associated as a Cabinet Minister with the activities of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. For five months in  1.93S-39,  T was Postmaster-General, and matters in connexion with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited came under by ministerial control. In  1940,  I presided over a Cabinet sub-committee which presented an unanimous recommendation that, the communications side of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited should be taken from it and vested in the Postmaster-General's Department, which was then under the ministerial control of the Honorable Victor Thorby. The history of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is a fairly long and lurid one. Its activities are of two separate types, one being in connexion with communica-tions and the other in connexion with manufacture. These are not interrelated. At some time in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament, certain franchise monopolies and powers were vested in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I am assured that they still exist. They are so strong and watertight as to prevent the Postmaster-General's Department from installing any telephone or wireless communications between the mainland and some islands off the Australian coast; for example, Magnetic and King Islands. Such communications can be installed only on such terms and conditions as Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited prescribes or permits. Such a franchise monopoly should not be accorded under Commonwealth law to any company, even a semi-governmental company. From what I have been told by men who know something about wireless matters, I believe that the equipment of this company does not compare favorably with similar equipment of even commercial broadcasting stations. Although I cannot cite the exact figures - I have asked the Minister to obtain, them for me - I can say that the charges imposed by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for ship to' shore and shore to ship communications were so high in comparison with those Qf other British companies that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ned</inline> Kelly would have hesitated to impose them. The sooner these communications are taken away from Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited the better find various governments have decided that that should be done. The monopoly which this company exercises extends over many things besides communications. It has certain monopolies, over patents, and. from investigations which I made as a Minister in  1939.  I was forced to the conclusion' that the manner in which some of the patents came into the hands of the company was questionable. </para>

                    <para>The bill has certain features which require investigation. I see no reason for setting up a commission to manage telecommunications. In 1940, a decision was made, admittedly shortly before the general elections, that these communications should be handed over to the Postmaster-General's Department. I believe that that is where they belong. Already 91 per cent, or 93 per cent, of the communications are in the hands of the department. The Minister has been delightfully inexplicit as to what the Government proposes shall be done with the reconstructed company. The Commonwealth should not have any shares in the company at all. Once the telecommunications have been handed over to a government authority, the company should then function only as a manufacturing concern. I recall certain observations of a former colleague of mine when referring to the difficult position ih which the Government was some-, times placed in connexion with patents, held and administered by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and carrying monopoly rights. There is the further matter of the company having commercial radio licences. The Government has the exclusive ownership of the national wireless broadcasting system operated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and &gt; should not be iri any .way implicated in the ownership or management of commercial wireless stations. I do not believe in nationalization as a principle, but I stand foursquare to the statement of that great Australian, who paid a brief visit to his homeland this year, the right honorable S. M. Bruce, that in modern civilization such amenities as communications, transport, water and light should be under the control of a public authority. </para>

                            <para>- That may be. The ownership of the shares in a company such as Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited should be fairly closely investigated by this Parliament, and a general rule should be laid down that an activity of this kind should be either 100 per cent, a government undertaking, or 100 per cent, a private enterprise.

                    <para> Some of those at present employed in cable and wireless services are fearful of their fate under the new arrangement. The Minister gave no clear statement of what the Government proposes to do with the employees. What he did say was that as many of them as could be provided with positions would be taken over. The Minister should go more carefully into this matter at the committee  stage than he did in his second-reading speech. The terms- of acquisition are of importance but we have not been told anything about - that worth hearing. I know that under the Constitution the terms must be neither harsh nor generous, but just. I have a recollection of having, as Minister, read something about the rights of monopolies in this country. A. former Attorney-General, who is now a member of the judiciary, laid down that a company that had acquired monopoly rights without payment was not entitled to any compensation for them. I am fearful of these matters when handled by a Labour administration, lest somebody may get a " pretty fair go " out of the Treasury in return for some shadowy concessions. The Leader of the Australian Country party presented a case which has not been answered, - and unless the Minister and the Government are prepared to meet the position as expressed by .the right honorable gentleman, and have a proper investigation made of what has been done in this matter, the Opposition will have to say a little more about, it when the bill is in committee. There should be a most careful and stringent investigation of what is to be done with the company. In a company in which over half of the capital is government owned', although the Government has never had one half of .the control of it, any profit derived ought to go to the Government in proportion to the amount of capital supplied by it. During the brief periods for which I held different portfolios, certain facts came to my knowledge, and unless my memory is seriously at fault, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has been subsidized from time to time, in respect of its communications by grants from the Commonwealth Government. I ask the Minister to produce the figures, in committee. </para>

                            <para>- The Government has three directors on the board of this company. I have no doubt that there exists a complete record showing every application made to the Government for a subsidy, and it should also show when share capital was called up. I think I can remember such a call being made while the Lyons Government was in office. Before we pay anything for alleged monopoly rights in communications we ought to know what the company paid the Government for those rights. In the first place,_ such rights belong to the people and to no one else, and only by the action of the Government could they be transferred to the company. Half the subscribed capital was provided by the taxpayers, and any compensation should be divided between the company and the Government in the same proportion. </para>

I am now asking for information which I believe is available on departmental files,' information which is vital to the proper consideration of this bill. We are entitled to know what money' was invested in the company, what subsidies were granted to it, what monopolies, franchises and privileges it received, and what it paid for them. If it. paid nothing, the company is not entitled .to sell them back to the true owners at a profit. Only by appointing a committee such as that suggested by the Leader of the Australian Country party can we get at the facts. Honorable members opposite speak of nationalization, and of protecting the rights of the people, but unless they are very careful they will find' that they themselves are helping to grease the fatted pig. We are now considering a measure under which it is proposed to purchase certain assets, more than half of which already rightly belong to the taxpayers of Australia. I will not consent to those assets being disposed of unless the interests of the taxpayer are properly safeguarded. Judging from the remarks of the Minister for Immigration, I should say that he knows less' about the history of this company and its operations than I do. </para>

He spoke at great length and in great detail of certain alleged events which may or may not have taken place at Gibraltar. I do not know whether the newspaper reports to which he referred were true or false. For my part, I hope that they were as false as Judas, but the honorable member said that stories of that kind should not be allowed to be sent over cables owned by a Commonwealth authority. I interjected to ask him whether he proposed to institute a  censorship in peace-time. I remember, during the lifetime of this Parliament, honorable members opposite waxing eloquent on the subject of freedom of speech. </para>

                        CAMERON.Spiritual censorship? Nonsense! We are going from bad to worse. The history of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited ought to be closely investigated. 1 know that in 1940, although the Government owned a majority of the shares, the company deliberately applied a policy hostile to the Government. Its tactics were destructive at a time when it ought to have been prepared to place all its assets and facilities at the disposal of the nation. A complete history of the company's operations- - and I can produce some of the facts - would show it up in a very bad light.

                        <para>.- Honorable members generally appear to lie in agreement that some control over telecommunications is necessary, but members of the Opposition, particularly the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> seem to have fears regarding the method of control proposed by the Government. The debate has made it clear that some honorable members fear the passing of this bill will injure Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in some way. I pay a high tribute to that company for the work that it has accomplished over the years; but, unlike the honorable member for Barker, I believe that all communications, whether by air, road, rail or sea, should he nationalized. More important still is the need for the nationalization of telecommunications. The honorable .member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> criticized the Government in connexion -with the railway from Goulburn to Canberra ; but I remind him that that railway existed long before the present -Government occupied the treasury bench. Does the honorable member know of any private company which would take over that railway ? " , </para>

It ill becomes any honorable member to speak  deprecatingly  of the people who elected this Parliament. The people of the United Kingdom have suffered great hardships during the war, but when given an opportunity to express their views at the ballot-box they returned a Labour government. There is no foundation for many of the fears of honorable members opposite. I foresee great developments in the future. We are not far off frequency modulation, television, facsimile and other methods of broadeasting, and when those improved methods are in use Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited will have its opportunity, because its technical service and its manufacturing capacity will be required. I am confident that that organization will not lose under this measure, because the new developments which I foresee will more than make up for any small losses in other directions. </para>

                            <para>- Labour governments were responsible for establishing the undertakings I have mentioned, but" non-Labour governments destroyed them. The Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers conferred great benefits on Australian primary producers, but a non-Labour government took the ships off their runs and employed them in places where they could* not pay. Later, the ships were practically given away, because it was said they were being run at a loss. The same thing happened to the Geelong Woollen Mills. Although they were operated at a profit, an unsympathetic government disposed of them to private enterprise. The honorable member for Wentworth also said that the former member for Henty, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coles,</inline> had been compensated for his support of the Government by being appointed  chairman  of another national service. He referred of course to the National Airlines Commission. I ask honorable members to consider for a moment the business experience of the former honorable member for Henty. </para>

The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> made some wild statements about the proposed compensation payments to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, but he did not give any authority for his figures. It is quite easy to make reckless statements without attempting to substantiate them. We know that this bill will be carried. I hope that before long the honorable member for Barker, who apparently entertains fears about nationalized undertakings, will have to admit that it is necessary for the building of a great nation, to have .its telecommunication services operated as a governmental instrumentality. </para>

                        <para>.- Recently I had conversations with employees of Cable and Wireless Limited at Southport, Queensland, which is the Australian terminal of the cable and wireless service between Canada and this country. These men are gravely concerned with their future under this proposal. Some of them came from Great Britain and have worked in this service in various parts of the world. To-day they are doing -a good job at Southport. I should like to know from the Minister whether their rights and privileges will be adequately preserved under this measure. I have discussed this matter with the Minister, and apparently he has not yet informed his mind fully on it. That is why I made this appeal to him. The men to whom I have referred would like an assurance of continuity of employment.They want to know if their seniority will be preserved, and if their leave and superannuation rights will be safeguarded. Some of them joined the service in Great Britain whereas others joined in Australia. Formerly the service was known as the " All Red 'Route ". The whole matter is seriously involved and the men are most concerned. Some of them joined the service upon leaving college and have  i  remained with it ever since. To-day they arc uncertain of their future, and I ask the Minister to clarify the position. They are specialists and are entitled to a clear statement of where they stand. I have examined this bill carefully, and have read clause 18 several times. It covers nearly three pages, and is full of "huts ", " mights " and " becauses ", and is further complicated by the fact that it is qualified by clause 23. I ask the Minister to give an unqualified assurance that the rights of these men are adequately safeguarded under this bill, or alternatively, to express his willingness to accept amendments to this end when the measure reaches the committee stage. </para>

                    <para>This debate has proved conclusively that there has never been a bill introduced into this Parliament that has contained more uncertainties than the one now before us. "Uncertainty as to the exact nature of the proposal, the amount of compensation to be paid, and many other important matters, is revealed by the numerous points on which information is sought. The Minister himself is not certain of many things, and I believe that the problem can best be dealt with by accepting the amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> and. postponing the measure until a thorough investigation of the proposal can be carried out. There  are many points that require clarification. We must know what we are doing and the people must know what the bill provides. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Adelaide referred at length to the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers and the Geelong Woollen Mills, Both of which, were government ventures. After the Government took-over the Coalcliff colliery, the cost of production rose from 24s. lOd. to 27s. 3d. a. ton. That fact clearly indicates that government control of industry breeds inefficiency and increases the cost of production. The Government's policy of the socialization  nf  industry will ruin the country. </para>

                        <para>. - . Negotiations with respect to taking over the telecommunications services of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia.) Limited date back to 1930. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Fisk represented the company in those discussions. I did not hear the remarks made to-night by some honorable members regarding these negotiations. The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> suggested that the Government should appoint a select committee to go into this matter. In respect of certain aspects of the rights held by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited it is most difficult to determine the basis- of payment, and I do not think that anybody realizes that fact more clearly than the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> I know that he and others had some doubt  a3  to what might happen should lengthy litigation take place concerning the acquisition of the telecommunications assets of that company. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> initiated negotiations to take over the telecommunications rights _ of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Campbell</inline> Stuart visited this country in the capacity of adviser to the British Government. At that time a proposal was made that the Commonwealth should come into the negotiations under a scheme whereby, by 1962, it would become the complete owner of the telecommunications services' of Amalgamated . Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and also acquire the rights of the Cable and Wireless Limited, in this country. As time went on other plans were evolved, one being known as the Anzac plan, which was not entirely acceptable to the then Coalition Government in Great Britain led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill.</inline> .1 understand that thai Government appointed a sub-committee of the British Cabinet to investigate the matter. Following a divergence of opinion, Lord Beith visited Australia and the other dominions in order to learn whether it was not possible to modify the Anzac plan. The proposal to acquire .the telecommunications services conducted by Cable and Wireless Limited, had been the subject of discussion in government circles in Great Britain for a considerable period, and,, finally*- as honorable members are aware, a decision was reached by which the British Government planned to take over all of those interests. In the early negotiations, with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Fisk, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> the Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> who was then Postmaster-General, and I devoted many weeks to see if a basis could be arrived at by which the telecommunications assets and. rights of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited could he acquired by the Government. I do not propose to Cover the details of the proposal then made, but I point out that portion of the agreement relating to Cable and Wireless Limited was not acceptable to that company, which was represented in those negotiations by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Wilshaw. Ultimately, that plan was abandoned. Later, the Coalition Government in Great Britain led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> took up the matter, and subsequently evolved a' plan for taking over telecommunications services throughout the Empire by the various governments. Later, the plan outlined by  the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline> in his second-reading speech, was adopted by all the dominion governments, including that of Southern Rhodesia. The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has had something to say about the socialization of industry. The fact is that all of those governments, some of which are very conservative, admit the need for controlling telecommunications services as a government owned utility. I was pleased to hear the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> admit this afternoon, without committing himself to the broad principle of nationalization, the wisdom of such a plan. He dealt with the subject very fairly, pointing out that particularly in time of war it was very desirable that telecommunications services be under government control. Eventually, when the Empire plan was decided upon, Australia as a party to the agreement was faced with the task of taking over the telecommunications rights of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The Leader of the Opposition knows of some of the incalculable factors in any attempt to assess the- value of the rights held by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. It lias been said that certain of those rights are interminable ; and it has been "nobody's guess " as to what might be done with regard to compensation, or what, litigation might ensue upon failure to reach agreement. In the original agreement, it. was proposed to acquire the rights of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited at a cost of approximately £1,250,000. Certain conditions were stipulated. The agreement was to operate till 1962. I am speaking now from memory. I did not anticipate that any suggestion would be made that any expenditure involved in this matter might be challenged as a misuse of the taxpayers money. I have had the advantage of participating in all of these negotiations during the last fouf  years; and trying to solve the particular problem of assessing the value of the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. Some people would say that the old agreement was fairly generous, whilst others would say that if the matter were taken to court no one could possibly guess the figure at which the company's rights .might be assessed. Some have said that it would be an astronomical figure. A considerable time ago we again resumed negotiations, having in mind the Empire agreement. I was rather sorry that the matter of cost was raised, because the House will have the opportunity later to discuss that phase of the matter. After all, the private shareholders are entitled to ask that the negotiations be not discussed in detail until their representatives have had -the opportunity of putting the proposed agreement before the board of directors of whom the right' honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is one. </para>

I was surprised to hear some one say that I, as Treasurer, am a generous fellow. That is a departure from the usual charge against any . treasurer. I have ,taken an active part in the negotiations, and I say that it -is difficult to assess just what is fair compensation for the private shareholders' rights in the telecommunications side of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I have spent many hours as a member of the Cabinet sub-committee in dealing with this matter. We did reach a possible agreement which has to be submitted to the directors aud, I presume, the representatives of the private shareholders and finally to the shareholders themselves. The general manager of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hooke,</inline> and I discussed, the matter in consultation with- qualified accountants from the Treasury of equal standing to any in private life. I do not propose to go into the figures in the agreement, because I do not think that would be fair to the people associated with Amalgamated </para>

I have been informed by the Minister for Trade and Customs that the prices of petroleum products are continually under review by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner and those prices are periodically adjusted in accordance with changes of actual costs. I anr informed that the recent trend of costs has been downwards, and this trend, if maintained, should be reflected in due course in lower prices. </para>

                        <para>Has the Prime Minister any information concerning the completion of the memorial to Australian servicemen being erected by the Brittish War Graves Commission in Tobruk?  If  the memorial has been completed have any plans been made for Australian representation at its unveiling, and if no decision has yet been made will the right honorable gentleman consider the claims of representatives of the Rats of Tobruk Association to attend theunveiling? </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Reports received last year from representatives of the Imperial War GravesCommission indicated that the memorial erected by Australian troops in the cemetery is marred by surface cracking and if allowed to remain in its present form will deteriorate further. In addition to the gradual deterioration of the memorial, its position is off the established axis of the central path on which it stands. After, full consideration of the position, the Commonwealth Government hasapproved the replacement of the existing memorial with one of a permanent nature at a cost of approximately £1,000 sterling. The approved design prepared by the principal architect of the Imperial War G raves Commission retains the  essential  character of the existing memorial. It is not expected that the permanent memorial will be completed for at least another six months, but advice is now being sought from the commission as to the probable dato of completion. When this information is to hand it will be conveyed to the honorable member for Parkes. To date no request has been received by the Government from any of the branches of the Bats of Tobruk Association for representation at an unveiling ceremony. Any such application will receive consideration when the memorial is nearing completion in the light of conditions then existing. </para>

                    <para>Australia is entitled to reparations from Germany in conformity with the terms of the Potsdam Declaration of August, 1945. This declaration allocates to the Allied Nations, excluding the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Poland, 75 per cent, of the removals from the Western zone. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Poland are to receive 25 per cent, from the Western zone in addition to the removals from  the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics zone. German external assets also, are to be appropriately allocated. The listing of German plants, equipment, and general items available for the payment of reparations is in the banda of the Allied  Control  Council. As yet this authority has not completed its task of selecting factories for reparation, and so no official estimate  of  the total value is available. Australia is a signatory to the Reparations Agreement drawn up by- the Paris conference of December, 1945. This agreement divides the 75 per cent, of the reparations from the Western zone into two categories: (a) industrial capital -equipment and merchant shipping, of which Australia is to receive 0.95 per cent.;. (b)  all other items, including Germany's external assets (excluding gold), of which Australia is to receive 0.70 per cent. As yet there  is  no clear indication of the value of Australia's share in reparations. Though these percentages appear small and are no adequate measure of the burden of war on Australia, or of its contribution to victory, it must be remembered: (a) that Australia is but one of eighteen claimant countries; (b) that these include several European countries which suffered such severe material damage at the hands of Germany that they must rely largely upon German reparations for even partial restoration of their pre-war economy. To date, twenty German industrial plants have been listed for allocation by the Inter-Allied Separations Agency, and negotiations for their allocation commenced on the 1st  July.  Australia lodged claims for electro-generating power plants and a selection of machine tools in urgent demand and unavailable from other sources. Whilst Australia has a wide variety of industries in urgent need of plant  and  equipment, it is necessary to give first consideration to such items as will be of the widest benefit to the country. This is particularly necessary in view of the relatively small total  value  of reparations  that will be allocated to Australia. </para>

                        <para>  -  On the 21st June the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) asked a question regarding the alleged resignation of certain members of the War Crimes Defence Section in Tokyo. </para>

                    <para>The present trial is being held before an international tribunal of distinguished judges, appointed by the Supreme Commander, and its conduct accords with due standards of international justice and equity. The indictment of the accused was drawn up by an international board of prosecutors, and its findings arc the result of a prolonged and exhaustive inquiry into the available evidence relating to the possible war guilt of former leaders of military, political and economic life in Japan. The indictment was lodged with the international tribunal on the 29th April last and the defendants were arraigned before the court on the 3rd May. A month's adjournment was then granted to enable the counsel- to prepare the defence, and the tribunal reassembled - on the 3rd June. Concerning the reported  resignation of certain, of the defence counsel, I can now advise the honorable member that six members of the original American defence counsel assigned by General Head-quarters recently resigned. The circumstances were that additional American counsel were engaged in the United States of America during the preparation of the defence and, arising from a failure to agree on matters connected with conduct of the defence, certain members of the original group resigned. The honorable member will appreciate that these resignations in no way prejudice continued observance of the principle that the accused must have access during the trial to defence counsel. </para>

                    <para>The Postmaster-General, has supplied the following answer:-</para>
                    <para>The need for augmenting the telephone facilities between the mainland  and Tasmania  is fully recognized by the Post Office and work is now in hand to provide additional channels. It is expected that within the next two or three months two extra circuits will be provided in the Bass Strait submarine-cable, making a total of seven circuits available by that means, whilst four additional channels will he brought into service on the radio link. The two existing part-time radio channels will be converted to full-time operation and a total of six full-time radio channels will then be in service. The total number of circuits between the mainland and Tasmania will therefore be increased from five full-time and two part-time to thirteen full-time channels in all. The extra facilities should enable a satisfactory service to be rendered to the public. </para>
