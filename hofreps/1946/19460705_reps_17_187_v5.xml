Periodically for many years, representations have been made for the working of a second shift in the coal-mining industry, not only in connexion with underground operations but also in open cuts, but it has not been possible to reach an agreement on the matter. Discussions are proceeding at the present time. I shall have a further talk with the Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKell,</inline> in regard to it. </para>

                        <para>- A bill will be introduced during the present sittings to provide for the payment of a bounty on raw cotton for five years from the 1st January, 1947. The Raw Cotton Bounty Act will expire on the 31st December, next. The Tariff Board investigated the cotton-growing industry and made certain recommendations, but the Government decided that more generous treatment should be given to the industry than was recommended by it. The Queensland Cotton Board was consulted, and I am assured that it is satisfied that what the Government is doing is in all circumstances a generous measure of assistance to the industry. I remind the honorable gentleman that in 1940, when the previous legislation was introduced,, the Government of Queensland agreed to carry out water conservation and irrigation schemes in order that cotton might be grown under irrigation. The under-production of cotton in Australia will not be overcome until we transfer the growing of cotton from the dry farming to the irrigation areas. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Where cotton has been grown on irrigation areas, the production per acre has been trebled. I assure the honorable gentleman that the proposals of the Government will give most generous treatment to cotton growers, and will have the approval of the overwhelming majority of them. In my opinion, the bill will be hailed with satisfaction throughout Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- For the diagnostic treatment of sufferers from tuberculosis, the Commonwealth Parliament agreed to provide an amount of ##£##50,000 per annum, and the States will subsidize it on a ##£##1 for ##£##1 basis. The act provides also for the payment by the Commonwealth of ##£##50,000 a year, which the States will subsidize on a ##£##1 for ##£##1 basis, for aftercare treatment. The amount of ##£##250,000 per annum, which will be granted to the States, is designed to relieve families in necessitous circumstances as the result of the breadwinner having contracted the disease and being compelled to enter hospital for treatment. The exact- details of the organization - probably it will be the welfare departments of the States - which will determine what are necessitous cases and the assistance that shall be granted to them, has still to be considered by the State authorities. At the moment I cannot give any undertaking in regard to income tax concessional deductions. Legislation is being prepared in connexion with the coal-mining industry in which it will.be proposed that the delegated authority to be set up shall be enabled to take general steps in regard to dust prevention and diseases arising therefrom. I cannot say any more just now on the subject of special payments. </para>

                <para>Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn officially to an anomaly created by the recently, issued National Security (Female Minimum Rates) Regulations. Complaints have been made to me that under the regulations instances have occurred of subordinate members of domestic staffs in mental hospitals in New South Wales receiving higher emoluments than their supervising officers, and that it is impossible to correct this anomaly because wage-pegging provisions prevent the granting of additional payments to such supervisors. As the Commonwealth is involved in both phases of the question, I ask whether steps will be taken to consult with the State authorities with a view to the correction of the obvious anomaly?

                        <para>- The Victorian division of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation arranged some time ago to collect from its members quantities of dripping for despatch to Great Britain. A total of 10 tons was accumulated. The question then arose whether, as this was a voluntary gift, a contribution should be made to the tallow equalization fund. The matter came before the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, who wrote to the federation on the 1st May that##"## he would give an immediate decision. As no decision had apparently been made by the end of that month I sent the honorable gentleman a telegram, dated the 30th May, asking for a speedy announcement. I have had no acknowledgment of that telegram, and, so far as I know, a decision has not yet been made. I now ask the Minister whether this is typical of the delays associated with such transactions, and whether he can tell me when a decision may be expected? </para>

                            <para>- I have given many rulings on this matter. The Standing Orders clearly lay down that no debate may be introduced when a question is being asked or answered. That necessarily embraces debatable matter of which a person who is not a member of this House is the author. The introduction of such matter would clearly be an evasion of the Standing Orders. An honorable member may refer to a press article or any other matter, but  in  doing so he must give only the bare substance of it and not quote from it extensively. I rule that the question is entirely out of order. </para>

                        <para>. - The bill before  the  House is one to establish a national university at Canberra. As I propose, in the course of  a  few brief remarks, to offer criticism of some aspects of the proposal, it is only fair that I should begin by complimenting the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> on his -interest in the problem of higher education, and the action he has taken from time to time during the last few years, particularly in respect of universities. I, for one, have the warmest regard for his approach to these matters and the work that he has been able to do.  I  say that at once, so as to indicate that any of my , criticisms will be in no sense merely factious.  </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The second thing that I should like to say is that I strongly support all sound extensions of facilities for higher learning, tt follows from that, that my desire *is to see further universities established in Australia from time to time. There can be no doubt that the existing Australian universities are grossly overcrowded, and that that condition of overcrowding means very much reduced efficiency and may, unfortunately, lead in some instances to falling standards in the university itself. I know that in the University of Melbourne, which in my time had, I think, something like 1,500 undergraduates, there are now 6,000 or 7,000 undergraduates. An even more remarkable story of growth could##'## be told about the University of Sydney. All of these exist ing institutions, which have reached high standards by world measurement, are suffering because they have crowded classrooms and grossly overworked staffs. When there is a combination of those two things, the best aspects of university work are bound to suffer. Therefore I, for one, favour very much the seizing of the opportunity to establish new universities as the occasion offers. But when I say that, I should like to emphasize the point that, although new universities may be essential, what is even more essential is that standards should not only be maintained but also improved from year to year. There could be no worse contribution to the scholastic life, or, indeed, the general social life, of Australia, than the establishment of secondrate universities in addition to first-rate universities. A second-rate university would do a great deal of harm. </para>
                    <para>The next point that I want to make is that we cannot establish a first-class university merely by passing an act of parliament or by the provision of money, though each of those things is, of course, completely essential. A considerable investigation is required, and very great preparation is needed, before a university can be established. I believe that in establishing a university we need to have,##'## in the first instance, a clear notion in our minds as to precisely the function that the university is to perform, and the place that it is to occupy in the total University structure of the nation.##'## If, for example, as in the case of Canberra, the university is to be established in a remote and small community - and Canberra is both remote and small in the sense in which I am using those words - great thought is required as to whether it ought to be an undergraduate university at all ; whether it should not begin its life as a post-graduate university, and if so, whether it should confine its activities in th##'##e first instance to those matters which lend themselves particularly to study in a community of the kind in which it will be established. If this is to be an undergraduate university, then I suggest that one of two things will follow: either it must become primarily a residential university, so that it may attract students from all over Australia  - and that will give rise to its own  prob##'##lems  in Canberra - or, it will cater inevitably for only a small proportion of the families of civil servants established in Canberra. It will be only a small university, and as such may fail to attract the staff which will guarantee the standard of education which we are entitled to demand of a university. If, on the other hand, it is to be a postgraduate and research university, other considerations arise. The bill provides that the university, among other things, will embrace a school of medical research, a research school of physical sciences, a research school of social sciences, and a school of Pacific affairs and diplomatic studies. I believe that there are some studies that could be appropriately undertaken in Canberra.. Problems which come under the heading of Pacific affairs, including the study of foreign countries and anthropology, could very well be studied with great  advantage in  Canberra. Some problems of public law could be admirably studied here, and research work doneon them ; also problems of public administration, which cry aloud, particularly in Australia, to be made the subject of scientific investigation, could be studied here in. Canberra. But let us turn from that to the proposal to establish here a school of medical research. I am at a complete loss to understand how it could be thought possible to establish, in the true sense, a school of medical research in a small town where hospital facilities are necessarily ##'## limited. Experience all over the world has gone to show that the best medical research work is done in great medical centres where it is possible##'## to aggregate, not only the experience to be gained in a great hospital, hut also the work of other institutions which bear on medical research. If, for example, the Commonwealth desired to assist medical research, I have no doubt that the best way would be to make substantial grants to established medical centres in great cities like Sydney and Melbourne, rather than to take a few eminent men, and more or less isolate them in Canberra. Research involves the co-operative effort of teams of workers, and constant access to methods for the practical application and testing of theories. Victorians will remember the situation of the Melbourne General Hos pital. It has associated with it the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, and it ought to have associated with it all the activities which bear on medical research. There would then exist a centre, not only for medical practice and treatment, but also for medical research, which might well become world famous and have a profound influence on the history of medicine. However, one cannot visualize that at any early date we can, in a place the size of Canberra, usefully carry on medical research. </para>
                    <para>The same thing is true in a lesser degree, perhaps, of research into the physical sciences. I say with all goodwill that it would he a mistake to suppose that by bringing eminent scientists - Australians perhaps - from other parts of the world to Canberra and providing them with the most elaborately equipped laboratories we should be putting ourselves in line to achieve great results in research. I emphasize that research work of value is the product not of isolated thinking, but of organized thinking. Success is the result of team work, and worthwhile research cannot be clone except in the closest conjunction with all the facilities needed for testing and applying theories, week by week. </para>
                    <para>I should like to know how much actual investigation has been made with a view to establishing a national university in Canberra, by whom it has been made, and the qualifications of those who made it. The only memorandum which I have seen in connexion with this matter - and I grant that many memoranda may existwithout my having seen <inline font-style="italic">them-</inline> - was published on the 27th May of this year in the. <inline font-style="italic">University Gazette,</inline> which is produced for university circulation, and contains uni-  versify information. In this number, there is printed a memorandum directed by the  chairman,  of the Australian ViceChancellors Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Medley,</inline> to the Prime Minister on the problem of research, and it contains some criticism of the proposal to establish a national university in Canberra. Parliament itself is entitled to know what investigation has been made into the matter, and what are the results achieved. Much detailed work must have been done, and I have no doubt that the Minister will be able, when he replies, to give us some information on the point. In his second-reading speech on the bill, he.said that ##£##872,500 would be provided for building. That is a precise amount, and it seems to indicate that some definite conclusions have been arrived at in regard to the proposed building.##'## He further stated that ##£##325,000 a year would ultimately be granted each year for the maintenance of the university. I invite Hie Minister to give particulars of how these sums are made up, because that would show much better than does the bill itself the precise nature of the proposed establishment. </para>
                    <para>The great needs in Australian universities are more facilities and greater encouragement for research work. Those who have been associated with universities in Australia and are interested in what they are doing have long since been oppressed by the- fact that the university staffs are far too much engaged in the work of teaching and too little engaged in the work of research. A  man  whose whole- time is occupied by the demands of teaching large university classes may, unless he be a superman find himself becoming rusty in his own business, because his lectures are of necessity - using the word in a comparative sense - .elementary. He is there to teach students the elements, whether the lower elements or the higher elements, of what lie is discussing. If he is to continue as the really inspired master and leader of his students his own mind must never get into a groove. By research and examination of new problems he must maintain a fresh mind- so that, he may give real guidance to those who come under his influence.  His  task is one of the most profound authority and importance. In our universities to-day the facilities that the lecturer has for research are extraordinarily limited. They are limited primarily, at times, by the demands made on his services for other purposes. All universities have been troubled by this matter. They have to realize that they should have at their command much larger sums of money in order to establish research chairs in the various faculties, and to maintain under the guidance of the deans of the faculties constant attacks upon new problems, whether they be problems of science, of law, or related to the various schools of what we call the humanities. It would be a great pity if we were to concentrate unduly upon establishing new research institutes at  theexpense of those already established and. urgently in need of funds. Let me say at once that that is not an argument - against the establishment of such a university as is proposed in relation to thosematters which, in the first instance, can be best compressed in Canberra; birt it is an argument against mere duplication, for duplication##'##s -sake. I direct attention to a few paragraphs in the memorandum forwarded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Medley,</inline> Vice-Chancellor of the Melbourne University, to the Minister for Post-war. Reconstruction(Mr. Dedman). The memorandum was compiled  by him as  chairman  of the Australian Vice-Chancellor##'##s Committee, consisting of the vice-chancellors of all Australian universities. So it is not merely an individual expression of view ; it expressesthe view of all of the universities of Australia. I shall not read the whole document, but I should like to quote a few important paragraphs which, I believe, should be put on record. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Medley</inline> says - </para>

                        <para>Apart from training research workers, the pursuit of now knowledge is an essential part of a university##'##s contribution to a community.

                    <para class="block">Those words have been carefully chosen; they represent . the view of men who are, after all, experts in this field, and they are views which we are bound to take into very earnest consideration. I have no doubt that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction will be able to throw a good deal of light on these matters, because I know he has devoted much time to this, and I give him credit for it. I invite the honorable gentleman to take us into his confidence as to the progressive steps contemplated in the establishment of this university. ##[## would have much preferred that the bill should not endeavour at this stage to say what institutes are to be established or what departments of knowledge are to be pursued. I would have thought it would have been far better to establish a highly competent council and entrust to the council the work of determining what will be the first, second and third steps. If we imagine we will be able to produce a fullblown university in Australia in a year or two we are making a great mistake. It is the first step that will count. Let us take that step by all means. But let us concentrate in the first place on the things that could be better studied here than anywhere else in Australia, and, as the university grows, let it expand as the population and facilities of the city expand until it- reaches out into every department of knowledge. </para>
                    <para>May .1 conclude by commenting on two matters which I agree are quite minor. The first of them is that ##[## confess to a mild feeling of horror at the thought that we are to establish in Canberra a university which we propose to call the Australian National University. Why should not this be the Canberra University? I cannot imagine anybody becoming extraordinarily enthu siastic about the proposed title. If institutions of this kind are to be real, and not merely scientific shops, they must, develop some <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps,</inline> their own character and colour, and make their own mark upon those who pass through them. In order to achieve this I suggest strongly that this disembodied title which it is proposed to confer ##"## on the university should be dropped in favour of one with a good deal of reality. </para>
                    <para>My other minor comment is that I was very pleased to hear the Minister say in his second-reading speech that the buildings of a university of this kind must he of distinction. With that sentiment. I am entirely in agreement. But I was a little dashed when I heard him say that the buildings should be in harmony with the general architectural features of Canberra, because I confess that I regard Canberra for the most part as an architectural abomination! The building that we are in now, although pleasant enough inside, looks externally like nothing other than a chocolate factory. We have adopted in Canberra, for some reason that I can never understand, architecture of a flat, squashed type that is completely out of ##"##harmony with what ought to be. Let us make up our minds that this being the Australian capital city, with institutions of various kinds like the National Library, a national university, or whatever name it .may go by, we shall establish in Canberra buildings of real permanence and beauty. I hope that the Canberra university buildings will not consist of squashed, pork-pie-like buildings of the type that at present disfigure. Canberra. In a. private capacity I arn prepared to. give distinguished advice to anybody at any time oil how the buildings should be designed. All. I can say now is that the university, which I hope is to be established to endure for ever, ought to be not only a place where scholarship is at the highest level, not only a place at which inspiring human beings will be brought in conjunction with other .malleable human beings for the production of great citizens, but also a place which, like all great universities of the world, will give a touch of beauty to the memory of those who pass through it. I support the hill,##'## but I have ventured those few criticisms  in the belief that we should all desire that the university should be permanently established in the best way. </para>

                        <para>.- The Australian National University Bill marks the third stage of the Common-  wealth Government##'##s entry into the field of education. The first was the establishment of the Commonwealth Office of Education, which will allocate financial assistance to the States .for general education purposes. The second was the establishment of the Universities Commission, which will provide assistance to students who otherwise could not afford a higher education. This step is the third. Many years ago, . some 200 acres of the Australian Capital Territory was set aside for the establishment of a university. So other governments have envisaged the establishment of a university at Canberra, but the present Government is to be congratulated that it has taken practical steps to bring the plan into being. The Leader of the Opposition  <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has voiced- the concern of the vice-chancellors of the Australian universities that the##"## allocation of ##£##325,000 a year to the new university may be at the expense of Commonwealth assistance already being given to the States. He conveyed to my mind - and I do not know whether he intended to or whether it was obtuseness on my part - that there was opposition by the vice-chancellors to the university. ##"##What he said about Professor Medley did convey the impression that he is opposed to it, but there is at least one vice-chancellor on whoso behalf the right honorable gentleman did not speak, the vicechancellor of the university of ##"##Western Australia, Professor Currie, who said - </para>

                    <para>Then Professor Currie went to express a fear of a reduction of the expenditure on State universities. I congratulate the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> on the careful research which has taken place in this matter and also on the. men from the various State universities employed to make it. The committee that made recommendations on the School of Social Science,- for instance, consisted of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, Professor S. J. Butlin, Professor P. Alexander, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. K.</inline> S. Cunningham, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ian</inline> Hogbin, Professor G. ##"##W. Paton and Professor G. L. ##'##Wood. The committee which reported on the physical sciences consisted of the following, distinguished people - <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. R.</inline> Woolley, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J.</inline> P. Madsen, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. F.</inline> W. White, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. G.</inline> H. Briggs and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. D.</inline> F. Martyn. The schools named in clause <inline font-style="italic">7</inline> of the bill - a school of medical research, a research school of physical sciences, a research school of social sciences and a school of Pacific ##"##affairs and diplomatic studies - merit some consideration. The Leader of the Opposition dwelt on the question of research. He said that it was essential that research should not take place in an isolated community like Canberra but that in medical research, for instance, immediate access to large hospitals was important. I think he exaggerates the isolation of Canberra. There are two matters to be considered when discussing research. The various committees of experts differentiated sharply between them. The first is the training of graduates in techniques of post-graduate research. Research is a matter for special training in itself. Most of the committee were seised of the fact that undergraduate students are to a very large .degree recipients of actual teaching, almost in the high school sense. The##'## technique of research is not developed. If you are to have research workers to go on with new research, there must be, as the right honorable gentleman said, some establishment for training in research methods. Most of the committees thought that this university would be a good place for that purpose, particularly because the State universities are heavily overloaded, as the right honorable gentleman said, with teaching, so##"## that training in them in the techniques of research is somewhat difficult. I do not wish to exaggerate that difficulty, but I do say that there is a strong case for the establishment of research institutions where there will be no teaching load upon the staff. The right honorable gentleman said that Canberra was too isolated for independent  research, but I really think that he exaggerated that difficulty. Sydney Universtiy is about half an hour away from the Sydney Hospital. </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter if it is within five or ten minutes##'## walk. If in a laboratory an independent research worker encountered problems in medicine that he wished to study in a hospital he would have to spend a considerable time in a hospital. Two hour##'##s flight from Canberra will take him to Sydney. He will probably be absent from Canberra for two weeks while conducting his research, in the same way as he would be absent for two weeks from the Sydney University. The criticism which the right honorable gentleman directed at the establishment of the national university in Canberra was in the nature of hairsplitting. </para>

                    <para>Other matters associated with the establishment of this university deserve attention. Turning to other fields of science, we find that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is already established here, so that an opportunity exists to co-ordinate the fields of study in which that institution is engaged, and the work of the new national university. The same remark applies to the School of Forestry in the Australian Capital Territory, and in the field of astrophysics, to the Mount Strom lo Observatory. In fact, previous governments founded a research colony in the Australian Capital Territory. Evidently, they did not consider that Canberra was too isolated for research. The establishment of this new university will add another research field here. </para>
                    <para>I turn now to the schools mentioned in the bill. The School of Medical Research, even were it another medical faculty not engaged in post-graduate work and were solely confined to under-graduate work, is vitally necessary. The students of the University of Western Australia, who do first year medicine in that university and cannot complete the degree there, at present are unable to find room in the universities of the eastern States to continue their studies. Therefore, if, in time, this national university were to relieve some of the existing gross overcrowding in the universities of the eastern </para>
                    <para class="block">States, the establishment of its medical school would be justified on that ground alone, because the existing facilities for medical teaching and research in Australia are quite inadequate. In addition, there is the School of Social Sciences. The Committee on the Social Sciences met jointly on a number of occasions with the committee that was studying problems associated with the School of Pacific Affairs and Diplomatic Studies. </para>

The Government,  no matter how enlightened its policy may be, must have adequately trained personnel to administer it. Otherwise, the Government will find that its policy will not be applied. The British Government should be our model in this respect. For a long period of time it has been improving the calibre of its colonial admin-is- trators and diplomatic corps. If this university is established on sound lines it can do the same for the Australian community.

                    <para class="block">If that foreshadows an intention to open this university to talent, I congratulate the honorable gentleman upon that provision. The correspondence that I have received from the University of Western Australia shows that there can be a two-way relationship between this national research- university and the State universities. If the State universities are adequately financed by the Commonwealth and State governments they will produce students of a higher calibre, who - can be the##'## research students of the national university. Again, if this university is adequately financed and conducted, it can provide for the State universities .teaching personnel who are thoroughly versed in research techniques, and will thus improve State standards. In my opinion, this is a progressive measure. The Leader of the Opposition has conjured up a great many invalid objections. The establishment of this university will be immensely beneficial to -Australian education, and I congratulate the Minister upon the bill. </para>

                        WHITE  (Balaclava) ##[##11.48 J.The Parliament will applaud the fact that the Commonwealth Government is taking a greater interest, in education. For years, education in Australia has been starved, and the standards are not. good. All political- parties in this Parliament have realized that fact, and have urged the granting of assistance, but it is most important to decide how that assistance shall be given. This proposal, to establish, at great expense, a university iii Canberra deserves close scrutiny and analysis. I personally think it is too ambitious. A great university cannot be created by the mere passage of this bill. The world-famed, universities of Oxford and Cambridge had their origins, in the earliest culture and history of England. Provincial universities such as those of Manchester and Leeds, and the University of London, cannot be compared, with; Oxford and Cambridge. Neither could a university, established in Canberra compare in prestige with the older universities of the Australian capital cities, especially those of Melbourne and Sydney, which ha.v,e long and honorable records. When the Empire Medical Convention was held in Australia in 1934, the Melbourne centenary year, visiting leadersof medical science from overseas were pleasantly surprised by the standards of the great medical schools of Melbourne and Syd.ney, which they regarded as equal to anything in the world. Surely no onewould suggest that a university at Canberra could overtake these older universities in prestige, however much money might be spent upon it.
                    </para>
                    <para>Whilst there is scope for specialized study in Canberra, in, say public .administration, anthropology, Pacific affairs, diplomatic subjects, .and subjects related to activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, other aspects of this proposal need consideration. I shall mention one that has not so far been referred to in the debate, although I suggested it in 1932, when the Royal Military College was being removed from Canberra to Sydney, and, in fact, seemed likely to be abolished altogether by the Labour Administration in office at that time. I proposed then that the activities of the Royal Military College should be enlarged and put on the basis of the West Point </para>
                    <para class="block">Academy of the United States of America, in which students are accepted for both civil and military studies. That policy could be applied to Duntroon with advantage. Our Royal Military College has a first-class and world-wide reputation. For some years in succession it was the Empire##'##s leading military college, winning the Laverty Cup. The college has produced many excellent graduates. I can see no reason why its curriculum should not be enlarged to cater for students who desire to pursue both military and civil studies. The present four-year course includes a number of university subjects in which students are taken almost to graduation standard, and I can see no reason why the West Point Academy practice should not be applied to it. If that were done, students would obtain a valuable education in military affairs, and even if they decided ultimately not to follow a military career they would be a reserve, and would have received training which, in the event of war occurring, would make them eminently suitable for staff positions. Persons so trained are urgently required in time of war. The Royal Military College at Duntroon is known in some countries for its achievements, where even the Commonwealth Parliament is not known. That may sound like an exaggerated statement, but it is not. I could refer to many distinguished graduates from Duntroon. General Vasey was one ##'##qf the first graduates from the college. He filled many posts in World War I. as a staff and artillery officer, and during World War II. he commanded the 7th Division and rendered _ distinguished service in Greece, Crete, and New Guinea. He met an untimely end in an unfortunate air force crash in Queensland. I call to mind also WingCommander Wackett who studied at Duntroon. In his spare time he graduated in science and engineering, and later played a very big part in aircraft manufacture in Australia. He left the service to become first manager of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation. We all know of his achievements in aircraft design and production, which were a big factor in the defence, of this country^ Air Commodore Macauley, who is  Deputy  Chief of Air Staff, is another notable graduate from Duntroon, and I could mention many others. I cannot see why this excellent institution, which is already established at Canberra, should not be enlarged so as to include not. only studies in strategy, military tactics ##"##and the like, which are so necessary now that time and space have been annihilated, by atomic warfare and aviation, but also other studies such as those provided at West Point Academy. I am surprised that the vice-chancellors of the various Australian universities did not, in their report, comment upon the West Point practice. </para>
                    <para>I understand that the proposed national university at Canberra is intended to provide not only for studies in public administration, anthropology, diplomacy and the like but also for undergraduates generally. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has stated, from his wide experience, this latter requirement would mean that the new university would have to meet the needs and amenities of young people coming to Canberra, and this city, after all, is remote from- other centres of research. It would be impossible, for example, to establish a first-rate medical school here. I suppose that the younghonorable member from Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> would not advocate that undergraduates from the University of Western Australia should be brought to Canberra to study in what, in the early stages at any rate, must, be a second-rate institution. What has the honorable member to say on that point? </para>

Whilst I approve of government expenditure on education, I contend that the way in which the money is expended should be scrutinized. In the United States of America, West Point Academy, of which the Royal Military College at Duntroon is the Australian equivalent, caters for the civil as well as the military side of education. We have a splendid foundation on which to build at Duntroon. It should be so developed that its graduates would be equipped to choose civil avocations if there were no future for them in the permanent military service. </para>

                            <para>- It is futile to address the Minister, who has never had any association with the fighting services, and is unable to appreciate that a military institution gives a thorough education to its graduates. It is a pity that he has not had the benefit of compulsory military training. By some means or other, he has been able to escape the experience that would have fitted him to follow intelligently what I am saying. If the aim be to bring- greater lustre to Canberra, there are other means of doing it. The train service to this city is the most archaic that could be imagined. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> who is in charge of the scheme for the standardization of the railway gauges of Australia, has not succeeded in providing a service to Canberra that would do credit to Patagonia or Bulgaria. This city must be developed, because it is the Federal Capital, whether we like it or not. Its communications and amenities must be improved. Our air services are good, and they would remain so if they were not nationalized. If our airports were improved, this city would be brought into closer touch with the rest of the continent, and much of its present isolation would disappear. Western Australia also is isolated from the rest of the continent. It is farther from the eastern States than is New Zealand ; consequently, it suffers disabilities. The time taken to reach Canberra from Melbourne by rail is longer than is taken to fly across the Atlantic Ocean from England to America. If a. university is to be established here, buildings worthy of thecity should be erected. An addition to the foundations already so well and truly##'## laid at Duntroon would be worth while. Whatever is done should be an ornament to Canberra. Approaching this- city by air, one sees whitewashed .buildings that are reminiscent of Arab structures in Mesopotamia. This House of Parliament has no architectural beauty outside, although it is comfortable enough inside. Before the Government incurs the proposed expenditure on the establishment of a national university in Canberra, it should consider whether it would not be better to make larger grants to the universities already established iri the States, whose needs are very great. The University of Melbourne is establishing a branch on Air Force property at Mildura. Hundreds of young people will have to live there in huts, because the Melbourne University has not sufficient space in Melbourne to acter for them. The location is not a. good one and the conditions for study will be very difficult. If a camp site had to be used, one nearer to Melbourne, such as Somers, should have been chosen. My alternative proposal for Canberra could be made ancillary to the scheme that the Government .has propounded. ##"##When the Royal Military College was removed from Duntroon in 1932, and placed in an unsuitable environment in Sydney, where it appeared to be in danger of a complete eclipse, I initiated a proposal for its restoration and expansion in Canberra. The late General Vasey made a report on Duntroon, in which  he recommended such a scheme. I doubt whether Ministers have read it. If they have not, they should study it, because it enunciates progressive ideas which, if adopted, would do much good for our future defence, and certainly for education. </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> upon having Introduced this bill to establish a national university at Canberra; it is a step forward in the development of higher education in Australia. Birt it is to be regretted that the scheme is being undertaken in a piece-meal fashion. A hill for the assistance of higher education throughout the Commonwealth, embodying provisions for the establishment of a university at Canberra, would have been infinitely better. The object of the measure is to establish an institution that will, be principally devoted to research work. I take it that the majority of students to be trained will be residents of Canberra, supplemented by a number drawn from the rural areas from Goulburn southward. Therefore, it is likely that this university will not become a large institution, like those that are established in the capital cities. The advantages of that will be very great. The development of education in the Common-  wealth appears to be proceeding along the line of assistance by the Australian Government to higher education, the States undertaking more and more the function of education in the schools, and to some extent in the universities. Probably, the. Commonwealth will advance more and more-on the field of university education, by assisting the States with grants of money, because the States are largely restricted as to the amount which they can expend on education, on account of their having been denied the right to levy, income tax and to exploit other avenues for the production of revenue. Popular education will advance in the States, probably at the expense of higher education. In New South Wales, the extension of the higher education facilities to rural areas is being opposed. I am keenly interested in the sole rural university college outside the capital cities in the Commonwealth, the New England University College at Armidale. An endeavour is being made to obtain automony for it, and to have on the New England Tablelands the only university in Australia outside the capital cities; but every obstacle is being placed in the way, apparently by - the Government of New South Wales, and, I believe, by the Senate of the University of Sydney, although it claims to be in favour of the proposal. One can understand the objections of the members of the University Senate. They probably consider that if this university were given autonomy a considerable proportion of the funds that are available in New South Wales for the development* of higher education might be diverted from the University of Sydney and distributed among rural universities. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> particularly stressed that in the existing universities it was. practically impossible for the professors to devote adequate time to research. He asserted that they were chiefly engaged in teaching, and claimed that that prevented them from doing essential research. In all the universities, the administrative work placed on the shoulders of the professors prevents them from devoting the time that is needed, not only to teaching, but also to research. I believe that in the general scheme for the expansion of education throughout the Commonwealth the more rural universities there are the better will be the work thatis done. In the New England University College, the average attainments of the undergraduates who enter it upon obtaining a Leaving Certificate has not been up to the standard of the undergraduates who enter the Sydney University, but upon graduation it has been higher. I consider that to be due to the fact that the teaching staff there comes into more intimate contact with the students because of the smaller numbers with which they have to deal, and also because they are able to undertake a considerable amount of research. That work is growing, and original work is being undertaken, particularly in respect of the history of Australia. According to clause 6 the functions of the university shall include the following: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The bill says nothing about the establishment of research schools for the study of problems associated with the primary industries, either agricultural or pastoral. Notwithstanding that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Canberra does research into rural problems, I. believe that facilities should be provided at the national university for co-ordinating the results of research in other institutions, and also for doing original research. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Howard, in <inline font-style="italic">Air Agricultural Testament,</inline> protests against what he calls the ##"## compartmenting##"## of agricultural research, particularly in India and other parts of the British Empire. The same weakness is discernible in regard to research into the pastoral industry of Australia. Many scientists are carrying on individual researches into particular problems, but no facilities exist for the interchange of knowledge or for the co-ordination of effort. The national university should provide such facilities. It is a strange thing that here in Canberra, on the very soil where Farrar performed his monumental work in connexion with the development of the wheat industry, it should be proposed to establish a university that will not concern itself in any way with research into agricultural and pastoral problems. </para>
                    <para>The universities in the State capital cities are at present grossly overcrowded. The normal capacity of the Sydney University is 3,600, but there are at present some 9,000 students enrolled there. In such circumstances, it is extremely  difficult  for students to receive the instruction to which they are entitled. The Commonwealth has made grants to the New England University. College for the building of lecture rooms and laboratories, but so far it has declined to give any assistance towards the provision of hostels for the accommodation of students. If it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall enter the field of higher education, Ministers should realize that the rural universities provide the best facilities for education, and enable the best research work to be done, because they are less crowded, and the atmosphere is more conducive to work and study. The Commonwealth Government should  Continue  its interest in higher education, and make grants to the States to enable them to found and maintain rural universities, such as the institution at Armidale. This would encourage the decentralization of educational activity, and enable students to pursue their studies free from the distractions of a large city. </para>

I am surprised that the present Government, which is becoming more and more international in its outlook, should have used the word ##"## national ##"## to describe the university. It is. proposed to establish a school of political science, and no doubt it will be placed under the direction of the very persons who are doing their best to dilute the idea of nationalism. That they are so engaged was evident from their talk at the last Summer School of Political Science, which was held at Orange. They have turned their backs on the AngloSaxon tradition, and have become international in their outlook. </para>

                        <para class="block">With the first two proposals I amin agreement, and concerning the third I shall have something to say later. The fourth proposal is important, because we are regarded by many as an appendage of Asia. The doctrine of Asia for the Asiatics is being increasingly advocated bya great many people. It was preached by the Japanese who made many converts, and they failed to achieve their purpose completely only because of their cruelty, ruthlessness and domineering manner. However, the fire still smoulders, so I approve of the proposal to establish a school of Pacific affairs and diplomatic studies in which problems associated with our relations with neighbouring countries may be investigated. It is well that we should send students to northern areas to study those inferior peoples, and try to raise them to the level of the Anglo-Saxons. However, we should not lose our heads about it, as the Governmentseems to be doing. </para>
                        <para>I am sory that I cannot agree with the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott),</inline> who advocated that more money should be expended in northern New South Wales, on the establishment and maintenance of rural universities.I believe that we should begin with the provision of facilities for secondary education. In the high schools that students should be culled ruthlessly, before ever they go to theuniversity. In my opinion, New England is already over-supplied with educational facilities as compared with other parts of Australia. Before I went overseas during the war,. I visited northern New South Wales,. giving recruiting talks, and Ihad an opportunity to observe the educational facilities existing there. Immediately I finished in the north,I went to Wollongong, on the South Coast, and was struck by the lack of educational facilities as compared with those in the area I had just left. It is possible for a member of Parliament to be too good a member in the interests of his own district. Government supporters will probably not agree with me in that, because they are always talking to their electorates. It is certain that the more thickly populated areas are over-supplied with amenities as compared with the outlying areas. It would be hard for me to become too good a member, becausethe Northern Territory has been so neglected in the past that it would take years of strenuous and successful advocacy to bring it up to the level of other communities. Therefore, I take the honorable member for New England to task for advocating the expenditure of more money in the nearer rural areas, rather than in themore distant areas, which are practically without facilities of any kind. We know that when a member of a State Parliament becomes a Minister he is tempted to spend money lavishly in his own electorate. That is. why New </para>
                        <para class="block">England enjoys so many facilities. In this I am not criticizing any particular party. The members of all parties do the same when they are in power. I. know that wooden bridges, which had still 30 years of life in them, have been pulled clown and replaced by concrete bridges, simply because the Minister in power was able to have it done. In contrast to the facilities available in many parts of Australia conditions in Darwin are deplorable. Children are sitting cross-legged on the school floors, as the Japanese used r.o make their prisoners sit. There is no furniture in the school, and few facilities for teaching##'##. The position is the same at Tennant Creek, Pine Creek and Katherine; and yet the Government proposes to expend hundreds of thousands of pounds on providing a university in Canberra, which is already well supplied with educational facilities. The facilities proposed to be provided by this bill should be extended to those who live in the outlying areas of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No less than ##£##50,000 was wasted at Laraki a. 4 miles out of Darwin, in an attempt to provide what some anthropologist thought would be better conditions for the natives ; but when the work was completed the natives stayed in their mla-mlas, leaving the building to their dogs. On the advice of another anthropologist this Government proposes to expend ##£##118,000 on the establishment of a model native village at Port Moresby. What superfluity of silliness, having regard to the failure of the  Larakia  experiment ! The Government will not accept the advice of those who have lived among the natives all their lives ; it is dominated by anthropologists and other ##"##hooey##"## scientists. Clause 7 of the bill provides that the proposed Australian National University may establish, amongst other things, a research school of social sciences. No doubt, provision for such a school has been inserted in the bill as the result of the influence exerted on the Government by the ##"## rat-bags ##"## who attend the meetings of the Summer School of Political Science. In 1937 I attended the sessions of that school at the Albert Hall,- Canberra, and was amazed at the ##"## rat-bag ##"## theories advanced by some of the speakers. Yet some of them are now senior officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. One of them is now  chairman  of a committee which has been appointed to advise the Government on the development of the Northern Territory. I have every* respect for the views of highly qualified technical men-, and of those trained in the orthodox sciences, but I have no time for the views of graduates in the pseudo sciences, who dominate this Government, and I shall oppose their interference in the progress of thi3 country with the utmost vigour. Just imagine a man with the scientific, engineering and educational attainments of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kemp,</inline> the Co-ordinator-General of Public Works in Queensland, and one of the foremost engineers of this country, having to play ##"## second fiddle ##"## to economists trained in the Summer School of Political Science! We shall be committing a great evil if we permit the Australian National University to be dominated by the pseudoscientific ##"## hill-billies  ##"##, of whom this Government appears to be so fond. Unless we cull out those misguided ##"## rat-bags ##"## the university will produce many disappointed young men whose educational background will be so unrealistic as to render them unfit to take an important part in the work and affairs of this country. It would be far better to train them as artisans than to allow them to waste their time over these pseudo sciences. </para>

Only recently a noted scientist in England chastised the peoples of the British Empire for not making a coordinated geological test of its boundless resources. This Government has done nothing to develop the mineral resources of this country. Whilst it is prepared to waste money on futile attempts to alter the native way of life purely at the whim of anthropologists, it will do nothing to exploit the known resources of this country. Its policy is to neglect the known and concentrate on the unknown. In the name of sanity and decency let us abandon this stupidity and make provision in this bill for the establishment of research schools in the important branches of science to which I have referred. </para>

                            <para>- That was not exactly my idea. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research operates on the experimental side of agriculture) but what I have in mind is a school of agriculture at which young men and women would learn the scientific side of agriculture, as they do at the agricultural colleges in the various States, in order to engage in primary production. I do not claim to know a great deal about farming, but any one who has visited country schools must be aware that the lessons the children learn encourage them to migrate to the cities, ra ther than to stay on the farms. We must stop the drift of people to the cities if we are to preserve the rural industries on which our future is dependent. It may still be possible to include a provision in the bill for the establishment of a chair of agriculture at the university. I ask the Government to give that matter deep consideration. I am sure that not only the honorable member for New England, but also many other honorable gentlemen are in accord with the need for courses in agricultural science. It is indeed a matter of regret that the Australian Capital Territory, the centre of a vast primary producing district, has not such a college already. </para>

                    <para>The Commonwealth Government in recent years has done much to promote higher education. It is contributing money through the universities to assist boysand girls of the right type to take university courses that they otherwise would be unable to take because of the poor circumstances of their families. Many of what might have been the best brains in the country have not been developed because the parents could not afford to keep their children at school beyond compulsory attendance age, let alone send them to universities. But, henceforth, boys and girls of ability, but without means, will be able, because of this Government##'##s policy, to go ahead with their studies. The money expended will be more than repaid because of the beneficial results that will accrue to the national economy from the development of minds that might otherwise have remained undeveloped. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable gentleman can takeit from me that I shall behere longer than he will be. I can understand the annoyance of the honorable member, because he was a member of the government that wasted money in Darwin. The honorable member for the Northern Territory, who attacks this Government for not having expended sufficient money in parts of the Northern Territory, supported the government that expended ##£##2,500,000 on the Laraki##'##a barracks, which were evacuated after the first Japanese bomb fell on Darwin. It ill becomes an honorable member to criticize us when he supported a government which, instead of wisely spending money on the development of the Northern Territory, wasted ##£##2,500,000 on barracks that were abandoned as soon as the enemy dropped a bomb. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am absolutely opposed to this bill. Unlike the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chambers),</inline> I do not believe that the bill will lead to any national education service and, in addition, I hope and pray to the Lord that it will not. Education is the responsibility of the State parliaments, which can look after their own education services. Furthermore, I do not believe that the Federal Capital warrants a university of any kind. It is high time that this Parliament began to show some consideration for the downtrodden taxpayer, and realized that the expenditure of millions of pounds on all kinds of projects that the Government is undertaking must cease. The honorable member for Adelaide referred to the waste of money in the Northern Territory. If he desires an example of waste in that part of Australia, he shouldbegin from the date when the Curtin Government appointed the Allied Works Council. </para>

                    <para>Let me examine briefly the proposal for the establishment of a university at Canberra. After having listened to some honorable members, I could be excused for thinking that universities were produced like rabbits, out of hats, or by legislation, or by rule of thumb. When we examine the history of the famous universities of the world, we find that they grew up over a long period of time, and upstarts among the universities do not reCeIve much of a hearing. The London University does not compare with Oxford and Cambridge. What value is placed upon a degree of the average university in the United States of America - I exclude Harvard, Yale, and one or two others - compared with a. degree of Oxford or Cambridge? There must be something on which to base a university. Canberra has not a. large enough population to warrant the establishment of a university here, and if honorable members believe that,  because  this city happens to be the Federal Capital, and the Government establishes something of a university here, people all over Australia will be induced to send their children here, they are labouring under a misapprehension. </para>

Oxford never was the capital of the United Kingdom, and the reputation of Oxford University dates back centuries. So also does the reputation of Cambridge University. Attempts to establish universities at big industrial centres like Manchester and London have not succeeded in ousting Oxford and Cambridge from the pre-eminent places that they have occupied in the world of education for centuries. </para>

                    <para>The Government is not likely to  estab##'##lish  successfully a school of medical research unless the research is to be conducted in conjunction with a large hospital. If I am any judge, that adjunct will not be available in the Australian Capital Territory. Clause 7 provides also for the establishment of a school of physical science. Heaven knows what that means ! . It may refer to the atomic bomb, which, after all, is a physical matter. In addition, there is to be a school of social sciences. My experience of the products of schools of  social sciences is that generally th##'##ey are fairly ##"## red ##"##. Finally, provision is made for the delectable school of Pacific affairs and diplomatic studies. Those are four wonderful corner-stones on which to found what is supposed to be the superuniversity of the Commonwealth. Some honorable members appear to believe that, because Canberra happens to be the Federal Capital, everything should be concentrated here. In my opinion, one of the outstanding tragedies of Canberra is that it is insulated and isolated from the life of the people of Australia. People who are raised here and who see nothing more of Australia than the environs of Canberra, do not know how the country functions: They may know something of how the administration is carried on - and a most expensive administration it is. </para>
                    <para>The one- educational establishment in the Australian Capital Territory which should receive some consideration from the Commonwealth Government, has apparently been overlooked. I refer to the Royal Military College at Duntroon. As that institution is outside the scope of the bill, I shall not debate it now. I merely call attention to that fact, and I shall be interested to know whether the Government is prepared to do as much for the only military educational establishment in Australia, which only the Commonwealth Government is responsible for maintaining, as it is prepared to  do for an unwanted university which ia not likely to make a great figure in the education life of the Commonwealth during the next 50 years. The outlook of this Government towards finance is so wide and extravagant that it is time that some members of the Opposition asked it to come back to earth. If the Government has large suras of money to expend, the shortage of houses and hospital accommodation calls urgently for attention. Until those two problems have been solved, the Commonwealth Government is not justified in spending one penny on an institution which is not wanted, which will be a purely artificial growth, and which will not cut any figure in the educational life of Australia. For those reasons, I oppose the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- When listening to the speeches on this bill, I- could not help arriving at certain conclusions. One conclusion which has been forced upon me during the last few minutes was that when this university, with its capacity for providing extra study, is established, there should be a chair for discovering some more facts about the queer phenomenon of Staterighters infesting the seats of the Opposition in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. I was impressed also to find that, with the exception of the speech of the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley),</inline> the discussions went round and about the subject rather than to the core, which is the establishment of a university in Canberra. I heard disputation regarding the architecture of the university, and always is drawn into the debate a hatred of Canberra. Surely we have a mandate- -a spiritual mandate, at any rate - to accept the decision of the Australian community relating to the Federal Capital, and having quieted our own Australian doubts about it, we accept it as evidence of the growth of this great Commonwealth, and, in addition, accept our destiny within it. If we are to progress, I fail to see that such matters as high taxation, financial provision for hospitals, and State responsibility for education have anything to do with the establishment of a national university, except as side issues. The subject before the House is that we should have in this Federal Capital and at the core of our Australian nationality some indication of our progress - some institution which .will enable us to proceed upon the lines of civilization and civilization proceeds hand in hand with learning, and the edifications which may be drawn from a national life allied with civilized processes. In the circumstances, there can be no argument that a. university is necessary wherever man can build one. The histories of universities have not all been of venerable piles associated with slowthinking dons, quietly flowing rivers, and philosophies. A university was originally just an aggregation of men who taught themselves to think, and having done so, taught other persons to think. That is the basis of all education from elementary education to the higher education.##'## But because it has been suggested that the proposed university of Canberra should be the national university with postgraduate courses, the project is assailed for having forward, thrusting ideas, and for disdaining the inferiority complex that it cannot survive, is unwanted, and will be expensive.. It would be much better if we, as members of  the Commonwealth Parliament, addressed ourselves to- the future of the country, instead of always getting into the narrow-minded philosophy that no good can come out of Canberra, and that everything we do with the Federal Capital must be wrong. Parliament House has been criticized as being a temporary structure, but behind it is the ideal, permanent and indestructible, and although this building may not please all aesthetic minds, that fact has nothing to do with the philosophy and national feeling behind the establishment of a great federal city. So it is with the -national university, at Canberra. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> objected to , the proposed name of ##"##Australian National University##"##. I do not think that the right honorable gentleman was thinking in a- political sense. The party, which he leads, once was called the ##"##National##"## party, hut it- is. now known as the Liberal party. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition is politically very sincere in his outlook on  education. When ##'##the subject was discussed a few months ago, he delivered one of the finest speeches that I have ever heard on that subject. I have since read it on two occasions. The right honorable gentleman approached the matter from a purely national standpoint. In the circumstances, the question of whether the university shall be called the -National University is immaterial.  If we are seeking to create an atmosphere around our future university, we can do no better than call it the ##"## John Curtin Memorial University ##"##. John Curtin taught us the meaning of true federation arid true Australianism, and he highlighted the sacrifices that a great Australian should be called upon to make in time of war, even unto death. So if it were necessary, and the occasion does not arise at the moment, to give the university a name, I hope that my suggestion will receive careful consideration. </para>
                    <para>Other honorable members raised various issues, including researches in relation to peoples, and particularly in relation to medicine. I remind. them that although the Paris  Sorbonne  was filled to overflowing with students who were treating, as so many students treat, the university as a plush-lined carriage where they get half a dozen letters after their names before going out into the world to practice their professions, there were two people in a little stone hut alongside the university who were isolated from the others. Their researches gave us the miracle of radium. Isolation is sometimes necessary to a man or woman who is engaged in research work, but I agree entirely with the Leader of the Opposition that the research worker must have his contacts, experiments and facilities to study what has been done in a practical way elsewhere. But the locale of a university has nothing to do with its performance, particularly if it is devoted to research, as the bill proposes that the Canberra university shall be. </para>
                    <para>There is a fascination in this debate. It brings to my mind many other desirable developments, such, for example, as a national theatre. I should not quibble about a decision to establish such a theatre in Canberra, for thereby we should be accumulating traditions which at present we lack. We frequently refer to the ancient homes of learning, but we should remember that those places are not famous merely because they are ancient. As a matter of fact in their outlook they are as fresh as the morning. If we are to progress as we desire to do, </para>
                    <para class="block">Ave need to be reaching out to the future. We need long-range planning in relation to our universities. To adapt the words of a popular song, ##"## Yon cannot stop us from dreaming##"##. We cannot afford to think of the nation in. terms of breadandbutter and cash-register politics. It would be a bad thing for the nation if we had no- dreamers. We must maintain our place in the community of nations, and to do so we must demonstrate our capacity to contribute something worth while. We have gathered a good deal from the seats of ancient learning in Europe. I do not know that we have drawn much from Asia, except the story of its ancient culture. But we must make our own contributions to learning and culture. If we had a National University established in Canberra we should be able, I believe, to do great work in the interests, not only of our own people, but also of those of the Northern Territory, Papua, and the- Mandated Territory of New Guinea. I should be disappointed in this measure if it. did not envisage in some way the establishment of a course of colonial administration. Although we are a young nation we have already had thrust upon us great responsibilities in regard to colonization. Native peoples, who are in the dawn age of civilization, look to us in regard to their future, and if we had a National University in which consideration could -be given to these matters it would be a great advantage. I am reminded by interjections from the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain)</inline> that it may also be necessary to do something for some of our own white people! But attention certainly needs to be given to the tinderprivileged people of black skins under our control. </para>
                    <para>Something has been said about the amount of money and the area of land that should be provided for the purpose of this university. We should do our best to give the national university proper  status, and to make it symbolic of all thai is best in the architectural beauty and culture of our community. The area of land surrounding it should be sufficient to provide a campus and a proper atmosphere. But after all the principal consideration is the nature of the work that will be done within the university itself. I hope that at the appropriate time we shall establish a chair of rhetoric, for the cultural development of our people has to be adequately described, and for this purpose we shall .need proper cultural and technical service. The soul of this country will be found in the writings. and arts of its people, as well as in the films produced here, though film production has been commercialized. A chair of rhetoric would do a great deal to create a true Australian conscience. </para>
                    <para>We need to develop a courageous and characteristic Australian outlook. I am happy to know that the Common-  wealth Government is taking this step to establish the university and I hope that the measure will have the unanimous support of the members of this Parliament. Some honorable gentlemen opposite develop an anxiety complex about what our neighbours, by whom they mean the people in other parts of the world, will think of us if we do certain things. It is not our business to ape the doings or to fear the judgment of the people of other nations. We have been settled in this country for more than 150 years and every opportunity should be provided for thoroughly, equipped and trained Australians to ##'##tell the story of our##'## achievements and to develop the cultural qualities of our race. A National University will undoubtedly serve a good purpose in this regard, for it will tend to develop our national characteristics to the highest possible degree. I hope therefore, that the new university will be supported by every section of the community. Its only possible opponents will be those little Australians who fear that something may be clone that is beyond their comprehension. When this terrifying thought takes hold of them, they begin to speak derogatorily about long-haired professors, planners, and the strange people who infest universities, as though the only knowledgeable folk are those who go to the races and patronize the tin hares. The </para>
                    <para class="block">Australian people prefer to pursue higher purposes than that. Many of them wish to study the best elements of citizenry because they believe that Australia has a purpose to fulfil in that regard. We can afford therefore, to throw to one side the criticism of such individuals as the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain),</inline> though perhaps something might be said for providing some means, in the new university, to cater for ##"## lame brains ##"##. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I am gratified at the manner in##'## which this bill has been received throughout Australia and, in particular, by members of the House, with the exception of the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> and the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. . Blain).</inline> I -sard most of what I wished to say when I made my second-reading speech, and I do not propose to prolong the debate at this stage; but I wish to reply briefly to a few observations made, by honorable members. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> while giving generous support to the measure, voiced misgivings about the possible effect of establishing research schools, as proposed in the bill. He questioned the effect that the establishment of these schools might have on the research, work at present being undertaken in the existing Australian universities. Those universities received ##"##grants totalling ##£##52,000 last year from the Commonwealth Government for the work that they are doing.##"## Of that amount ##£##40,000 was made available from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research endowment funds, and the other ##£##12,000 was provided for research work in the social sciences. The total amount was larger than any previous Australian government had provided iri one financial year. In fact, the Australian universities have never been better off than they are to-day, insofar as Commonwealth Government grants are concerned. I do not say that enough money is being provided, for the field of research is extremely broad. It will be necessary for large sums to be made available from time to time for research work  in universities. The proposed Australian National University at Canberra will he able to take some part in these activities to the advantage of the country. The Leader of the Opposition conceded that some research schools could appropriately be associated with the new university, and be referred in this regard to the school of Pacific affairs and the school##'## of diplomatic studies. I believe that he would be willing to##'## include in the category a research school in social sciences. The right honorable gentleman voiced some misgivings as to whether the Australian National University could do effective work in medical research. That point was dealt with by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley),</inline> who showed clearly that the value of research of that description did not depend upon whether the university which engaged in it was situated in a thickly populated area. As a. matter of fact, that circumstance has very little to do with the value of research. By interjection the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> suggested that the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the most famous seats of learning in the British Isles, do not owe their renown to the localities in which they are situated. In my view a ##'##medical research -school could do work in Canberra which would be as- effective as the work##'## being done in. the research schools of existing universities in the State capitals. The Leader of ##'##the Opposition said that presumably the Government had given careful consideration to this proposal. That is true. It was aided in this regard by a number of committees, on which the universities##'## of Sydney and Melbourne, and also most of the other Australian universities were represented. The members of the committee which reported upon medical- research were : <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. F.</inline> M. Burnett, Director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. S.</inline> McCallum, Commonwealth Director7General of Health ; <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alan</inline> Newton, member of the Central Medical Coordination Committee and  chairman  of the Medical Equipment Control Committee; Professor H. K. Ward, of Sydney University; and Professor R. D. Wright, of Melbourne##'## University. The subject was dealt with carefully by these experts. </para>

                            <para>- I shall endeavour to do so. When the Director-General of Post-war Reconstruction was in London recently he also had the opportunity of consulting <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Howard</inline> Florey on this subject.##'## As honorable members know, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Howard</inline> Florey was the discoverer of penicillin. It transspired during the discussions that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Howard</inline> Florey would be much more emphatic in support of a medical research school at Canberra if, . simultaneously, there was set up in this city a research, school of physical sciences, with which. Professor##'## Oliphant, of Birmingham University, who has been concerned ##'##in the discussions on atomic energy generally, could be associated, because medical research consists not merely of medical experts attending hospitals at which they can see patients, but also of work##'## undertaken in laboratories into problems where contact with patients suffering from certain diseases, or with other experts in the medical field, is not absolutely necessary. I understand that Madame Curie, the discoverer of radium, for example, conducted most of her research activities in an isolated locality. It is not necessary for research workers in the medical or any other field to be in constant close contact with other research workers in that field, although that has ad vantages on some occasions. I believe that the medical research school in Canberra will not suffer in any way by reason of the fact that it is situated in this city, instead of in either Melbourne or Sydney. </para>

                    <para>Another point raised by the Leader of the Opposition was in relation to the name of this university. I have received considerable correspondence on that##'## subject. Some persons believe that it should be called the University of Canberra, whereas others consider that the correct name has been selected. Included among those who support the name selected is one to whose opinion I pay a very great deal of attention - the honorable member, for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley).</inline> Three Australian universities have the names of the capital cities in which they are located, namely, the Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide Universities; but in the three remaining States we have the University of Tasmania, the University of Western Australia and the University of Queensland. This shows that there is some division of opinion as to what name should be given to a university. Some persons consider that the name should be closely related to the city or town in which it is situated, whereas others hold the view that it would be better described by being related to the name of a wider geographical area. I consider that we have chosen correctly in having identified this university with the whole of Australia. Another name that might have been selected, the University of the Commonwealth of Australia, would perhaps have been too long. The name selected is the best that could have been chosen in all the circumstances, and I do not propose to accept any amendment  that might be submitted to effect an alteration of it. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> debated the subject of research being undertaken in agricultural colleges.  There is nothing in the bill to prevent the setting up of a college devoted to agricultural research in Canberra, underthis university. I hope that, in the years to come, when the council of the university sees fit to do so, such an institution will be established. </para>

                        <para>. -There is one feature of the report which perhaps could be elucidated; it arises under the section headed ##"## Periods during which proceedings shall he broadcast##"##. I notice that the broadcast is to commence at the time fixed for the meeting of the House, and that it ##"## shall cease when the adjournment is moved in the House which is being broadcast at that time ##"##. No doubt the committee has given careful consideration to this matter. But I draw the attention of the House to this consideration: There may be occasions when a very important discussion will take place on the motion for the adjournment of the House. Surely the report of the committee should read ##"## shall cease when the motion for the adjournment of the House has been carried ##"## ; in other words, when the House actually adjourns ! Otherwise this position may arise - it frequently has arisen : Some member or members may desire to debate an important matter of general interest on the motion for the adjournment of the House, and the Prime Minister or the Minister in charge of the House may say, as . he has said many times in my experience, ##"## I shall move the adjournment earlier, so that membersmay have an opportunity to debate the matter on that motion ##"##. Under the terms of this report as I understand them - I have just glanced at the document - if the motion for the adjournment of the House were submitted at, say, 10 p.m., however important might be the ensuing debate the broadcast would terminate as soon as the Minister in charge of the House had moved, ##"## That the House do now adjourn ##"##. That means that there would be an automatic exclusion from the broadcast of all debates on the motion for the adjournment of the House - I do not refer to special adjournment motions that are submitted at the beginning of the sittings - even though very many important subjects may be raised which ought to be brought to the notice of the public. </para>

                            <para>- As the honorable member for Darwin very rightly points out, the subjects are important to the members who raise them. It may be very important that the electors should know that their representative has raised a certain matter, and what answer has been made to it by the appropriate Minister. However, all that I say is that this proposal of the joint committee, if adopted, will automatically exclude one debate which is a well-established characteristic of this Parliament, and may occasionally be extremely important and useful. </para>

                        <para>.- The re-broadcasting of questions without notice is to occupy only 35 minutes each evening. We know that it has been the practice for Ministers to interrupt the asking of questions in order to make statements by leave. Sometimes, the statements are important, but at other times they are very long and unimportant. Has the committee considered that a statement by a Minister on leave might occupy the whole of question time? The committee might recommend that Ministers should be asked to make such statements at the end of question time. That would be only fair. It was obvious that the committee would be troubled with matters of this kind which could be avoided if the whole of the proceedings of Parliament were broadcast. </para>

                    <para>Let us ##'## now turn to questions upon notice. It was once the practice in this House to read such questions, and the answers to them, and this is still the practice in the Senate and the House of Commons. Usually, more thought and care is given to drafting questions upon notice and the answers to them than to questions without notice. Are questions upon notice to be completely ignored in the broadcasting? I suggest that the committee arrange to allot a portion . of the broadcasting to such questions. </para>

                        <para>.- As a member of the committee which prepared this report, I ask the House to accept it as a working basis upon which to begin. All the points raised by honorable memberg have been considered by the committee, some of them at##'##length. In reaching this decision, the committee was guided by what it believed to be in the best interests of Parliament, which is the overriding consideration, and also in the interests of the listening public. We had also to take into consideration the technical limitations of the broadcasting system. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I agree with the Leader, of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that the exclusion of debates on the motion for the adjournment of the House is undesirable, but as many of the speeches made on that motion relate to one electorate only, and as the debates come on at a very late hour, it was thought that, at the beginning, at any rate; they should be excluded. It was also thought desirable that the listening public and the broadcasting authorities should know approximately when the broadcasting for the day would finish. However, the matter will receive further consideration, because the motion for the adjournment of the House provides private members with one of their most precious opportunities to air grievances. </para>
                    <para>The matter raised by the Leader of theAustralian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> is one of some complexity. It is desir-- able that we should enable the public to listen to what is undoubtedly the most entertaining part of the proceedings of the House, namely, question time. However, the news broadcast from the Australian Broadcasting Commission stations is at 7 o##'##clock, followed by a  brief commentary which it is thought should not be excluded. Then, it is believed that, before the House meets, an Australian Broadcasting Commission official will explain procedure, and tell the public what business will be discussed by Parliament in the evening. All thisallows only a limited time for the rebroadcasting of questions. Also, it must be remembered that there are two Houses of Parliament to consider* Obviously,, one House will not be able to get on the air at all, and precedence should be given to the questions asked in that House during the day. Our idea was that there should be no selection of questions for re-broadcasting, but that the record of questions and answers should be rebroadcast from the beginning until the time is exhausted. </para>
                    <para>The point raised by the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> has also been considered.  We  have not been able to discuss the matter with representatives of the Government, but. we hope - and I ask the Prime Minister to bear this iri mind - that .the practice will be -adopted by Ministers of making statements by leave at the end of question time. We have also discussed with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> whether it would be practicable  for him to call honorable members at question time in such a way . that those .on the back benches would have an equal opportunity to ask- questions with those on the front benches, and thus have their questions and the answers to. them heard by a larger audience. We suggested that he should keep a list of those who got the call each day, so that those who failed on one day might be given priority at the next sitting. Normally, the leaders and  deputy  leaders on each side of the House are called early by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> We suggest that they might consider other members by spacing their questions more widely, or by deferring some of them until the latter part of question time. </para>
                    <para>This is an all-party committee. In the very brief time at our disposal we considered the various points as fully as was possible. We ask the House to accept the##'## recommendations as a working basis. In the light of experience we shall, I have no doubt, be able to give a more satisfactory service to Parliament and to the public. We are making a beginning, and we all hope that that innovation will prove a success. </para>

                        <para>. -  I support the motion for the adoption of this report . I do not disregard the point made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> about speeches on the motion for the adjournment of the House. As a member of the committee, I assure him that the matter will be looked into by the committee at its next meeting. As for the interruption of questions by ministerial statement, those in charge of the broadcast could disregard such interruptions when preparing the records, so that only the questions themselves and the answers would be re-broadcast in the evening. Questions are the most interesting part of the proceedings of Parliament, but unfortunately, they are asked at a time when a great many people are unable to listen.For that reason the committee has recommended that this part of the proceedings between  7  and  8  o##'##clock in the evening be re-broadcast. </para>

                        <para>. - Owing to the demands on broadcasting time, it is not possible to ensure that all questions asked shall be re-broadcast in the evening, but it is not intended that any selection of questions and answers shall be made by broadcasting officials. A question and its answer can be shut out only because the question is asked after the first  35  minutes of question time. If the suggestions put forward are adopted, every member will have a fair opportunity from day to day to be heard over the air during question time, or of having his question and the answer to it re-broadcast later. This will particularly be the case if Ministers will postpone until after the first  35  minutes the making of statements by leave. The committee is treading new ground, and attempting to solve vast problems. Some of them can be solved only in the light of experience. I hope that the report will be adopted to-day, so that the broadcasting of proceedings may begin next week. </para>

                        <para>. -  As a member of the committee, I hope that the House will adopt the report. Possibly a better report might have been prepared if the committee had had more time. What it has achieved has been possible only by meeting  for  practically all the time that the House itself has been sitting to-day. An effort has been made to ensure that every member shall be given a fair opportunity to be heard over the##'## air, whether during question time or at other times. Questions occur in the mid-afternoon or, when the House meets in the morning, between  10.30  and  11.30,  when a great many people are not able to listen. As the questions are so interesting and valuable, it was thought desirable that this part of the proceedings should be broadcast, as far as possible, after dinner. I am not happy about the proposal that the time allotted for the re-broadcasts should be limited. I would rather that a full hour were allotted to the rebroadcasts so that all the questions asked in both Houses might be heard by the public. However, the committee will have further opportunities to consider the matter and to report to Parliament, and it is hoped that many of the suggestions advanced by honorable members can be adopted later. </para>

                    <para>.- Has the Minister considered prescribing functions for the university additional to those mentioned in the clause? Is it possible, for example, that the university may decide to grant travelling scholarships? The honorable gentleman, who has taken a prominent part in the post-war education of ex-servicemen, will, I am sure, agree that many more overseas scholarships are needed, not only  for  men but also for women. The Rhodes Scholarships are an excellent institution, but they are available only to males. Consideration might be given to the desirability of extending a somewhat similar concession to Australian girls who attend the Australian National University. If the Minister has not already considered this matter, he might ascertain the views of  the vice-chancellors of the other Australian universities. I understand that such a system has already been recommended for application in some State universities. </para>

                    <para>.- In my second-reading speech I referred to the desirability of utilizing, in associa-##"## tion with the university, the professional staff of the Royal Military College at Duntroon, an excellent institution, which has been in existence since 1911. I pointed out that graduates of the West Point Military Academy in the United States of America aregiven a training which fits them to enter the public service or go into civil avocations if they decide not to follow a military career. If the Government is not in favour of the introduction of such a system in Australia consideration might at least be given to the desirability of interchanging the teaching staffs between the college and the university. If that were done, men of high qualifications would be more easily attracted to join the professional staffs of both institutions. </para>

                    <para>.. - Recently, the Chief Justice of Victoria said that the community was losing its sense of moral indignation towards wrong-doing. I desire to express some moral indignation about the widespread wrong-doing which has not been sufficiently discussed in this House, namely, the pillaging of cargoes and the like while in transport. The main reason why I have risen this afternoon is that certain specific instances have come to my notice of pillaging at some time between the loading of the cargo at Victorian ports, and its arrival at the ports of destination in Tasmania. . According to my information - and I believe the figures I am about to cite to be very close to correct - one ship alone had paid ##£##219 compensation for pillage which took place between Melbourne and Burnie, Geelong being an intermediate port of call. At the present time ali claims for pillage are settled by the transport authority on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. When such a large amount is paid in respect of one ship, it indicates that there must be a tremendous leakage on all the ships trading in Australian waters. It has been suggested to me that, apart from the general decline of moral principle which seems to have overtaken the world, there is an. insufficient supervision of cargo. In earlier years, .shipping companies themselves provided that supervision, but when i they are not responsible for the settlement of claims for losses arising from pillage, the same immediate##"## interest is not taken by them. If. possible a system akin to the house detective, should be instituted, and the wharfs##"## and ships should be patrolled, because the leakage is too great to be overlooked, not only from the financial viewpoint, but also from the viewpoint of the preservation of the moral standards of the community. I am informed that many similar cases have occurred. For example,- a large case of dinner-ware was despatched to a retailer in Tasmania, but when it reached its destination, it was found to contain only one piece of crockery. Pillaging is rife, and is being carried out on a well-organized basis, otherwise it would not be easy to abstract almost the whole of the contents of the case in such a way as not to make that fact obvious. Other material would have to be put into the case to make up for the lost weight. </para>

                <para>I propose now to say a few words relating to the Tasmanian shipping service. Although I have raised this matter in the House on many occasions, it is one of such great urgency that I cannot neglect the opportunity once more to emphasize the claims pf Tasmania for a better shipping service. The statement was recently made that one of the difficulties confronting Tasmania at the present time is that there is insufficient labour available to clear the ships at Burnie and Devonport. Large cargoes are awaiting shipment. Within a short distance of these ports, however, are the port of Ulverstone which could take ships of smaller draught than can##"## be taken ##"##at the. principal ports, and also the port of Stanley, 50 miles farther along the coast, which serves a district from which large quantities of potatoes and other agricultural produce are exported every year. The shipping of produce from Stanley will also have the advantage of preventing a great deal of handling in getting the cargoes- to the ship##'##s side. As the potato industry iri Tasmania is worth approximately ##£##10,000,000 a year, it cannot be neglected. The consumption of potatoes in <inline font-style="italic">New</inline> South Wales alone dropped by 400,000 bags during this year, due to the shortage of shipping. It is an enormous amount, and of course it represents not only a loss to the consumer, but also to##'## the grower, and again I urge, the Government to devote particular attention to Tasmania##'##s shipping requirements. I am quite aware that there is a general shortage of shipping, and I appreciate the claims of other parts of the Commonwealth; but I emphasize that Tasmania is the only State that is entirely dependent upon shipping for the transport of heavy commodities. Most of the produce of that State is perishable, and, unless shipping is made available##"## promptly, considerable loss is sustained. What I have said about the provision ##"## of shipping for the carriage of produce from Tasmania applies also to the carriage of goods to the island. I am assured by the Government that the shipping committee has this matter under review constantly, but there is one point to which I have not previously made reference. The section of the Shipping Board dealing with Tasmania- the Tasmanian Shipping Committee - is composed entirely of ship-owners or managers of shipping companies. I impute nothing at all against the gentlemen concerned; but I believe that each of them is likely to look at the matter solely as a shipping proposition, and not as a human problem, and, therefore, is inclined  to allow his mind to run along routine channels instead of dealing with the problem from the more general aspect, which I think is more important at present. I leave the matter with the urgent request that the Government shall give to it more than passing attention, and will endeavour to  deal with the problem from the human point of view, instead of purely as a matter of business. </para>

                    <para>. - There, are two matters to which I shall refer. One is a matter of policy which will require a certain amount of  consideration by the Government, if it has not already been considered. It con.cerns the future- of Italian prisoners of war in Australia. For a long time, some of these men were employed on farms and at other places throughout the Commonwealth, but last March, they were put back into camps and apparently are still there. There is prevalent in the community to-day a belief that the Government is not getting these men out of the  country as quickly as they should be sent, and also that certain people who employed them are endeavouring to have them retained in this country. There is necessarily a conflict of opinion on this subject. I have no doubt as to where I##'## stand on the matter, and I hope that the Government stands on the game ground. According to the Hague Convention dealing with prisoners of war, these men should be returned to their own country at the earliest opportunity. If the Government has any other view on the matter, I request it to make a declaration of policy soon, because the feeling in certain quarters is- inclined to become a little warm. I have no personal knowledge of the actual shipping position, and so far as I know, the Government may have a valid defence - lack of shipping - for its failure to repatriate the men. However, I hope that a clear-cut statement will be made that- it is the intention :of the Commonwealth to conform to the convention- and to return all prisoners of war to their country of origin as soon as possible. If that be done, the second issue with which I wish to deal arises, and_ - -once again it is -a matter of policy. I refer to .the future attitude of the Com-  monwealth Government towards the migration to Australia of former prisoners of war and other  persons from enemy countries. Much has been said about migration, and I think that if ex-servicemen are to be brought to this country, the claims of British ex-servicemen should have first consideration. </para>

                <para class="block">According to some press statements I have seen, there are in the United Kingdom quite a number of men from Southern Ireland who served with the British forces, and who, because of the policy of the Government of Eire, are not permitted to return to that country. They should be included amongst British ex-servicemen who are to be given an opportunity to come to this country. Then, if foreigners are to be encouraged to enter Australia, I point out that there are large numbers of displaced people of Polish nationality who fought with the Allies, and who at##'## present have no desire to return to Poland as .it is governed to-day. These matters are all of first-class importance and call for the attention of the Government. Furthermore, in the interests of politics and administration generally, they call for some clearcut statement of policy. </para>

                    <para>.- I take this opportunity to bring to the notice of the Government some matters which I believe require urgent consideration. First I direct attention to the variation of the subsidy payable ##"##upon milk sold for human consumption in certain parts of Queensland. In places such as the Ipswich district and Southport, the subsidy is limited to the period from May to September of this year, and Ls only 2d. a gallon, whereas milk sold for human consumption in the Brisbane area is subject to a varying payment over a period extending from March to December. The figures are as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">

                </para>
                <para class="block">The point I wish to emphasize is that the subsidy payable on milk sold- for human consumption in the Brisbane- area increases, to as much as 4##£##d. a gallon, and the period of payment extends from March to December, whereas in country areas a flat rate of 2d. a gallon is payable for the shorter period of May to September. The costs of production are the same in each case. The producers are at a loss to understand the reason for the differentiation, and have asked me to seek clarification of the matter. The dairymen are thoroughly dissatisfied. There is no reason for the differentiation. In all the districts the dairymen are having trying times. . The drought has forced them to pay high prices for stock feed. I ask the Minister to have the matter investigated and adjusted before we meet on Wednesday. I ask, too, that the producers who have lost money because of the differential rates be recompensed! I also ask the Minister to conduct an immediate investigation of why for ;the- last four or five months dairy-farmers in the outlying parte of Brisbane have not been receiving their subsidies. They are having a bad enough time coping with the difficulties caused by the drought, and should not have their worries aggravated by being denied the payments due to them. It is bad enough that drought is causing a reduction of the output of the dairy products needed by Great Britain; but it is wicked that administrative shortcomings should be allowed to interfere with production. I ##"## leave the matter there, confident that the Minister will treat it as urgent. </para>
                <para>Once, not so long ago, this country boasted penny postage. Now it costs 2|d. to send a letter. The result is that the revenues of the Postmaster-General##'##s Department are swollen beyond all reason. As I shall show by the citation of the department##'##s earnings, it ought to have sufficient money to provide the services, postal and telephonic, that country residents, particularly, need so badly, but are denied. In 1940-41, the department earned ##£##19,496,213; in 1941-42, ##£##22,462,684; in 1942-43, ##£##25,579,340 ; and in 1943-44, the last year for which figures are available, ##£##27,512,988. But, instead, of paring postal charges in proportion to those steadily increasing earnings, the department has been piling up consistently large surpluses. In 1941-42, the surplus was ##£##5,518,793; in -1942-43, ##£##6,142,645; and in 1943-44, ##£##6,297,103. I should not be surprised if the surplus last financial year was ##£##10,000,000. It is amazing, in view of those gigantic profits that the postage remains at 2-Jd. It is more astounding, in view of its huge, income, that the department is loath to provide postal and telephonic services  to country residents, about the improvement of whose amenities the Government these days makes such a mouthful. In order to illustrate the miser-like attitude of the Postmaster-General##'##s Department, I cite the fact that the experience of myself and other honorable gentlemen who have approached it on behalf of country residents urgently in need of telephones, both public and private, is that we meet with a refusal. When we press the matter, the reply is : ##"## All right, if the applicant will pay ##£##5, ##£##10, ##£##15 or ##£##100 towards the cost- of installation and provide labour and materials, we will provide him with a telephone ##"##. The day appears to be not far -distant when the department will be requiring farmers to mortgage their farms before telephones will be installed. I a6k the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to make representations to his colleague for a re-examination of the departmental, policy towards applicants in country districts for telephones. A further disbursement of the department##'##s huge earnings should be on increasing mail deliveries in rural districts from the present weekly, bi-weekly and tri-weekly deliveries to deliveries six days a week. </para>
                <para>Country people are not the only ones suffering the lack of telephones. Dwellers in the larger centres of population suffer too. In Ipswich, where I live, there are  about  300 people awaiting installation of telephones in their premises. I do not know of any insurmountable obstacles to the giving of such conveniences. During the war thousands of men served as signallers in the services. In that capacity they did work similar to that done by employees##'## of the Postmaster-General##'##s Department. Great numbers of them have been released from the. forces. Under the Re-establishment and Employment Act, they are entitled to preference in employment. They could be employed by  the  Postmaster-General##'##s Department in factories on the manufacture and installation of telephone apparatus. </para>
                <para>Representations have been made to me that the slaughter of beautiful trees and shrubs in Canberra has been intensified. Last week-end I drew the attention of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson)</inline> to the? matter, and <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> reply that a consultative committee of experts and citizens decided what trees should be lopped or removed and that such operations were necessary for structural reasons or because of disease. But I have been told not only that trees are unnecessarily chopped down, but also that other trees are hacked about in a way that no tree-lover would tolerate in his own garden. I- ask the Minister to call for a report and to make sure that there is a better check over this work. </para>

The men who have been told to destroy . certain trees are destroying other trees as well. This is an important matter. A tree cannot grow in ten minutes. I ask the Minister to make sure that the responsible authorities keep a record of trees destroyed and give explicit instructions regarding pruning so that trees will not be seriously disfigured. Upon receiving recommendations regarding work to be carried out, the Minister should have a further check ma.de to sec that the decisions are not exceeded. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) asked that an investigation be made of pillaging on wharfs and also urged an improvement of Tasmanian shipping services. These matters will be brought to the notice of the Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> immediately with a view to having a complete review made of them. I shall also intimate to the Minister the urgency of the honorable member##'##s request. -I assure the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> who pressed for the more speedy repatriation of Italian prisoners of war, that the Government desires to comply in full with all international conventions on the subject. Prisoners of war will be returned to their own countries with all possible expedition. The honorable member also referred to a matter of policy regarding the immigration rights of prisoners of war formerly held in Australia. Ho said that men who had fought as our allies during the war should have prior rights over such persons. I agree wholeheartedly with him, and I am sure that the Government also does so. Men who identified themselves with our cause during the war should have first claim to consideration. We are in agreement on that subject. I have some doubts regarding the position in relation to sporting ammunition. I do not believe that any government action has caused the existing shortage. This matter does not come under my supervision as Minister for Munitions, but I recall that, even before the end of the war, sporting ammunition was not subject to government control. Sporting ammunition is manufactured by private firms, which are responsible for the distribution of supplies. That being so, I am doubtful whether the Government has any responsibility in the matter. However, I shall be glad to have the matter investigated and I shall supply the honorable member with full information on the subject next week. The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> referred to the difference between the prices charged for milk at Ipswich and Brisbane respectively. I shall bring to the notice of the##'## Minister for Commerce and Agriculture his representations regarding the payment of subsidy to milk producers and will seek to get a reply before next Wednesday. Any alteration of postal charges is a matter of government policy. I have no doubt that an announcement will be made by the Prime Minister when the Government decides that they should be reviewed. In the meantime, the honorable member##'##s representations will be considered. . On the subject of the destruction of trees and shrubs in Canberra, I am sure that the Minister for the Interior is earnestly endeavouring to preserve the beauty of our capital city. He is alert to the danger of unnecessarily destroying trees and shrubs, and will see that everything possible is done to prevent spoliation. I am sure that he will give further attention to the honorable member##'##s representations. </para>

                        <para>-Recently, the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> asked a question concerning the Australian Purchasing Mission, and I promised to have a statement prepared setting out the position of this body. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">The honorable member referred to the statement, of policy issued by the United States Department of State regarding the continuance of government purchasing by other countries in the United States of America. In this statement the United States Government declared itself in favour of a return to private channels in international trade and therefore desired that the activities of the various purchasing missions set up in the United States of America during the war should cease as soon as possible. The United States Government recognized that some government participation in trade may have to continue during the transitional period between war and peace, but considered that, as the transitional period drew to a close and emergency needs ceased to exist, the war-time purchasing missions should bc disestablished. This statement was issued on the 2nd April, 1946. By that date, the activities of the Australian Purchasing Mission - Commonwealth of Australia War Supplies Procurement - had already been considerably reduced in keeping with the Australian Government##'##s policy of disbanding the war-time purchasing mission and##"## diverting trade to normal commercial channels. The United States Government was informed accordingly. It was pointed out to the United States Government, however, that while certain cOInmodities in short supply are still subject to international allocation or control by the United States Government, it would be necessary to procure them through government channels. Commodities still being procured in this way are tinned plate, aircraft spare parts, raw cotton and cotton yarn. The staff of Australian War Supplies Procurement has been reduced from its peak of over 600 officers to about 100. The number employed at the 30th June, 3945, was 407 and on the 6th May, 1946, 122. The staff at the 30th June, 1946, was expected to be 99, and it is anticipated that, by the end of this year, the agency will be completely disbanded. Its functions included procurement of military and essential civilian goods under lend-lease and Canadian mutual aid, cash procurement of goods not eligible for supply under lend-lease or Canadian mutual aid, the programming of war-time requirements, and negotiation with American agencies for the shipment of all. goods to Australia by sca and air. The total value of the goods procured by Australian War Supplies Procurement was approximately ##£##550,000,000. When the existing operations of Australian War Supplies Procurement cease, provision will be made for the Australian Consulate-General in the United States of America to carry on  such  future government purchases as are required to meet the needs of Commonwealth Government departments. </para>

                        <para>In view of the serious shortage of coal supplies throughout Australia, with its deplorable effect on industry, transport and the generation of electricity for power and domestic use, will the Prime Minister take up with the Government of New South Wales the following questions for joint action by the State Government and the Commonwealth Government in order to bring about a rapid increase of the production of coal: - 1. That double shifts be worked at all open-cut mines in New South Wales. 2. Immediate development of additional areas of open-cut working at Muswellbrook, Ben Bullen, and other suitable places, as recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Davidson in his report on the coal-mining industry? Also is it not a fact that within two months of the start of stripping operations at the Muswellbrook open-cut, production was 1.000 tons of coal a day? </para>

A double shift is also operating on overburden development at Ben Cullen.

Further areas arc being prospected and/or investigated in the northern and south coast districts of New South Wales. At Muswellbrook within two months of commencing stripping operations, output reached 400 tons, not 1,000 tons. This has gradually expanded each quarter until the average production now is 1,500 to 1,600 tons a day. An additional 500 tons is expected from next week 1 and with further machinery available a still greater expansion is anticipated within a few weeks. </para>

                        <para> -  On the 26th June the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hadley)</inline> asked a question in which he referred to the recent reduction by 1d. a gallon of the price of petrol which, he said, motorists regarded as inadequate. The honorable member also referred to the tax on petrol, and asked that it be reduced by 2 1/2d. a gallon. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I have conferred with the Minister for Trade and Customs on this matter and now inform the honorable member that the tax on petrol is a revenue tax, and any question of its reduction is linked with the general budgetary position andwill receive consideration by the Government, at the appropriate time. Petrol prices are continually under review and are adjusted periodically in accordance with changes of actual costs. The recent trend of costs has been downwards, and if this trend is maintained it will be reflected in lower prices. </para>

                        <para> -  On the 3rd July the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> asked a question concerning the distribution of tobacco with reference to supplies for ex-servicemen. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The National Security (Tobacco Rationing) Regulations were revoked as from the 31st March, 1946. Since that date the tobacco manufacturers have set up a central organization, the Tobacco Manufacturers Committee, and, in each State, a Tobacco Trade Distribution Committee. These bodies operate on a purely voluntary basis, but it is understood that the aim of the tobacco manufacturers is to continue the distribution of tobacco on the same lines as existed under the National Security Regulations. Complaints have been received from time to time by the Department of Trade and Customs regarding the distribution of tobacco by the tobacco manufacturers, but, as the Commonwealth Government now has no authority in the matter, these complaints have been referred to the Tobacco Manufacturers Committee. It is suggested that the honorable member should adopt the same course in regard to any complaints  received  by him. </para>

                    <para>  -  On the 27th June the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> asked me a question concerning the issue of discharge certificates in the Navy. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>This matter has been taken up with the naval authorities, and I now inform the honorable member that, when a rating is entered into the Navy, a certificate of service is prepared in which is shown the ships and establishments in which he has served, examinations passed, and medals awarded, together with an assessment of his character and efficiencey at the 31st December of each year during his service. This certificate, which is given to the rating on discharge, is his passport through life, and is of material assistance in obtaining subsequent employment. This form of certificate, has been in existence since the inception of the Royal Australian Navy, and is amended from time to time te meet existing conditions. A great majority of- naval ratings would  prefer their certificate of service to a discharge certificate such as is issued by the Army and the Air Force. The question of issuing a discharge certificate in  addition  to the certificate of service will be the subject of review. </para>
