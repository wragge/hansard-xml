                        <para>- Can the Minister for the Interior furnish any information in relation to negotiations with the Government of South Australia for the running of a third passenger train weekly between Perth and Adelaide and thence to Melbourne? Prior to the war, when this additional service was provided, was a concessional fare allowed to railway employees, and to members of football and other sporting teams which travelled as a body? Was this concession suspended during the currency of the war? If so, is it intended to grant it afresh when the third train is restored? If the restoration is not to be made automatically, will the Minister consider its immediate application, and thus confer a distinct benefit on the Perth and West Perth football teams which propose to travel  to the eastern States this year, and help considerably many footballers who have returned to the game for the first time this year after lengthy and noble service in the defence of their country? </para>

                        <para>- I am able to inform the honorable  member  that arrangements have been completed for the provision of an extra regular passenger train each week to and from Western Australia, commencing from Melbourne on Thursday, the 25th July, and from Perth on Monday, the 29th July. This has been made possible by the withdrawal of a regular military personnel train service. Concession fares were discontinued as the result of a decision by the various Railways Commissioners in 1941, because of the heavy traffic on the railways at that time. I see no reason why the concession should not be restored, and I have instructed the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner to raise the matter at the next conference of Railways Commissioners. </para>

                        <para>- I have not read the report to which the honorable member has referred, but I can assure him that the statement has no basis in fact. On a recent visit to South Australia, I had a conference on the matter with the Premier of that State and the Leader of the Opposition in the South Australian House of Assembly. The difficulty that arose was that South Australia was endeavouring to have the construction of this line included in the general scheme for the standardization of railway gauges. The Commonwealth Government was not prepared at that time to have it so included, but it has again considered the matter and I am hopeful that it will he able to assist South Australin with regard to it. </para>

                    <para>- I disclaim any responsibility for the indefensible act of the Government in granting such a big additional area to a lessee already possessing 10,600 square miles of land. When the Minister said that people of the Northern Territory lacked representation in this Parliament he could be referring only to me, and to my absence from Australia as a member of the 8th Division Australian Imperial Force, and to the fate which honorable members well know befell me in becoming a prisoner of war in the hands of the Japanese for three and half years. I am obliged to make this personal explanation in an endeavour to clear myself of the intolerable charge levelled against me by the Minister that an indefensible administrative act of his department occurred only because I was a member of the Australian Imperial Force, and a prisoner of war. I am astonished that the reply of the Minister should amount to an admission that his department had performed in my absence an administrative act which would never have been attempted had I been in my place in this House. </para>

The ordinance provided that when a lease expired by effluxion of time, the new lease was to be disposed of by ballot.. In the particular instance referred to there was only one applicant for the lease, the Alexandra Downs Company, to which it was eventually granted. I further explained that action had been taken by this Government to prevent such a thing happening again. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to make a personal explanation touching the statement of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Johnson)</inline> that while I was Minister for the Interior I had neglected to amend the Crown Lands Ordinances of the Northern Territory, thereby making inevitable the allocation to a lessee who held 10,600 square miles of country an' additional 825 square miles for a period of 42 years. My explanation is that nothing in the Crown Lands Ordinances, as they existed during the term of my administration, prevented the resumption of land from lessees who held large areas. On the contrary, they specifically provided for the resumption of areas - 25 per cent. after 10 years, and 50 per cent. after 20 years. The managing director Alexandra Downs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forrest,</inline> interviewed me personally, and made representations that I should not exercise my right, as Minister, to resume 25 per cent. of the area of his lease. I told him - and I am sure the records of the Department of the Interior will support my statement - that nothing would prevent me from resuming the proportion of his lease that I was entitled as Minister to resume, for the purpose of making it available for new settlers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forrest's</inline> company was able to obtain the additional area only by an unprecedented administrative act of the Department of the Interior during the term of office of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> by advertising as available the' resumable proportion of the lease before the resumption fell due. Because this method was followed the department established the sole right of the Alexandria Downs Company again to secure a lease of the additional area. </para>

                        <para>- The high prices of motor cars are due largely to the fact - that the vehicles, or, at least, their main components, are imported, and that in the countries of origin, namely the United Kingdom and the United States of America, prices have risen considerably. As to reducing the sales tax on motor cars, that matter will be considered when a general review of the sales tax is being made. </para>

If the Government's attitude has not changed, will the Prime Minister consider the desirability of conducting a further governmental inquiry into costs of production in the zone, with a view to fixing a return to the producers which will enable them to pay their way in both good and bad seasons? </para>

It is true that some time ago an arrangement was made with the State Government for a committee to inquire into the circumstances of dairy farmers in the milk zone who had suffered as the result of drought or dry weather conditions. Costs of production in the dairying industry have been made the subject of a number of inquiries and are constantly under review by the Prices Commissioner. However, I shall consider the representations made by the honorable member. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I know, the reason why public servants to whom the honorable member refers join outside organizations is that they are offered a higher remuneration than they receive in the Public Service. The three particular public servants who, I think, the honorable member has in mind were in constant contact during the war with outside organizations and public men who learned to appreciate the ability and capacity of many Commonwealth public servants. Despite what has been said about these officials being bureaucratic, outside organizations have been anxious to obtain their services and have been prepared to offer to them much more attractive terms than the Commonwealth Government is able to offer to them. On the other hand, many men transfer from private enterprise to the Public Service, and in the long run the losses and gains almost balance. I believe that the Commonwealth Public Service contains officers of as fine a type as is likely to be found in any other country. </para>

                    <para> - Settlement of ex-servicemen on the land in the States- was fully debated in this House recently. I shall see whether a further statement on the matter is required from me. The matter of single-farm units has been discussed with the  State  governments over a long period. The agreement reached at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers excludes single-farm units from the land settlement scheme. That lias been made clear to State Ministers who have made representations to me on the matter. The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia is completely opposed to single-farm units chosen by individual ex-servicemen - I think the term " singlefarm units " may be misleading - as being unfair and inequitable to the very large number of ex-servicemen who would have no chance to obtain farms under similar conditions. </para>

                        <para>- That matter has been considered by the Minister for Supply and Shipping. The Commonwealth Government has no constitutional power in peace-time to fix a flat rate for petrol throughout Australia, although it is true that it could do so temporarily under the National Security Act. However, because some petrol companies operate in only a small way and distribute supplies only in the capital cities and the larger companies supply country areas as well as the cities, it would be obviously unfair to declare a flat rate, which would differentiate between the rates of profit of companies operating in the same trade. </para>

                        <para>- Under the National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations wages are pegged at rates ruling on a certain date, and it is illegal both for an employee to receive, and an employer to pay, wages in excess of those rates. To the management of certain firms namely, the Purcell Engineering Co, Pty. Ltd., and Babcock and Wilcox Ltd., both of Sydney, members of the Federated Ironworkers Union and the Moulders Union have intimated that, unless they are paid an over-all increase of 10s. a week, ballots will be taken each week to decide which employees shall resign from these firms, thus defying the law, and visiting great loss upon the employers. As this action would be a breach of the National Security Regulations and of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, rendering those concerned liable to heavy penalties, does the acting Attorney-General propose to take any steps to uphold the laws that this Government itself introduced? </para>

                        <para>- It is true that supplies of insulin became very low because cattle were not being slaughtered in Queensland, but the position was not so acute that persons requiring the drug were unable to obtain it. The Minister for Health quickly arranged for stocks of pancreas in the north to be hard-frozen, and brought south to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in order to maintain continuity of the supply of insulin. The danger has now passed. Insulin can be made quickly. I am certain that no difficulties will now arise in providing supplies for patients, but I shall ask the Minister for Health to supply to the honorable member the exact figures regarding stocks. </para>

                    <para>This bill is intended not only to give effect to undertakings given to unions and employers when dilution agreements were made between the Federal Government, employers organizations, and trade unions in the early days of the war, but also to assist in the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen. Whilst dilution necessarily involved a lowering of trade standards to meet war requirements, the normal standards of the trades were to be restored as soon as dilution was no longer essential. The present Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies) headed the Government of the day which was a party to those agreements. Both Labour ministries since then accepted fully the terms of the agreements. In 1942 the late Mr. Curtin, as Prime Minister, re-affirmed in the House the promise to restore normal trade practices at the end of hostilities. The present </para>
                    <para class="block">Government considered that this agreement would unduly prejudice the rehabilitation prospects of a number of returning servicemen, and therefore undertook negotiations with employers and unions. As aresult of these negotiations," the scheme provided for in this bill was evolved, and whilst it adequately fulfils the earlier agreement in regard to the protection of recognized tradesmen, it will also make a material contribution to the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen by making it possible for a number of them to enter the skilled metal trades. </para>
                    <para>It will be recalled that with the fall of France in May, 1940, it became obvious that Australia would not only have to depend on its own resources for the production of arms for its own forces, but also would have to help to supply the munitions required by the mother country and allied forces in the Middle East. However, the huge munitions programme contemplated could not be carried out without considerable increase of the number of tradesmen in the engineering and related trades. The Menzies Government approached the trade unions and employers organizations, and agreement was reached on a scheme of dilution to meet these exceptional needs. Under the dilution agreement, the unions assented to the relaxation of existing trade customs and practices to enable semi-skilled and partly trained workers to perform work normally carried out by fully qualified tradesmen. It was, however, fully understood that this action would not be permitted to prejudice the ultimate rights of the recognized tradesmen. The dilution regulations subsequently made under the National Security Act give clear expression to these principles. Honorable members know that the munitions programme expanded almost beyond recognition after the extension of the war into the Pacific, and the skilled metal trades were diluted, to a far greater degree than had been originally planned. Approximately 50,000 men were added to the diluted trades, and although a large number of these have now returned to their normal occupations, 24.000 still remain in employment as added tradesmen. </para>
                    <para>The temporary need which brought these men into this field developed in </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia new industrial activity, a part of which at least is likely to be permanent. It is only right and proper that these new avenues of employment should not be closed to men who have been absent in the armed forces. The bill, therefore, makes provision for the admission to the engineering, boiler-making, blacksmithing, electrical, and sheet-metal trades of ex-servicemen who have had sufficient training and experience in those trades while in the forces to enable them, after a reasonable period of probation or training in employment, to reach the standard of skilled tradesmen. Honorable members will be aware that the Navy, Army and Air Force needed large numbers of technicians to meet the demands of modern mechanized warfare, and for this many thousands of servicemen were trained in special technical work. Naturally, many of these men will not wish to use this technical skill in civil life. Many have other occupations to which they prefer to return. For others, however, this skill acquired in the services, and the opportunities provided by this bill, will be a means of rehabilitation. At the same time, I must warn honorable members that the Australian engineering industry, despite its expansion since 1939, has not unlimited absorptive capacity, and, therefore, one function of the committees provided for in the bill will be to avoid the overloading of industry, which would result in the ultimate unemployment of both ex-servicemen and recognized tradesmen. To avoid such overloading, some portion of the dilution structure must be retained in the interests of all. Following upon conferences which were held with representatives of the appropriate employer organizations and unions, the provisions of the engineering, boilerrnaking, blacksmithing, electrical, and. sheet-metal trades dilution regulations were revised and amended in March of this year to meet the new situation, and the substance of this bill is, for all practical purposes, identical with that of the amended regulations. </para>
                    <para>The bill provides for administrative machinery to control the scheme by central and local trades committees similar in composition and functions to the committees of unions and employers which administered the dilution scheme. These committees will have the additional duty of settling matters concerning the employment of the different categories of tradesmen, and will be Industrial Committees under the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1945, in respect of these trades.. First priority in employment is accorded to " recognized tradesmen " - (a) in respect of engagements, by the provision in clause 43 that an employer shall not employ on tradesmen's work any person other than a. " recognized tradesman " if a competent recognized tradesman is available and offering for employment; and (b) in respect of dismissals or retrenchments, by the provision in the same clause that the "recognized tradesman " would be the last to go unless a local committee consented otherwise, and subject to an employer exercising award rights to dismiss an employee for malingering, neglect of duty, or misconduct. </para>
                    <para>Provision is made for ex-servicemen with training and experience in the trade, acquired in the forces, to become " recognized tradesmen " in three ways :  - </para>

                            <para>Ex-servicemen who have gained some trade skill in the forces and are eligible for training benefits' under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme may be authorized as "trainee-tradesmen" by a local committee, and after a reasonable period of training on the job may be certified as " recognized tradesmen ". </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>It will be noted that both " probationary tradesmen " and " traineetradesmen " will receive the full tradesman's rate of wages, but in respect of " traineetradesmen " a part of the wage will be paid by way of training benefit under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme. Applications to a local committee for admission as a " probationary " or " trainee-tradesman " must be made, unless there are exceptional circumstances, within six months after the ex-serviceman's discharge from the forces or after the 22nd March, 1946, whichever is ' the later. So as to avoid any misunderstanding; I point out to honorable members that the 22nd March is, in fact, the date on which the scheme was brought "into effect by the National Security (Trades Dilution) Regulations No. 2. </para>
                    <para>I commend the bill to the House, in the hope that it will be treated . as a non-party matter. Both sides of the House will wish to redeem the pledge to our bona fide tradesmen that pre-war practices and customs would be restored, and will also desire to provide for a just measure of rehabilitation to men who have served in the forces. In concluding, it is fitting that I should pay a just tribute to men who, as skilled tradesmen or added tradesmen, contributed their part in factory and workshop, and also to the trade unions and employers, without whose voluntary acceptance of the dilution principles our munitions programme could not have been carried out. In the name of the Government and the people of Australia, I thank, those employer and employee organizations which so wholeheartedly co-operated in administering  the  wartime scheme and are now further co-operating in the administration of the scheme that is incorporated in the bill. </para>

                            <para>- The then. Leader of the Opposition, the late Mi-. Curtin, was asked to fulfil his promise of 100 per cent, co-operation with the Government, and to assist in organizing conference? of unions and employers, with a view to devising means for increasing the number of technical tradesmen in this country. The .present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and I were detailed to assist the Government.- I remember attending the first conference, which was held in the offices of the Munitions Department in William-street, Melbourne, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> in the chair. The Munitions Department represented to the conference that, on a peace-time basis, 7,000 toolmakers  would be required to complete the contracts that were in hand for that one year. A census showed that there were only 500 of these tradesmen in the Commonwealth wilh a peace-time status. </para>

                            <para>- We hope that, there will be no dismissals. This measure has been introduced so that a promise made when the shortage had to be overcome may be kept. The trade unions and the employers agreed conjointly to  break down the customs of the past by accepting semi-skilled men as fully skilled, and regarding unskilledmen as semi-skilled. That was the only way to get over the difficulty. The present Government and the previous Administration repeatedly promised the recognized tradesmen that their positions would be restored to them after the war. . If ever the stage be reached at which dismissals will be necessary, the last men to be dismissed will be those who have been recognized as tradesmen. This Parliament should not only keep that promise, but should also provide for the employment of further quotas of ex-servicemen who have had experience in the metal trades and are to he given a short probationary training. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has his own methods, and they are not the usual methods of honorable members generally. I paid what I considered to be an adequate tribute to the company for the handling of this section of its business. I know that it has done a fine piece of work for Australia in respect of not only its overseas services, but also its Australian manufacturing interests. It may be said to the credit of the company that it has never had an industrial dispute among its employees, but, has maintained the happiest relations with them. Altogether it employs about 5,000 people, and I think the number was as high as 7,000 during the war. These men and women have rendered good service to their country and to the company that employed them. If there is any feeling at all that 'the tribute has not been adequate, I add that the Government is highly appreciative of the services of the company and its employees. </para>

                    <para>The honorable member for Wentwortb also said that no other British country had yet ratified the proposal in the over-all agreement recommended at the conference on telecommunications in 1945, and he asked why Australia should be the first to ratify it. He argued that we should proceed slowlyin the work of ratification. My reply is that all of the British Commonwealth governments concerned have approved of the form of the over-all  agreement, and have indicated their  in1 .eli tion  to proceed to a full implementation of the plan for the nationalization of the oversells telecommunications, services. </para>

The third point taken by the honorable member was that the Government should consider the operation of the services through the medium of the Postmaster-General's Department rather than by setting up a commission. The honorable member said that the scheme should be debated in a non-party atmosphere, but before he concluded his remarks he descended to gross personalities. He alleged that the idea of the Government in proposing to set up a commission, was to find an opportunity to give jobs to its supporters. He instanced the appointment of the former honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coles)</inline> as  chairman  of the National Airlines Commission.

                    <para>Henty was selected on his merits to be  chairman  of the Commonwealth Airlines Commission, and if success in business is to be regarded as the criterion of a man's capacity to manage a big business organization, the honorable member for Henty is much better fitted for the position than is any honorable member opposite. The honorable member for Henty. is one of Australians true patriots. He has been actuated, not by base personal motives, but by a desire to serve his country. He has been prepared, even at the cost of injuring his business, to put the nation's interest first, and that is more than can be said of many of his critics. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member should understand that it is fundamental to the plan agreed upon at the London conference that the organization to be set out in each Empire country should be a separate entity ; that is, either a public corporation or' company wholly owned by the Government; or, in the event of this proving to be impracticable in any country, and if the organization is a part of a government department, it should take the form of a separate undertaking. The reason for these arrangements is that the plan agreed upon is Empire-wide, and that under such a plan the government bodies in each Empire country will contribute on an agreed basis towards the expenses of a central board to be established in London, and towards the maintenance "of the  extensive submarine cable system. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition seems to imagine that this is to be a purely Australian concern with no Empire associations. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member further argued that an arrangement by which the Postmaster-General's Department would undertake the operation of overseas telecommunication services would enable many miles of telegraph lines now used by cable and wireless companies to be released for the use of the department. I point out that special telegraph channels for the handling of overseas traffic would still he needed even were the department to assume the operation of overseas tele-  communication services. Thus, there would not be anything like the saving in the use of telegraph lines which the honorable member envisages. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member also asked how the interests of the cable staff employed in foreign countries by Cable and Wireless Limited were to be protected. This is a matter for determination by the British Government, which will acquire the assets of Cable and Wireless Limited. Under the London conference plan, the British Government has agreed to protect the interests of the employees, and there is no reason to doubt that it will do so. </para>
                    <para>The honorable member said that a government institution was not so well suited to carry out research and developmental work as were private undertakings. The answer to that is to be found in the record of the Postmaster-General's Department, which maintains  one of the finest research laboratories in the country. No private enterprise could succeed in research as does the postal department. </para>

                            <para>- That is a very big organization, but it has been in financial difficulties for many years, because it is not able to compete with new methods of overseas communications. Even though wireless communication offers an alternative method to communication by cable, the Government of Great Britain found it necessary for many reasons, including the need for secrecy during the war, to keep the cables in operation, and therefore subsidized the company so that it might carry on. It would have been foolish for Empire governments to take over wireless communications without also taking over the cables. It will be the responsibility of the governments of the countries concerned to undertake research work to ensure that advantage is taken of all developments in the science of communication, in respect of both radio and undersea cables. There is in Melbourne a very fine laboratory associated with the Postmaster-General's Department. There is in Sydney another very fine research centre, although a smaller one, associated with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and the Government has no desire to close it down. There cannot be too many of these laboratories. We learned that during the war. We experienced great difficulty because at first we did not have enough research laboratories and worse still, not enough trained research workers. Nothing, will be done to disperse the research workers associated with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, or to lessen the efficiency of its laboratories. </para>

It was imposed for war purposes, and the war is not yet over for at least 100,000 men who are still in uniform. The transition from war to peace is still in process, and that is the most difficult and most dangerous stage of all. We have not yet returned to the halcyon days of peace. Postal" and telephone charges are bound up with national finances. When it is possible to reduce the charges they will' be reduced. </para>

It is illuminating to hear the 'members of the newly-formed Liberal party endorsing such tory views. This Government does not subscribe to them. Asa matter of fact, there are good reasons why, in this instance, the Government should retain its interests in the business activities of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The Commonwealth has participated in those activities over the last 24 years, and there is no good reason why it should now vary an arrangement which has worked so successfully. ' </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In any case, since the Government is taking away the major part of the company's business, it is morally bound to help the shareholders to preserve their interest in the restricted sphere in which the company will in future be operating. During the period of the company's reconstruction it would be unfair for the Commonwealth' to withdraw its financial investment in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The company will be faced with many problems in re-arranging its organization, and the withdrawal of the Commonwealth's financial investment at such a juncture would place it in an unfortunate position. The Government does not desire that such a position should arise, and therefore it proposes to help the company by allowing its investment to remain. Some honorable members opposite hold a different view; they believe that the best way to help the company would be for the Government to withdraw its money. </para>

I said that the use of the information was, to say the least, highly, improper.' I did not criticize the 'right honorable gentleman for using it. The man who gave it to him was guilty of a misuse of information. Finality has not yet been reached with the company, but negotiations for an agreement are proceeding. . The Government is of the opinion that it is better to reach an agreement by negotiation, if that can be done, rather than that it should provide a feast for lawyers such as the honorable member for Warringah. That certainly would be a misuse of public funds. If we are to pay compensation in 'the way indicated by the Prime Minister, who is also Treasurer, honorable members can rest assured that neither too much nor too little will be paid. The figure which will ultimately be arrived at will probably be less than if a case were allowed to drag through the law courts of this country, until finally a number of judges in either Australia or Great Britain decided the issue, without knowing as much about the operations of the company as do the people who are at present conducting the negotiations. I point out that,_ in addition to the purchase of the physical assets of the company, the Government must have regard to the loss of profits resulting from the termination of the agreement. The company has always maintained that it has valuable interminable rights. Whether it has them or not, the fact remains that it makes that claim. Such ii claim cannot be dismissed in the flippant way that the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> would dismiss it. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. It must not be forgotten that in acquiring the telecommunications assets and services of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, the Commonwealth will acquire also .the revenue benefits arising out of the conduct of such services solely by a government authority. That revenue is considerable. Indeed, trade rivals of Amalgamated -Wireless (Australasia) Limited say that that company has been able to compete successfully in its manufacturing sphere of activities because of the diversion thereto, as subsidies, of profits from the telecommunications section; Adequate and reasonable compensation must be paid to the private shareholders of the company for the loss of their rights. No good purpose would be served by the appointment of a  panel  of experts, as the Government has confidence in its present advisers. Whatever the final compensation figure arrived at may. be, honorable members may rest assured that it will be fair to the company as well as to the taxpayers. I doubt whether experts equal in ability and knowledge to the two gentlemen who are conducting the . negotiations could be found. Although they have been named by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> I repeat that the task has been entrusted to the Secretary of the Treasury, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McFarlane,</inline> and the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fanning.</inline></para>

                    </continue><para>The -honorable member for Barker said that the charges imposed by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for ship to ship and ship to shore communications are high compared with those in other British countries. The reply to that observation is that the rates for this class of traffic are determined by the agreement entered into between the administrations of the countries concerned, the shipping companies, and the bodies operating the coastal radio stations. The charges made by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited are in accordance with that agreement. In some British countries the rates are higher than those charged by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in the Australian and New Zealand zones. In respect of British ships operating beyond those zones', Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has offered to reduce the rates to the lower level obtain-' ing here, but with the exception of one company, the authorities controlling such ships have not so far accepted the offer.

(sterling) per word, according to classification of ship and nationality, and according to the coast station through which the message is transmitted. Particulars regarding the corresponding charges levied in New Zealand are not readily available but information in this respect will be obtained later if so desired. </para><para class="block">The other points raised by the honorable member for Barker were equally interesting, but not very convincing. He said that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited had certain monopolies over patents which he questioned its right to possess. The reply to that observation is that as between the Commonwealth and the company the matter of patent rights was covered by Part II. of the Wireless Agreement 1927. That part of the agreement was completely determined on 1st March, 1934, by processes therein provided. Since that date the company's claims to those rights have ceased to exist. The honorable member is just twelve years out of date, but that is nothing exceptional for him. When I asked him why, when he was Postmaster-General, he did not rectify some of the things about which he now complains, the honorable gentleman replied that he was in office for only five months. The average member of the Australian Labour party would not need five months in which to rectify something which he believed to be wrong. The honorable member apparentlynot only wasted the whole of the five months he was in office, because he did nothing to remedy the things he complains about to-day, but he also did not even attempt to find out what the position was because he has referred to something which, on the evidence, ceased to exist about twelve years ago. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I accept the correction, which is indicative of the honorable member's mind on all questions. And the fact that he is even temporarily under the  deputy  leadership of the honorable member for Wentworth is also merely an accidental circumstance. The plan for co-ordinating overseas telecommunications throughout the British Commonwealth and Empire, as recommended by the London Telecommunications Conference of 1945, was accepted in principle by all thegovernments of the British Commonwealth, not only those that had the advantage of an up-to-date, progressive Labour outlook, but even by those that were somewhat backward in their outlook. It is fundamental to that plan that the organization to be set up should be a separate entity, that is, either a public corporation or a wholly government owned company, or, in the event of that proving impracticable in any country, and if the organization is part of a government 'department, it should take the form of a separate undertaking. I have already said that in' respect of the observations of the honorable member for Wentworth, and I feel impelled to repeat the statement in order to make the position clear in relation to the observations of the honorable member for Barker. The reason for this arrangement is that the plan agreed upon is Empire-wide, and that under such plan the governmnent bodies in each Empire country will contribute on an agreed basis towards the expenses of a central board to be established in London, and towards the maintenance of the extensive submarine cable system. We cannot look at this merely as a problem associated with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, Cable and Wireless limited and the Australian Postmaster-General's Department. A general rule should be laid down, claimed the honorable member for Barker - who, by the way, observes no rules at all in respect of anything - that an activity of this kind should either be a 100 per cent, government undertaking or left wholly to private enterprise. The honorable gentleman is certainly an extremist ; he goes the limit whichever way he decides. There is a happy medium in all things, a,nd this (Government commends itself to the Australian people because it is always able to discover the happy medium, not only in respect of a matter such as is covered by this bill, but also in all other matters/ Overseas telecommunications <inline font-style="italic">ais</inline> provided for in the bill will be a 100 per cent, government undertaking. The Government's interest in the manufacturing activities of the company is not covered by a provision in the bill as it now stands, but by an agreement that may be made under clauses 23, 49a and 52 of the bill as they will be amended later. Some of those who at present are employed in cable and wireless services are fearful of their fate under the new arrangement, said the honorable member for Barker. The honorable gentleman went further and said that I had given no clear statement of what the Government proposes to do with these employees. Suitable provision has, however, been made in clause 18 (.11 ) of the bill' for the .protection of the interests of the cable and radio employees. Following the implementation of that provision, the Government intends to set up a committee to give consideration to all matters affecting all employees concerned in the transfer of the telecommunication services. That committee will consist of representatives of the two companies, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Cable and Wireless Limited and of the Government, and whatever is decided upon will no doubt be given effect immediately and without difficulty. </para>

The framing of provisions defining the rights of employees would, in the opinion of the legal  advisers of the Government, be beyond the capacity of the Parliamentary  Drafts]nan, and  even if they could be framed, their, inclusion in the bill may even be beyond the right of the Parliament.

                    </interjection><para>Mr. CALWELL.- The honorable member's memory is badly at fault. Such moneys as have been paid to the company have been paid in accordance with the 1922 and 1927 agreements which are binding upon the Government. For instance, the 1922 agreement exempted th&lt;' company from payment of terminal charges to the Commonwealth, but this provision was altered later and the company was required to pay those charges. In addition, the company was required to pay to the Commonwealth 30 per cent, of the revenue it re'ceived from its coastal and island services. Thus, instead of receiving a subsidy, the company was required to make a contribution from its revenue to the Government. In order to compensate the company to some degree for the loss incurred on its coastal and island traffic, and in consideration of the company discharging certain obligations of the Commonwealth in respect, of safety of life at sea. the Commonwealth agreed to pay £45,000 per annum. But the Commonwealth would have been obliged to pay that amount to any instrumentality for sending messages from 'the shore to vessels at sea. However, this payment by the Commonwealth is more than balanced by the revenue received by the Commonwealth. If there is anything wrong with the agreement, the honorable member for Barker has been long enough n member of tha Parliament to raise his voice in the councils of the various parties to which he has given his doubtful allegiance, and in the various governments in which he has served with considerable notoriety, .with a view to effecting any remedy he desired. However, he comes now, in 1946, like an 'avenging angel with a fiery sword, and says that he is going to have something fixed up. There is nothing to fix up now. because the case put up by the honorable member is based on shifting sands: The amounts paid by the company for the year ended the 30th June, 1945, totalled £101,417, consisting of £91,874 in respect of terminal charges for beam service, £3,S00 in respect of terminal charges for. coastal and island radio services, and £c&gt;,743, representing 30 per cent, of revenue from its coastal and island radio services. Allowing for a contra amount of £45,000 paid to the company by the Commonwealth, the balance in favour of the Commonwealth was £56,417. That was the position in a typical year, but in other years the balance in favour of the Commonwealth was greater. Therefore, instead of all the dreadful revelations regarding payments by the Commonwealth to the company year afteryear, which the honorable member said! the files would disclose, the fact is that last year the Commonwealth received from the company £56,417. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The argument is not, whether the company received value. The honorable member for Barker said that the Commonwealth was paying out a lot of money to the company which it ought not to be paying out - that the Commonwealth was subsidizing the company. The truth of the matter, as I have shown, is that the company is making very heavy payments to the Commonwealth. No subsidy is paid to the company. The aspect of service does not arise. I have no doubt, however, that the company has provided very good service for the money that it has received, and that the Commonwealth has not paid more for that than was fair and equitable. </para>

The honorable member for Bourke urged an extension of the system of competitive examination to all  employees rather than limiting ' such examinations to clerical employees only. He also suggested the establishment of , a promotion appeals board by the commission as is provided for in the Commonwealth Bank Act.' The conditions of employment of technical and other em'ployees, except .clerical employees, will call for the laying down of certain qualifications. It may be considered that the commission should make any necessary detailed arrangements in this connexion by the issue of regulations under the act rather than by specific provision in  the  act itself. In respect of the promotions appeals board it may be "preferable, if an appeal board is to be set up by the commission to determine questions relating to promotions, that the matter be dealt with by the issue of regulations under the act- and not by special provision in the act itself.  However,  I am impressed by the remarks of the honorable gentleman, and I have referred the matters he raised to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> with a view to determining whether any amendments should be made to clause 18 of the bill to cover the points at issue, or whether it would be preferable to deal with these matters by way of regulations issued under the act." If it is found desirable, certain provisions in this respect will be included in the bill at a later stage. I shall, ask the Postmaster-General to make such amendments in the Senate. </para><para>I come now to the speech of the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who, among Opposi-tion members, at least knows something about the measure. He has played a very important role in guiding, the relations of the Commonwealth Government with the various telecommunication companies which have operated in Australia. He urged that provision should be made in sub-clauses 10 and 11 of clause 18 for the transfer to the service of the commission of telecommunication employees of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited to the maximum extent possible.  I  have already stated that it is the intention of the Government to set up an ad <inline font-style="italic">hoc</inline> committee consisting of representatives of the company, the Treasury, the commission and the employees to deal with all matters concerning pensions, furlough, superannuation and like rights, and to consider the matter of compensation to any employees who may be prejudicially affected by the- change-over. The conditions relating to the employees in the reconstructed manufacturing company will be a responsibility of the company, but discussions are proceeding with a view to their interests being fully protected as far as it is practicable to do so: The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> dealt largely with the situation at Gibraltar.

Nothing has transpired in denial of the fact that' the private shareholders in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited are to receive about £1,400,000 in respect of fewer than 500,000 shares mid for only about half of the assets and activities of the company. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> :said last night that negotiations for a satisfactory arrangement with the private shareholders had been in progress for some time, and that the House could not be given the figures on which the negotiations were based because it was necessary that the private shareholders :should first have the opportunity to discuss the matter. I remind the right honorable gentleman that the people of Australia, of whose interests he is a custodian, own more than half of the shares in the company and that they are equally entitled to information on which to decide, whether a part of the assets arid activities of the company ought to be taken over on the terms proposed. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but since June the shares have stood at 7ls. 6d. a share, whereas the price in 1942 was 43s. 6d. A share at 71s. 6d., on last year's dividend rate, would return £2 15s. lid. per cent., which is less than the return from Commonwealth bonds. The capital of the company is approximately £1,000,000. At the date of the last balance-sheet, reserves, other than specific reserves, amounted tq £625,878. So, each share at the date of the last balance-sheet had a backing of 30s. lid., whereas buyers are offering 71s. 6d. That shows that the price of 7.1s. 6d. is a result of those negotiations. It shows more than that. I ask the Minister to note this point. It shows that 71s. 6d. a share is the market value of shares having a backing of only 30s. lid. of shareholders' funds, according to balance-sheet figures. That establishes the value surely. Buyers offer 71s. 6d. for all the activities of the company, including the section that this Government proposes to buy on the basis of £3 a share.

The shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, operating as it is now, are quoted at 7ls, 6d., so, for 50. per cent, of the shares and activities of the' company the Government is to pay £6 a share. That is the case, and if it does not warrant an investigation by a select committee in order to protect the Australian people, who own more than half of the company's shares, I do not know what does. </para>

                        <para>.- I repeat the demand which I made in my second-reading speech that the Minister should give a definite and unqualified assurance that those persons who, at the time 'of this agreement, were employed by Cable and Wireless Limited, should have preserved their continuity of employment, long-service leave, pension and superannuation rights, retiring allowances, and furlough. When they joined the organization in its infancy they acquired those rights. They have endured the " heat and burden of the day" in the service of the company. They have been stationed in many distant parts of the British Empire. Although the Minister has forecast a number of amendments to clause IS, none of - them gives the assurance which I seek on behalf of the employees. The Minister undertook to examine my representations. Last night, when I discussed the matter with him, I was perfectly satisfied that provision had not been made to preserve the rights of these employees. Originally, many of them were employed by the British company, but later they transferred to the service of the Australian company. When they did so, they were promised certain things. 'I ask the Minister to indicate to me where all the points which 1 have raised artcovered in clauses 18 and 23. If my information is correct, there are two agreements - one between the Australian company and its employees, and the other between the British company and its employees. Does the bill protect the rights of the men. who belonged recently to the British organization, and the employees of the Australian company? I also invite the Minister to explain whether preference in employment to ex-servicemen will be observed in the forthcoming reorganization ? </para>

                        <para>- When the Reestab.lishment and'. Employment Act was before the House honorable members were given to understand that preference in employment would be accorded to ex-servicemen. Whatever the precise, meaning, range and effect of the sections purporting to confer preference in that act may be - and nobody seems to know - this clause may take away from ex-servicemen the rights provided for them in the act. I do not believe for a moment that that is the intention of the Minister. However, such an interpretation could be placed on this clause, and I consider that it should be clarified in order to place the position beyond doubt. When we deal with the Tradesmen's Eights Regulation Bill we shall find that it provides that an employer may engage only a recognized tradesman to engage in a trade job. Nothing is said about the employee being an ex-serviceman or anything else. In effect, this provides for preference to trade unionists, not to soldiers. I do not object to preference to unionists, but I do object to it being brought in by a side-  entrance, as it were. Honorable members understood that preference in employment to ex-servicemen was to be general, and that the Crown was to be bound by the Re-establishment and Employment Act. But if the interpretation of the act given by a lower court is upheld, the Crown is not bound by the provisions of the act. The Overseas Telecommunications Commission will represent the Crown, and, according to, one magistrate's. decision, it will not be bound to accord preference to ex-servicemen. The Minister should make the position quite clear. </para>

                        <para>.- I am concerned in particular with the position of employees of Cable and Wireless Limited. I am not greatly concerned about the issue just raised by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> because I believe that the Minister has explained the position adequately. For the purposes of the law dealing with preference to ex-servicemen, the commission will be equivalent to a department of the Public Service. I observe that, in sub-clause 11 of clause 18, an attempt is being made to provide for the employees of Cable and Wireless Limited. The taking over of a concern such as this has a direct bearing on its employees. The sub-clause states - </para>

                        <para>Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, any other employee of the Company or any employee of Cable and Wireless Ltd. who. at the date of acquisition by the Commission of the telecommunication assets referred to respectively in sub-sections (1.) and (2.) of section twenty-three of this Act, is exclusively engaged in Australia in or in connexion with telecommunication services and has been so exclusively engaged for a period of three years, and for whom the Commission can find suitable employment shall be entitled to a position in the service of the Commission with such status and salary and under such conditions as the Commission determines: </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The first important factorto consider is that the principle will apply only if the employee concerned has been engaged exclusively with the company for three years prior to the taking over of the company. That may be interpreted in such a way as to operate very unjustly against a. man who has been engaged in one of the fighting services. It might be said that a person who had been serving with the armed forces at the termination of hostilities had not been engaged exclusively by Cable and Wireless Limited or Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for a period of three years.That is a distinct possibility. I do not believe that the Government intends such an interpretation to  be made, and I am sure that this committee has no such intention. Three years is not a fair period, because persons employed for less than three years may justly deserve, some consideration as the result of the disturbance caused by this legislation. I am not satisfied that there is sufficient provision for the welfare of such persons. Men who have had less than three years exclusive service with the company are entitled to some consideration. They may have certain rights in respect of pensions, for instance. There ought to be in this bill a provision similar to that in statutes providing for the taking over of State employees by the Commonwealth. Failing that, compensation should be paid to persons displaced unless an opportunity is given them to find employment with the commission. </para>
                    <para>Thus, three problems arise in connexion with employees of the companies to be taken over. First, the bill does not provide at all for persons with less than three years exclusive service. No provision is made for pensions for them, or for compensation for superannuation rights which they may have lost. Secondly, the words "engaged for a period of three years " may exclude servicemen who left the actual employment of the company for service overseas. In their case, it might be denied  that they  have had three years exclusive service with the company. Thirdly, the provision which entitles such as do come within the meaning of the sub-clause to a position in the service of the commission is of little real value since the right is conditioned by these words - "to a. position in the service of the coin-mission with such status and salary, and under such conditions, as the commission determines ". I realize that the problem is not a simple one, but I raise the matter now because the employees constitute an important section of the public, and are important parties to 'this transaction. Therefore, I believe that they should receive more consideration than is afforded them in the bill. The three points which I have raised should' be answered, if not now, then at some later time. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Francis)</inline> has no right to insult me by saying that I will not answer points raised by honorable members. The Government ' is anxious to protect the interests of the employees of the company. I am not sure that the honorable members for Moreton and Balaclava do not want to do a little stunting in this matter as in other's. I- shall now address myself to the intelligent members of the committee. The period of exclusive service does not mean that a person shall have served for three years exclusively before the taking over of the company. The requirement is that he shall have been engaged for a period of three years. If he had been engaged before the war started, and continued in the- employment of the company right up to the conclusion of hostilities, he must have had more than three years service. The idea, is that  a.  'period of three years service would be required to make him an efficient employee. </para>

We are taking over a business undertaking, and we have to take over with it those who have demonstrated their efficiency and competency to do the work for which they will be paid. It may be said that, had there- been no war, thousands of people in the armed forces might have secured employment with Cable and Wireless Limited, and might have been capable of discharging the duties now to be undertaken by others.

                            <para>- I hope that 1 shall not he silenced on the important subject of preference to ex-servicemen. They make application from time to time for employment in various Commonwealth departments, but they are constantly disappointed. When the Reestablishment and Employment Bill was under consideration, 44 amendments to be proposed by the Opposition were distributed throughout the chamber, but no opportunity was afforded to the Opposition to emphasize the necessity for leaving no loophole by which ex-servicemen could be denied preference in employment. Thebill abolished existing preferences and introduced a sham. The Government guillotined the measure through the House, and thus prevented a full discussion upon its provisions. </para>

                            <para>- It was a matter of the first importance. The way in which the Re-establishment and Employment Act now operates shows that the Opposition Was justified in the stand which it took on that occasion. The act should be amended. Had steps been taken to ensure the granting of preference to ex-servicemen, we should not experience the trouble in that regard that is occurring to-day. I trust that the. honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> will insist on submitting the amendment which he has foreshadowed. </para>

Sub-clause 10 deals with the employees of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, who transferred from the Commonwealth Public Service to the service of the company when the 1922, 1924 and 1927 agreements between the Commonwealth Government and the company came into effect. The sub-clause will entitle any such employees who are exclusively employed by the company in connexion with the radio-communication services to appointment to positions on the commission's staff, with such advancement in status and salary, beyond those held by these employees when previously in the service of the Commonwealth, as the commission considers just. Pension, superannuation retiring allowance, or furlough rights held by . these employees will be preserved .to them. The amendments and additions proposed to this sub-clause, as well as to sub-clause 11, are designed to place the several classes of employees of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Cable and Wireless Limited, transferred to the service of. the commission, on the same relative basis in the preservation of existing rights, including those appertaining to pensions, superannuation, retiring allowance and furlough, as well as to ensure that employees, mainly but not exclusively engaged in telecommunication duties, will be eligible for transfer to the service of the commission. </para>

                    <para class="block">With due respect to what has been said, there is considerable doubt as to whether ex-servicemen will be able to obtain preference in employment in this government instrumentality, in view of the fact that certain of the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act and the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Act have been repealed. As a large number of ex-servicemen who were signallers and wireless air-gunners in the" Army and the Air Force may seek employment in what, will be a monopoly company, the amendment should be acceptable to .all honorable members. I ask the Minister to accept it. </para>

                <para class="block">This motion is to give effect to the Government's wheat stabilization policy in regard to the contribution by growers. It relates to a charge on all wheat exported. The charge applies to wheat now in <inline font-style="italic">No.</inline> 9 pool from the 1945-46 season and to later crops. It will be 50 per cent. of the excess of the export price above the guarantee, the other half going to growers as a part of the pool return. There is provision for a lower rate than 50 per cent. to be prescribed, or for a lower price to be prescribed for the basis of calculating the . 50 per cent. contribution. It has already been stated that this season growers will get the full benefit of the export price above 9s. 6d. a bushel and  so that price will be used this season instead of the actual export return now estimated at 10s. a bushel. The reason for this is that a price of 9s. 6d. a bushel was used as the basis of calculation when the plan was being considered, and now that the export return is likely to exceed 9s. 6d. a bushel the growers will get the full benefit of the extra amounts. . Other portions of the resolution are intended to facilitate collection of the charge on a pool basis. The Australian Wheat Board will, in effect, be the export seller, and will pay the charge at reasonable intervals instead of paying each time a shipment is made. The payments will be adjusted to the actual pool return, and will not be based on the fluctuating prices of small parts of the crop. </para>

                        <para>. - It is impossible in one speech to deal with all the political problems of the wheat industry, not only because it is one of the greatest of Australian industries, but also because it provides uswith a considerable share of our export income. Its problems are, and for many years have been, far-reaching; as far back as I can remember politics, the Parliament has from time to time considered the needs of this industry and has endeavoured to do something for it. I propose to concentrate my remarks upon certain essential aspects of the bill before the House, which contains a portion, at any rate, of the Government's wheat stabilization plan. The first aspect with which I wish to deal is the relation of this bill, and the plan to which it refers,  to  the referendum for the alteration of the Constitution by including marketing powers in the list of those powers held by the Commonwealth Parliament. This is a question which gives rise to some curious considerations. In the course of the Minister's second-reading speech, which contained a full and fair statement of the Government's plan, he gave expression  to  some ideas which I desire to quote because they have a great bearing on the forthcoming referendum. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture said - </para>

                        <para>Co-operation with the States is an essential part of the plan. The States control production, and production must be regulated according to the markets available for our wheat. In marketing, "Commonwealth and States must use their constitutional powers in harmony, if the plan is to be effective; neither can provide effective marketing unaided. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The stabilization plan is intended to make the wheat industry" sound financially. Regulation of production, not restriction of production, has been recognized over the years as one requisite for any plan. It is recognized not only by the governments concerned, but 'by the growers; and growers are willing to co-operate in regulation of the industry to secure the wide benefits of stabilization. </para>
                        <para>Regulation of production is another feature . which was brought in as a war-time measure, and now can readily be adapted to peace-time needs. It is a State function, and Commonwealth and States will co-operate to secure uniformity in administration. The experience gained by State officers during the war years, while they were co-operating to carry out Commonwealth policy, will be invaluable in the future in carrying out the joint policy. </para>
                        <para>Special mention should be made of the need for co-operation between Australian governments on this question. Commonwealth and States have their separate powers, and, by using them together, the plan can be carried into effect. Used separately, the constitutional powers of the governments are not capable of dealing with the problem. The plan represents a high degree of co-operation between Australian governments, and it provides for a partnership in which all of them willplay an effective part, not' only in deciding the policy, but also in carrying it out. </para>

                    <para class="block">Those observations by the Minister are, in my opinion, completely correct, but they are wholly at variance, I believe, with the basic argument that has been submitted for the marketing referendum. It was said from this side of the House, and  in particular by those honorable members who sit behind me in opposition, that the problem of production could not be discussed quite independently of the problems of marketing and prices, and, accordingly, that the ideal system was one in which there was co-operation between the States, with their special authority over production, and the Commonwealth, with its special authority over interstate and international trade. If any justification were required for that argument it is to be found in the passages I have just quoted. Here is a scheme which, as I have followed the Minister's speech, is not regarded as being in any constitutional doubt. It is put forward as a valid scheme designed to last for a period of years, and it therefore cannot be regarded as depending on an affirmative vote at the marketing referendum. The Constitution amendment which will shortly be before the people seeks to concentrate all power in relation to marketing and prices in the hands of the Commonwealth, leaving the problem of production entirely in the hands of the States. Accordingly, if the power is to be used with any success exactly the same- type of co-operation will have to be achieved between the Commonwealth and the States as is exemplified in this bill with no constitution alteration at all. </para>
                    <para>I pass to the second consideration. The Minister has just introduced to the House a second measure, the Wheat Export -Charge Bill. It is perhaps unfortunate for the proper consideration of this plan that the House has not had before it from the beginning, first, the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill, to which I am now addressing myself; secondly, the Wheat Export Charge Bill, which is an integral part of the plan ; and, thirdly, some outline of the legislationto be presented to the State parliaments, because we must have a knowledge of all three if we are to have an accurate conception of the plan as a whole.. </para>
                    <para>I would like to say a little - not much need be said - about the case for the stabilization of the wheat industry on the basis of what I might call a floor price. There have been, over the years, differences of opinion about this matter - there are probably still differences of opinion on matters of greater or smaller detail - .but I believe that all parties agree that if we are to solve the problem of the wheat industry there must be a stabilization upon the footing of a guaranteed price.' That is just, because, of course, it would create a more balanced economy in Australia. The position might be different if we had an uncontrolled economy all round; but we have not had an uncontrolled economy. By our tariff policy, which I strongly support, we have accorded to manufacturing, industries a protection which is designed to enable them to sell . in competition at a price which will cover the cost of production and some reasonable measure of profit. In other words, we have in the case of manufactures assured the reasonably efficient manufacturer of a reasonable price upon the local market. In respect of wheat we should in the first instance afford a similar stability. But wheat is a commodity which, is not merely sold on the local market. In the past our manufactures 'have been almost entirely sold on the local market, a circumstance which many of us hope will change rapidly in the next few years. Wheat, on the contrary, has been one of our great export products. The wheat industry is one of the- chief industries on which Australia has depended for its overseas income, and it is now so constituted that we cannot say that we have given to it any degree of real stability if we deal only with that portion of the wheat crop which is harvested and sold in Australia. We must seek to give a reasonable measure of stability to the whole of what might be described as the average wheat harvest, whether it be sold in Australia or abroad. Therefore we must be prepared to  potect  the wheat-grower in re,spect of not only that portion of his crop which is sold here but also a reasonable volume of production for export. Whether the . latter should be arrived at by. control of acreage, or by some other means, is a matter which excites. some differences of opinion. I do not propose to discuss those differences of opinion at this stage because, fortunately, we have some reasonable assurance that, for the next few years at any rate, Australia will be able to sell all the wheat it can grow. </para>
                    <para>A stabilization scheme upon a proper price basis should not be looked at merely as if it imposed at some future time a potential liability upon the Treasury.. Looking at this plan we may feel con:fident, as 1 do, that in the next few years the contributions to the stabilization fund will come out of the realization of wheat and not out of the Treasury; but the object of the scheme is that if at some future time the moneys in the fund should be exhausted, in order to stabilize the price at the necessary level assistance will be forthcoming front the Commonwealth Treasury. That may be expressed as a future possible liability. Against such a potential liability there must be offset enormous advantages to Australia. The fact that we stabilize this great staple industry means that we are helping to produce a balanced economy and a proper spread of population in Australia - that we are doing something in the real sense towards the prevention of undue aggregation of population in the big cities. In a word, a. scheme of this kind represents practical -decentralization. Itmay not- be decentralization in the sense in which that word connotes the establishment of new industries, but it certainly will make secure an old and well established industry which is vital to the Australian economy. All these desirable things that I have referred to require solvent and progressive rural industries as the foundation of a modern and civilized life for our primary producers, with the necessary amenities to ensure that our country dwellers are able to resist the lure of city life and city occupations. It is proper that I should say, and I kp ow the Minister will agree with me, thai, the stabilization idea is not new. Attempts have been made to produce plans in the past. The present proposal, I say at once, appears very liberal when compared with the plan of 1940-41 at the time when the government of which I was Prime Minister was in office; but, in reality, the difference between the 1940-41 plan and the present plan is very, largely, apart from certain features which I shall discuss later, a difference of price. In 1940-41 world parity for wheat was substantially below the price which was to be guaranteed under the Government's plan. As honorable members will recall, the plan at that time provided for a guaranteed price, of 3s. lOd. a bushel f .o.b. ports. There was a provision that any receipts on realization of wheat above that price should be divided, as in this plan, between the fund and the growers. The guarantee was to be applied to a realized harvest of 140,000,000 bushels. That meant this : In 1940-41 the government of that day was accepting what looked like a certain responsibility to subsidize the plan heavily at the outset, because, as I say, world parity was below the price that was indicated. In 1946, the present Government is in a very much happier position because world parity is well above the guaranteed price proposed in the bill, and, consequently, there will be no initial liability upon the Government; that is something for the distant future. So far as we can judge, over the next few years the fund will be accumulating its reserves out of the plus difference between the guaranteed price and world parity. Therefore, for the first few years at least this will be essentially a growers' fund. Having regard to some references which are made occasionally to the 1940-41 plan - not by the Minister,' but I have heard contemptuous references to the 1940-41 plan - it is, perhaps, worthwhile reminding the House of two facts in relation to. that plan: First, that scheme provided for a guaranteed price of 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. ports, and for the provision oi a fund into which surpluses were to be paid, the surpluses to be divided equally between the growers and the fund; and, secondly, the price then indicated was remarkably close to the price which had been asked for by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. It is not to be thought that the government in those days was nominating a price completely out of harmony with the ideas of those engaged in the industry. It was not; because on the 27th August, 1939,. the Australian Wheat Growers Federation made certain proposals, all of which, if I remember rightly, found a place in the Government's scheme. But the price asked for by the federation was 3s. lOd. a  bushel  f.o.r.  ports  That is not identical with 3s. lOd. a bushel f.o.b. ports, but is remarkably close to it. I mention those figures in order to indicate that the proposals then made had all the essential features of a sound stabilization plan, whilst the price imposed, as we were reminded recently by the honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen),</inline> a very large immediate and potential liability upon the government of the day. </para>
                    <para>I turn from that, because I do not want to dwell unnecessarily on -matters of past history, to another question. Should there be a poll of wheat-growers before this scheme comes into operation? There is a fairly well-established  practice in Australia - I can recall many instances in rural industries - that before schemes of this kind, which affect primarily the growers of commodities, are put into operation, the wishes of the growers should be ascertained. After all, their labour, skill and assets, their acceptance of risks, and in many cases their acceptance of  hardships, have produced the harvest, and they are,therefore, the most interested people. Indeed, as we have seen, for the- next few years, they will inevitably be the major contributors to the stabilization fund ; and in those circumstances we believe that before legislation of this kind comes into operation it should require to be approved by a majority of the wheat growers voting at a poll taken for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- I am suggesting that the bill when passed, before it comes into operation, should be referred by poll as a total scheme to the growers in order to secure ' their approval or disapproval. It is not for me to say whether the growers approve the proposal. I am not in the least degree qualified to say what the view of the wheat-growers would be upon that matter. I have heard some honorable members who affect to know something about these things say that the wheat-growers were hostile to the plan. I have heard others say with equal confidence that the growers would be in favour of it. I offer no opinion about that aspect at al!, but I venture to offer the opinion held by many people that when you are dealing with a large important industry of this country and you are establishing a scheme which, for some time to come, will involve large contributions by the growers themselves out of the realization of their own wheat, the opinion of the growers should be taken. </para>

                            <para>- Before dinner I had been ' addressing myself to the Government's wheat stabilization scheme and in particular to the general case for stabilization. I now want to refer to some aspects of the scheme requiring determination. The first is perhaps one of the most important questions connected with the scheme: Should the 1945-46 harvest be included; in this scheme? I want to say at once that the answer to that question is in my opinion and in the opinion of many other honorable members of this House, no, the 1945-46 harvest should not be included in the scheme. Indeed, it is difficult to .understand on what principle of justice a stabilization scheme of tha kind now before us can be made retro;spective, and that is, in effect, what the proposal of the Government amounts to. The 1945-46 harvest, that is the harvest of the last season, was acquired by the Commonwealth under regulation 14  of the National Security (Wheat Acquisition) Regulations. It was acquired, as preceding harvests during the war were acquired, by virtue of the Commonwealth's war-time power, and if I read regulation 14, which is the important one for this purpose, honorable members will 3ee exactly how it operates. It says this- </para>

                    <para class="block">Consequently, the wheat harvest, not only in 1945-46 but in previous years, was acquired by the Commonwealth. The rights of the wheat-growers were converted from rights of property in the wheat into right to receive compensation from the Commonwealth, and, as compensation is represented by the words " on just terms ", it is difficult, if not impossible, for me to understand how payment for that wheat can fall below the level of the actual market value of the wheat. When the wheat-growers' 1945-46 harvest was acquired and delivered the claim by the wheat-grower at once arose. We are now dealing with a scheme which seeks to include the 1945-46 wheat, though the rights of wheat-growers to be paid for that wheat came into existence, under regulation 14, months and months ago. So that when this scheme proposes to go back and take away from the grower some of the benefits' of the claim that he had, it is retrospectively depriving him of a right which was fully matured at the beginning of the year. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is not disputed, as I understand it. that the price at which wheat was sold or saleable by the board was greater than the 5s. 2d. f.o.r. ports stated in this bill and it may very well be greater even than the larger sun] mentioned by the Minister in the course of his second - reading speech. It seems to me a most astonishing proposal that wheat already acquired, wheat in respect of which Commonwealth liability to an ascertainable extent has already accrued, should be included in a future scheme, the effect of the acquisition being to reduce the price to which the grower .otherwise would have been entitled in relation to the 1945-46 harvest. The proposed inclusion of the 1945-46 harvest is not only grossly unfair and retrospective, but it seems to me to deliberately cut across the constitutional protection to which the wheat grower was entitled at the moment at which the wheat was acquired. I do not want to labour that. I put that view briefly as clearly as I oan. I have heard nothing so far from the Minister or the Government which would indicate that there is any answer to that argument at. %all. Certainly there is no answer satisfactory to the individual wheat-grower. </para>
                    <para>But there are other reasons, economic reasons, for excluding that harvest. The harvest was extraordinarily low, following a drought year. In many wheat-growing areas in Australia that drought was not merely of one year's duration, it was of two. On top of. that the inevitable demands and circumstances of war have  meant that a good deal of maintenance, repair and development work on farms has been postponed and plant has become obsolete or worn out. The result of all that may be a fictitious state of credit for some farmers, others may find themselves substantially in debt. If we add all those 1 circumstances together, surely they support the elementary justice of giving to the f  farmer  the full benefit of the full price of the 1945-46 harvest so that he may have proper opportunity of paying his debts, re-establishing himself, doing re; pair and maintenance work and buying plant for the future. If that were done the effect would be that the industry would be in a more solvent position, and the new scheme would not begin until the 1946-47 harvest. It would then operate entirely in relation to future harvests and deliveries. </para>
                    <para>The next consideration is the problem of how the guaranteed minimum price should be fixed. The bill fixes the guaranteed minimum price to be paid by the board to the growers at 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. ports, and, as I understand the scheme, that is to be the price for a period of five years. The bill itself contains no provision that I have been able to discover for the variation of the price at any time during that term. On that state of affairs I have two comments to make. The first is this : It seems to me practically a certainty that over the next five years, the cost of producing wheat in this country will rise in terms of Australian money, because it is quite clear not only that the basic wage in Australia will bc due very shortly for revision, but also that when wage-pegging is relaxed, and it. will bc relaxed some- day. wages generally will rise, and prices and costs also will rise. If .that expectation be correct - and he would be a very bold-man who offered any other prophecy of the events of the next five years - a guaranteed price for wheat that seems quite fair in 1946 may have become seriously inadequate by 1948 or 1949. Therefore, it seems to me essential that there should be- some fair and accurate means of adjusting the guaranteed price in accordance with any increase of costs that may occur during the period of the operation of this scheme. </para>

                            <para>- I am directing my attention, at present, to that element of this scheme that says, " Here is a guaranteed minimum price which is designed to make the industry solvent, and which is to last five years ". If the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Burke)</inline> believes that he can guarantee to the wheat farmers not only a price for the next five years but also a level of costs, he will have an answer to my argument; but <inline font-style="italic">J.</inline> do not believe that anybody can guarantee the maintenance of the present cost level. In terms of Australian money this is certain to rise. We of the Opposition propose that there should be incorporated in this scheme some' means for a periodica] adjustment of the guaranteed minimum price to accommodate any increase of the reasonable cost of the reasonably efficient production of wheat. That, we believe, should be done- by means of a rural industries board which would make periodical investigations and reports. That is the first, comment that I make on this aspect of the matter. My second comment is this : If we do have machinery for the periodical revision of the problem of costs and the periodical  reascertainment  of a guaranteed minimum price, a period of five years  seems unreasonably short. After ail, if we intend this stabilization scheme to be permanent so far as possible, and if we are really endeavouring to carry the problem of the wheat industry beyond mere annual or sporadic treatment, the obvious thing for us to do is to institute a longer term for the scheme, and to introduce into that longer  term  means for a periodical adjustment of the price to be paid. Therefore, we suggest that the period should be ten years instead of five, to enable wheat-farmers to plan the development and use of their properties over a reasonably long period. I have referred to the need for a rural industries board. May I add just a few words about the purpose and function of such a board. With great respect to all honorable members, and particularly to those who are closely acquainted with the wheat industry, I suggest that the ' Parliament ' is not an effective tribunal for determining the cost of producing wheat. The great majority of us in this chamber are not qualified to attempt that task. The fixing of the price, therefore, must be either a matter of sheer bargaining from time to time between contending political elements, which is a very unscientific way of dealing with a great industry, or a matter of careful, accurate, and impartial investigation. Many years ago in this country we established the Tariff Board primarily to deal with secondary industries. That board consisted, and still consists, of specially chosen men with capacity for impartial investigation and with great facilities for such investigation.- The Tariff Board has established a very high reputation and a very high authority. I am sure that every member of this chamber will agree that the Tariff Board, in relation to secondary, industries, has achieved such public authority that its  recommendations almost invariably are regarded throughout Australia as reasonable and having due and proper relation to the costs of Australian production. If an application is made for a tariff, the Tariff Board investigates the actual local industry or the potential local industry. It examines the efficiency and costs of that industry, and in due course makes its' recommendation. What we propose is that in relation to primary industries, particularly the wheat industry, there should be a board which corresponds in its function to the Tariff Board - a rural industries board competently manned, and with adequate facilities for investigation so that as a permanent body it would very soon develop a reputation and authority similar to that of the Tariff Board. Its prime function for the purpose of this scheme would be to determine periodically - I shall hot attempt to define " periodically but so far as I am concerned it would be annually - the reasonable cost of reasonably efficient wheat production, and the reasonable profit margin that should be added to that cost to arrive at a guaranteed minimum" price which would enable the industry to be carried on effectively and progressively. It is not only unjust but also useless to guarantee a price that falls below the total figure so determined by impartial investigation. We shall do nothing for the wheat industry if we fix a price and stick to it doggedly for five years, notwithstanding the fact that after, say; three or four years it has become apparent that the price is below the reasonable cost of production. That will not bring solvency to the industry; it will ' bring the scheme to ruin and precipitate once more further investigations and plans by this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I am delighted to know that some members of this Parliament believe that during the next five years, the value of money in Australia will rise and the cost- of production in this industry will fall." The wheat farmer is entitled to an assurance - and this is the whole basis of our argument - that the price guaranteed to him under a scheme like this shall be adequate to cover his true average cost of production, and to give to him a reasonable margin of profit. That result, cannot be achieved unless we have the means of revision, and the means which are suggested and which I have been discussing for the last five minutes seem, to many of us at any rate, to be admirable and flexible means for arriving at a just result. We believe that by the introduction of machinery of that kind, and its effective use in a ten-year plan of stabilization, the Australian wheat-grower will, for the first time, have a feeling of proper security, and that wheat itself, instead of being, as it has been for many years, the subject of almost constant political controversy, will take its place as a settled, solid and highly valuable feature of the Australian economy. </para>

If the right honorable gentleman's information be correct, .namely, that approximately £1,500,000 will be sufficient to acquire the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Cable and Wireless Limited, there may still remain an obligation on the Treasurer to provide certain other moneys for working expenses. </para>

                        <para>- The committee has just approved the insertion of a new clause which will permit the Minister, who is the Postmaster-General, to acquire these assets pending the constitution of the commission. Obviously, that means that the negotiations have reached the stage at which it is possible to say that they will be concluded before the commission has been constituted. In the transitional period, the Postmaster-General will exercise the powers of the commission. I have said that the Treasurer will be authorized by this provision to approve advances being made from this appropriation, and from such further appropriations as may be made by the Parliament from time to time on the recommendation of the responsible Minister. </para>

                        <para>- Since the reopening of the Sydney Stock Exchange in 1942, the value of the shares of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has followed the general trend of the stock exchange, they having appreciated by about 60 per cent. There is nothing remarkable in' that. The value of the shares of quite a lot of other concerns also has appreciated. The financial columns of any newspaper published in any part of Australia will show that every company is doing very well, to-day. That may be a very nice compliment to the Government of Australia, which is responsible for the good conditions that make such a state of affairs possible. </para>

                        <para>- What is important is that the people of Australia believe it. The right honorable gentleman appears to think that, the increased value which, now attaches to the shares of Amalgamated Wireless '(Australasia) Limited signifies that, for a long time past, there has been " something in the wind " - to use the vernacular - in the matter of this transfer, and that people who deal in stock exchange transactions have considered that more than a. reasonable figure was likely to be offered to the holders of shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The accretion to the value of the shares of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited compares thus with the accretion  to  the value of the shares of other large industrial concerns - Australian Consolidated Industries, 56 per cent. ; Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, 65 per cent.; and Tooth's Breweries, 81 per cent. Those figuresprove that the right honorable gentleman's comments were not justified. There has been no unusual trading in the shares of this company. None knows that better than the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> who is a director of the company. </para>

Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has paid dividends of up to  14  per. cent. No doubt the value of the company's shares would appreciate considerably if its telecommunications were not acquired by the Government, as these offer a widely expanding field in the future. Rather would its shares be likely to depreciate by reason .of the Government's compulsory acquisition of the telecommunications section of its business. </para>

He contends first that they are depreciating, because the Government is to do what it proposes to do, and his other argument, which is a valid one, is that the value of the shares is likely to appreciate as a result of what the Government proposes to do. That is the Government's case on this clause, and it is safe for the committee to authorize the Treasurer to make advances to the commission up to  £3,000,000. </para>

In accordance with the custom ' of the Parliament of Great Britain, it is laid clown that a Minister, on the recommendation of the Governor-General, shall ask the Parliament to approve the appropriation of certain moneys, and the Governor-General's message recommending the appropriation must state the purpose for which the money is required. Neither in the clause which we are debating nor in any statement by the Minister has that been disclosed.

From that read by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> it is clear that, if we agree to the clause in its present form, the Commonwealth will be entitled to hand over to an unknown commission - we do not know the name of even one person who will be a member, of it - the sum of  £3,000^000.  In addition, the commission may be paid such other sums as from time to time are appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose. There is no limit whatever to these other sums. If a purchase of assets is made on behalf of the Government, a certain., sum of money must be paid and must come back to the Government as its share of the venture.

The representatives of the taxpayers are entitled to know the mind of the Goevrnment on this matter. The assets of Cable and Wireless Limited must have a known value to the Government, and that might be some guide. Similarly the value of the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited must be known. Only a portion of them are required solely for government purposes, but in respect of capital, more than half of that company is owned by the Commonwealth already. For a portion of the company's assets the Government is asking the Parliament to provide £3,000,000, an unknown fraction of which would be devoted to the purchase of certain of the company's assets and the assets of Cable and Wireless Limited. This clause must be read in conjunction with clause 32, which provides that moneys and investments may be lodged with the Commonwealth Bank or such other bank as the Minister _ approves. .1 know of no government instrumentality which has the right to do other than comply with the provisions of the Constitution, which require all public moneys to be paid into Consolidated Revenue. For that reason the Postmaster-General must pay all moneys received by his department into the Treasury, and he can only function, as far as expenditure goes,  on the money voted to him by the Parliament from year to year. </para>

                        <para>- If that be correct, we still require from the Minister an explanation as to what. the Government proposes to do regarding patents, franchises and commercial wireless assets of the company. Will the Government take a part in conducting those activities, or does it intend to farm them out? The Minister says it is necessary that government capital should be re tained to carry the company over a critical period. Only last year, banking legislation was enacted under which the Commonwealth Bank could lend as much money as it wished to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. From the taxpayers' point of view, the Government's connexion with an undertaking which is a delicious hybrid of no particular value is an entirely different proposition from the Commonwealth Bank financing the company in the customary way and taking the usual risks. </para>

He said that never before has a government appropriated a specific sum of money for a purpose such as that contemplated in this bill. I remind him it has been done twice in the life of this Parliament - once, when £4,000,000 was appropriated for the purpose of inaugurating the Mortgage Department of the Commonwealth Bank, and again when £3,000,000 was appropriated to establish, the Australian National Airlines Commission. Now, the Government is asking Parliament to appropriate £3,000,000 in order to nationalize telecommunications. The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> and the honorable member for Barker have taken certain parts of the bill out of their context. The clause providing for the appropriation of money should he read in conjunction with clauses  29  and  32.  Clause  29  is as follows : - </para>

                <para class="block">Honorable members will agree that a person buying a business would not pay down the full amount of the purchase money if that meant leaving himself short of money with which to establish himself. The Government is now asking the Parliament to appropriate  £3,000,000,  which will be probably more than half of the amount which will eventually have to be paid by way of compensation to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for the loss of its telecommunication business. That is the side of the company's business which showed such substantial profit during the war. Once that asset is removed the company will be in an entirely different position. The money left after the Government has paid compensation will be put into a fund which will be audited annually by the Auditor-General, who will report to the Government and to the Parliament as to how themoney is disposed of. It seems to me that the honorable member for Barker, in criticizing the provisions of the bill, is merely trying to make political capital out of it. </para>

                <para class="block">Parliament is being asked to appropriate  £3,000,000  for the purposes of this legislation. I agree that thepurposes have been made clear, but what has not been made clear is how this amount of  £3,000,000  is made up. For too long the Parliament has been asked to appropriate amounts running into hundreds of millions of pounds, and never have I heard one honorable member on the Government side demand particulars of the amounts sought. In these days of very large expenditure we should demand the closest scrutiny of all proposed appropriations. To-day we are presented with the extraordinary spectacle of the Government asking Parliament to appropriate  £3,000,000  without any explanation being offered of how the amount is arrived at. I do not expect a detailed statement showing everything to the last half -penny; estimates must, of necessity, be in general terms, but surely we are entitled to more information than has been offered. The present situation cannot be considered apart from the situation which will exist once the commission has been established. Will the Government then come to the Parliament and say, " For the purposes of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission we require an amount of ' X ' millions of pounds ", and tell the Parliament nothing more? That is precisely what it is doing to-night. The Parliament is entitled to more information than has been given to it, and the public, too, are entitled to know how the amount of  £3,000,000  is made up. This is a committee of supply, whose function it is to scrutinize all government expenditure. I do not suggest that the amount asked for is not needed, but the committee is entitled to further particulars. Either the Government just plucked a figure out of the air, or it represents an estimate. If it is not more than a guess, the Government should say so. If it represents an estimate, there should be certain particulars available, and these should be made known to the committee. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Warringah has held office as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and he knows that before any Minister places before the Parliament a figure such as has been done in this clause, estimates have been carefully scrutinized. In my opinion, the sum of £3,000,000 is adequate, having regard to the limitations imposed by clause 29, namely, that the moneys to be expended shall be raised under the authority of any act and shall not exceed in all the sum of £3,000,000. I hope that the Leader of the Australian Country party does not suggest that the whole. of that amount must be expended during this financial year. The meaning of the clause is that sums up to £3,000,- 000 will be expended by the commission as it deems necessary for the proper conduct of its affairs. I consider that any attempt by the Opposition to  obtain detailed items making up this amount is an attempt to aid business competitors to obtain information for use by them in their own interests.  </para>

                    <para>. - Having regard to the fact that the party with which the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> is associated has as its object the socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange, he has made an extraordinary speech. The honorable member said that the purpose of the Opposition is- to obtain information for the benefit of competitors of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I remind hint that the people of Australia, through this Parliament, are half-owners in the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and are therefore entitled to know what is going on and how their money is being. used. The honorable member said that I had stated this afternoon that shareholders' funds, namely paid up capital plus reserves, amounted to 30s. lid. for each fi share. He went on to say that the intangible assets of that company should be taken into account. I remind him of the basic fact that the intangible assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited were given to the company for nothing, and .have been enjoyed by it for over 20 years. Despite that fact, on a comparable basis, shareholders will receive £6 for each share. If that is not a margin for the intangible value of assets I do not know what is. </para>

                        <para>-  Of course they have. They have been profit-bearing for the Government, also. Whatever dividends the Commonwealth Government has received as a half-owner of the company must be set off against the subsidies that the company has enjoyed from the Commonwealth Government. Having regard to the earning capacity of the company for twenty years, the Australian people as half-owners of the company, have received inadequate returns. I want it to be thoroughly understood that a definite drive for shares in this company has occurred only since negotiations were opened in June. This means that on a comparable basis the Government is paying £6 for every £1 share ' in the company. The facts are undeniable and indisputable. " </para>

                        <para>- That does not matter. The fact remains that that is their established value. Yet, on a comparable basis, the Government is prepared to give the equivalent of £6 for them. I draw the attention of honorable members opposite to clause 29 of the bill, under which the Treasurer may advance to the commission no less than £3,000,000. This Parliament and the people are entitled to know exactly upon what that £3,000,000 is to be expended. I have already stated that £1,500,0.00 is to be utilized for the. acquisition of the telecommunications portion, of the business of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and only for a half, share of that, because the Government owns half the share holding. In other words the Government is prepared to give to the private shareholders of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited no less than £1,500,000 for a half share of one department of its activities. </para>

                        <para>- I have cited them and they have neither - been confirmed nor denied. If there be any doubt about the matter I ask. how much of the £3,000,000 the Parliament is asked to appropriate will constitute compensation for the acquisition of this one department of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. This large amount of money must be provided either from Consolidated Revenue or from loan funds, and as the custodians of the public purse wo have a right to demand that we be taken into the confidence of the Government in regard to the items' on which this money is to be expended. It is strange that the Government has a habit of adopting the figure of £3,000,000 in connexion with its socialization proposals. That amount was appropriated for the establishment of the Mortgage Department of the "Commonwealth Bank, the Aluminium Commission, and the National Airlines Commission, and now we are again asked to appropriate a similar amount for the purposes of this bill. Complete details of how the money is to be expended should be supplied. </para>

                    <para>. - When discussing the acquisition of ' certain assets  of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited honorable members opposite should endeavour to keep somewhere near the beam. Diverging widely from the beam they have been arguing about the provisions of clause 29 as if the £3,000,000, which is to be the maximum amount which may be advanced to the commission, were proposed to be expended to-morrow. There is no proposal in this bill to do that. It is necessary that some maximum figure be stated in the bill. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> says that the Government should state everything precisely-- r </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member claimed that the Government should state approximately the estimated expenditure on each item. That, of course, would mean that the commission would have to be. established and negotiations completed before the bill could be presented to the Parliament. It is obvious that the Government could not pursue the course suggested by -the honorable member. We ask for authority to appropriate £3,000,000 in order that  compensa-tion  may be paid to the private shareholders of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, that the assets of Cable and Wireless Limited may be purchased to provide for developmental expenditure which, might be necessary from time to time, and, finally, in order to provide working capital for the commission once it comes into operation. If the clause were as bad as honorable members opposite suggest I should imagine that when a similar provision in the other legislation instanced by the Leader of the Australian. Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> was under discussion in this Parliament similar objections would have been raised. </para>

I do so for many and varied reasons, but for the fundamental reason that the payment of these moneys would contribute toward the socialization of industry in this country. I recognize that considerable sums will be required by the Government if it intends to implement its policy of socialization and give effect to the pledge which has been signed by every member of the Ministry and its supporters; but members of. the Opposition are totally opposed to the policy of socialization of industry and favour private enterprise and individual effort. </para>

                <para class="block">He continued to argue in favour of private enterprise but did not revert to the purpose for which the money was to. be appropriated. He opposed the appropriation of the money merely because he opposed the principle of the bill. Nor did he seek to prevent the Australian National Airlines Commission1 from operating as he is apparently seeking to prevent the Overseas Telecommunications Commission from operating. If this Government were to itemize the estimated expenditure it would be likely to incur in  acquiring  the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited it would thereby indicate to the directors of the company  and to its .private shareholders just how much it is prepared to offer for the shares. When commencing negotiations one does not set down the maximum value one is prepared to pay, but rather one allows negotiations to proceed as a necessary preliminary to the fixation of a price. If the Government were to set down a figure of  £2,000,000  or  £2,500,000  as the amount it was prepared to pay for the assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited it may be found that that amount would be greatly in excess of what it would actually pay after negotiations had been completed. It is better to negotiate an agreement and reach finality before setting down a figure which might be made the subject of legal tussles in the courts of the land right up to the Privy Council. Under such an arrangement it might take two or three years to reach finality. I ask the Parliament to trust the Government, which will see that justice is done to all parties concerned in the agreement. </para>

                        <para>- On that occasion we supported the Government's proposal, and it is unthinkable that we should object to an appropriation of which we were in favour. Having voted the sum of  £4,000,000  for the purpose mentioned, we knew perfectly well how the money was to be expended. In this case we do not know how the money is to be expended. Mention has been made pf the Aluminium Industry Bill. The Opposition fought that measure clause by clause, and for very good reasons.. This matter depends upon the circumstances in which the bill is presented to the Parliament, and the Government's failure to disclose the purposes for which it requires the money proposed to be appropriated. We have a rough, foggy outline of what is proposed, but the Government has nottold us exactly what it proposes to do. It is one thing for the Opposition to oppose the appropriation of a sum of  £3,000,000  for the acquisition of interstate air-lines when we were opposed to that proposal. It is quite another thing to support the appropriation of  £3,000,000  for the acquisition of telecommunication services, which we believe should be in the hands of the Government; but we should be entitled to. an explanation of the details of this expenditure. Instead of giving. us that explanation, the Minister simply asks us to trust the Government.  .Quite frankly, we do not trust the Government.. . </para>

                <para>Clause 39, which I  suggest should be  read and discussed in conjunction with this clause, reads -  (1.) The Commission shall, as soon as possible after the close of each .financial year-  that relates .to  the  close of a financial year whereas clause 31 relates to the beginning of a financial year -  submit to the Minister an annual report with respect to the operations of the Commission and financial accounts, in respect of that year, in such form as the Treasurer a  approves  (2.) The annual report and financial  accounts,  accompanied by a certificate of the Auditor-General, shall be laid before both Houses of the Parliament within fifteen sitting days after their receipt by the Minister. </para>
                <para>On more than one occasion honorable members have shown how futile it is to discuss the financial operations of the Government after such operations have come to an end, and how futile it is to attempt to persuade this Government to pay any heed at all to remarks of the Auditor-General with respect to its financial operations. I emphasize that clause 31 makes no reference at all to the necessity foi' placing these estimates before the Parliament. My objection, which is fortified by the discussion which took place on clause 29, is that the estimates in respect of an organization of this kind should be placed before the Parliament at the commencement of the financial year. It is quite idle for the Parliament to claim any charge -over finance, if, indeed, the estimates are to be given to the Minister who simply does not present them to the cb amber but merely says that he requires a certain sum of money in respect of the proposed commission. What I wish to emphasize, and I have sought in vain to attract support for my contention from honorable members opposite, is the right of the Parliament, particularly since the war has come to an end, to know in detail the estimates of every department and every authority which functions under an act of Parliament while .such estimates are being discussed. As I have remarked on more than one occasion, the- truth is that control of finance has been taken away from the Parliament. Indeed, finance is no longer in the control of the Executive, because when a Minister is asked to give information as to how a large proposed vote is made up we are vouchsafed no details at all. It is important to direct attention to this clause and to the need for an amendment to be made to provide that the estimates referred to therein shall be brought before the Parliament with all the other estimates of governmental expenditure each year and tabled so that we shall have the data upon which intelligent discussion and criticism may take place. I cannot imagine that any Parliament could" function efficiently without that data, but for more than five years no one' outside the Ministry has been able to say that he has received it. I know that during the war, for the sake of security, expenditure on defence needed to be lumped into one sum without disclosure of details. but that timehas passed, and the Parliament must re-establish its authority over finance. If we do not we cannot claim to be a democratic parliament. It issignificant, in connexion with this clause to direct attention to what took place with respect to clause 29. The honorable member for Watson (Mr.Falstein) said that the Government could not give the information because to dp so would be to reveal details to trading competitors of the commission. That has nothing to do with this matter, because slight analysis shows that the commission is to be a legislatively created monopoly, and consequently it will have no business competitors. But the Minister will have nothing of that idea. He says that that is not the reason. He says, "If we revealed the figure at this stage of the negotiations we should be telling the investing public how much is to be paid or how much we are thinking of paying to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited". A little analysis of that also shows that it does not hold water. The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> has revealed that there are no sellers, only buyers, of shares of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited on the stock exchange. It is. extraordinary that we should have one statement from a back-bencher opposite and a contradictory statement from the Minister. I appeal to honorable members to assert their rights. Private members to the right or the left of the Chair ought to have full details of every appropriation. Is it intended that the estimates to be prepared under this clause shall be the secret of the Government? Is it intended by the Government simply to seek the appropriation of so many million pounds? Or is it intended, when the annual estimates of all departments are being considered, if " considered " is the right word, that the estimates prepared under this clause shall be laid on the table? To have those estimates in their possession is the right of honorable members. Are we mere pieces of machinery with some of us on one side of the chamber and the larger number on the other side? Is this in reality a committee of ways and means? </para>
                <para>It is not when we are told only that the. Government requires £3,000.000.No matter how much we ask for details they are kept from us. They will never be given to us unless we impress our will on the Executive. Every honorable member has a duty to his electors to preserve his custodianship of public funds. We shall never have a reduction of taxes unless we assert our authority over those charged with the expenditure of public moneys. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> has worked himself into a fine frenzyin defence of the right of the Parliament to examine the estimates of public departments. He has protested vigorously and sophistically about the necessity for the government of the day to submit all estimates of every government department and all commissions to the Parliament for ratification. He proclaimed that it was the right of every honorable member to demand full information on the finances of the commission. I do not deny that it is the right of every honorable member to get any information he desires about the financial activities of any government department but there is the duty imposed upon honorable gentlemen to be in their places when these matters are submitted to the Parliament and to take an intelligent part in discussions on all reports  submitted to the Parliament. There is usually a great desire on the part of many honorable members opposite to rush away from the Parliament or to attend very rarely. They negative their rights to discuss matters. I am addressing my criticism to honorable gentlemen opposite who claim their rights are being whittled away. Any honorable gentleman can place a question on the notice-paper. </para>

We are convinced that the public interest is being well served by the. general purposes underlying this measure. The clauses to which objection is being taken are purely machinery provisions. Apparently, the Leader of the Australian Country party did not hear, or did not take note of, what I said to the committee this afternoon in answer to the honorable member for Barker (Mr.' Archie Cameron), namely that this Government" did not pay any subsidies, to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. In fact, in the financial year ended the 30th June last, the company paid to the Government the sum of £57,000; This, idea, of subsidies and the like arose in the disordered imagination of the honorable member for Barker, and exists nowhere else. </para></speech>

They are like the " flowers that bloom in the spring ", "The money paid to the Government mayhave been derived from othersources altogether. If the company is in such a sound financial position that it could pay these sums continually, why the need for a subsidy of £45,000 a year?The Minister also said that members of the Opposition were not often in their place inthis chamber, and did not take opportunities to debate certain matters that appear on the notice-paper. I point out that on the notice-paper there are twelve ministerial statements, and I am quite certain that no time whatever will be allowed by the Government for a debate on' these important matters with which they deal before the Parliament is dissolved for the f orthcoming generalelections. There is also a notice of motion by myself, that has been there since last year. When the Minister alleged that members of the Opposition were not often in their places, I was sitting on the wrong side of the chamber, almost alongsidethe Minister himself. </para>

Clause. 31 relates to the sum of £3,000,000 that is tobeappro- priated for the purposes of thiscommission, and the Government, isshowing great reluctance to give anydetailsof the manner in which this moneyis being spent. The honorable  member  for Warringah.. asked if some  details could be given to the committee.The Minister for Immigration resortedtoan unfortunate analogywhen he , referredto the Australian National Airlines Commission, and. saidthatwhen the , : setting up of that authority wasbeing debated, the Oppositionraisedno objection to the. appropriationof £3,000,000. Wedid oppose that proposal.Apparently whenever the Government has a socialistic scheme to bring before the Parliament, it thinks of a number, usually, £3,000,000. At least, that is true of the Australian National Airlines Act, the Aluminium Industry Act, and now this measure. This clause relates to the preparation of estimates, and the Minister so far has refused to give usany estimates of the money that will be expended. I should have thought that a government  which has the socialization of industry as its objective would have been anxious to disclose these things. Honorable members opposite claim to have no interest in the  profit motive, yet they are afraid to say how this money will be expended. The Auditor General has referred to the manner in which accounts are kept by departments under the control of this Government, and I do not think that the Minister should be permitted to get away with this without giving the committee more details. I support honorable members on this side of the chamber who have raised this matter. I believe that in doing so they have rendered a service to the taxpayers who will have to provide the money. Finance cannot be obtained from thin air; it must be derived either by taxation, loans, or hank credit. Already too much bank -credit has been used with resulting inflationary tendencies. Of course, the Government has a majority somewhere 'in this building - it i3 not in the  cham-  her at present - and can force this proposal through regardless of the interests  of  the general public and the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. SPENDER</inline> (Warringah) [9.50].- I propose to move an amendment and I shall not be deterred from referring to it by the comments of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr..

                <para>To this clause, I have no objection, but what I have sought to convey, and apparently it has not penetrated the magnificent intelligence of the Minister, is that it does not go far enough, because it does not protect the people. I know that it is the habit of the Government to think less and less of the people, and more and more of its power; but, strange to say, although members of the Opposition are accused of being the minions of "Big Business ", I believe that more money is represented by honorable member's opposite, in the form of hotels and other interests, than we represent. We assert the right of the people to know what the Government's financial proposals are. Therefore, I propose to test honorable members opposite by compelling them to show precisely where they stand in respect of these vital matters. I move- </para>

                <para class="block">There can be no objection to that amendment. In his " meanderings of Monty "' - if I may so describe them - the Minister walked round and round and round and round, but he never reached the central point, namely, the need for the Government to inform honorable members of the estimated cost of acquiring the telecommunication assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. It is upon that, subject that I ask the honorable gentleman to bite, if he will, assuming that his teeth will penetrate it. </para>
                <para>The Minister directed attention to clause 39, which provides that the commission shall, as soon as possible after the close of each financial year, submit to the Minister an annual report relating to its operations and financial accounts. The only relevance of that clause to the present discussion is that it supports my amendment, and does not support the contentions of the honorable gentleman. It draws attention to. the obligation of the commission, when the money has been expended and any extravagant expenditure cannot be recalled, to submit to the Minister a report of its operations and its financial accounts. Those documents, accompanied by a certificate of the Auditor-General, shall be laid before both Houses pf the Parliament within fifteen sitting days after their ' receipt by the Minister. All I ask is that a similar procedure be followed before the money has been expended. The Government will not be justified in refusing my request. After all, the Government may expend money only with the authority- of this Parliament. It has no right to say, " We shall expend so much money upon this project. We have a big majority, and shall roll the Budget through the House of Representatives and the Senate ". The correct approach is to present to this Parliament early in the financial year estimates of revenue and .. expenditure, with all the detail available, so that  honorable members may discuss intelligently the Government's financial proposals. The Minister has failed utterly  to reply to the criticism voiced by honorable members on this side of the chamber. He sought to turn the argument by resorting to personalities, in which he often engages. We are discussing an important matter. It is not to the point for the honorable gentleman to say, " When similar proposals were under consideration in the past, the Opposition did not raise these objections." Even assuming that all honorable members failed in their diligence in the past, that is no reason why .the point now having been raised, should not be dealt with. The clause, if amended in the way I suggest, will read - </para>

                        <para>- It is not necessary, because the provisions -already incorporated in the bill are those which are normally incorporated in this kind of legislation. These provisions were included in similar bills introduced by antiLabour governments, which occupied the treasury bench for so' long. In opposing certain provisions of the bill this evening, the honorable gentleman may be , entering the . lists for the leadership of the Liberal party, now that. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ii.</inline> G. Casey proposes to contest it. Perhaps he fears that the electorate of Warringah is the object of the attention of some other gentleman. But whatever his purpose in raising these objections may be. I am' not able to define it. I know that he has some occult and undiscoverable motive in trying to hamstring this committee, and interfere with the operations of the Executive. Having the numbers, the Government does not propose to oblige him by letting him have his way. </para>

                    <para>.- I wondered, when the proceedings of the House of Representatives were being broadcast, what the effect would be on debate. The honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> has provided the answer. Any man who did not actually have this bill before him, would imagine that it contained no safeguards and checks on expenditure. The tactics of the honorable member were to submit his amendment, and then read the clause, thereby suggesting to listeners that he was proposing the safeguards. </para>

                <para class="block">Clauses 33 and 34 provide similar adequate safeguards. The whole substance of the objection of the honorable member, for Warringah is that there is something furtive about an upper limit' of £3,000,000 being placed upon what may be appropriated for the purposes of this bill. The bill merely provides that sums not exceeding £3,000,000 may be advanced to' the commission, and safeguards are provided in order to ensure that the amounts advanced shall be applied to 'the purposes of the bill. That the Auditor-General will have the right to examine the accounts of the commission, is made perfectly clear. The honorable member for Warringah' has attempted to convince listeners to the debate who have not the bill before them that something objectionable is being done with money contributed to consolidated revenue by the taxpayers. The honorable member, who awarded to himself the title of a cleaner debater than the Minister, in the same way as he assumed the title of lieutenant-colonel, would be well advised to keep such references out of debates of this kind. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not so far "entered the lists" in this debate. I do so .at this juncture because I consider that the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> has not grasped the true significance of the argument of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender).</inline> That is quite understandable, because the honorable member for Fremantle is new to. this . chamber. Because of his political ignorance and inexperience, he would not understand fully- why it  is  necessary for this chamber to retain control of the public purse, when it is considering the estimates of revenue and expenditure. It is true that he was elected to this. Parliament during a period of war, when it was necessary for war expenditure to be appropriated in a lump sum. The honorable member for Warringah has pointed out that we are now back to the days of peace, and on that account must observe the procedure that was followed in- this Parliament before the outbreak of hostilities. This chamber should once again assert its. right to, control the public.purse. That argument is germane to the clause, which makes it clear that the commission shall prepare estimates, in such a . form as the Minister directs, of its receipts and expenditure for each financial year, and shall submit those estimates to the  Minister.  That is as far as the clause goes. But, as the honorable member for. Warringah pointed out, the committee wants to have details of those estimates. If these are not provided, the expenditure is likely to be ' shrouded in complete  mystery, arid this Parliament will not have such information of the trading transactions of the commission ' as will satisfy it that the money is being expended * wisely' and efficiently. Surely there is nothing in that argument which warrants the generation of heat in the debate! Honorable members who sit on this side of the chamber wish to ensure that it will once again have control of the public purse. At the moment, that control reposes in the hands of the Minister. Whilst we hold the honorable gentleman in high regard, we know what use he made of funds provided for post-war education during the last referendum campaign. We wish  to ensure that when estimates of receipts and expenditure are submitted, they will be such as will warrant the approval of this Parliament. That is all the honorable member for Warringah seeks. The honorable member for Fremantle does not understand the subtleties of the situation, and we excuse him on that account; but there can be no excuse for the Minister, who knows that this is a time when control "of the public purse should repose in the hands of the members of this committee. I ask the honorable gentleman to give consideration to the representations of the honorable member for Warringah. </para>

                    <para>.- Like the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> I have hesitated to intrude in this debate; and I should not have clone so now, had it not been for his most extraordinary statements.  His  story about what happens in peace-time, and his attempt to castigate the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley),</inline> rather amused me, because I was a member of this Parliament in the days of peace, and I can recall a government in which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition was a Minister, or of which he was a supporter, appropriating millions of pounds in a few. minutes under the operation of the " guillotine ". This clause, on which the honorable member treated us to an extraordinary spectacle, merely provides for a limit of £3,000,000 on expenditure for the purchase of certain assets and shares. Details are not submitted to the Parliament, for the reasons that were so well explained by the honorable member' for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein).</inline> Honorable members opposite are agents for private concerns which want to be acquainted with the whole of the details, in order that they may use them for personal gain and aggrandizement. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has made great play in regard to what he has termed the ignorance and inexperience of the honorable member for Fremantle. He is noted for his indulgence in little sharp tricks in this chamber. He has cleverly made use of the broadcasting of parliamentary debates, in an attempt to deceive the people into believing that something sinister is being done by the Government. There is nothing of 'the kind in this proposal. The Government merely asks the </para>

                <para class="block">Parliament to authorize the appropriation of an upper limit of £3,000,000, with proper and adequate legislative safeguards. The commission will be responsible for submitting to the Minister detailed estimates of its expenditure at the end of each financial year. As a natural corollary, the Minister will present those details to the Parliament in due course. In his attempt to castigate the honorable member for Fremantle, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition failed badly. It was a most unfair attack- on a young member who makes excellent contributions to our debates. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard),</inline> who took the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> to task for having tried to chastise the young honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley),</inline> who speaks in pontifical tones from time to time, and with the air of a professor tells us how stupid is everybody except himself. The honorable member for Fremantle has not taken long to be polluted by the usual method of the Labour party of making personal . observations when driven into a corner. He said that I had misled the people over the air. I address the members of this chamber, and am not particularly interested in the microphones which have been installed for the purpose of broadcasting parliamentary debates. In fact, I opposed the introduction of the microphones under the conditions in which they have" been installed, but I am content to have the merits of the contributions of honorable members on the Opposition side judged by the people in comparison with those of supporters of the Government. The honorable member for Fremantle remarked that the bill provided ample protection, and, approaching the matter from Olympian heights, he said, "Look at clause 33 ". This provides that, subject to the act, the moneys of the commission may be applied in payment of expenses and charges and in discharge of. other obligations of the commission, in the payment of the remuneration and allowances of the commissioners and the employees of the commission, and in investment in any securities of or guaranteed by the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Government. I do not know what, protection that gives to this Parliament, but no doubt the honorable member will tell us. Clause 34 provides that the commission shall keep its accounts in such form as is approved by the Treasurer. What real protection is given to this chamber or to the people by such a clause? None . whatever. The next clause states that the accounts of the commission shall be subject to inspection and audit,- at least once yearly, by the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth. So are all the accounts of every government department.' What protection does that give to the Parliament over public finance? </para>
                <para>I have raised a matter of fundamental importance to the nation. Are estimates to be placed before the Parliament before the expenditure is incurred ? The honorable member for Bass said he had participated in the debate only because of a remark by a previous  speaker.  Either he was not in the chamber when clause 29 was tinder consideration, or he was asleep, because that clause has already been debated. It deals with a present appropriation, but this clause refers to estimates to be prepared each year in future. The point I am seeking to. make is that, this Parliament has a right to demand that estimates shall be placed before it before they are approved. The clause states - ' </para>
                <para>Thu Commission shall prepare estimates, in  such  form as the Minister directs, of its receipts and expenditure for each financial year, and shall submit those estimates to the Minister. 1 point out to the honorable member for Fremantle that that gives no control of the matter to this Parliament. The point, is that all estimates should be placed before us, so that we may determine whether they should be accepted for the ensuing financial year. Therefore, I arn seeking to add to the clause an obligation on the Minister to present the estimates of the commission to the Parliament. I seek the addition of the words : - " which shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as is reasonably possible after their receipt." Not one word said from the Government side meets the objection which has been raised by the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>.Advantage has been taken of an opportunity for an ill-timed and unjustifiable attack on the honorable .member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley).</inline> That honorable member has paid close attention to the proceedings ever since his election to this Parliament, and his contributions have considerably improved the standard of the debates. If there is one mistake which he has made, it is that he has expected honorable members opposite to say what they mean, not realizing that they merely talk to the electors and endeavour to damage the Government by every means at their disposal. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> in his ill-advised speech, made a poorly delivered attack on the honorable member, whom he described as a new and innocent arrival in this chamber. Comparing . those two honorable members from "the point of view of political wisdom, the honorable member for Fremantle stands head and shoulders above the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. We. are told that the commission should furnish details of the expenditure proposed to be incurred by it. but it would be impossible for it to furnish that information. It must be quite obvious that the precise amount cannot be determined until negotiations regarding the purchase price have been conducted between* the parties. It is even more evident, that details of expenditure cannot be estimated, even by the most competent treasury official, before the commission begins to function. In these matters, the honorable , member for Fremantle was correct, and honorable members opposite who criticized him were simply playing to. the gallery - in this instance a much larger gallery than usual, because the debate is being broadcast. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> referred to the. compensation which was to be paid to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for assets, tangible and. intangible, which it, was proposed to take over. The amount of compensation will depend, first of all, on the value of the physical assets, and, in the second place, upon the value of such intangible assets as rights, privileges and concessions granted to the company by previous governments. A condition should be attached to the granting of a right or a patent that, at some time, it should revert to the giver. It should be within the power of the person or authority, granting the right, to redeem it at some time, and on terms agreed upon. The fact is that rights granted to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited have acquired a value far beyond anything that was contemplated. The Leader of the Australian Country party has estimated at  £1,200,000  the value of assets to be taken over and when the value of the physical assets is subtracted, the remainder represents the value of rights enjoyed by the company. If the company has thus been placed in possession of intangible assets of too great a value the responsibility rests squarely upon previous administrations, which attached no condition or limitation to the concession. It certainly does not rest upon the present Government. It is evident that the rights were conferred without due consideration of their prospective value. </para>

That gives the lie direct to the Minister who said that no subsidy or contribution had been paid by this Government to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. </para>

The speech of the honorable member was studded with comments about what was happening in the chamber in- an attempt to tickle the' ears of listener's.  His  effort to have the clause amended was merely a "slick" effort' to show that -some matter which is outside the control of the Parliament ought to be brought under its control. He knows that the Government is responsible for the country's finances, and that at the pro'per time it will make any necessary explanation. I do not think that the honorable member's efforts to win for the Opposition the support of {he listening public will be successful, but we can expect to hear from honorable members opposite many such speeches between now and the general elections. I ask the committee to reject the amendment.

                    <para>. - This clause is identical with a provision in the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act. The Commonwealth Government does not accept any liability in respect of local rates, or State taxes on land, and so on, but in practice the Australian Broadcasting Commission does make an <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payment to many local governing authorities throughout the Commonwealth, and it will be competent for the proposed commission to do the same. That is a matter for the commission to determine. I have no doubt that when that body has been established its members will read the remarks made by honorable members during the course 'of this debate, in order to ascertain the will of the Parliament in regard to cognate matters which will be subject to their decision.

During the war many properties were taken over by Commonwealth and State governments and semi-governmental bodies, and many utilities were practically worn out by government departments, yet the bodies  and persons concerned have no lawful claim against the Crown in respect of the damage. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I agree that there is no inherent right to collect rates from Commonwealth instrumentalities, although it is well known that in some towns the best sites are held by the Commonwealth. Local governing bodies have to provide roads, footpaths, &amp;c., to serve these properties, without receiving in return any contribution by the Commonwealth. The present state of affairs will be accentuated if effect bo given to the nationalization policy of the Government. The time has come when the Parliament should take a stand in these matters. I do not say that that should be done to-night, but Commonwealth instrumentalities should be placed on the same footing as other property-owners who pay rates. </para>

                    <para>. - I know that the clause, as proposed to be amended, is similar to a provision in the Lands Acquisition Act. It means, that if a property is resumed in December, its value is assessed, not as at the date of resumption, but as on the 1st January prior to resumption. Although such a provision appears in the Lands Acquisition Act, I have never been able to ascertain why it was inserted. Has the Minister satisfied himself that the Commonwealth, which is obliged under the Constitution to pay just terms of compensation, is entitled to fix any date as the date on which value shall be determined? </para>

                    <para>. - The provision made in this clause is similar to that made  in  other acts under which the Commonwealth acquires property. All it is proposed to do in amending the clause is to make provision that where an agreement is reached the compensation payable in respect of property acquired shall be paid on such date as is fixed in the agreement. I assume that it is competent for the Government to make an agreement, and I take it that it is also competent to fix in the agreement a date at which the money will be payable. That provision in the Lands Acquisition Act was debated fully in the early days of federation. Sitting above this Parliament as an interpretative body, a super legislature,  is  the High Court, whose' function it is to interpret the laws passed by this Parliament. The High Court recently upheld the very provision to which the honorable member has referred. If the High Court has held that provision to be fair and reasonable, and to be in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, there is nothing we can do about it. tonight. </para>

I draw specific attention to the fact that the Estimates for the year ended the 30th June, 1946, show that an amount of £37,950 was paid to the company during the financial year 1944-45 towards the cost of coastal wireless stations, and that the estimated expenditure on that account for the financial year 1945-46 was £38,000. I am afraid that that factor has been completely overlooked. That isobviously so, because the Minister, in reply to the honorable member for Barker

                    FADDEN  (Darling DownsLeader of the Australian Country party) [10.54J. - I again draw attention to the necessity to take into consideration the subsidies that have been paid by the Government to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. In of the year ended the 30th June, 1945, the Government paid to the company the sum of £37,950 towards the cost of coastal wireless stations, and in the financial year ended the 30th June, 1946, the sum of £38,000 was paid for the same purpose. Provision for this payment was made in the Estimates of the Postmaster-General's Department. This shows clearly that the Government is subsidizing Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. That is contrary to the. information that has been given to the committee during the debate that no subsidy had been paid to the company. I draw particular attention to that fact.

                    <para>.- The statement just made by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> is not correct. He said that the Government was subsidizing Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, whereas in fact the payment of £37,950 which he mentioned was made in respect of services rendered by the company to the Commonwealth. Those services have proved so valuable that for the information of the people of Australia I shall detail them. The company provided a coastal radio watching service which spent more than 1,000,000 man hours listening, during which 500 distress calls from ships were dealt with. Special services provided were for the exchange of naval messages to ships at sea, and the transmission of free weather messages and time signals to ship-wrecked personnel in life boats and the Australian army in forward areas. A special coast watching service for observing enemy movements enabled vital information to be supplied regarding Japanese warships prior to the Coral Sea battle, and also the approach of enemy aircraft in New Guinea and at Darwin. </para>

                        <para>- Every Australian realizes that the Coral Sea battle was the turning point of the Pacific war. But for the enterprise of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in rendering those services to the Government probably we would not be here to-day, and honorable members opposite would not have the opportunity to take advantage of the broadcasting of this debate in order to make party political capital. Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited ako. provided at Port Moresby a service for the outposts of the Army and for the Royal Australian Navy to Canberra. A station was established at general headquarters at Port Moresby. Later, this station was removed to Hollandia and, subsequently, to Leyte and was used for transmission to Australia of press messages which totalled 7,050,000 words. The service was provided for the people" of Australia at a cost of £38,000. The Commonwealth Government has not paid any subsidies to the company. </para>

What the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> and the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> have talked about relates to the current income of the company. I told honorable gentlemen in my speech, in reply to the "second-reading debate, that no subsidies, were paid to the company. None is paid to it. It is true that the Commonwealth Government pays £45,000 a year for a service rendered by the company - the transmission of messages to ships at sea  from coastal stations. If the Government  did not pay the money to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for that service,- it would have to pay it to another company if there were another company performing a like service. Money must ' be paid to some authority which will do the ne'cessary work of protecting life at sea. That payment is not in the form of a subvention or subs'idy. It is a business deal. Such things are not taken into consideration in the assessment of compensation in respect of assets taken from the company. It is most extraordinary that honorable members opposite remain so obtuse, no matter how clearly and lucidly the position is explained to them - not all honorable members opposite, but just a handful of intransigent souls that have frustrated or attempted to frustrate  us all night with banalities, generalities and, as I said of the honorable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> extraordinary platitudes. </para>

                        <para>- Yes.  Not so many people listen at 11 o'clock as at 9.30, and . those who:misuse the provision for broad, casting the proceedings have probably gone home to bed, but some . honorable gentlemen opposite, who take an intelligent interest in the bill, have .remained. The figures cited by the Leader of the Australian Country party do not differ from the figures that I gave. I said &gt; that- the Government paid annually £45,000 which it is obliged ,to pay under  the- agreement of 1927, which was formulated and passed through Parliament by the parties to which honorable gentlemen opposite belong. There is provision for the deduction from that amount of 30 per cent, of the revenue from coastal and island radio'- services. In the year ended the 30th June, 1945, that sum amounted to £5,743. That is approximately the figure given by the Leader of -the Australian Country party. There is no inconsistency between the two figures. I ask the committee to dismiss from its mind entirely any question of subsidies. The honorable member for Barker can put as many questions on the noticespaper as his fertile brain can conjure up. </para>

                    <para>The permanent head of the Department of the Army, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> R. Sinclair, under instructions from me, visited the Brighton camp on the 12th June while on duty in Hobart. He reported that he was satisfied that the staff employed at  the camp at the time was performing essential duties, but that, as a result of the progress of demobilization in Tasmania, considerable reductions of the strength of the Brighton camp were contemplated. Such reductions are now taking place. The posted strength of the Brighton camp on the 2nd March, 1946, was 62 officers and 461 other ranks, and on the 13th June, 1946, this had been reduced to 41 officers and 307 other ranks. Re-organizations which are now taking place will effect still further reductions of these numbers. The position is being kept continually under review. The honorable member can be assured that no staff will be retained in the Brighton camp, Tasmania, or in any beyond the strength necessary for the other Army installations in Australia performance of essential duties. </para>

                        <para>There has been no clash between Dutch and Australian Imperial Force troops at Morotai and there is no feeling of growing tension nor truth whatsoever in the allegations. Dutch armed with knives and revolvers have not been involved in any picture show clash, but. on one occasion two Dutch soldiers were requested to leave as they were armed. They complied forthwith, explaining that as they were new-comers to the island they did not know of the regulation. Several months ago the Dutch commanding officer forbade hismen carrying firearms off duty. No Australians have been killed or wounded. Cordial relations exist between Dutch officers and Australian Military Force officers, resulting in mutual assistance when required. This report was discussed with Dutch Commanding Officer Nica, who had received similar signal from his  head-quarters. He agrees that the above facts are correct and has no information concerning  any incidents. As many Dutch attend Royal Australian Air Force pictures the matter was also discussed with Royal Australian Air Force but. they have no knowledge of any incidents. </para>

The total quantity of this waste cigarette paper received over recent months has not exceeded 28 lb. in weight. Considerable trouble has been caused through the bales containing this waste paper being ripped open in transit by unauthorized persons in their search for paper suitable for use as cigarette paper. As a result the company has arranged for the exclusion of any waste cigarette paper from future consignments from Western Australia. </para>
