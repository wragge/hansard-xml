                        <para>- I have received  from the Consolidated Export and Import Group of Australia a telegram in which my attention is drawn to the effect on Australian primary and secondary industries of the cancellation of orders of a value of ##Â£##6,000,000 by the Netherlands East Indies. The group points out that it is concerned not only on its own behalf but also because of the effect on Australian trade generally, and suggests that the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen may be vitally prejudiced by the cessation of our trade with the Netherlands East Indie?. Can the Prime Minister state what action he proposes to take to ensure that our national economy in relation to trade with the Netherlands East, Indies shall be protected against the disrupting tactics that are employed by the Waterside Workers Federation and otherCnmmunist-controlled unions? </para>

                            <para>- There could be reasons other than that. The Government does not attempt to condone the refusal of the waterside workers to load goods, particularly foodstuffs and mercy cargoes. As honorable members know, this has been a subject of very great difficulty.Ministers have made every effort to reach a solution of the problem, which is related to the very complicated position that has developed in Indonesia. As I have pointed outpreviously, the trouble on the waterfront was due in the first place not to any action by Australian waterside workers, but to the fact that Dutch nationals had walked off Dutch ships and had refused to handle the cargoes that weresought to be placed on them. Had that incident not occurred there would not have been any trouble with the waterside workers. </para>

                            <para>- I said that I did not condone the action of the waterside workers, but I have stated what was the original cause of the trouble. All sorts of statements have been made about the quantity of goods which the Dutch authorities hold in Australia, and most of those statements were incorrect. I know approximately the quantity of goods which they hold. I do not propose to say anything which might create international complications. There may be other reasons - I have no doubt there are - why the Dutch cannot buy ##Â£##30,000,000 or ##Â£##40,000,000 worth of goods in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Even that figure may be as much exaggerated as the other The Dutch have only limited resources for the purchase of goods in Australia, and I have no doubt that some of the orders have been cancelled for that reason. During the visit to Australia of Lord Louis Mountbatten, anattempt was made to get the Dutch ships out of Australian ports, not so much so that goods might be carried, but so as to put the ships into use. I am sorry to say that, up to yesterday, those attempts had not been in any way successful. Further conferences are to take place, I think, to-day, and I hope that, at least, the ships will be able to sail. I am sorry that there has been loss of trade. Even if the amount is only ##Â£##1,000,000 or ##Â£##300.000, it is still important, and it is unfortunate that circumstances have arisen to cause that loss. In the earlier stages, before there was any labour trouble, we were told that the Dutch had placed large orders in Australia, but it was found that they were not prepared to pay our prices. This, no doubt, was in accordance with sound commercial practice. If they could get the goods cheaper elsewhere they would buy them. </para>

                            <para>- The Government has decided that ships used in the Australian coastal trade shall be built in Australia. Necessary arrangements for the construction of the ships will be made by the Shipbuilding Board. Whether they will be sold, leased or chartered to private enterprise or operated entirely by the Government is under consideration. I frankly confess that the construction costs disturb me. I have said that elsewhere. I do not remember the figure of ##Â£##73 a ton ; I thought it was ##Â£##64 a ton, which is about the same as the cost of building ships during the war in the United States of America. Doubtless the circumstances were unusual, owing to work at weekends, overtime and other cost-raising factors. Compared with the shipbuilding cost in Canada ##Â£##64 a ton is high. It is much higher than the cost of shipbuilding on the Clyde. In this country it is not possible to reproduce at once the shipbuilding skill exhibited on the Clyde as the result of hundreds of years of experience, but it is our duty to do the best we can to raise shipbuilding standards here. The men employed on shipbuilding in Australia are not so skilled as are their counterparts on the Clyde. Many of them had to be trained in a hurry. </para>

The honorable member##'##s remarks from time to time would lead one to believe that all other peoples are perfect, but the men in this country, who are acknowledged to have produced some of the finest fighting men in the world, are slackers. I repeat that the cost of ship- ##Â»## building is disturbing. We hope that with more efficient labour, better technique and more opportunity for the executives engaged in the work to study methods overseas it will be possible to reduce the cost. But the one thing that we do believe is that Australia should supply its own requirements of coastal vessels. </para>

There have been informal and unofficial talks about the subject, but as I indicated previously, the view of the Government is that any such matters must be considered in relation to the whole of the defence of this country and the South-West Pacific Other countries, in addition to the United States of America, are closely concerned. They are, first, the United Kingdom and then Kew Zealand and other neighbouring, countries.

I understand that about 1,200 were thought to have been lost between Sandakan and Ranau. These parents are anxious to know whether any search made since the cessation of hostilities has brought to light any information concerning the fate of these men, the place of their burial, and the prospect of having them re buried in Australian war cemeteries. I mentioned this matter to the secretary to the Minister for the Army last night, in the hope that the Minister might be abbs to indicate this morning whether any search had been or was being made, and with what result. Will the right honorable gentleman make a statement on the matter? </para>

                                <para>- After the cessation of hostilities, certain remissions of the sentences were made of all those service personnel who were serving periods of detention in camps throughout Australia. An examination is now being made of the whole of the personnel now in detention camps, and particular consideration is being given to those who have already been discharged from the services. I hope to he able to make a recommendation to Cabinet on the matter in the near future, with a view to granting further remissions, having due regard to the crimes that were committed and the fact that the war has ended. I assure the honorable member that the matter which he raised will not be overlooked. ##'## </para>

                            - I shall do so, and I shall confer with, the Minister for Air to see whether greater use can be made of aircraft for this purpose. The honorable member will realize that when we had large Army and Air Force establishments and also a substantial number of Dutch servicemen in the islands, it was possible to maintain##'## fairly regular mail services, but the demobilization of both Army and Air Force personnel has progressed very rapidly. Because of a shortage of transport planes, and the fact that those that were operating could not pick up a full load of mail to make several trips a week to the comparatively few personnel in some of the outposts, the mail service ##"##was reduced. I realize the great importance of a regular mail service, and will do everything possible to ensure its continuance for as long as is necessary.

Many small vessels##'##  suitable for this ##'##traffic were required for the services. These are gradually being released, and as they become available they will be employed in services such as that to Tasmania. After the armed services have finished with these ships they require some renovation, and this also causes delay. Other circumstances also contribute to the general difficulties.

                            <para>The inability qf the Post Office to meet the demand for new telephone services is due entirely to conditions arising out of the war. During the period of hostilities the Department was obliged to restrict the provision of telephone services. All classes of telephone material were in short supply and existing stocks were utilized for the provision of services urgently needed in connexion with the war effort. In consequence, there is a large accumulation of applications for telephone facilities and some considerable time necessarily must , elapse before the outstanding orders can be completed. Ample stocks of all typos of material are on order and supplies are now coming to hand at a reasonably satisfactory rate, but, unfortunately, through lack of building accommodation and skilled staff, it is not practicable to bring this equipment into service at a. rate sufficient to meet the existing abnormal demand. The difficulty regarding buildings is most acute and until progress in this respect can be  speeded-up  there in no early prospect of improvement, but every effort is being made by the Department to overcome the present situation. Despite the serious disabilities with which the Postal Department has been confronted, approximately 32.000 new services have been connected since the cessation of war with Japan. As the position in respect of man-power, materials and buildings improves it is expected that the rate of increase will be accelerated. </para>

                            <para>- Including wheatgrowers who also have stock. With that I find no fault. I believe it to have been a statesmanlike policy, and absolutely essential, not only to our existence, but also to the existence of British people and our allies, that we should produce to our utmost capacity. The Government saw fit to supply cheap stock food at concessional prices to the extent of 52,000,000 bushels from No. 7 pool and 34,700,000 bushels from No. 6 pool. I offer no objection to that. I have, however, a very serious quarrel with the Government when the wheat-growers are expected to carry the whole of the burden. In response to representations on the subject, the Government, I understand, has decided to make a concession to the value of ##Â£##3,500,000 to the growers; but, according to its own figures, it has taken about ##Â£##10,000,000 from the wheat-growers, so that it might supply wheat for various purposes at concession prices. Most other industries have been subsidized during the war in one way or another. The wheat farmers have suffered the effects of serious and prolonged droughts, not only in marginal areas, but also in good wheat country with an average rainfall of18 inches. On some of this country the farmers have been able to cut hay only twice in seven years. During that period, they have had two complete crop failures and three partial failures. Even this year, although the Australian wheat crop is about normal, at a figure of 142,910,000 bushels, the crop in the areas to which I have referred has been almost a complete failure. On good land which had been fallowed for two years, crops ranged from two to three bags an acre, and, in odd cases, to as much as five bags. Therefore, it is obvious that the farmers need assistance. From No. 7 pool 3,400,000 bushels was taken for breakfast foods, and 37,200,000 bushels for manufacturing flour for local use. The price paid for wheat for breakfast foods was 4s. 3d. a bushel, for flour for local consumption, 5s. 2d. a bushel, and for stock feed, 3s. 6d. a bushel. At that time, Great Britain was prepared to pay 6s. lid. a bushel f.o.b. for all wheat available. </para>

                        <para>- Great Britain was buying huge quantities of wheat for India at 6s. lid. a bushel, and South American countries were paying even more. 1 do not say that all the wheat could have been sold for that price, but what was left in No. 7 pool could have, been. The department admits that the amount taken from the growers has been approximately ##Â£##10,000,000. If all the wheat had been, sold at export parity prices it would have realized ##Â£##19,704,739, whereas the Government proposes to pay the farmers only ##Â£##9,671,470. It is true that, at one time, the guaranteed price w.as 4d. above the export parity price, but before the Government paid out anything under the guarantee, the export price had risen, and nothing was, in fact, paid by the Government under that provision. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that there was trouble in regard to shipping, but there was an export parity price. The Government has done another thing which is worthy only of a bushranger - I refer to interest charges. On No. 6 pool interest charges are fixed at ##Â£##1,239,755. We know that the Government had, to make advances to the growers against their crops ; therefore some interest charge against the growers would be just, but it was not just that the farmers should be debited with interest charges in respect of wheat, held by the Government for stock feed and for the production pf flour for home consumption. The Government had acquired. the wheat for these purposes, and the growers had no longer any say in its disposal. Nevertheless, the farmers have been debited with interest charges on advances in respect of wheat held for stock- feed, breakfast foods, power alcohol, and flour for local consumption. That is in-  iquitous.  At least 50 per cent, of this charge should have been debited against consolidated revenue. Interest charges against No. 7 pool were considerably more, and out of this pool 57,000,000 bushels was allocated for stock feed, 2,200,000 bushels for export flour, 3,400,000 bushels for breakfast food and 37,200,000 bushels for flour for local consumption. Obviously, the Government had to hold large quantities of wheat for these purposes, and it had to borrow money to finance the enterprise, but there is no justification for debiting interest charges so incurred against the growers. It is most unjust that the wheat-farmers, who have been struggling against adverse circumstances including drought and lack of fertilizers, should be debited with the full charge. The farmers had to carry on in the absence of the young, strong men who went into the Army. The work had to be done by the old and the unfit. Men who had previously retired, or were merely managing the properties for their sons, had to return to an active part in farming operations. In spite of all the disabilities suffered by the farmers, the Government imposes  upon them this unjust charge. Therefore, I urge the Minister to make representations to Cabinet in the hope of having it removed. It is utterly unjust that the farmers should have to carry the interest burden on wheat sold at concessional prices for stock feed and to proprietary companies for the manufacture of breakfast foods. The charge .would more properly be borne by consolidated revenue than by the wheat-growing industry. </para>

                    <para>When it became obvious that the world faced a wheat famine as the result of war devastation in Europe and Asia, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, on behalf of the Government, asked wheat-growers to step-up production. The Government did not tell them that they would not receive the market price for their wheat. On the contrary, it implied, although it may not have said so straight out, that they would get that price. It said that wheat prices would be good. Now, however, the Government proposes ,to pay them 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.b. on##'## a bagged basis, which is about 4s. .3d. a bushel or 4s. 4d., at the most at country stations. </para>

                            <para>- The Government was going to grab 60 per cent, of realizations. However, that is neither here nor there. The difference between f.o.r. ports and f.o.b. does give some slight assistance, but the fact remains that the price t.o be paid is below the cost of production. Machinery costs to-day are at least 100 per cent, higher than they were ten years ago. It is only a few years ago since I bought a new binder for ##Â£##31 15s. </para>

                            <para>- Other costs have risen. Superphosphate costs ##Â£##5 ls. a ton to-day, compared with ##Â£##3 10s. a few years ago, and the .quality has deteriorated, being 18 per cent, as against 22 per cent. The cost of wheat bags has risen from 30s. to 36s. The farmers, who have been saddled with all these increased charges on production, are to get only 4s. 3d. a bushel at country stations, and  the  Government proposed to take 60 per cent, of realizations above that amount, and to pay that into a stabilization fund, which is only an equalization fund, after all. In view of the fact that other industries are subsidized, I consider that the Government should also contribute to the equalization fund. </para>

                            <para>- 1 may be. History demonstrates that after a great war, when the world faces a wheat, famine the like of that to-day there is no likelihood of the Government having to contribute to the equalization fund for at least five years. In common justice, the 1945-46 wheat crop should be exempt from this stabilization plan. I agree with the Government and the- wheat-growers##'## organizations that a wheat stabilization plan is essential, because no one wants to go back to the old days when, with a world shortage of wheat, a return of 7s. or Ss. a bushel, with consequential land booms, was followed in two, three, four or five years by a world glut, with the price dropping to the ruinously low level of half-a-crown a bushel. The boom-and- burst cycle is disastrous, not only to the industry in general, but to men engaged hi it. The wheat-farmers are so badly in need of a stabilization scheme that they are ready to submit to a great deal in return for it, but we do not think it fair that the 1945-46 crop should be included in the scheme, iri view of the straitened financial circumstances of the men engaged in the industry, particularly the men in the lighter rainfall areas, and the marginal areas, whose only chance of getting on to their feet again, so that, they shall be able to go ahead with renewed hope, lies in their being allowed to get the full price for their wheat this year. The people, who will be able to buy bread at a reasonable cost., ought to be prepared to subsidize this industry, as they are subsidizing other industries, to keep down the cost of production. I do not think anybody doubts that the wheat-growers have been badly treated in being forced to carry on their industry under almost impossible conditions, including shortages of labour, fertilizer and machinery. During theN war the policy of the Government was that men engaged in the manufacture of farming machinery had to be diverted to the production of armaments. I have no complaint about that because the necessities of war demanded it, but the farmers suffered as the result. I think it is just that they should be compensated as far as possible. , <inline font-style="italic">##[##Extension of time granted.##]##</inline> 1 urge on the Minister, whom i thank for having moved that I be given an extension of time, that there are certain things that, in common justice, the Government must do. It must pay the wheat-growers a just price for the wheat sold at concessional prices. Otherwise, it will be deliberately robbing them of their due. It must transfer the burden of interest on the concessional wheat from the industry to the Consolidated Revenue. It must allow the wheat farmers to get the full amount of the realization on the 1945-46 crop if it wants the industry to carry on in solvency as the great pillar of the political economy of this country. </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> on the temperate manner in which he approached this subject. I agree with his view that for many years the wheat-grower has experienced great hardships, but I find it interesting to note that only at this juncture does the heart of the Opposition begin to bleed for the wheat-grower. For many years, members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party had an opportunity to relieve that distress, but they omitted to do so. Never in . the history of wheat-growing in Australia have the producers experienced such a devastating period as in the few years when the Australian Country party held the balance of power in this chamber. At. that time, honorable members opposite had an excellent opportunity to relieve the plight of the wheat-grower, but they sadly neglected him. Now, when wheat-growers generally, with the exception of those in drought-stricken areas, are more prosperous than ever before, honorable members opposite are taking a keen interest in their welfare. No doubt that interest is. prompted by the approaching election. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I agree with the remarks of the honorable member for Bendigo about interest charges. I have always had  my  own opinion about them, and I assure the House that I shall examine the honorable member##'##s submissions, and  discuss them with Cabinet. One contention which I refuse to accept is that wheat which has been acquired and distributed at concessional prices was not paid for on just terms. The quantity of wheat .for stock ##'## feed used from the various pools was 32,500,000 bushels from No. 5 pool, 34,750,000 bushels from No. 6 pool, and 51,500,000 bushels from No. 7 pool. Subsidies have been paid on this wheat. From No. 5 pool, where the rise of price did not occur until towards the end of the pool, the payment was 6d. a bushel, or ##Â£##S00,000. </para>
                    <para>In Nos. 6 and 7 pools the subsidy on feed wheat brought the return on this grain to the average of other sales in the same pool. Under this arrangement the subsidy for No. 6 pool was ##Â£##2,200,000. No. 7 pool presented a difficulty. On the same basis, the subsidy on this pool would be over ##Â£##3,000,000. However, the Government has decided to increase this by ##Â£##3,500^000, making the total subsidy ##Â£##6,500,000. </para>
                    <para>The drought is the real reason for the extra payment for No. 7 pool. Normally, the basis of payment was fair, but the drought created such a big demand for wheat from No. 7 pool that it was necessary to make of it a special case. During the worst year of the drought, no wheat from No. 8 pool was sold at concession prices. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the honorable member has reminded me of breakfast foods. Some years##'## ago, a government of the United Australia and Australian Country parties introduced legislation fixing the home-consumption price of wheat. The Labour party, which was then in opposition, supported it. Some honorable members opposite have since declared that we opposed the bill, but that contention is not correct. I challenge any honorable member to show in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that the Labour party divided the House on. the measure. Under that legislation, wheat for breakfast foods was not provided at the home-consumption price. In fact, wheat used for breakfast foods  and  the like was to be made available at the ruling price. ##"##When the Labour Government took office, we provided wheat for the manufacture of breakfast foods at the concessional prices, and we have paid to the ##"##Wheat Board the amount of the difference between the concessional price and the home-consumption price. Those payments totalled about <inline font-style="italic">##Â£##500,000.</inline> Under the legislation introduced by the administration of the non-Labour parties, wheat-growers were not entitled 10 that money. </para>

                    <para>The concessional price has been trenchantly criticized in debates in this House. ##"##When I attended the annual conference of the ##"##Wheat-growers Union at Gunnedah, I made my first declaration that we would take concessional feed wheats at the basic rate of 4s. a bushel and pay in respect of them a subsidy of 6d. a bushel. Then the price of wheat for export gradually rose. That of wheat for export in No. 5 pool slightly exceeded 4s. a bushel and an amount of ##Â£##S00,000 was paid as a subsidy. I informed the conference of wheat-growers at Gunnedah, and the delegates there agreed, that an average would be struck on the export price and other sales, and th##'##at would be the concessional price. The  conference regarded  that decision as being quite fair and endorsed it. </para>

                            <para>- No? the concessional prices were not taken into consideration. The average was struck on the home price and the export price, and that amount was applied to the whole of the concessional sales. I realized that an injustice could occur there, and, therefore, I made another offer, which the wheatgrowers of Australia accepted. After the conference at Gunnedah, I had discussions in Sydney with the representatives of the Farmers and Settlers Association. Among those present were a former member for Riverina, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nock,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cambridge,</inline> who is the general secretary of the association. We discussed this matter at length in my office, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nock</inline> said definitely, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ##'##</inline> Cambridge agreed, that the decision was fair. Later, honorable members opposite moved the adjournof the House on several occasions to discuss this price, and many misstatements were made ##"##throughout the country. Subsequently, I met the repre-o sentatives of the Wheat Growers Association at Canberra. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nock,</inline> who waspresent on that occasion, and some of the other, representatives were a little alarmed at some of the statements in the press. The honorable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> was- not backward in making such statements, because  he considered that, they would create unrest among wheat-growers. When I repeated my assurance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nock</inline> and the other representatives of the Wheat-growers Union declared that the decision was perfectly fair and they were satisfied. Then murmurings arose in the Australian Wheat Board. I know that the honorable member for Indi has a particular friend there and when they have a cup of morning tea together they probably do not talk about the weather. I met representatives of the wheat-growers organization and the Australian Wheat Board in Sydney and discussed this subject and, with the exception of one man, they declared that the decision that had been reached was absolutely fair. Moreover they asked me to confer with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPherson,</inline> a representative of the Treasury, and the Australian Wheat Board, with the object of determining the price that should be paid. That was done. At, that stage, however, the most disastrous drought that Australia has known overtook us, with the result that, instead of requiring 30,000,000 bushels of wheat for stock feed 51,500,000 bushels was taken from the No. 7 pool .for that purpose. I met representatives of the Wheat Growers Federation and the Australian Wheat Board in Sydney recently and discussed concessional prices with them, at considerable length. The conference placed on record its satisfaction with the price that had been paid for the stock feed taken from No. 5 and </para>

                    <para class="block">No. 0 pools, but expressed the opinion that in view of the extraordinary circumstances which- had arisen,- and the very large amount of wheat taken from the No. 7 pool for stock feed, the concessional price should be reviewed. I agreed with that decision, notwithstanding that a definite decision had been reached sometime previously at a similar conference. Reconsideration was justified in view of the fact that such a large quantity of wheat had been taken from No. 7 pool. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon)</inline> was present at that conference. Tt was suggested, on that occasion, that it would be fair to pay the export price for the wheat that was taken for stock feed and that .adjustments should be made accordingly. It is practicable to ascertain  the export price in monthly periods, fairly accurately. </para>
                    <para>It became apparent early in 1945 that Australia would need every bushel of its wheat in order to counter the worst effects of a disastrous drought, and it was due to the decision of the Government that wheat was available at that time for stock feed. A decision by the Prime Minister was conveyed to the Australian Wheat Board through me that no more wheat was to be exported for the time being. The Board had, of course, already approached the Prime Minister for permission to export wheat. I consider that the agreement to pay 6s 5-^d. a. bushel for the wheat taken from No. 7 pool for stock feed was, in all the circumstances, entirely just because it represented the then ruling export price. That meant that an additional amount of ##Â£##3,500,000 was made available for distribution to the growers of the wheat. </para>

The previous Government acquired wheat for the. No. 1 pool at the lowest price ever paid to our wheatgrowers. I protested to the then Minister for Commerce that it was most unfair that wheat should have been acquired, at that time, for less than 2s. a bushel. The wheat-growers did not receive any benefit from that Government due to the increased price at which the wheat was ultimately sold. But now we are hearing a great deal about ##"##-just compensation ##"##. The fact is that this Government has treated the wheat-growers most sympathetically, and has done a great deal to stabilize their industry. That  the  wheat-growers appreciate ##'## what the Government has done was shown by the fact that not  One  wheat-growing constituency in Australia returned an Aus- - tralian Country party candidate to this Parliament at the last general elections. </para>

                    <para>Another important fact that should be remembered is that about 50 per cent, of the wheat that was sold at the concessional price from the No. 7 pool was purchased by wheat-growers for pig, poultry, and stock feed. I represent, one of the biggest wheat-growing areas in Australia, and I know that many wheat-growers in my district who delivered their wheat to the No. 7 pool later received large quantities of it back at the concessional price for use as stock feed. I have never heard any complaints from wheat-growers about the treatment they have received from the Government in this connexion. Recently, I addressed, at Parkes, one of the largest meetings of wheat-growers I have ever attended, and not one question was asked about the concessional price. The meeting applauded the statements that I made about repayments. Honorable members of the Australian Country party may attempt to tickle the ears of the wheat-growers, but the farmers are well aware of the benefits they have received through the administration of this##'## Government. <inline font-style="italic">##[##Extension of time granted.##]##</inline> The wheat stabilization plan that has been applied by this Government has been of immense value to the industry. We all are well aware of the serious shortage of fertilizers and the heavy increase of fertilizer prices in- Australia. The Government has accepted financial responsibility for many millions of pounds  in  respect of fertilizer costs which otherwise would have fallen on the wheat-farmers. Last year, also, the Government provided a subsidy of 5s. a dozen for wheat sacks. It has also provided subsidies, under its stabilization plan, for many other basic materials required for wheat-growing. </para>
                    <para class="block">The wheat-growers, in common with every other section of producers, as well as the workers, must come within the scope of that stabilization plan. If it were not retained for home use, hide producers could perhaps obtain double the price they have been paid for their hides. We did not hear any complaint on that score, because they realized that there must be stabilization; otherwise, inflation would be rampant, and that would be a national disaster, the full blast of which would be felt by the wheat-growers more than any other section of the community. </para>

I have not heard that subject debated in this House previously. The price of wheat at that time was not1 so low as it had been some years previously. I sold thousands of bushels of wheat at ls. 2 5/8d. a bushel. I mention for the information of the Minister that when wheat was acquired in 1939 I was not sitting behind the Menzies Government but occupied a seat on the cross benches. Had there been any argument to raise, it would have been raised, but that did not occur.

The 2s. 9 1/2d a bushel was conceded by the Menzies Government on the 29th November, in this House, in answer to a ##'##question by the then honorable member for Wannon. Later, the Menzies Government became seised with the belief that certain injustices had been done in the acquisition of the wheat that had been grown in the 1938-39 season. It appointed Judge Payne, of South Australia, to sit as an adjudicator and to assess the damage that, had been done. Judge Payne submitted his report to the Curtin Government after its assumption of office. The recommendations that it contained have never been given effect. ##"##I brought the matter to the notice of the Prime Minister late last year. The Chifley Government says in its defence that it will not pay the compensation recommended by Judge Payne to .the owners of that wheat, because they are merchants and not growers. Let the Minister contradict that if he can. He cannot stand on both pieces of ground at the one time. A few minutes ago he said that the Menzies Government had paid too low a price to the growers of wheat in 1939; yet on his recommendation the Chifley Government refused to pay the compensation recommended by Judge Payne because the owners of the wheat were merchants and not growers. </para>

                            <para>- The matter has been before the honorable gentleman time and again. He knows perfectly well that certain merchants lost heavily. One Sydney merchant lost thousands of pounds because he was not allowed ##'## to complete a contract he had signed. Because of the sense of justice which permeates this Government, that owner, who happens to be a merchant, is not to get what a judge recommended that he should receive. I did not introduce this element into the debate; that was done by the Minister. I do not think he expected the ##"## comeback ##"##. I- have some knowledge of this matter. I was not Minister for Commerce twice without learning a few facts. I have not forgotten certain things that happened, but the subject of the debate to-day is npt what happened to merchants in 1939 or to growers up to a little while ago, but whether the present scheme, which is to operate for the forthcoming five years, is one that ought to be supported by this Parliament. That is the purpose of the motion of the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin).</inline> The speech in answer to it by the Minister dealt with anything except the question that had been raised. The honorable gentleman was perfectly wise in refusing to face up to the case that had been presented by the honorable member for Bendigo; that is the best course he could have adopted. Let us consider .some of the facts. It. is perfectly true, as the Minister said, that the Labour party never voted against the flour tax. I cannot recall its. having done so. But the Minister ought to reread speeches which he made on it as a private member. It is a marvel to me that the honorable gentleman could have torn to pieces a proposal which was so strongly objected to by ..the Labour party on that occasion, and then failed to ##"## face the barrier ##"## by calling for a division. Neither he nor the party which sits behind him has yet been game to bring in a bill to repeal the flour tax, which lIlli remains on the statute-book. If a party, when assuming office, finds on the statute-book legislation to which it is politically opposed on principle, the honest course is to repeal it. That is something which I believe the present Government is not likely to do in connexion with the flour tax. It talks and squeal? a lot, but is singularly inactive. </para>

There have been debates on that subject in this chamber, but the honorable gentleman has not been able to explain the basis on which the price was arrived at. Were all the sales grouped together, and was the price granted to the farmer the average of them all, or were the export sales grouped and was the price granted to the farmer the average of the export sales? Up to date, that has not been answered. </para>

                            <para>- They have not been given anything this year. A bill has just been passed through the Parliament of South Australia. Any -ember of the Labour, party from that State can confirm what I say. I am the only non-Labour member of this House from South Australia. <inline font-style="italic">##[##Extension of time granted.##]##</inline> There are only three wheat electorates in that State. The Government of .South Australia has passed a drought relief bill. The onus is now on the Commonwealth Government to pay its half of the amount involved.  Lt  receives all the income taxes from the wheat-growers in South Australia and from- every other taxpayer. The State Government is npt reimbursed one-half of the revenue thus obtained, vet it is standing up to one-ha##'##.f of the cost of drought relief. I want to know, and so will the wheat-growers of South Australia, whether the Commonwealth Government is prepared to find the other half. I do not think that it will. Distilleries for the distillation of wheat are scattered all over Australia.; yet in Western Australia the wheat-growers were paid about 12.##Â»##. an acre not to grow wheat. The right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> has stated in this House time and again that the first munition of war is food. Early in the  war, science produced methods whereby the weevil menace was overcome; therefore, the Government did not have to worry about that. lt stands to reason that it would be far better to store wheat and have it available for  consumt1011  when required, than to pay to wheatgrowers 12s. an acre not to grow wheat. </para>

                            <para>- We are now talking about present facts. Judged in every way, this Government##'##s record in respect of wheat has been a sorry one. The present scheme is one of the sorriest that has ever been propounded, although it is not quite so bad as the Scully .wheat plan, under which grower was set against grower, and the attempt was made to divide all growers into two lots. Now all growers are treated alike. One of the first rules of law in a democratic community is that everybody shall stand equal in the eyes of the law, whether lip. be a small man or a big man. It is pleasing to note that the Government is exhibiting some semblance of a sense of justice on this occasion. ##"##But it is quite easy to guarantee a price when the information in the possession of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture must prove that for some years ahead the price of wheat will be very much higher than 5s. 2d. a bushel. Not much political courage is needed, no great financial risk is taken, in guaranteeing 5s. 2d. a bushel, when one knows that wheat is going to be worth from 8s. to 12s. a bushel. That is not politics ; it is getting down to ##'##a fairly low level. The Minister ##"##put his foot right in it ##"## this morning. If he considers that he can convince the wheat-growers of the justice of the scheme that he has placed before them, he will find that he is backing another loser, as he did in connexion with the Scully wheat plan. </para>

                        <para>.The speech delivered by the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> was irrelevant to the motion, but it showed clearly enough that the merchants still have among the Opposition some very strong advocates. A method for the control of wheat marketing was instituted during the two periods of crises in our history, the 1914-18 war, and the war just concluded. During both those periods it was necessary to organize wheat pools in order to give the industry stability. After the last war, the pool system was broken down by the representatives of the merchants, and the representatives of the same interests are trying to-day to destroy the system of organized wheat marketing which has been established. The honorable member for Indi interjected that the Government had to be pushed into every move in the direction of establishing a concessional price system. In order to understand the situation, it is necessary to be familiar with the background. On the 15th November, 1939, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies,</inline> who was then Prime Minister, said##'## that the Government intended to acquire the whole of the wheat crop at an average price of 2s. 9d. per bushel bagged, and 2s. 7d. a. bushel bulk, less freight. This meant ls. 8d. to ls. 9d. bagged, and ls. 5d. to ls. 7d. bulk, with the possibility of another dividend to be paid in April. The honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin)</inline> was incorrect when he said that the Government proposed to pay only 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. at ports. He did not add that we ,proposed to pay also to the farmers 50 per cent, of the amount by which the export price exceeded 5s. 2d. Thus, 5s. 2d. is the minimum price, but under the scheme introduced by the previous Government, the maximum price was an average of 2s. 2d. a bushel. Members of the Australian Country party are now weeping crocodile tears over the concessional price issuer but let me quote a statement by the honorable member for Indi on the 17th September, 1940 - </para>

                        <para>In these matters the Country party members took a prominent part, but they had to reconcile what they wanted to give with what was available.

                    <para class="block">It is clear, therefore, that if any one was pushed into making- concessions it was the then government. At that time, representatives of the Australian Country party in this House were more concerned with getting positions for themselves in the Cabinet than with protecting the interests of the wheat-growers. It was then very hard to dispose of wheat, and the wheat-growers themselves suggested that production should be reduced. *Some members of the Australian Country party even went so far as to suggest that there##'## should be a complete -##"## wheat, holiday ##"## in some States. Thechief adviser of the honorable member for Indi, the man who was nominated to the Wheat Board by the Australian Country party, complained that the Government was piling up surplus wheat stocks. </para>

                            <para>- They were Australian Country party representatives who approached the Government on the matter. The Government refused a complete wheat holiday, but, because stocks were rising, it consented to a reduction of production for one year. Then, on the request of the wheat-growers themselves, we continued that .scheme for three years. Recently, the Australian manager of the Wheat Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thompson,</inline> made an important statement about wheat at a conference in Sydney. This man was appointed to his position by a previous government at a salary of ##Â£##5,000 a year. I do not complain of the size of the salary, he has shown himself to be worth it. However, it was a very high salary, and the fact that it was paid shows that the Opposition, when in power, thought i great deal of this man. <inline font-style="italic">##[##Extension of time granted.##]##</inline> This is what he said - </para>

                        <para>As I atn leaving the Wheat Board shortly it will be a happy thing for me to know this particular matter is cleaned up. So far J have had to put the growers case to the Minister and the Minister##'##s case to the growers, and it is just as well I have now to toe the straight and narrow line and tell you where I do stand on this matter. Throughout my connexion with the Australian Wheat Board, at no time has any government asked the board to do something which was unfair to the growers and on the other hand I must also say at no time have requests been made from growers which were unfair. In fact, they have been most lenient to the board and overlooked such mistakes as the board has made and instead of picking on details have taken the broad results of the work done and I can assure you it is highly appreciated. On this particular matter the same good feeling will eventually find a solution which will be accepted by everybody. Now. in August. 1943, we intimated, as a Wheat Board, that the price of export wheat was now getting out of line with the price at which stock feed was being bought and asked to meet you and discuss the matter. At that meeting you readily agreed with the board and- yourself suggested the formula that the price for stock feed should be the average of the rest of the pool. That was accepted by the board am i subsequently notified tn the conference st Gunnedah and to deputations to the federation awl on several other occasions ir has been substantiated by yourself.  </para>
                        <para>We cannot ignore the fact, we all three bodies agreed upon this particular move. If there is any responsibility to-day, we can share in it. On the other hand, certain things took place subsequent to that time which demanded we should reconsider it because it is not our affair but the affair of the wheat-growers. I refer to the tremendous increase in the use of stock feed which was still more aggravated by thu drought. At the time we met you in conference we were using about 15,000.000 bushels nf wheat a year for stock feed. At one stage it went up to something like fiO.000,000 bushels. Therefore, it does seem there is some justification for asking that we should have a frank talk on this subject. I am pleased at the frank way in which you put the matter before the conference this morning. I am sure if we are to speak equally frankly you will be satisfied. Tt seems because of this, change that took place we can put before the Government for their consideration. The Wheat Board has considered this on several occasions, but it is not a body that can say what price ought to be. 1 1. run say what it could have sold the wheat at, and the letter which was sent to you gave you the price which, within very narrow limits, shows what the Board could have obtained for the wheat had it been selling it on the open market. There##'## are some growers and members of the Wheat Board who think that no matter what else takes place that should Vie the price. On the other hand there are some growers and members of the Wheat Board who believe that the price laid down by the regulations covering the price fixing, that price should be paid because growers benefit by the holding of the price at something within a reasonable rate instead of allowing them to sky rocket, and, therefore, become onerous on the wheat-growers as well as on the rest of the community. </para>
                        <para>The formula upon which we all agreed has paid in just over ##Â£##5,800,000, which is a substantial sum. We would##'## like your Government to realize that Canada is to be the basis of an international wheat agreement upon which all wheat prices are to revolve. The International Wheat Agreement provides prices to be fixed which will meet the reasonable costs of production and give a reasonable price to consumers and Canada##'##s prices are those which are fixed as a basis. Canada has enjoyed prices up to quite recently which were not fixed: from which there ##'##was no reduction, and this Canadian growers have obtained the benefit of the high prices ruling from the war. They have been able to reduce their capital commitments, their interest, and so on, and in the post-war period will find their costs in that connexion should be materially reduced, a? they are the- basis that puts our Australian farmer in ;i difficult position because apart from the other disabilities duo to our geographical position, we have to meet those disabilities which the wheat-growers of Canada have been able to gain.  I  would like you to have that in mind because sometimes it has been overlooked. The pools that are particularly affected are Nos. fi and 7. So far as No. 5 is concerned, in view of the agreement made it will he recognized by everybody as reasonable at the time it was made. No. (1 pool comes into it to a slight extent but in my own view there is not any material discrepancy in No. 0 pool. No. 8 pool has had no wheat for stock feed.  1  tin not think any one here wants to try and work points on the Government, and I am sure the Government does not want to work points on the wheat-growers. No. 7 pool has not been fairly treated for reasons beyond your control and beyond our control, and I do not think there should be an adjustment there on a frank statement made. I have heard; the treasury officials have been frank, the wheat grower is not the only man involved in this sort of thing. There is this difference. The wheat-growers went into this under regulations which were practically a bargain between the Government and the wheat-grower and provided for certain methods being carried out, and that is a little different from those of the other industries. The position of No. 7 pool in particular might be given further consideration by your Government. </para>

                        (Wimmera) ##[##18.18.1 . - As member for Wimmera, the greatest and best wheat-growing constituency in the Commonwealth, I say that our duty in this House, when dealing with the wheat industry, is to get down to fundamentals. The real questions are (1.) Is the industry worth saving?; (2) does the Government consider that 4s. 2d. a bushel at country sidings covers the cost of production and a fair margin of profit?; (3) should the producers be called upon to bear the brunt of the concessional prices for wheat?; (4) should not the 1945-4##'##6 crop he kept out of the pool and the growers be allowed the full price for that wheat on account of the years and years of drought that they have had to put up with, about which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture

                        has expressed sympathy to-day? Too much . time has. been taken up in this debate by honorable gentlemen opposite saying what other governments have or have not. done, but the past has nothing to do with the question of what is to be done for the wheat industry now. Wheat-growers throughout ##'## my constituency are protesting against the policy of the Government, which deprives them of the full price that will be paid for their wheat. Meetings of protest have been held at Culgoa, Warracknabeal, Ouyen, Hopetoun, Kerang, Swan Hill, Sea Lake, Rainbow and other centres. Protests were also made at meetings held at, Melbourne and Perth. Another has. just concluded in Perth. The producers claim that the price that they are offered is wholly inadequate. A day or so ago, one Minister admitted to me that the wheat-grower was entitled to the cost of production plus a fair profit.

Another offender in that respect is the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lemmon),</inline> who said, ##"##We want to look at the conditions that confronted the wheat-growing industry at the outset of the war ##"##. Nonsense ! What we have to examine is the condition that confronts the industry to-day. We want to ascertain what is causing the drift from the farms to the cities. We want to discover what will curb that drift and give the greatest impetus to decentralization: A glance at the position will disclose that the wheat-growers have been excluded from schemes designed to stabilize industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tonkin,</inline> at the dinner tendered by the Primary Producers Association and the Wheat and Wool Growers Union to delegates to the conference of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation in Perth on the 4th April, said - </para>

I cannot understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tonkin</inline> did not go to the core of the matter and discuss the question whether 4s. 2d. a bushel at country sidings equals the cost of production, plus a fair profit. The wheat industry is languishing, and, if it is to be restored to the position of being a great Australian asset, some tonic must be administered to it that will help it  back onto its feet. People were first attracted to Australia by the lure of gold, but, when the pursuit of gold became unprofitable, people turned their bands to the land; thereafter, Australian prosperity was built on the foundation of the products of the soil and the pastures. Upon the wheat industry, as well as the wool industry, Australia##'##s future depends. </para>
                    <para>The export price of wheat from December, 1944. to March, 1945, was 6s. 5##Â£##d. a bushel, and, in April and May,. 1945, 7,722,850 bushels of wheat was sold for stock feed when the export value was 7s. 4id. a bushel. In June, July and August, 12,269,169 bushels was sold when the export price was 8s. 8d., leaving 12,111,000 bushels to be sold after August. Why was the price to be paid to growers for export wheat fixed at the lowest level wheat had reached that year, namely 6s. 5-Jd. ?

                        the Government, under the stabilization plan, cannot offer the wheat-grower more than 4s. 2d. a bushel at country sidings. However, the right approach to this matter is not the price that wheat is fetching, but the cost of production. So let us start at that end and ask ourselves whether the producer is not entitled to the cost of production, plus a fair profit. All fair-minded people will agree that he is.

                    <para>I have received dozens of letters from wheat-farmers, who lost their crops through drought, saying that they want to sow their land with wheat, but have not the money to carry on satisfactorily in the industry. ##"## We want drought relief##"##, they say, but the Commonwealth Government has handed that matter over to the States, and nothing has been done. There must be close cooperation between the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments on the matter of drought relief. </para>

                            <para>- They certainly will not, pay that they are satisfied, because they are intensely dissatisfied and are holding meetings of protest everywhere. The only people who do favour ##'## the present set-up are those dependent on the Government for jobs. They are part-time farmers, relying on governmental positions for the bulk of their means of livelihood. The wheat-farmers have always battled for stabilized prices, because no one knows better than they do how price vagaries affect their economic position and cause their industry to languish. But wheat to-day is selling at 10s. 4Â¾d. a bushel in the world markets, and, on that basis, many years will elapse before the Government will be called upon to contribute one penny to the wheat stabilization fund. It would not be too much to expect the Government to pay 5s.2d. a bushel for wheat at country sidings. If it did so it would be acting in the best interests of the country, because it would thereby foster the production of a grain for which the world is crying out. </para>

As honorable members know, some doubt, has existed in the public mind as to when the National Security Act, in its terms, would come to an end.

                <para>According to the terms of the original act, there could be no doubt that the termination of the war for the purposes of the National Security Act and regulations thereunder, would be marked by the issue of a proclamation. In 1940, an amending act was passed, in which the definition of ##"## the present state of war ##"## was repealed, and a new section 19 was substituted therefor. I cannot say that I either personally recall or have been able to discover the precise reason for the abolition of the definition of the present state of war ##"##. I do not know whether the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has been able to discover why the amendment was made. </para>

                <para>During the last few months in particular, a good deal of discussion has occurred as to whether the war ended with the surrender of Japan, or would end only with the issue of a proclamation of peace. Consequently,there has been considerable uncertainty in the mind of the outside business community in particular as to how long the regulations under the National Security Act would operate. </para>
                <para class="block">My own view has been in conformity with that of the Crown Law authorities, namely, that the war would end when a proclamation was issued, but, admittedly, that is a matter upon which some doubt has existed. What this bill does is to produce a terminating point for the National Security Act.From the standpoint of those who said that VP-Day was the end of the war, and, consequently, that the act terminated six months thereafter, this bill represents an extension of the time of the operation of the National Security Act.From the standpoint of those who believe that the war would end when a proclamation was issued, this act represents a curtailment of the operation of the National Security Act. As my own view has been, and is, that the issue of a proclamation of peace was the normal time, this bill, to me, represents a provision for terminating the National Security Act at a date earlier than it might otherwise have come to an end. </para>
                <para>I do not desire to occupy the time of the House unduly at this stage of the sittings by discussing the legalities that are involved in this matter, but it may be useful if I were to say to honorable members a few sentences on the broad legal questions involved in it. In making this statement, I have little doubt that my own view is shared by the Attorney-General. In the determination of the constitutional validity or statutory validity of a National Security regulation, two questions always arise. The first is whether the regulation is within the terms of the National Security Act. Once this bill is passed, that problem, so far as it involves consideration of time, will be cleared up. But the second question is not whether a regulation is within the terms of the National Security Act, but whether, assuming that to be so, the regulation is one which may be made properly under the constitutional power. In other words, at this moment, on this day, in this month, does the Constitution authorize the Government, under the National Security Act, to pass a certain regulation? That is a matter which, in spite of certain remarks made outside the Parliament, cannot be answered in any broad simple proposition. It can be answered only by considering the intrinsic nature of each regulation which is concerned. </para>
                <para class="block">For example, under the National Security Act, a. ##'##censorship regulation could be made quite validly up to the 31st December next. I am now taking the present bill into account. But the question which the court would have to ask itself would be : Once the actual war ends and the fighting finishes, is the imposition of censorship related to the defence of Australia? Does it come within the naval and military defence of Australia? It may very well be that three or six months ago the High Court would have said that a censorship regulation was invalid, not because it was not within the terms of the National##"## Security Act, but because it was not within the Constitution.##'## On the other hand, certain  regulaions  which the Government introduced would undoubtedly continue for a substantial period after the war. The court would say that, just as it is within the defence power to impose certain economic and financial restrictions in war-time, so </para>
                <para>Chey may be maintained in time of peace so long as they are related directly to the war economy. The. result is that, in regard to every different subject-matter, there may be a different point of time at which regulations cease to be related to the defence power of the Commonwealth. I say that, not because I desire to occupy the time of the House with these technical legal matters, but in order to make it clear to people who are interested that this bill will provide a terminal point for all National Security regulations, but makes no provision, in the meantime, regarding the validity of National Security regulations. I for one, as the member of this House who was initially responsible for the introduction of the National Security Bill in 1939, welcome a definite statement and a definite legislative proposal regarding the termination of the , act. I welcome also the announcement that, after the termination of this act, those regulations which the Government desires to continue will take ordinary statutory form, so that they may he discussed in the Parliament, and, if they become law, their validity will have to stand examination in the light of established legal principles. They will be just as open to legal examination as are ordinary regulations, but the great  advantage  will be that the Parliament will have had an opportunity to discuss them,, and their form and principles, so that they will represent the will of the Parliament and not merely the will of theExecutive. </para>
                <para>At this stage I shall say no more exceptto add a retrospective remark. This Parliament, throughout the war, entrusted the Executive with vast authority. That was, I believe; the proper course. It hasundoubtedly proved a very useful thing to do, but it has involved an abandonment to a substantial degree of parliamentary authority. During the years of crisis the Parliament delegated its authority to the Executive. This bill marks the return to the Parliament of its ordinary legislative authority, and, to that extent, it marks the resumption of the ordinary democratic processes as opposed to the necessarily more autocratic processes which occur in war-time and in time of emergency. Many unusual things have been done. Under these regulations many citizens have been brought into the service of the Commonwealth. The nation, in fact, has received remarkable service, from the most highly placed individuals exercising the widest possible authority downto the humblest private citizens who have worked in the war effort. This occasion, should not be allowed to pass without an expression from the members of this House of its profound gratitude for the work that has been done by many citizens under the authority of this legislation. I suppose there is not a single department of the Commonwealth Service in which great authority has not been exercised by citizens who, in many instances served in a voluntary capacity in the cause of the nation. Many citizens##'## completely abandoned their private##'## pursuits and surrendered their usual emoluments in order to do some notable piece of work. Other citizens, who may not have been able to go so far as that, have substantially sacrificed their private interests. Many others have willingly accepted great personal inconvenience in order to undertake work which was necessary for the maintenance of the stability of the country. The Attorney-General is familiar with trie names of citizens who in munitions establishments, in the various service and public departments, and on boards of business administration and the like, have  done magnificent work throughout the war. 1 take the opportunity provided hy the introduction of this measure to terminate  I  he operation of emergency regulations to meet emergency circumstances, to say, not only as Leader of the Opposition, but alSo as Prime Minister for the first two years of the war, that we are profoundly grateful, in this Parliament, for all the work that has been so well done. </para>

                            <para>mutiny by native troops in New Guinea, of which  I  believe the Government is aware.  I  consider it to be essential that steps be taken to prevent any recurrence of the trouble. On the 13th March  I  asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> whether he was aware that a mutiny of native troops had occurred at Rabaul. The right honorable gentleman replied that he was not aware of it, but would have inquiries made and advise me of the result. As  I  have heard nothing from the Prime Minister on the subject since then,  I  was inclined to believe that there could have been little foundation for the statements that had been made to me. However,  I  have received advice from other sources which suggest to me that the Government is adopting a form of evasion in its replies. The disturbances in New Guinea appear to me to be of so serious a nature as to threaten the lives of certain service and civil personnel. 1 have received advice from the  executive of the Pacific Territories Association to the effect that reports obtained from reliable sources indicate that acts of  insubordination  have been committed by* natives of the New Guinea Infantry Battalion at Rabaul. The executive of the association is of the opinion, in view of these reports, that the arming of certain natives of New Guinea and Papua is contrary to the be3t interests alike of the natives themselves and of the territory. I understand that these views were conveyed to the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. ##"##Ward)</inline> in a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Adelskold,  secretary of the Pacific Territories Association, dated the 4th February last. The association stated in its letter that reports from, reliable sources indicated that a very unsatisfactory state of affairs existed. It also forwarded to the Minister for External Territories information of specific instances of acts of insubordination and of abuse and threats directed by members of the New Guinea Infantry Butta lion against Australian officers. As the letter indicates the extent and seriousness of the mutiny and of the general situation I shall read it. </para>

                    <para>Last Saturday week, 1##]##th inst., a party of N.G.I.B. boys went by truck to Kokopo and entered areas out of bounds. When Lieutenant Dean tried to remove them they threatened him and called him ##"##a bloody Angau bastard##"##, ##&amp;##c; ##&amp;##c, and said that they had ,won the war here and elsewhere, and that the Australians always ran awa}##'##, and so on. </para>
                    <para>The A.D.O. at Kokopo, Captain Johnson, went with Lieutenant Dean to the N.G.T.B. Head-quarters to complain to the officer in command in the absence of Colonel Allen in New Ireland, but only non-New Guinea officers were there who had no idea of dealing with the situation. </para>
                    <para>The N.G.T.B. boys surrounded their car and tried to prevent them from seeing the O.C., threatening them with tommy guns, axes, bayonets, ##&amp;##c.. and again called them various so-and-sos. They also stole Lieutenant Dean##'##s revolver out of the Jeep. </para>
                    <para>This Saturday the performance was repeated at Kokopo, whore they released N.G.I.B. prisoners and demonstrated threateningly against the A.D.O. and officers whose lives 1 consider to be in grave danger unless strong action is taken. </para>
                    <para>In Rabaul, on the same night, the N.G.I.B##'##. guard on the Japanese prison compound left their posts with their Bren guns, ##&amp;##c, and demonstrated against the O.C. Native Police, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Eon</inline> Hicks, using similar bad language, threats and boasts. They then released N.G.I.B. and other native prisoners from the calaboose. </para>
                    <para>This morning there was a conference be- . tween the G.O.C., General Eather, Brigadier Graham (just arrived from Lae), the District Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Bates,</inline> and others. I have not heard##'## what transpired, but I believe they are awaiting the return of  Colonel Allen  before taking action. </para>
                    <para>This N.G.I.B. business seems to be entirely unnecessary and undesirable, and I think that, in view of the happenings, it should be disbanded and the Native Police Force should be built up to sufficient strength for police purposes and other activities not performed by the Australian garrison troops. If drastic action be not taken there will be serious trouble and possible loss of life, and general disaffection of the native population. If the Government were trying to create an ##"## Indonesian situation ##"## here they could not be doing better towards that? end. </para>
                    <para class="block">Those are very serious statements from a reputable source. In the light of information I had received, I asked the Prime Minister to inquire as to how far the mutiny had spread, and what disciplinary action had been taken; but I have not received any advice from him. The Pacific Territories Association wrote to the Minister for External Territories on the 4th February, and on##'## the 6th February that honorable gentleman promised to take up the matter with the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> On the 12th February, the association again wrote to the Minister for External Territories, stating that, as the result of nets of insubordination, senior officers of Angau had suggested the disba.nd.ment of the native unit, which  constituted a threat to the lives of officers, and possibly to those of returning civilians. Angau stressed that this was not merely a passing phase, but a movement that might grow, because the native troops were armed. The Minister replied on the 14th February that, he had forwarded the additional information to the Minister for the Army. On the 21st February, the association received a copy of a letter from the Minister for the Army to the Minister for External Territories, acknowledging his letter of the 14t,h February, and stating that an endeavour would be made to furnish an early reply. This incident occurred in January. The Government has ignored -the questions that have been asked in this House, and the representations of the Pacific Territories Association and Angau. The </para>
                    <para class="block">House and the country are still waiting to learn what disciplinary action has. been taken, and what the Minister intends to do to preserve the peace of the community. The Minister might now be able to tell the House whether the trouble has passed. Was disciplinary .action taken ? Has full control of the natives been restored to the officers who were insulted? Have the theft of the revolver of a responsible military officer, and many other acts of violence, been investigated and dealt with in accordance with military law? Coloured peoples who have learned of the uprising in Indonesia must be in a state of unrest. What steps does the Minister propose to take for the disarming of the natives, with a view to preserving the peace that has always been observed in the territories held under mandate by Australia? </para>
                    <para>This morning I questioned the Prime Minister in connexion with the cancellation of orders for Australian goods of a value of more than ##Â£##6,000,000 that had been placed by the Dutch Government, because of the failure to secure their delivery in the Netherlands East Indies. I know it will be said that shortage of shipping has been one of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> causes of this failure. But the trouble goes deeper than that. It had its origin in the refusal of members of the Waterside Workers##'## Federation to load all Dutch ships, including mercy ships that were intended to carry food and medical supplies to the Netherlands East Indies. Those ships might have been used in a shuttle service for the carriage of the goods that had been ordered from Australia by the Dutch. The Prime Minister has said that goods to a value of not more than ##Â£##2,000,000 have been kept in Australia by reason of the failure of the ships to leave our ports. The more recent advice we have received proves that orders to a. value of ##Â£##6,000,000 have been cancelled by the Netherlands East In dic8 Government export and import organization, under the authority of the director, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jan</inline> Van der Noordaa,  ##'## Dutch ships have been held up in Australia since last  September,  due to the black ban imposed on them by Aus.tralian waterside workers and seamen. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is natural to expect the Dutch  authori-lies  to be bewildered .and disgusted by  the  attitude of the waterside workers, and the failure of the Government to enforce the law. Dutch nationals, in the  persons  of Indonesian seamen, may have originated the trouble by walking off the ships. Had that shipping been available, food and manufactured articles of an estimated value of ##Â£##20,000,000 would have been sent from Australia to the Netherlands East Indies during 1946. That statement has been made by one of the Dutch authorities. The Prime Minister, in reply to me this morning, said that factors other than those that I had mentioned might be involved; for example, . the Dutch authorities might not have sufficient purchasing power to obtain goods from Australia. I have no knowledge of that. But I do know that the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jan</inline> Van der Noordaa  leaves no doubt in .the minds of those who have read it that these orders were cancelled, not because the Dutch were not able to purchase the goods, but because shipping was not available for their carriage. Honorable members will recall that Lord Louis Mountbatten, while in Australia, played an active part in this matter, and spoke in strong terms. He had  come straight . from Java, and was acquainted with the sufferings of both the white and the coloured peoples. He realized the urgency of their being supplied immediately with food and other essentials. Notwithstanding his representations, the position remains where it was before he intervened. Last February, a D##'##utch official said - </para>

                        <para>Surely the Australian Government realizes the grave damage being done throughout the East to Australia##'##s political prestige and to her trade relations! It would seem that the best thing we can do is to cease trying tn do business with Australia. We have suffered a succession of disappointments and humiliations. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Australia has developed a very big manufacturing capacity, and requires overseas markets for what it produces. If we do not##'## wish to revert to unemployment and depression, we should endeavour to produce more in order that we may take advantage of the markets that are open to us. Some persons, regard the Netherlands East Indies as our best prospective market. Last January, the Netherlands Government announced the cancellation of orders for flour that had been placed with Australia. The orders were then placed in America, which is a competitor of Australia in eastern markets. Before the war, Australia supplied 99 per cent, of the flour imported by the Netherlands East Indies, totalling approximately 100,000 tons, of a value of from ##Â£##1,500,000 to ##Â£##2,000,000. Honorable members who have - studied the trade statistics in relation to eastern markets know that America is the largest supplier of . the Netherlands East Indies and other eastern countries, because it knows how to ensure the transport of the goods to their destinations. Australia is closer to those markets, and has not the long haulage which America has to undertake. We do not need to approach the Dutch for orders, because they are taking the initiative. Yet all that we say is, ##"##We are very sorry. Because the. waterside workers have##'## boasted that the ships will not go to you, we cannot do business with you ##"##. I pleaded with the Prims Minister to preserve the national economy in relation to our trade with the Netherlands East Indies, and was left completely confused by his answer. On the 16th January, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Van</inline> der Noordaa  said that Australia was losing an export trade to the Indies of a value of ##Â£##11,000,000. He went on to say that we would have lost the whole of that trade by the end of February, and added, ##"## It <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> even possible that some of this trade may be lost permanently ##"##. Large orders for salted fish, rice, dried fruits, tinned vegetables, butter, tinned milk, biscuits, cheese and animal fats which had been placed in Australia would have to be placed elsewhere, according to a Dutch authority, who added that all purchasing in Australia had ceased. The Netherlands East Indies requires industrial produce, and would have, purchased from Australia machine and hand tools, rice cultivating implements, blankets and woollens. All this trade has been lost to ns, and the loss is due almost entirely to industrial unrest, which the Government seems powerless to combat. Not only the great strike which occurred during the Christmas period and lost to Australia, production and wages worth millions of pounds, but also successive  strikes on the coal-fields, have been the means of creating an industrial situation which must  immediately react to Australia##'##s disadvantage. The failure of the Government to take action must have encouraged the waterside workers in their recalcitrance. An indication of the loss of trade from which Australia is suffering because, of dislocation resulting from industrial trouble is contained in the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> S. Wong, the leader of the Hong Kong trade mission, which came to Australia in February last. The Hong Kong traders wanted to pay cash and provide shipping for a wide range of Australian products, but the goods were not available, and the disappointed mission had to return to Hong Kong. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wong</inline> said - </para>
                    <para>The shortage of goods in Australia will force us to buy in America, where goods are more plentiful. Even a. token shipment would have kept Australia##'##s name-before Hong Kong retailers. </para>
                    <para class="block">Thus, industrial trouble is preventing, us from, filling orders and is destroying our commercial goodwill with the islands and nations to the north. Industrial stoppages have also prevented the manufacture of goods for the use of our own people, apart from the building up of reserves for export. The more recent action of the waterside workers in preventing the sailing of mercy ships with food and medical supplies for the unfortunate people of Indonesia has kept those ships idle, so that they have not been able to lift ##Â£##6,000,000 worth of goods ordered by the Dutch. When the Prime Minister was answering my question this morning, it appeared that he completely failed to recognize that we had any obligation whatever to the Dutch. He did not say that action would be taken to enable the Dutch ships now in Australian ports to carry goods to the Netherlands East Indies. Evidently, he failed to realize that the Dutch had placed their fleet between us and the Japanese in the battles which took place to the north of Australia when Japan was casting covetous eyes on this country. The Dutch have been good allies to us. Indeed, there has been developed a blood brotherhood between us, and we owe them something more than mere lip service. During the war, Holland  lost. 200,000 of its people as the result of German action. Nearly 140,000 persons were deliberately murdered in concentration camps, and a further 20,000 were shot or starved to death. The total war casualties amongst the Dutch amounted to 22 per 1,000 inhabitants, whereas, even in the United Kingdom, the rate was only 7 per 1,000. It is the duty of the Government to see that the  law  is observed and that the waterside workers load the Dutch ships so that relief may be sent to the people suffering in the Netherlands East Indies. Now the Dutch have said, in effect, ##"## If you cannot make the waterside workers obey the law and work our ships, we shall place th err  at  your disposal to bring to Australia the British brides of your servicemen ##"##. There is a subtle irony in that gesture which the Government seems unable to appreciate. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I again urge the Government to give attention to the two matters which I have raised, the mutiny of armed native troops in  New  Guinea, and the need to take some action to enable trade with the Dutch to be carried on, so that the economy of the country may lien efi t. </para>

                                <para>- I have discussed the matter with representatives from New Zealand, and I have found that that country has been very generous. I hope that Australia will emulate Now Zealand, and will make a contribution to the food supplies of Great Britain, if necessary by imposing further rationing on our people. 1 ask the Minister for- the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> to give his attention to the demobilization of men in the Navy. I have been informed that demobilization is not being carried out on the same terms as in the Army and the Air Force. There is a points system, but instead of making it apply generally over the whole service, each branch and mustering has its own system of points. Consequently, some men who have served throughout the whole of the war are still retained. I have already taken up with the Minister the case of a man. who was called up some weeks before the war, but who has been refused discharge on the grounds that he has not yet enough points. The same thing, I understand, applies to many of the permanent ratings. Even though they have points well in excess of what would be necessary to release men from the other service.?, they are unable to get their discharge from the Navy. I think it is true that not one permanent petty officer has been promoted to commissioned rank during the whole of the war. Justice is due to these men, who have borne much of the brunt of war service, and have received so few of the rewards. It may be that men are being kept in the Navy because recruits are not forthcoming to take their places. If that he so, the Government should call up recruits now, rather than wait until after the elections. Those who have given years of service should be allowed to return to civilian life. The Man Power Department decided that one man who has served in the Navy for six years was not needed in his previous occupation, and he was retained, although he had spent every one of his last six birthdays at sea. Other men, with fewer points, have obtained their discharges, and are taking the jobs of those who cannot get out. The men of the Navy do not go on strike or hold up ships. They fought loyally for their country, and now expect to receive justice. </para>

                            <para>.- I direct attention to the lack of appreciation by the Public Service Board and the Government of the magnificent service rendered during the war by meat inspectors in Queensland, where they were engaged in examining food for the use of our own forces and those of our allies. This branch has been in existence for over 30 years, and the men have striven persistently for their rights. A long time c lapsed before they could obtain benefit from the Arbitration Court. Eventually <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers heard their ease and decided that 55.5 per cent: of them should be made permanent, which meant that 40 were appointed permanently, leaving 34 on a temporary basis. Since then the percentage has been reduced from 55.5 to as low as17.7. The States treat their employees much better. Queensland officers become permanent after six months of temporary employment, and the period of qualification for permanency in New South Wales is twelve months. But, in the Commonwealth Public Service, men with up to seventeen years temporary employment are still deniedpermanency, notwithstanding that the Superannuation Act was amended recently to enable temporary public servants with five years in the service to qualify for benefits. The Meat Inspectors Association asks that its members who qualify under the Superannuation Act for benefits should also be entitled under the Commonwealth Public Service Act to permanent appointment. During the war the meat inspectors performed splendidly in ensuring the quality of the food Supplied to our troops and the troops of allied forces. They will be called upon, with the advent of peace, to continue that service until the occupation of enemy countries ends. It beyond comprehension that the Public Service Board should deny permanency to these men. I know that the Minister for Commerce - and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> is sympathetic, because he has expressed his sympathy with them to deputations of honorable members on both sides of the House representing Queensland constituencies. </para>

                            <para>.- Early in March I asked the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> certain questions about the Dutch ships that are held up in Australian ports. Amongst other things, I asked the right honorable gentleman as to the terms that the wharf labourers bad laid down for allowing the ships to sail. He told me that a reply was being prepared, but that, as a conference was being held on the matter, it had been delayed, and that, he thought, it was better to wait until he could supply full information. I waited a little while before repeating my  7-equest  for information.  His  reply then was that none would be forthcoming. About six weeks have passed since then and the right honorable gentleman has had ample opportunity to get the full information. If he has it, as he should, he refuses to give any. This is a matter of great public importance, affecting not, only this Parliament, but also the prestige of Australia. Honorable members should be supplied with full information regarding the occurrences, the prospects, if any, of an early settlement, and the. action which the Government proposes to take to ensure the departure of the ships. But the Government is unwilling to give the facts, and is hiding any information that mav be available. Earlier the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> pointed out. that lame quantities of stores were being withheld from the Netherlands East Indies, and large orders given to </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">Australian manufacturers and primary producers were being withdrawn by the Dutch authorities. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> referred to that danger during the motion of want of confidence a few weeks ago. He showed that very unfortunate results to Australia, would accrue if our##"## trade relations with the Netherlands East Indies were disturbed. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> in reply said,  ##"## This is a materialistic approach. I do not approach the problem in that way. I think it far more important to work with higher motives ##"##. What are those higher motives? No indication has been given that the Government is actuated by any motives at all, since nothing has been done for four months to settle the problem. What higher motives are there than the motives to help suffering humanity? As the result of the Government##'##s inaction, the health of thousands of refugees in Java has been affected. Because of the refusal of waterside workers to load the Dutch ships, urgently required relief has been withheld from those unfortunate refugees. Amongst the goods to be sent in those ships were watercarts and motor trucks. The water supplies of many towns in Java, including Batavia and Sourabaya, have been destroyed, and water carts are urgently needed. In addition, motor trucks are required to carry necessary stores and provisions. The mere fact that those ships. could not sail with the goods, and, therefore, those supplies could not be delivered, has caused the death of a. number of refugees and a great deterioration of the health of thousands of others. That is not the only consideration which should actuate the Government in this matter. Surely we still have some loyalty to our Dutch Allies, who did so much for us in the war. Hundreds of Australian servicemen, who were prisoners in the Far East, were helped materially by Dutch citizens at the risk of their own lives- Now, when we are called upon to repay some of $hat debt, we are not doing anything. </para>
                        <para>The withdrawal of these ships from the general, shipping pool available to the Allies at this time calls for comment. At one period, sixteen ships were laid up at ports in Australia. Most of theIr have now departed, but seven have been  tied up in harbours for seven months. A few days ago, the Prime Minister stated that General MacArthur was allotting to Australia certain ships for the repatriation of Japanese at Rabaul. Those vessels will be drawn from the general shipping pool. Yet, seven ships are lying idle in Australian ports ! How does the Government explain that? </para>
                        <para>I come finally to the trade consideration. The honorable member for Wenthworth said that, large orders had been cancelled by the Dutch authorities because of the shipping hold-up. In addition, stores acquired by the Dutch authorities are now filled with their purchases, and the Dutch have been asked to vacate the premises. Those goods cannot be exported. About a month ago, Australian millers had orders from the Netherlands East Indies for ##Â£##2,000,000 worth of flour. Those orders have been cancelled. Another important consideration is backloading. Ships which took Australian flour to the Netherlands East Indies would naturally return with ##'## pepper, which is unobtainable here, tea and other goods which we require in large quantities. In March, the Dutch cancelled orders for large quantities of agricultural machinery and tools. When I referred these matters to the Prime Minister he brushed them aside, as if they were of no importance. He stated that the Dutch in Australia had not sufficient credits to enable them to buy large quantities of goods, and that they had not been satisfied with the prices quoted. But the fact remains that the prices must have satisfied the Dutch, because they placed large orders with Australian exporters. Finally, the Prime Minister said that Australia was not in a position to sell large quantities of goods. I remind the right honorable gentleman that the quantity of goods which we sell is not of great importance. Even token sales are of great value. We in Australia need to build up goodwill in trade, and in the final analysis goodwill is the factor that counts. For seven months Dutch ships have been held up in Australian ports, and the Government does not seem to have taken any action. Numerous conferences which have been held have not solved the difficulty. Honorable members have not even been told what took place at those discussions. The Supreme Allied Commander in SouthEast Asia, Lord Louis Mountbatten, talked to the representatives of the waterside workers, no doubt at the request of the Government, to see what could be done. Again, nothing happened. For a time it seemed as if the ships would sail, and the Government made some hopeful statements. To-day the Prime Minister said that a conference was taking place, and he hoped that something would eventuate. I am becoming tired of hopeful statements, when no action is  taken. What action should the Government take? The only thing that it can do is to direct numbers of servicemen who, for the most part, are not doing anything, to load the ships. These ships must sail so that the stain on our honour may be erased. But the matter goes even 9 deeper than that. A principle is involved. If the Government considers that these ships should be loaded and sail with their cargoes, let the Prime Minister, say so in a definite statement. Most of the statements by Ministers regarding this hold-up have been very lukewarm, in spite of the fact that the Government has a lot of support from industrial organizations, including the Sydney Trades and Labour Council and the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. Although the Government has said from time to time that it disapproves of the hold-up, it has not shown any signs of its disapproval by action. Of course, action might entail risks. Speaking on the motion of want of confidence, the Prime Minister said that he would not risk a general strike on the Australian waterfront merely to settle thi3 dispute. Of course there is a risk to be run ! There is a risk to be taken in almost everything we do in life, particularly in industrial matters; but surely the risks which the Government is running to-day by not taking action in the waterside, coalmining and electricity disputes, and a hundred other disputes, are less dangerous than this continual submission to industrial blackmail. If we are to govern this country, the Prime Minister##'## and his Ministers must show authority. In this particular instance the Government should assert its authority and say, ##"## We consider that these ships should be loaded, and they will be loaded##"##. I ask ##'## the Government to act  promply  to settle this dispute, which is a disgrace to the name of Australia. </para>

We shall have to do something about it soon, and I should like the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to make a dramatic announcement or order a swift inquiry relating ##'##to servicemen who, so long after the end of the war, are still confined a3 defaulters in various prisons throughout the country. No plan has been made for their future. In war-time the sentences of courts-martial were reasonably sound, but, in the light of peace-time conditions, what are we to do with these defaulters? If they defaulted in service alongside their comrades, perhaps they caused loss of blood and treasure. But if we keep them in prison so long after the end of the war they continue to cost us money for their own upkeep and that of their families. The treatment of these men must be drastically changed. Although they did not serve as they should have done, we should apply common sense to the problem when man-power is so scarce. I should  like to know how many thousands of these men are involved, and how much man-power and money is being run down the sink every week in maintaining them. Many servicemen returning from overseas may consider that these defaulters should serve sentences. Obviously we cannot present them with a reward for not having served; but we shall have to direct our minds to -solving the problem. There must surely be a quick and effective way of returning these men to the manpower stream. Every key industry in this country requires man-power, and many of the defaulters are skilled men who enlisted or were called up for military service. We are waiting for that collection of skilled men to start operations which will provide employment for unskilled men. So long as key men do not resume their occupations, . just so long will there be a fear of unemployment in the unskilled section. With our limited man-power in Australia in peace and war, we cannot afford to have idle units. Perhaps sentences for absence without leave or desertion could be revised dramatically in the light of present-day circumstances. We may be doing greater injury to these people and to ourselves by continuing their incarceration, which must result in a loss of morale. The early release, under proper conditions, of many of those now being held in prison camp* may be ##'##advisable. They could,  perhaps  be placed in useful jobs in industry. T know that I may be treading on someone##'##s corns in making these suggestions.. but we must remember that many soldiersare waiting for homes and it may be a good plan to allow persons who evaded their duty during the war to undertake now work of a kind which, to a degree, might repair the damage done by their earlier conduct. It certainly will be of no advantage to drive these people to the verge of lunacy. Much can be said for changing their conditions of living. The problem should be attacked  in three ways. First, we must take steps to put an end to the savage sentences that are still 1 being imposed by , courtsmaartial, which seem to consider that wartime conditions still obtain. Secondly, these prison camps must be examined to ascertain whether they contain any highly skilled people who could be released on parole to do useful and necessary work. I do not mean that anything in the nature of labour corps should be created, but we must do something to enable these people to rehabilitate themselves. They should not be left to languish. Thirdly, we must face the situation created by neurotics, who absented themselves without leave from Army life and who are doing considerable damage to their own morale while they are in their present position. Many of these individuals should be placed under treatment by first-class psychiatrists. The savagery of commandants and staffs of prisoner of war camps has been ex- / plained to us by the ex-prisoner of war members of this House. We have learned a good deal about the savagery of conditions in Malaya. It is a fact that many military men have shown genius and initiative in war operations, but sometimes these very qualities lead to abuses  in  other directions. We should do something to help the people still in these camps to reorientate themselves. They should not be allowed to become human driftwood; and they certainly should not be forgotten. </para>

                            <para>.- The poor calibre of this Government has been shockingly reflected in the offhand manner in which it regards the disastrous blow that Australian trade in the East lias suffered. I do not desire to traverse the ground that my colleagues have already covered concerning the merits of the dispute which is holding in Australian ports ships containing foodstuffs and materials that are urgently required by the Dutch Government for use ill the Netherlands East Indies. I shall confine my remarks to the trade aspect of the subject. It cannot be denied that honorable gentlemen opposite have been very slow in realizing the damage that is being done to Australian trade in the East by the dispute that is continuing on the Australian waterfront; but I am surprised that they have not realized the damage that this dispute is undoubted -. doing to industries in their own electorates. I can imagine the political storm that would have broken over the heads of honorable members on this side of the chamber had they been in office at##'## the time such a dispute occurred. We would have been told that industries were being destroyed, and homes blasted by the curtailment of employment which is inevitable in such circumstances. Not so long ago the people of the Netherlands East Indies were regarded as our greatest potential export customers apart from our leith and kin in Great Britain. We went to a good deal of trouble some years ago to open markets in the Netherlands East Indies. The first Australian overseas trade commissioner ever appointed was sent to that area. In the ##"## ##'##thirties ##"## Australian industrialists chartered a special boat to take Australian produce to the Dutch East Indies, and strong efforts were made to lay the foundations of a first-class export trade. We had realized prior to the outbreak of the war that a valuable market existed there, and that the productive capacity of the East Indies could supply useful goods. for Australia. Yet the Government has indicated that it regards this dispute as being outside of its jurisdiction. Ministers and also officers of the Australasian Council of  Trades  Unions have admitted that, more humbug and chicanery is observable##'## in this dispute than has been manifest in possibly any other that has occurred in Australia. It is admitted . also that the dispute has been fomented, and is being maintained, by the Communist elements in certain trade unions. Why then has the Government done nothing, in the last seven months, to force the issue? </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>To-day the Netherlands East Indies authorities have intimated that they have found it necessary to cancel certain orders that have been placed for Australian goods. That means, of course, that a nasty stain has been placed on Australia, because of its unsatisfactory dealings with an old and tried ally. The fact has been established that more than 250 Australian firms have been preparing orders for despatch to the Netherlands East Indies. Undoubtedly, those firms will incur heavy financial loss through the cancellation of orders, and this is specially serious at a time when they are endeavouring to convert their operations from a war basis to a peace basis. Any one who has had practical experience in business will know how adversely both small and large firms can be affected by the cancellation of orders in this way. A severe blow will also be inflicted upon the employees of those firms, for the workers will be deprived of prospects of continuous employment due to expanding industry. </para>
                        <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to-day made the utterly unwarranted and unworthy statement that one of the principal reasons why the Netherlands East Indies authorities had cancelled certain orders was lack of finance. I am astonished that such an argument should have been advanced. If that is the true state of affairs, Australia should have been prepared to grant liberal credit to the Netherlands East Indies as an acknowledgment of .services rendered during the war. It must be remembered,, too, that the vessels which are being held up in Australian ports have been described by the Prime Minister as ##"## mercy ships ##"##. It would be to the everlasting discredit##'## of Australia, therefore, if it allowed financial considerations to prevent the despatch of these ships. Questions of financial accommodation should not be allowed to hinder the development of this trade. As the honorable member for Flinders <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ryan)</inline> has said, the Australian people will not accept the policy of the Government in this connexion. This dispute could undoubtedly have been settled quickly in its. early stages had the Government taken a firm stand against {he waterside workers. This is said to be a trade union government, and Ministers certainly could have taken disciplinary action in the matter, but apparently they were not prepared to engage in a really first-class brawl with the waterside workers on the eve of a general election. However, if the dispute is allowed to continue, chaos must eventually occur on the  waterfront.  and the Government will, in consequence, be incontinently turned out of office. ##'##I hope, therefore, that Ministers will display a little more courage in this matter. </para>
                        <para>I wish now to refer to the decision of the Government to terminate the operation of National Security regulations on the 31st December. A bill designed to achieve that object was passed by the House earlier this afternoon. The Prime Minister, however, has indicated that certain controls will be continued after the act ceases to operate, and that legislation to this end will be introduced, though not at an early date. In fact, the right honorable gentleman has told me, and has stated publicly, that such legislation will not be introduced until after the elections. Australian trade and commerce, therefore, is to be left in a state of suspense as to the form that the legislation will take. ##"##We know that the Government intends to continue some control over prices, capital issues, rents, and real estate transactions. Thepeople are entitled to information about the nature of the controls that will operate. The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Manufactures have submitted to the Government certain views on this subject, and they have also indicated their dissatisfaction with existing controls. The need for some measure of prices control has been, admitted., but the manner and extent of it requires careful consideration. The war-time prices control regulations were designed to restrict competition and to divert the resources of the nation to war purposes. That policy is now in reverse, and certain inflationary tendencies are already observable in this country. The reason for this is that insufficient goods are being manufactured and marketed to meet the demands of people with money to spend. The answer to an inflationary situation of that kind is the production of the necessary goods ##'## in sufficient volume to meet the demand. Production in that volume cannot be achieved if the incentives which make it possible are stifled. Prices control is one of the impediments to reconstruction in Australia. It is not a popular subject to debate, because there is always the easy and cheap political argument about profiteering and so forth. Properly understood, profit, at a time when competition is in full force, merely represents the difference between efficiency and inefficiency in the conduct of a business. In Australia, ##'##businesses with a virtual monopoly of production so far as the local scene is concerned have had merely tariff protection against the production of other countries.  Consequently, such profits as they were able to make represented the efficiency of their businesses compared with the relative inefficiency of others. Therefore, rather than condemn them for making a profit, we should welcome it as a sign of efficiency in Australian industry. But so much of prices control in the hands of this Government has become profit control that we have the thoroughly anomalous situation of one class of goods, produced by one manufacturer, carrying a different price from that of the same goods produced by another manufacturer; because, by limiting the profit of the one you place a premium on the inefficiency of the other. That is not a way in which to encourage production. If profits are made, tax is paid on them. It has been estimated that SO per cent, of all the profits earned by companies goes back to the Treasury in the form of tax on the companies or on the incomes of the individuals when the dividends have been distributed. ##'## Five months ago, the Associated Chambers of ##'##Commerce of Australia placed their story before the </para>
                        <para class="block">Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline> who promised to supply an answer to the case they had made out. They have not yet had that answer. It would appear from the Government##'##s official announcement that we are not to learn what its policy on prices is until some time after the next general elections. Answering me at question time, the Prime Minister admitted that if goods were in adequate supply in a competitive field prices control would be unnecessary. Yet to-day those goods that are in the most highly competitive field are carrying the greatest burden in regard to prices control; because in the competitive field, normally, businesses producing a multiplicity of articles of many varieties, and having to contend with all the paraphernalia and rigmarole of the prices control machinery, are placed at a much greater disadvantage than a firm which manufactures one or two standard lines. I hope that the Government will not defer until after the elections the hopes that have been entertained in regard to the modification of prices control. I urge the Prime Minister to instruct the. officers of the prices administration to put into effect the policy that he enunciated when he said that if goods are in adequate supply in a competitive field, -prices control is no longer necessary. </para>
                        <para>I turn to another matter which I believe to be hindering the supply of housing for the people of the Commonwealth. The protracted continuance of a war-time control is having repercussions,  r  refer first to what is palpably an injustice against one section of the community, namely rent control. I realize that votes are not won by advocating increased rents for property-holders. But we should not be concerned merely with vote-catching; we should have some regard for fair play and equity in the application of Commonwealth regulations or legislation. The rents pegged at the 1940 level are still continuing. This is an utterly unwarranted discrimination against one class of holder, which is not shared by holders of many other kinds of assets. From time to time, adjustments have been made in respect of wages, with a view to counter-balancing increases of the cost of living.##'## But there has been no adjustment ill respect of the ##'##property-holder, who pays tax at property rates on the income that he derives in that way. The return from his property is based on the utterly false premise of the 1940 valuation. Tenants have had their wages secured by cost of living adjustments; therefore, these have not been pegged in the same manner. In order to reveal clearly the absurdity of the position, let us take a return of 8 per cent, in 1940 on a house valued at ##Â£##1,000, namely ##Â£##S0. To-day, the same house would certainly cost at least ##Â£##1,500 to construct. A return of S per cent, on that amount would be ##Â£##120. That is a gross return, from which rates, depreciation and other outgoings have to be met. Consider also the sale prices of properties to-day, which reveal an equally absurd anomaly. Prices of property are pegged at the 1942 level. A home that could be built for ##Â£##1,000 in 1.942 could not be built for less than ##Â£##1,500 to-day. Probably the 1942 construction would be the more valuable, because it would contain better materials. This would more than counterbalance the depreciation that would have taken place during the last four years. Yet, under the regulation -, the treasury must refuse consent to th. sale of the 1942 home at more than the then value of ##Â£##1,000, but must allow the 1946 house to be sold at ##Â£##1.500. The Government may not feel very greatly concerned at the effect on the property-holder. I suggest that it might feel concerned at the effect on those who desire to purchase homes, because undoubtedly a direct consequence of this policy is a freezing of the supply of homes throughout every State. Thousands of owners of properties to-day will not sell them, even though they could do so, because they know that the present cost of a new home, or one bought on the black market if they were obliged to purchase in that quarter would be very much higher. In existing circumstances, two black market transactions are involved. The owner of a house sells it at the black market price, and if he has to acquire another home he has to pay the black market price for it. Those who fall within this category must represent only <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> small fraction of those wishing to sell and purchase homes, because the majority of the people desire to abide by the law. Therefore, it is not sufficient for the Government to tell Australia that these controls are to be continued indefinitely, and that the future form of control will not be disclosed until after the general elections. I am certain that some of the controls that I have mentioned - prices, rents, land sales, capital issues - and others which to-day are having a restrictive effect on the Australian economy, could be modified with great advantage to the community as a whole. The essential principle could be maintained, and they could be applied where they could be -shown to be still essential. Every one engaged in industry to-day is convinced that they are being applied where they are not merely unessential, but are also having a harmful effect on the Australian economy. I hope that the Minister who represents in this House the department which administers so many of these controls, will , be able to reply satisfactorily to my comments. </para>

                        <para class="block">Recently, a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey</inline> made a statement in regard to the quality of Australian tobacco leaf, and the Minister, in -a half-hearted reply, attempted to defend  it. The Government lost a golden opportunity to establish the tobacco industry in Australia during the war. It had men appraising leaf who were associated with the British-American Tobacco Company Limited, one of the monopolies which it criticizes publicly but supports privately.  These persons set out deliberately to ensure that the Australian tobacco industry would  have been destroyed when the war was over. Their method was to appraise the poorer class mahogany leaf at almost the same price as the first class lemon coloured leaf which can be produced in Australia, particularly in the Gunbower district. I took a deputation to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully),</inline> to whom samples of leaf were shown and drew from him the admission that it was equal to any he had seen in Australia. Experts said that it was quite  suitable for the manufacture of cigarettes and even cigars. The growers were deliberately crushed out. It was impossible for them to survive when they received the same price as the man who produced mahogany leaf, because the better class leaf is a much lighter crop. The growth of mahogany leaf was encouraged because it was known that the demand was for lighter tobacco, which alone would be purchased when the wai##'## was over. I hope that the Government will get some men who understand the industry - not those who are associated with the British- American Tobacco Company Limited, but those who really belong to the industry and have its interests -at heart - to see whether something can be clone to place the industry on its feet before it is too late. </para>

                            <para>- There is a provision for discussing charges against members of this House, and there, are precedents in connexion with the matter; but I am afraid that the Standing Orders are a little weak on the point of discussing such matters in relation to a member of the Senate. However, I put it to. the honorable member for Bendigo, that although there does not appear to be any power to prevent him from making  the  statement he is making, lie ought to refrain from doing so. Whatever charge may have been proved against a man in the past, he has expiated the offence by virtue of the sentence passed upon him by the court. . It is bad taste for an honorable member from his place in this House to attack such a .man. If I had power to stop the honorable member for Bendigo, I would do so, and I say that, in the interests of the House, I think he ought himself to refrain from saying anything further on the subject. </para>

                            <para>.- We have just listened to an extraordinary statement by the honorable member##'## for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin).</inline> After all, whatever faults a man may have committed in the past, he has paid for them now as the result of a sentence of the court, or in some other way. We should not forget that Peter Lalor, who figured in the only armed revolt which ever occurred in Australia, was afterwards exonerated, and became one of the legislators of his State. No matter what the history of a man may be, once he is elected by the people as their representative, in this Parliament, it is improper for anyone, under parliamentary privilege, to attack him. It is a cowardly thing to do. </para>

As you pointed out, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> it came very near to being a breach of the Standing Orders, and whatever else it may be, it was certainly in very bad taste. Only a day or two ago, it was reported in the press that an Indian statesman was released from gaol to become a Minister of the Crown. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Donald</inline> Grant is the elected representative of the people, and has taken the oath of allegiance. What more could anyone ask of him in a democratic country? Apparently, the attack was pre-meditated, because the honorable member for Bendigo read from notes which had been carefully prepared for him. The attack was cowardly and uncalled for. </para>

                        <para>Earlier to-day, I asked a question about the running of the ship which now serves the northern part of Tasmania. Before the war there were two ships on the Tasmanian service, the <inline font-style="italic">Nairana</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona,</inline> which served the northern and western ports. When war broke out, the -people of Tasmania gladly agreed that the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona</inline> should be withdrawn for military service. Now the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona</inline> has returned, and after making a few trips, has gone into dock for overhaul. I urge that the schedule of the <inline font-style="italic">Nairana</inline> should be altered to provide for the making of three trips a week in order to meet the heavy traffic at this time of the year. In the past, it was customary for a ship to make two trips a week to the north-west coast, while another made three trips a week from Melbourne to Launceston, for several months during the summer. There is a good deal of resentment in Tasmania about the shipping service. I do not even suggest that all our shipping difficulties are over. They will not be over for a. long time, but, when the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona</inline> returns to the normal run, the position will be considerably improved, because there will be four crossings weekly instead of two. In view of the great loyalty shown by Tasmanians in willingly surrendering the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona</inline> during the war, I think that my request might easily be granted. It may be said that the air service between the mainland and Tasmania is more frequent now than it was when the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona</inline> was on the run, but an air service does not cater for heavy cargo or people unable to afford costly air travel.  ##"## - </para>
                        <para>The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> referred to the immobilized Dutch ships. I think it has been stated on numerous occasions that those ships were held up in the first place by Dutch nationals walking off them. That is the basis of the trouble. While the honorable gentleman was speaking it occurred to me that he was taking another opportunity to make a slap at the Government rather than to say something about a matter of which he had a reasonable knowledge. </para>

                        <para>In the last few. months trade with the East has been discussed on many occasions in this House and elsewhere. Yesterday, I read a. very interesting article in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sim</inline> on trade with China. It was sent from Singapore by a British press representative. Apparently, he wrote with a full knowledge of the subject, because he made some excellent suggestions that might well be acted upon by the Government. I do not mean to imply that the ##'##trade with the East is unknown to, or has been overlooked by the Government. Indeed, government publications have##'## been issued on the subject; but I do not think we have had an up-to-date statement of the Government##'##s policy. Earlier in this sessional period, I##'## suggested that the Government might be prepared to make a statement, to the House as to what was being done and proposed to develop this trade. It is quite apparent to honorable members that in eastern countries we have a potential market of millions of people in close proximity to us. Their standard of living is low. It is hardly a living standard at all. In fact, the Indian delegates to the International Labour Conference claimed that while other delegates were talking about raising living standards for mankind, India had no standard on which to build. Could we but raise the standards of the Indians and Chinese by as little as one or two per cent., our trade worries would be over. The article mentioned the commodities in short supply in China - refrigerators and tyres, for instance. We have not sufficient of those for ourselves at the moment, I concede, but the article suggested a token shipment in order that we might get our products on to the market and well advertised, so that we should have something on which to build. I do not know what has been done about the development ##"## of this trade, but I hope that in##'## the Department of .Commerce and Agriculture, which is concerned with our export trade, a capable officer is specializing on this matter, because it presents tremendous possibilities. I understand that a trade delegation is to go to India to study the Indian market. That is an excellent plan, because it will be a departure from purely governmental action. The captains of industry, who are used to dealing with commercial problems, ought to be able to assess the opportunities of this market. I am particularly interested in the development of trade with India, because people who have first-hand knowledge of the possibilities have discussed it with me, and, although I personally know very little about the potentialities of the Indian market, I accept what they have told me. One man, who was in India for thirty years, but is living in retirement in Australia, told me that India presented a vast market for our woollen goods. Many people, have the idea that India is eternally hot, but that is a mistake, and, there are parts of, the country where people need blankets at night and woollen textiles in the day. I do not claim that we ought to concentrate entirely on the development of markets in those countries, because we do owe something to the Mother Country, and it presents a market for many of our commodities. Nevertheless, it will not bc able to- take all our surplus production. Even if it were so, there are other Britishdominions with which trade with the United Kingdom has to be shared. Indeed, to-day because of the shortage of shipping we are not sending so much to Great Britain as we might in other times. Empire countries closer to the United Kingdom are supplying goods with which our goods might otherwise have competed, and we are supplying to markets closer to us. That arrangement is under the control of the British Minis- . try of Food. </para>
                        <para>Like the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> I am concerned about the detention of offenders against military law. For some time I have, been in communication with the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> on that subject. </para>
                        <para>Men who have served overseas and returned to Australia have found themselves in detention camps for military offences, and, although##'## some of them have been discharged, they have been compelled to serve their sentences. I believe that there is some justification for disciplinary penalties, but, because of some information that has reached me; I have come to the conclusion that some sentences imposed by courts martial are vicious and quite disproportionate to the offences committed. Consider the case of a man who, on returning from overseas service, is forced to cool his heels in camp. Bored, or perhaps because he has been refused leave to deal with some family matter, he might absent himself without leave. When he returns or is apprehended he is court-martialled. A monetary penalty might be imposed. He goes from bad to worse, and commits other offences, and, finally, he has a vicious penalty imposed on him, notwithstanding that in battle, when his services were needed outside this country, he was a gallant soldier. That is wrong. The suggestion made by the honorable member for Parkes is highly commendable. These sentences should be reviewed. One man, who is in a detention camp, has a. job in civil life to which he can return. </para>

That detention camp was top-heavy and wasteful. Between twenty and thirty men were guarding half a dozen prisoners. ##'## If the men in detention have not committed serious offences, their sentences should be reviewed, and the men should be allowed to return to civil life so that they may become economic and productive units in the community. If they are not good citizens, the civil law will deal with them in the civil courts. The honorable member for Parkes made practical suggestions, and I agree with them. I hope that the Minister will examine them,  and  review sympathetically the sentences which have been imposed upon the prisoners. </para>

                            <para>. - Regarding the forthcoming inquiry by the Full Arbi##'##tra-. tion Court into the working week, I assume from what has appeared in the press that the parties will be represented in the  usual  way, that is to say, there will be counsel for the employers or certain groups of employers, and counsel for the unions, either groups or individuals. I also gather that the Commonwealth Government itself is intervening, through counsel, in those proceedings with a view to supporting the claim for a shorter working week. Whilst I have no official information on the matter, I have seen ##'## references to it in the press. It has been put to me from various sources that consumers should be represented, through counsel, because of the very great importance of the issues which will be decided. When I say ##"## consumers ##"##, I mean organized bodies of consumers, such as##'## the Housewives Association. I know that in the ordinary course, one treats the court as representing the general public interest outside the interests of the disputants, and, as a general rule, I have no quarrel with that; but having regard to the fact that the Commonwealth itself is intervening, and, I presume, intervening on one side, I suggest, to the Minister- for Labour and National Service that the suggestion that counsel should be provided for a representative body of consumers is one which deserves consideration. I ask the Minister whether he will examine the matter, and arrive at a conclusion as soon as he reasonably can. </para>

Applications have been made, and claims  have been lodged. Both parties have been notified, and are now preparing their cases. The date of the hearing has not yet been fixed. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> stated, the Commonwealth has notified its intention to intervene, through counsel, to inform the mind of the court. The right honorable gentleman knows better than most in en the meaning of the words ##"## inform the mind of the court ##"##. I do not suggest that the Government is intervening on one side. What the Commonwealth will do will be to present figures dealing with productivity, past and present, and forecasts of the future, and inform the mind of the court as to what effect the introduction of a shorter working week may have on the national economy. </para>

Why they think that they can protect the interests of the consuming masses who are represented in the court I do not know, but they have a right to put their case. I shall ask my colleagues to examine the suggestion by the Leader of the Opposition, who has had a great deal of experience of these cases, with a view to seeing whether it is possible to put the view of some independent body representing consumers. </para>

                                <para>- Even the Prime Minister may not know what proposals have been formulated. This peace conference will not be conducted in a manner similar to the conference after the conclusion of the war of 1914-18. The proceedings at that conference evidently developed into a debate very similar to a stormy debate in the House of Representatives, but the conference finally arrived at determinations. On this occasion, it appears that the main decisions will be reached by three powers only, and it seems to me to be extremely doubtful whether the other powers will receive any consideration in the matter. Notwithstanding . that, the Commonwealth Government is under an obligation to inform the House regarding the attitude that the delegates will adopt towards the problems which will arise at the peace conference. No doubt we shall receive reports when the delegates return. Whether those reports will be debated before the election remains to be seen. </para>

                        <para class="block">From my knowledge of affairs in South Australia, the State Government purchased land for the settlement of ex-servicemen long before the Commonwealth introduced the Re-establishment and Employment Bill. The first purchase of land to my knowledge was made in the electorate Of Barker in January, 1945. I await with interest the reply of the. Government of South Australia to the Minister##'##s comments. The honorable gentleman will probably be involved in another wordy controversy similar to that in which he indulged over the Loxton irrigation scheme. Ultimately, . he hoisted a white flag, and agreed to the State##'##s proposals.  If  he is engaging in another controversy with the Premier of South Australia, I advise him to keep a few pieces of white calico handy. </para>
                        <para>I proposed to place upon the notice paper a question relating to the sale by the Commonwealth of certain naval vessels, but I have since heard that the Government, instead of making a direct sale to a certain power, is selling, donating or trading the ships to the British Admiralty. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am not able to distinguish any great difference between an outright sale and negotiations of that sort. If any deal of that kind is to take place, a direct sale rather than an indirect sale is advisable. Before the outbreak of war in 1939, I delivered a speech about the important part which is played in peacetime by the traffic in armaments, including warships, aircraft, artillery and munitions. On this matter; the Commonwealth electorate will desire a clear and unequivocal statement from the Government, regardless of its political beliefs. </para>
                        <para>The fate of some Australian garrisons in the Pacific has been the subject of correspondence between the Prime Minister and myself, hut since then, ex-servicemen##'##s associations, including the Sth Division Association and the 23rd Brigade Association in Victoria have taken a vigorous interest in the matter. They ask, quite rightly, for an inquiry by the Commonwealth into the fate of these garrisons shortly after Japan entered the war. No satisfactory statement, and certainly no authoritative statement, has been made by the Government. I put it to the Government, as some ex-servicemen##'##s associations have put it vigorously to members of this Parliament, that the Government had no hesitation in sending a special court of inquiry to discover whether there were too many Koreans on a Japanese destroyer when it left Sydney a few weeks ago. Surely then, in justice, we should pay the same attention to the feelings of the parents of our lost troops, and endeavour by inquiry to clear up once and for all what really happened to Australian garrisons posted in various parts of the Pacific and the East Indies shortly after Japan entered the war. </para>

                            <para>. - Recently I asked that copies of commentaries and news reviews broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission should be made available for inspection by honorable members. I suggested that perhaps one copy of each script could be laid on the table of the Library. I gave reasons why this should be done and referred to some rather strange conceptions of their functions which some commentators employed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission appear to possess. I  have since received  advice from the commission, through the Postmaster-General, that it does not see that any good purpose would be served by complying with my request. No reasons were stated to support that opinion; the mere assertion was made. I am satisfied however that from the point of view of the nation and of this Parliament a very good purpose would be served by making copies of the scripts available for examination of the allegation that some of the commentators give a decided slant to remarks which should be impartial. I hope that the Government will give further consideration to this subject. </para>

                        <para>The listening audience of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is also a matter of interest. I understand that the commission recently spent about ##Â£##1,500 in the purchase of .a survey to ascertain the proportion of Australian radio listeners who tuned in to commission programmes. The investigation revealed that less than 20 per cent, of licence-holders do so. About 1,500,000 people in Australia pay fees for listeners##'## licences, but apparently SO -per cent, of them do not consider it worthwhile to listen to what they pay for. In this country listeners may tune in to both national and commercial programmes, and it is desirable that both should be available, but I am anxious that the national programmes shall, by their appeal, command the attention of the majority of Australian listeners. To achieve this, ##'## however, considerable changes are necessary in the national programmes and in the administration of the commission. The national programmes must be .brought more into conformity with the desires of the general community. </para>
                        <para>Another matter to which I must refer relates to broadcast station 2WL ##"##Wollongong, which serves a considerable part of my electorate. The company operating that station has recently notified the Wollongong Trades and Labour Council that it will not permit any further political talks to be broadcast over its station. For several years the Wollongong Trades and Labour Council has broadcast a ten-minute talk over this station every Monday night. Speakers representing the miners##'## federation, the Federated Ironworkers Union, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Builders Labourers Industrial Union, and other trade union organizations have participated in these programmes. </para>

I now invite his attention to a matter about which I have questioned him. I refer to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alex</inline> Wilson as Administrator of Norfolk Island. There are many distinguished servicemen who served Australia well in Libya, Crete, Greece, Syria, Borneo, New Guinea, Papua, Bougainville, and scores of other places. Many of them have distinguished records, not only as soldiers, but also as administrators. They did a job for Australia in a first-class manner, and established such reputations that they ought to be qualified for appointments to posts such as  administrators of island territories. Yet when the Government first had an .opportunity to make a major appointment as an administrator, one of the best ##"## plum.3 ##"## that it could give was awarded to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alex</inline> Wilson, the ex-member for Wimmera, an ex-stooge of the Government. So it was a reward, not to a soldier, but to a politician who had rendered a political service to the Ministry. I have asked a number of questions in connexion with this appointment. One read: ##"##Was the position advertised?##"## to which the answer was ##"##No##"##. Of course, it was a perfectly confidential appointment. Nobody was to know. that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Rosenthal was to be shifted. It was done ##"## under the lap ##"##. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alex</inline> Wilson sneaked in the back door of the Minister for Transport and said ##"## Eddie,##'## what about that job on Norfolk Island ? ##"## </para>

He was not a member of the Government at the time, and did not hold any official appointment. He was in the same category as some of the other ##"## administrators ##"## assisting Ministers. I presume that almost every honorable member on the Government side can now qualify as an .administrator. I doubt very much whether any business firm which wanted a manager would accept such qualifications, or whether any member opposite who had some job to do and wanted a man with administrative experience and ability to do it would be satisfied with the qualifications put forward on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alex</inline> Wilson. This appointment was a scandal and a shame. It reeks of everything that is undesirable in such appointments. It was a shameless method of paying for political support. In no other way can it be described. It is a payoff, not so much at the expense of the Commonwealth as a whole - although that is a point, also - as at the expense of every decent ex-serviceman who might have a claim. Plenty of men who served through six years of war with great merit are now thrown on the scrap heap. The other day, the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> announced the retirement of certain high-ranking officers of the Air Force. Such men ##&gt;##as Bostock, Williams and Lucas have been given notice of their retirement. Any one of those men would be qualified to fill this job, but they were not given the opportunity to apply. If the returned soldiers expect preference in employment from this Government they have only to look at the appointment of Alex Wilson to know where they stand. </para>

The difference between these costs as determined by the Central Wool Committee and the price paid by the overseas buyers for the tops, noils, ##&amp;##c, was taken by the Central Wool Committee. Furthermore, in order to increase the production of wool tops, the Central Wool Committee arranged for tops to be combed on a commission basis. When the wool tops control commenced, the United Kingdom authorities agreed that all surplus from the operations referred to herein would be for the account of the Commonwealth Government. </para>
                        <para>Of the other items responsible for the credit balance of the accumulated funds, the most important is the interest earned on the moneys at credit from time to time. </para>
                        <para>The Government has carefully considered the disposal of these moneys, which have accrued outside the administration of the wool purchase arrange^ ment, and are the result of good and careful management by the Central Wool Committee. The moneys will not be taken by the Government into Consolidated Revenue, and will not be used for any individual distribution to wool-growers, nor to the fellmongers, topmakers, and manufacturers concerned The Government has decided, however, that these accumulated moneys, shall b##Â»## used for the benefit of the wool industry in connexion with research and promotion of the use of wool. The Government has drawn up proposals for the use of  the  fund in these directions, and will take an early opportunity to discuss them with representatives -of wool-growers. As J indicated above, the basis of our discussions will be that the money will not be paid into Consolidated Revenue, and will not be distributed to any section of the wool industry, but will be used in the interests of the wool industry, particularly for research and promotion of the use of wool. </para>
                        <para>This is the only Government statement that has been made in explanation of the sources of this particular fund and of the prospective use of it. The moneys involved have no relation to the possible profits arising out of the Wool Purchase Arrangement, which provided that the United Kingdom Government would pay to the Commonwealth Government 50 per cent, of profits made by the United Kingdom Government on Australian wool sold for use outside the United Kingdom. The late Prime Minister of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Curtin, pointed out on the 17th September, 1942, that it would not be possible to take an account of the profits until the purchase arrangement was wound up. On that occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> said, in reply to a question in this House, that the Australian share of profits would be distributed amongst the growers in proportion to their contributions of wool to the whole scheme during its operation. </para>
                        <para>Honorable members are aware that the war-time wool purchase agreement was not completely wound up, but was incorporated in the long-term plan which is  now in operation. As a part of the long term plan which was unanimously accepted hy the wool-growers organizations and by this Parliament, the accrued credits in the divisible profits account have been taken into account in the transfer of assets from the British Government to the joint ownership of the British and Australian Governments. As is now well known, the British and Australian Governments will, throughout the period required to dispose of the present large stocks of wool, fix annually appropriate reserve prices for wool, jointly provide any money required to buy in wool which does not realize the reserve price at auction, and share equally any profit or loss resulting from the undertaking. </para>
                        <para>I consider that it would be unwise at this stage to make any predictions as to what will happen to any profit or loss, realized as a result of the long-term plan, which goes much further than the wartime wool purchase agreement, and entails considerable financial outlay and liability to the Commonwealth. . </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by##'## leave -</inline> On the 26th March, the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> stated in Parliament that, in the period since July, 193S, Australia had accumulated gold holdings amounting to ##Â£##42,500,000. He suggested that, by not making these gold holdings available to the sterling area dollar pool, Australia was leading a non-co-operative movement within the British Empire. These statements are not only inaccurate, but are also seriously misleading, particularly in regard to Australia##'##s participation in the sterling area dollar pool arrangement. It will be recalled that, in the past, the policy has been followed of holding some quantity of gold in Australia. On the 30th June, 1929, for- example, gold to the .value of ##Â£##45,000,000 sterling was held by the banking system, a part of this gold, constituting the note issue reserve. During the period 1929-32, this gold was mobilized and exported to meet the deficiency in Australia##'##s balance of payments, thus avoiding default on the part of Australia in its international commitments. From 1933 until quite recently the amount of gold held in Australia was quite insignificant, since it was necessary to realize on all gold produced so as to enable Australia to meet its oversea obligations and to pay .for essential imports. However, during the last year or two, the Commonwealth Bank has been accumulating a small gold reserve by purchasing gold currently produced in Australia. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The estimate of ##Â£##42,500,000, quoted by the honorable member for New##"## England, represents the difference between the total value of Australia##'##s gold production and gold imports, and the total value of gold exported from Australia during the period from the 1st July, 1938, to the 31st January, 1946. An estimate of the Commonwealth Bank##'##s gold reserve cannot be derived in this way, since, at the end of this period, a considerable quantity of gold, which had been sold, had, for security reasons, not been exported from Australia, but was held temporarily in Australia on behalf of the Bank of England. This gold has since been exported.. The estimate made by the honorable member for New England is, therefore, inaccurate. Present holdings are approximately ##Â£##18,000,000 Australian. . </para>
                <para>I have no hesitation in refuting- the suggestion that Australia is adopting a non-co-operative attitude regarding the sterling area dollar pool. In this connexion, I remind the honorable member that the whole of the net United States of America dollar receipts, which accrued to Australia as a result of spendings by the United States forces in Australia, and from other sources in recent, years, has been made available to the sterling area dollar pool. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite true. In reviewing the field, we kept in mind the various members of the Opposition who might have considered themselves qualified, but I assure them that it did not take long to make a decision on their qualifications. It seems to me that some Opposition members are, as usual, trying to use the principle of preference to returned soldiers for their own political advantage. All who protested against the appointment suggested, as men who ought to have been chosen instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson,</inline> generals, major-generals, lieutenantgenerals and brigadiers, but no one holding lower rank. So all that honorable members opposite have tried to do is to obtain good jobs for ##"##brass hats ##"## who evidently find it difficult from their own efforts to re-establish themselves in civil life. The fact is that this Government has appointed many returned soldiers to posts that it thought the applicants were fitted to occupy. The Opposition##'##s protests against the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> will be laughed at by the people when they know the facts. When in power, they did not religiously adhere to the principle of preference to returned soldiers when making appointments to lucrative posts. For instance, the honorable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rankin),</inline> who attained the rank of major-general in the Commonwealth Military Forces and served overseas in World War I., was passed over in favour of thethen honorable member for Perth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nairn,</inline> a non-soldier, when the Speakership was being filled. Other returned soldier supporters of the then Government similarly passed over included <inline font-weight="bold">Major Marr,</inline> the then honorable member for Parkes, and  the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> a major in the Army. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham, Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, was appointed to a position in Japan. I understand that his service in the war of 1914-18 was on the legal side, and that, although he claimed some naval rank, the only vessel he ever boarded was probably a launch in Sydney Harbour. He got that diplomatic job when men who saw active service could have filled it. The honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Anthony),</inline> who led the attack on the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson,</inline> is a member of a party led by a man who is not a returned soldier. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> ##"##whom I should describe, I suppose, as the leader of the combined Opposition, because I understand that the Liberal party and the Australian Country party have an agreement for election purposes, is not a returned soldier. I recall that when he was attacked in this House by the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> for not having served in World War I. he said that he had had. very sound reasons for not having gone to that war, and a man##'##s decision whether to serve his country at home or overseas was his own concern. I agree with the right honorable gentleman that it is a matter for personal determination. But the honorable member for Richmond who protested vehemently against the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> on one occasion, during the course of World War II., bought a property on the north coast of New South Wales. While this country was in urgent need of butter, the honorable gentleman, who claims to have given great service to this country, sold the dairy herd on that property in order to convert it into a banana plantation, because of the greater profits in bananas than in dairying. In his constituency he is notorious as an##'## employer of cheap labour. I told once before in this House, and I repeat it now for the edification of those who did not hear me then, that once, as Christmas came near, he asked the wife of one of his workers where she intended to spend her Christmas holidays, which consisted of a fortnight off without pay! This is the gentleman who takes it upon himself to criticize the service given to this country by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson.</inline> On another occasion, he, with an air of ##"## patriotism ##"##, designed to fortify himself among his constituents, decided to give his parliamentary allowance to charity, but he misguidedly confided in someone that he was not making any real sacrifice because he was taxed at such a high rate that he preferred to give the money away for his own personal advantage rather than pay it back to the Treasury. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> tried to enlist but was rejected. He did not wear any badge to advertise to the world that he was a rejected volunteer. At the very time when his appointment was under the fire of criticism, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> had two sons serving in Borneo##"## and risking their lives in the defence of this country. They would not regard as a fitting reward for their services and their father##'##s service the vile attacks that have been made upon him. When matters like this are raised by honorable gentlemen, they should be honest enough to place all the facts before the House and the people. . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> rendered fine and honorable service to this country during the difficult days of the war. He did not wear a uniform as a liaison officer between Victoria Barracks and other equally safe places in Australia, but he did notable work. That is all I need to say. The Government has nothing to apologize for over the appointment. In the short space of time in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilson</inline> has been administrator of Norfolk Island, he has shown outstanding ability. As time goes on the excellent choice that was made when he was appointed to the position will become more evident to the Australian people. </para>

The advertisement specified ##"##the completion and operation of the plywood factory at Alexandria as a going concern ##"##. Some plant both of overseas and Australian manufacture although delivered had not been installed, the war need having passed.

                    <para>The broadcast referred to by the honorable member is evidently a radio story entitled ##"## When You Come Home ##"##. The script has been submitted to me and I can find nothing in it which could in the least be described as misleading. The broadcast seems .to have been well received in radio circles, if published comment can be taken as a guide. The <inline font-style="italic">Radio Times</inline> stated that the script was unquestionably the- finest, most polished, workmanlike, and effective piece of radio writing that has come out of this country. The show had its faults, but they were not of a nature serious enough to mar this fine contribution to both the loan and the library of Australian radio writing. The <inline font-style="italic">Listener In</inline> said that the play must rank as one of the best of its kind. The message of the play was a powerful appeal to give the men who have come back not sympathy but a man##'##s chance. </para>

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The matter has been investigated by the Minister for Works and Housing, who advises that a large number of bulldozers and other earth-moving plant has been made available to State Government departments and local government bodies in recent weeks. The service departments are- co-operating with the Department of Works and Housing and making earth-moving plant available to rehabilitate States and assist with national works. Committees of State Government representatives have been set up in most States to allocate all available plant to the various State authorities in accordance with the urgency of their demands. If, as represented by the honorable member for Richmond, plant made available recently is insufficient to meet demands of shires for flood relief immediate attention will be given by the Sydney or Brisbane officers of the Department of works and Housing to any requests received from Shire councils, provided such demands have the support of the State committee. </para>

                        <para>Oil or water-colour paintings imported by or presented to public art galleries or other public institutions, cathedrals or churches are admitted free of duty. In addition, the following are also admitted duty-free: - (o) Oil or water-colour paintings by Australian students or artists resident abroad for a period not exceeding seven years; (6) oil or water-colour paintings presented or bequeathed to the owner and not imported for sale; (c) paintings produced at least 100 years prior to the date of importation, classed as antiques and, as such, admitted duty-free. Oil or water-colour paintings other than those mentioned above are dutiable at the rates ##'##shown in the Tariff Schedule. These duties were originally imposed as a measure of protection for the work of local artists, and an inquiry conducted shortly before the outbreak of war indicated that the consensus of opinion among artists was that the duties should be retained, as it was feared that otherwise this country might be flooded with inferior productions, to the detriment of local talent. Whilst no objection was shown by artists to the admission duty-free of works of high artistic merit, there appeared to be no practicable method of assessing such merit. </para>

                        <para>There are 60,000 outstanding applications for telephone services in the Commonwealth and the difficulties experienced by the public in securing the facilities are fully appreciated by the Postal Department, which is taking all possible steps to meet the position. Due entirely to war conditions, it was necessary to impose restrictions on the provision of new services excepting those required for essential purposes. In consequence, it was inevitable that heavy arrears of applications should be accumulated. Since hostilities ceased approximately 32,000 new telephone services have been connected. Despite the fact that the number of new installations is now approximating the pre-war standard the continued demands for facilities and the difficulties with which the department is still confronted in regard to supplies of materials and building accommodation render it impossible to comply with all orders at present and some considerable time must necessarily elapse before the department can overtake the outstanding orders. Largo stocks of telephone equipment have been on order for a long period, and a considerable quantity has already been delivered, whilst further progressive supplies are expected. The main difficulty is to secure new buildings to accommodate the additional equipment whilst major cable projects and the shortage of skilled man-power are other factors which are contributing to the present acute position. The comprehensive programme of workswhich has been planned to overtake the arrears and cater for telephone development includes the provision of many new automatic exchanges in the metropolitan areas and country dis- t ricts and the matter is being proceeded with as expeditiously as practicable. </para>

                        <para>I ask the Minister for Air whether it is true, as reported in the press, that no member of the Royal Australian Air Force has been nominated to attend the radio training school at Debden, near Saffron Walden, in the United Kingdom? If that is so, and as we have no equivalent school here, I ask the Minister to rectify this omission, in view of the importance of ensuring that Air Force specialists should bo up to date in radar and radio work generally. </para>

                        <para>The proposal to establish an Empire radio school in England has been the subject of communications between the United Kingdom and the Australian Governments. Negotiations for Australian representation, both on the directing staff of the school and for attendance of trainees, have been in progress for some . time. When the commencing date of the first course is known, nominations of personnel to attend the course will be made, and it is hoped by that time that satisfactory arrangements for Australian representation on the staff will be completed. </para>

                            <para>Sixty Liberator aircraft are stored in the open at Amberley Field, the engines of those aircraft being protected by standard engine covers. It is impossible to provide the very extensive hangarage that would be required for those aircraft. All existing storage accommodation is fully occupied by technical equipment, stores, ##&amp;##c, which are subject to far greater deterioration through exposure to weather conditions. </para>

                            <para>Aircraft are not to be scrapped. They were obtained from the United States of America under lend-lease conditions and will be disposed of in accordance with arrangements as may be agreed between the Australian and the United States Governments regarding lend-lease equipment. None of these aircraft can be used to improve the service to Lae without involving a change in demobilization plans. It is considered that the present six aircraft services per week from the mainland to Lae and three services weekly from Lae to New Britain are adequate to meet present requirements. </para>
