The fact that a conservative newspaper like the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> which is a great supporter of the honorable member for Barker, said it regarded the quiz contest conducted by the Commonwealth loans organization as an excellent idea, is evidence that the competition was generally appreciated.

                            <para>- I have received complaints from those fortunate enough to obtain telephone connexions, some of them medical men, that their names  do  not appear in the telephone directory, the stated reason being  that the books  are issued only once a year.  They  have expressed the opinion that supplementary lists should be issued. I have taken the matter up with the Postmaster-General and he said, that, because  of  the shortage of paper, and because no one would look at the supplementary lists in any  case,  it was not proposed to issue them. I now ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to convey to his colleague that this refusal is unbusinesslike and that in the main cities, at least, supplementary lists should be issued. </para>

                                <para>- I thought that all the complaints were coming from people who could not get telephones, but if some who have been fortunate enough to obtain them still have good cause for complaint in that their names are not included in the published directories, I shall ask the Postmaster-General to see what can be done to remove the cause. I understand that telephone directories are published half-yearly, not annually, as mentioned by the honorable member. Should the reason for the non-publication of supplementary lists be a shortage of newsprint, I know of ways and means by which quantities of paper could be obtained and  put  to better  use  than at present. </para>

                        <para>- It is reliably estimated that the 1947 apple and pear crop in Tasmania will be light, and will be followed by a heavy crop in 1948. In view of the present shipping shortage, and the probable shortage of shipping space in 1948, it will he difficult for all growers to market their fruit in that year. The previous Minister for Commerce and Agriculture stated that the apple and pear acquisition scheme would probably be retained to cover the 1947 fruit crop. Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say whether this decision has, in fact, been made? Does the Government intend to extend the duration of the acquisition scheme to cover the 1948 apple and pear crop? </para>

They have been disposed of by the Mines Disposal Squadron. At the present time three vessels are operating in the waters between Cairns and. Townsville, and up to date about 200 mines have been destroyed by them. As the mines are fitted with a device which renders them harmless when they break adrift, there is no danger to shipping. Information relative to the number of mines sown in and around the Barrier Reef during the war period will be obtained and furnished to the honorable member. </para>

Australia. I have done so and find that the facts are not as he stated. The Loxton proposal was originally examined by the Commonwealth on the 6th September, 1945, </para>

                    <para>Hnd  discussions were held in Adelaide with the State authorities at. that time. The proposal was formally submitted by the State to the Commonwealth for approval on the 23rd November, 1945, and further discussions were held in Adelaide on the 16th January,  1946.  The Commonwealth formally approved of the project as suitable for war service land settlement on the 14th February, 1946, subject to an adequate acreage of plantings for the Loxton proposal being allocated to South Australia at a forthcoming conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. On the 16th April, 1946, the Australian Agricultural Council agreed to total plantings of 9,000 acres for South Australia, and on the 31st April, 1946, the Director of War Service Land Settlement advised the South Australian Director of Lands that the condition in .regard to allocation of plantings had now been- met. It is quite clear that the Commonwealth is not holding up the development of the Loxton area. </para>

These men are waiting for employment, and their services are required for the erection of lines in order that certain districts may be supplied with electricity. Can the Minister indicate whether his department has yet reached a decision on this matter? Will he endeavour to announce that decision before honorable members  consider this year's estimates of expenditure for the Department of Post-war Reconstruction?

                                <para>- The honorable member for Moreton has endeavoured to make it appear that the vocational training of those ex-servicemen is being held up by the Department of Post-war Reconstruction. The fact is that the law of Queensland provides that no individual shall be eligible to be employed in electrical undertakings unless he has had at least two years' training. That hurdle had to be crossed before any plans could be made for the training of ex-servicemen in this trade. The problem has now been settled between the Department of Post-war Reconstruction and the Government of Queensland, and, very shortly, the men will commence their training. No avoidable delay has occurred. </para>

Representations have been made tome that young men who have had some building experience in the Army and the Air force are told, upon being discharged from the services, that they have no chance of commencing a training course in less than six months, or even longer in some instances. Is the Prime Minister able to reconcile this apparently inexplicable delay on the part of the Government in arranging the commencement of those training courses with its separate decision to hasten the immigration of skilled building operatives from overseas? </para>

                                <para>- The rate at which ex-servicemen are taken into the training scheme depends upon a number of factors. The position is very thoroughly investigated before decisions are made, and these decisions are based upon recommendations made by an industrial committee upon which ex-servicemen's organizations, employers and employees are represented. Among the factors taken into consideration are the availability of accommodation for trainees and the availability of staff to train them. A great deal of the training - in fact, nearly all of it - is undertaken in technical colleges. Honorable members will readily understand that it is impossible for technical colleges to take in extremely large numbers of ex-servicemen at the one time. Moreover, even if it were possible to take in immediately all of the men who are offering, the result would be that a very large number of men would be dumped on the building trades employment market all at once. The industry could not absorb such a large number. There must be an even flow of trainees through the technical colleges, because accommodation is not available for all applicants in the technical colleges or in the extensions to them which the Government has provided. The Commonwealth Government has allotted £1,000,000 for extensions to technical colleges in order that this sort of training may be stepped up. I assure the honorable member that everything possible is being done to create an even flow of trainees, not only into the building industry but also into other industries. The total number of ex-servicemen receiving reconstruction training benefits is over 90,000. That is a far, far bettor figure, in relation to the numbers that we had in our armed services, than has been achieved in any other country. </para>

                        <para>- The site selected for the establishment of the aerodrome at Mentone includes very valuable agricultural land. Has 'the Minister for Civil Aviation taken into consideration the effect which the resumption of such land will have on Melbourne's present vegetable supplies? It is estimated that the loss of this source will reduce present supplies by at least 160 tons a week. Is the Minister aware that some of this land was recently acquired at a cost of £400 an acre? Will he give an assurance that land-holders whose areas are resumed will be fully compensated? Was the local council consulted before this site was selected? Has the Minister fully explored the possibility of obtaining an alternative site? If not, is he prepared to do so. </para>

                            <para>- All possible sites at Mentone were investigated before a final decision was reached. It is true that a portion of the land which will be resumed is highly productive, but I do not think that the proportion of such land is as great as the honorable member implies. I assure him that the officers of my department thoroughly examined the matter before reaching a decision. A. thorough examination was made of all possible sites, and full consideration was given to the effect of the proposed resumption upon present land-owners. One reason why the site in question was selected was that its resumption would cause the least disturbance to homes in the neighbourhood. The officers sought to avoid dislodging people from their homes unnecessarily. It will take some time to develop this aerodrome, and in the early stages no persons living in the neighbourhood will be disturbed. As to the compensation which will be paid to persons who will be dislodged when the programme is under way, their rights are fully protected by the Lands Acquisition Act, under which valuers are appointed to determine the real v.ailue of land to be acquired, and any land-holder who disagrees with their valuation may submit the matter to arbitration. I assure the honorable member that thorough investigations were made, but I am quite prepared, as Minister, to see that any matters which are causing dissatisfaction shall receive consideration or be explained by those who have recommended the adoption of this site. </para>

I then asked the Prime Minister whether Mr. Beasley was expressing the views of the Commonwealth Government, and, if so, what action did the Government propose to take against the sinister forces. The Prime Minister, on that occasion, promised to examine the statement and advise me whether Mr. Beasley's remarks coincided with the Commonwealth Government's policy. I now ask the right honorable gentleman whether he has examined the remarks attributed to Mr. Beasley, and, if so, will he furnish an answer to my question? </para>

                            <para>- Many difficulties face Australian importers who desire to buy goods from Great Britain, because of the system of licensing which is controlled, by the Division- of Import Procurement. Can the Minister representing the Minister for. Trade and Customs inform me when the licensing of imports from Great Britain or other countries in the sterling area will be abolished? When will he review the operations of the Division, of Import Procurement, whose activities should have substantially declined since the termination of the war? </para>

I shall peruse a copy' of the issue in which it appeared. I. read the publication regularly and with very great interest. It is published, 1 understand, by a member of the Liberal party in New South Wales. It contains very candid criticisms of quite a number of things other than the matter mentioned by the honorable member. If the article has been accurately quoted, all I can say is that the gentleman concerned has mixed a little fad with a lot of fiction. The story is, like most stories, based upon hearsay evidence that does not always accord with the facts. </para>

                    <para>When the Ministers of State Act was amended in June, 1941, it provided for an increase of the number of Ministers of State from eleven to nineteen and of the annual remuneration from £18,600 to £21,250, but limited the operation of the increases to the period during the continuance in operation of the National Security Act. As honorable members arc aware, the National Security Act will expire on the 31st December next. The purpose of the bill, therefore, is to continue the present ministerial numerical strength beyond that date. The principal reason, given by the Prime Minister of the day in 1941, necessitating the increase of the number of Ministers, was the desirability of eliminating the post of Assistant Minister - there were five Assistant Ministers in 1939, prior to the war - and to impose on every Minister the duties of a Minister of State, with responsibilities for a Department of State. Such a reason applies in peacetime as well as in war. Reviewing the position in the light of the present postwar period, it is considered that the continuous growth of Commonwealth activities, with their administrative responsibilities, and the many additional calls, compared with pre-war years, upon the time of Ministers, provide full justification for a continuance of the present number of Ministers. </para>
                    <para>Our association with international problems will need from time to time the presence of Commonwealth Ministers at international conferences. Experience since the cessation of hostilities lias stressed the desirability of representation at ministerial level at the more important conferences, if the Australian point of view is to be adequately expressed. </para>

                <para class="block">The purpose of the bill is to authorize the payment, during the current financial year, of special grants aggregating £3,670,000 to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The payment of these grants was recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its thirteenth report which was tabled recently. Further copies of the reporthave not yet been received from the Government Printer, but they will be made available to honorable members before the debate on the bill is resumed. </para>
                <para>The principle adopted by the commission over the years is that special grants should be designed to meet the financial needs of the States to the extent required to enable them to carry on with reasonable efficiency. In interpreting this principle of financial needs, the commission has taken into account each year the financial position of the claimant States relative to that of the non-claimant States. In the last five years reviewed by the commission, the non-claimant States have enjoyed budget surpluses. After taking account of the fact that these surpluses were primarily due to Commonwealth war finance, the commission in each of its last five reports decided that the financial needs of the claimant States would be adequately met by the adoption of a balanced budget standard as the measuring rod for the first approximation to the grants. After calculating the amount required to give to the claimant States a balanced budget, the commission makes adustments to the amount so calculated in order to take into account such factors as the relative severity of taxation in the claimant States, and the relative liberality of their services compared with those of the non-claimant States. In this way, some relativity is preserved between the standards of revenue and expenditure in the claimant States and the standards in the non-claimant States. </para>
                <para>Because the results of the States' budgets on which the commission bases its calculations are not available for some time after the close of the financial year, the grants calculated by the commission for 1946-47 have been based in the first instance on the budget results of the States in 1944-45. Where necessary, the commission has then recommended additions to the grants so assessed, in order to bring the grants into linewith the prospective financial needs of the States in 1946-47. Full details of the commission's methods and calculations are given in the thirteenth report. </para>
                <para>The special grants recommended for payment this year are in each instance higher than those paid last year. The details are - </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">For the information of honorable members, I shall now refer briefly to the present position of the finances of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The finances of those States deteriorated in 1945-46, but substantial deficits were avoided by the Commonwealth making additional financial assistance amounting to £2,133,000 available under section 6 of the States Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942. The principal factor responsible for the decline in the finances of South Australia and Western Australia in 1945-46 was the decline in the net revenues of the business undertakings, particularly the railways, whilst in Tasmania expenditure on social services substantially exceeded the previous year's provision. </para>
                <para>In 1946-47, under the revised basis of taxation reimbursements, South Australia will receive an additional £1,000,000, Western Australia an additional £740,000, and Tasmania a further £296,000, a total increase of £2,036,000 in respect of those three States. On the other hand, under the revised legislation, which became effective this year, the States will no longer be able to seek additional financial assistance under uniform tax legislation, an avenue through which South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania received in 1945-46 additional financial assistance amounting to £2,133,000. The total amount which will be received by those States in 1946-47 under the uniform tax legislation will therefore be £97,000 less than in 1945-46. </para>
                <para>After considering this and other items in the States' preliminary budget forecasts for 1946-47, as well as seasonal prospects and other economic factors affecting the finances of the States, the Commonwealth Grants Commission is satisfied that special grants aggregating £3,670,000 are required to meet the budget needs of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania in 1946-47. In each year, since the establishment of the commission in 1933, its recommendations have been implemented by this Parliament. After careful examination, the Government proposes that the commission's present recommendations should be adopted. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The purpose of this measure is to ask Parliament to authorize a gradual and orderly transition of our national life from what may broadly be termed war-time conditions to those appropriate to peace. It seeks to do this by giving effect for twelve months to certain regulations and orders made under the National Security Act 1939-1943, which would otherwise be terminated with the parent act on the 31st December, 1946. That such far-reaching legislation as the National Security Act should have been introduced by the parties now in opposition and strengthened subsequently by the Labour Government, was essential and, indeed, inevitable. It was essential as the framework within which, and the instrument by which, Australia organized itself for survival and victory in conditions of total war. During the war years, few of our day-to-day activities were unaffected by national security legislation. In the greatest of all our national emergencies, the act served its purpose. Now it has run its full time and is to disappear. </para>
                    <para>But many of the emergency conditions which the temporary legislation was created to control have not terminated. The difficulty and duration of a national post-war transition are affected by the length of the war, and the degree of human and economic mobilization at home, arid of economic dislocation abroad. This time we have undergone a six-year war. Our position- as the bastion, base, and supply and food source for so much of the Pacific war, and our role as an objective for actual invasion by the enemy, have involved Australia in a degree of human and economic mobilization quite unparalleled in World War I. Moreover, world dislocation and devastation were on a scale and over an area  beyond all comparison with the catastrophe of 1914-18. In these circumstances, a simple, or short transition from war to peace conditions in Australia was not to be expected. </para>
                    <para>With the cessation of hostilities, it has been possible to remove, and the Government has lost no time in removing, or, where it could not remove, at least in relaxing, a very considerable number of war-time controls. Even prior to the cessation of hostilities, a committee under the leadership of the honorable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Eraser)</inline> had assisted me in. cutting down and simplifying numerous controls and. .regulations. Every Minister and department has for eighteen months been under an obligation to report regularly to Cabinet, through ,my colleague the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman),</inline> on progress made in eliminating controls, and on. reasons for retaining the remainder? Honorable members will recall that the call-up, man- power direction, control of new manufactures and many other major war-time restrictions were dropped promptly after the cessation of hostilities. </para>
                    <para>Tn that way the Government kept faith with Parliament and with the people of Australia, who entrusted national security powers to it, and in so acting the Government was confident that it served the national interest. The Government also judged it necessary early this year to fix the termination of the operation of the National Security Act at the 31st December, 1946, in order to give to the general public an- assurance in that regard, and to ensure that any powers which might still be required would be brought under the review of Parliament itself. That is now being done. But with an equal sense of responsibility, and after careful weighing of all the trends and circumstances, the Government announced that termination of all controls under the National Security Act on that dato could not be effected without the gravest, danger to the nation al welfare. </para>
                    <para>If there be any who have doubts, I suggest that a short study of economic developments in the United States of America between the 30th June last, when the original Office of Price Administration Act lapsed, and the recent lifting of practically all remaining controls, will induce very sobering reflections. After the final abandonment of price control in the United States of America, except in relation to rents, sugar and rice, wholesale prices for many articles jumped between 10 per cent, and 70 per cent, in a single day. Prices of rayon goods, for instance, rose from 20 per cent, to 25 per cent, overnight, with prospects of another increase within a fortnight. General Motors announced a $100 rise in the prices of all cars immediately. In the United States of America, between 1914 and 1920, the food prices index rose from $102 to $235; but" between 1939 and last week it was reported to have risen from $89 to- $273, most of the rise occurring since the 30th June, 1946, without any suggestion that the limit has yet been reached. </para>
                    <para>The bill before the House, with the details set, out in its schedules, extends for twelve months from December, 1946, provisions which, in the considered opinion of the Government, are necessary to ensure a continued smooth -transition from war to peace. At the same time, some regulations and orders are listed for operation in 1947 which are included under this bill foi- reasons other than economic. In some cases these will later be incorporated in whole or in part in normal legislation. I refer to such regulations as those on disposal of Commonwealth property and on patriotic funds. In those cases, it is proposed to allow time until Parliament can deal with necessary legislation next year. In other cases, regulations are retained for the time being because the matters with which they deal are certainly disappearing, at least in their present form, but will not be out of the way by the end of December. I refer to such regulations as those dealing with treatment of prisoners-of-war, the women's services, and discipline of the war-time forces. A third group involves the preservation of rights to certain pensions, including compensation and allowances for which other legislative provision has not yet been made. </para>
                    <para>One more general point should be mentioned at this stage. Certain acts specified in the third and fourth schedules, and dealt with in the body of the bill, require amendment because of the termination of the National Security Act insofar as they make reference to, or are in some way dependent for their proper or continued operation on, the currency of the National Security Act. In some instances these are matters of major import. In one case, at least, namely, the Ministers of State Act, it is proposed in the present session to introduce a new bill to eliminate dependence in existing legislation on the duration of the National Security Act. In other cases, the opportunity has been taken to amend legislation where this is necessary. For example, sections 78 and 79 of the Crimes Act forbid the making of sketches and plans of any prohibited place. It is proposed to amend these sections by prohibiting the photographing of these places. I might mention in passing that the Government intends to present to Parliament amending legislation to remove certain obnoxious provisions of the Crimes Act. </para>
                    <para>The constitutional foundation for legislation giving force for a further twelve months to the provisions of certain of the .regulations originally made under the National Security Act is, of course, the same as that which was invoked to support the National Security Act, namely, the power in paragraph (vi.) of section 51 of the Constitution, which is usually referred to as the "defence power ". The scope of this power of the Commonwealth is very wide in time of war and, as has been pointed out by several judges of the High Court, does not shrink to its normal peace-time dimensions immediately on the cessation of hostilities. The high-water mark of the extent of this power was pointed out in clear terms by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs in <inline font-style="italic">Farey</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Burnett,</inline> 21 C.L.R. 433. </para>
                    <para>The defence power may be exerted in times of  [icii.cn;  but so far only by way of preparation. Actual defence, and all that it connotes, comes only when we are at war. War creates its own necessities, proportioned to the circumstances, and not mensurable in advance of the occasion; and defence is only complete when it meets .those necessities, whatever they may prove to be. </para>
                    <para>A war imperilling our very existence, involving not the internal development of progress, but the array of the whole community in mortal combat with the common enemy, is a fact of such transcendent and dominating character as .to take precedence of every other fact of life, lt is the ultima ratio of the nation. The defence power then has gone beyond the stage of preparation; and passing into action becomes the pivot of the Constitution, because it is the bulwark of the State. Its limits then are bounded only by the requirements of  self-preservation.  It is complete in itself, and there can be no implied reservation of any State power to abridge the express grant of a power to the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The doctrine there enunciated has been referred to by other J  Justices  from time to time and, although some qualifications may, perhaps, be said to have been engrafted on to it, it remains substantially true to say that the extent of Commonwealth power is almost limitless in time of war. The " defence power " does not, as Latham <inline font-style="italic">C.J.</inline> points out in <inline font-style="italic">Dawson</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the Commonwealth</inline> (1946 A.L.R. 461, at page 464) cease instantaneously to bc available as a source of legislative authority with the termination of actual hostilities. He states - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The power is not cut off as with a guillotine. '.I he defence power includes not only a power to prepare for war and to prosecute war, but also a power to wind up after a war to restore conditions of peace - gradually if that is thought wise, and not necessarily immediately by the crude process of immediate abandonment of all Federal control. The fact that certain conditions have been created by the exercise of the defence power is itself a fact which is relevant to the validity of a continued or further exercise of that power. </para>

                        <para>To place a country on a footing to take an adequate part in such a war as that through which we have passed requires a co-ordinated and systematic series of measures which must re-shape the economy of the country. It is impossible to suppose that the defence power will suffice to authorize the retention of such a legislative fabric so constructed throughout a long and indefinite period of peace. But it is apparent that the change back from a war economy to an economy appropriate to peace is a task calling for further measures of a legislative nature, and the defence power, in my opinion, is not insufficient to authorize laws for that purpose. The power must in consequence also extend to sustaining for some reasonable interval of time the laws and regulations in force at the end of hostilities so as to enable the Legislature to proceed with the task. The whole edifice does not collapse at once simply because the necessities which call it into being have passed. Further, among the things that are incidental to the power must he the fixing by the Legislature itself of some reasonable time during which the Regulations adopted for war are to continue in force, while the steps are taken that are considered necessary for the remission of the community to an order proper to peace. </para>

                    <para>I should point out that in three cases recently the High Court upheld the National Security Regulations then in question on the ground that their continued operation was necessary for assisting in the " winding up " of the war effort, or in re-establishing ex-servicemen in civil life. They were <inline font-style="italic">Dawson</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Commonwealth</inline> (1946 A.L.R. 461), in which the validity of the land sales control provisions of the National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations was upheld ; <inline font-style="italic">Miller</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Commonwealth</inline> (1946 A.L.R. 469), in which the share control provisions of those regulations were held to be valid; and <inline font-style="italic">Blair</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Commonwealth,</inline> not yet reported, in which regulation 30a of the National Security (War Service Moratorium) Regulations was upheld. This regulation relates to the issue of warrants to grant possession of unoccupied premises to returned servicemen. </para>
                    <para>Accordingly, the regulations, which are by this bill declared to be in force, include those which are necessary to enable the winding-up of current war-time activities to be effected. Power is taken to repeal those regulations during the period of their operation. It is considered that these provisions are within the defence power as expounded by the majority of the justices of the High Court. A document has been prepared setting out all the regulations and orders concerned, and this will be placed before the House. The power to revoke, repeal or amend regulations will still reside in the Governor-General, but it will not be the same power as was exercised under the National Security Act itself. Although the power under that Act relates to a number of specific matters, it also covered any power which, in the opinion of the Governor-General, was necessary or expedient for the better prosecution of the war. It was indeed a very wide power; it could not have been wider. Although under this bill, if passed in its present form, the Governor-General will have the power to amend regulations, the statute will embody a provision that the power in respect of regulations shall be limited to the subject matter of the regulations which the Parliament will approve. </para>

                            <para>- I do not doubt that there will be ample opportunity to review the whole position. If the legislation is passed, Parliament will give its imprimatur to the legislative provisions contained in these regulations. It is improbable that every regulation will cease to have effect at the end of 1947. Some of the economic regulations, as, for instance, those dealing with prices control, will probably have to be continued beyond that time. At the Premiers Conference held last August, it was agreed that control of some matters should continue for three years. </para>

It is based on the defence power, but the arrangement at the Premiers Conference was that there would be such a reference or, alternatively, that the bill to be passed by each State Parliament should be in a form agreed to by the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. It will operate  throughout  all Australia, whereas a reference upon which there was legislation. by the Commonwealth Parliament, would operate only within the borders of the State concerned. If we limit it to four States we shall have chaos. For instance, if control over prices were confined to four States, an impossible situation would arise. The powers sought in this bill will be exercised throughout Australia. </para>

The principal sets of regulations in this group are those covering price control, wage control, rent control, and the control of land values, capital issues and interest rates. At the Premiers Conference in August last this group of key controls was discussed with the State Premiers, who were in agreement that they should be continued for some time. Next year, the Government will introduce bills to continue anti-inflationary controls - prices, rent, land values, and capital issues - beyond the 31st December, 1947. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- Those bills will be in accordance with the decisions of the August Premiers Conference that, the anti-inflationary controls should continue to be exercised on the basis of Commonwealth legislation and appropriate complementary State legislation. First amongst these controls is price control proper. All parties, I believe, are agreed as to the necessity for continuing this control until such time as the supply of goods has caught up with the demand. Without it, there would almost certainly be a rise of prices, probably a considerable rise, in most fields, and this would gather <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> cumulative effect. Since the war began we <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> been successful in holding prices down, and also in maintaining a fair relationship between costs and prices in different fields, but .while the present wide gap between supply and demand remains there can be no general relaxation of the measures by which this success has been achieved. Rent control is a special aspect of price control and is made necessary by the great shortage of housing. Progress is being made in the housing field, but a long period must elapse before the supply of housing becomes adequate to the community's need. This is a world-wide difficulty caused find aggravated by war, and it is significant that rent control almost alone of American controls lias been retained to the present. I am sure that very few who know the housing situation would wish rents to be left free to unfettered competition here in Australia. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue><para>But prices and rents cannot be held in check unless costs too are controlled. Hence a measure of wage control, regarded as a corollary of a price control scheme, is contained in the present Economic Organization Regulations. The object is to ensure a fair distribution of returns and to keep real wages in line with the nation's productivity. These regulations are retained, but they will not remain unamended. Already the Government has relaxed the wage-pegging regulations in force at the end of the war, in order to permit the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to make variations in the standard hours and the basic wage. Indeed matters dealing with these subjects ii re already pending in the court. Although the measure before the House continues the selected regulations in their present form, it will permit of their amendment from time to time, subject to the Parliament's power of disallowing any amendment. In this connexion I remind the House of the Prime Minister's intention to make further relaxations of the wage-pegging provisions as and when circumstances permit that to be done. These particular provisions are at present under review. </para><para>Control of land values also clearly belongs to the group dealing with orderly economic transition. In the economic history of Australia the tendency for land values to boom in times of prosperity has been all too familiar. A period of favorable returns for producers leads to excessive bidding up of property values. Speculation develops, indebtedness grows, and costs impose a burden that cannot be supported if and when post-war prices and incomes decline. The result is often a desperate situation, necessitating long and painful readjustments. There can be little doubt that conditions are now present under which, in the absence of controls, past experiences of this kind could easily be repeated. The measure also contains provisions for the continuance of the pegging of values of land for taxation purposes at the 1939 level. </para><para>Strong competition for limited resources is a feature of the post-war situation, and it is this which necessitates the continuance for the time being of the capital issues control. Obviously, it is in the interests of the community that resources should be concentrated upon essential production and not be diverted to speculative and unnecessary enterprises. Capital issues control operates in the field of new investment and regulates the registration of companies, the  issue of. share capital and the making of calls upon shares and the making of loans upon mortgages other than by way of normal bank overdrafts. In other words, it regulates the main channels through which the savings of the public are actively sought by investors, and endeavours to ensure that those enterprises will be fostered which would contribute most to the output of essential services and commodities. During the war, particularly in the later stages, the control was made very strict. Since the end of the war it has been relaxed considerably, though capital transactions which are clearly unsound or speculative, or which threaten to create excessive capacity in particular fields of production, are still prohibited. But under present conditions when there is great competition to start ventures of all kinds this selective function is essential and should be continued for the time being. There was general agreement at the Premiers Conference in August that the control of capital issues should continue for at least three years and that it must be applicable to all States if it is to be made effective. It was agreed, further, that the control should apply not only to issues of capital but also to mortgages and interest rates generally. Extended power to control interest rates is regarded as vital. During the war period a notable reduction has been accomplished over practically the whole range of interest rates, and it is our purpose now to consolidate that important gain so that the economy can derive the full benefit of it through the transition period. In the period which followed the 1914-18 war high interest rates imposed a heavy burden upon industry as well as upon public finance. We do not want that experience repeated. Power to regulate bank interest is contained in Commonwealth banking legislation. To complement this, power is required to cover transactions outside the banking field. </para><para>The second group of regulations, under which war-time marketing schemes were organized, includes the apple and pear acquisition, Barley Board, tobacco leaf, dairy produce acquisition, egg industry, food control, potatoes, wheat acquisition and wheat industry stabilization regulations. There are several reasons for extending the currency of these regulations until the 3] st December, 1947: First, the Commonwealth must keep faith with primary producers. The apple and pear growers of Tasmania and Western Australia would be in a hopeless state if control were not continued until refrigerated shipping space lost during the war is made good and once more makes possible disposal of surplus production. Second, contracts have to be honoured : thus, the forthcoming barley crop in Victoria and South Australia is very largely under contract to the Commonwealth, which must have power to control its marketing. Third, the price stabilization and control  schemes  are dependent on continuance of some controls in this group; hides and leather, rabbit skins and tobacco are examples. Fourth, the Commonwealth has to honour certain contracts made in war-time with Great Britain. Thus we are under the necessity of implementing our contracts for the sale of dairy produce to Britain. Fifth, in some cases negotiations are under way but not completed with the States for agreed schemes of organized marketing. Thus, in the case of the egg industry, the Australian Agricultural Council is evolving, but has not completed, a particular scheme. Sixth, the Commonwealth has continuing obligations on the supply side, particularly in the case of food, towards the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan. For this reason, we believe it to be necessary to continue a limited section of the Food Control Regulations. Seventh, the Commonwealth has in one important instance at any rate - the wheat industry - itself passed wheat marketing legislation and is now awaiting passage of complementary legislation by the States. Until that State legislation has been completed emergency powers require extension. </para><para>The third group comprises provisions dealing with rationing and allied matters. After most serious consideration, Cabinet decided that the present rationing of clothing and food should be continued into 1947. The reasons are two-fold. In respect of tea and clothing, Australia is dependent on supplies from other parts of the world. In respect of sugar, butter and meat, Australia, has an obligation to help to alleviate the intense shortages in other countries, particularly the United Kingdom. The policy of the Government has been to relax clothes rationing as soon as it is in the interests of the public to do so, and during last year reductions were made in the coupon ratings of woollen piece goods and women's clothing, whilst coupons were removed from knitted underwear, knitted outerwear, hosiery,  headwear,  footwear and minor articles such as handkerchiefs, collars and ties. Further relaxations will be made as circumstances permit. With regard to tea, there is still a severe world shortage, as the Netherlands East Indies, one of the principal producing countries prior to the war, is still out of production. As to sugar, butter and meat, production in Australia is ample to meet all domestic requirements without restriction, but large quantities of these goods are required for export to Great Britain, where there is a very severe shortage of essential goods - a shortage even greater than during the war years. Besides the rationing regulations proper, there have also to be considered the hide and leather, jute control, tinplate, land transport (motor car), liquid fuel control, rabbit skin, and tea control regulations, all of which were related in war-time to the problem, of the best distribution of scarce commodities. To remove them now, while the effects of war-time dislocation are still strongly present, would be to give rise to acute instability and hardship. i.n the industrial group I should especially refer to the female minimum rt tes, industrial peace, and the shipping co-ordination regulations. As in the case of regulations included in other groupings, it is hoped that, as time permits, Parliament will be asked to enact in substantive statutes those parts of these regulations with which this Parliament is competent to deal. Meanwhile it is essential for the successful industrial reconversion of Australia that fundamental provisions under these regulations should lie retained. The industrial peace regulations, for instance, are still being widely relied upon by the Government, the Arbitration Court and conciliation commissioners. The regulations provide a means of bringing to the notice of the court and the Minister for Labour any matter which is likely to result in ian industrial dispute. They also permit the appointment of conciliation commissioners in excess of the three provided for in the current Arbitration Act.  These regulations are used by the appropriate Minister to refer industrial disputes and matters direct to the court or the conciliation commissioners for hearing and settlement. As a result of this many awards have been made .and are still in force. Many determinations have been made under the regulations, which cannot immediately be deprived of their basis without the gravest results. The Government is now exploring the extent to which some at least of the extensive war-time modifications in industrial relations machinery can, within the terms of the Constitution, be grafted into. Commonwealth peace-time legislation. It is intended to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act with a view to improving and extending the procedures of conciliation and also accelerating the arbitration process. However, while transitional difficulties remain intense it would be inviting industrial chaos to allow all these regulations to lapse in December. </para><para>The fifth group relates to provisions pending legislation. Some of the matters to be temporarily covered by National Security regulations and orders will be replaced by legislation during 1947. I instance the control of animal diseases, disposal of Commonwealth property, industrial property, minerals and patriotic funds regulations. </para><para>The sixth group relates to rights to pensions, allowances and compensation. From the point of view of many Australian individuals and families this group is of vital importance. It includes the whole or part of the benefits and compensation sections of the Civil Constructional Corps compensation, civil defence workers and war injuries compensation regulations, the war service moratorium regulations, the war damage regulations, the medical benefits for seamen, and the claims against the Commonwealth in relation to visiting forces regulations. Clearly, as our social service legislation is consolidated in the coming months it will be possible to incorporate in it the provisions and obligations under some of these regulations. In some cases the regulations will be covered by special legislation. The Commonwealth Government naturally has no intention of going back on its undertakings and obligations in these instances, and hence cannot allow the regulations imposing them to lapse until alternative provision is made whenever necessary. Small adjustments have already been made in some to bring them up to date, and they will be regularly reviewed to ensure that with the passing of time anomalies and injustices do not creep in. </para><para>In the next group, military and security, there are certain regulations of such a character that continuance of them is essential to cover some phases or other of the final demobilization period, the interim and occupation forces period, and the period of clearing prisoner-of-war, and alien control arrangements. We shall, for instance, still have a few members of the women's services, to whom existing regulations apply, on strength in the first months of 1947. Certain disciplinary and other related matters applicable to the remaining war-time and occupation forces require the retention of sections of the National Security (General) Regulations for the time being. Some important regulations governing prisoner-of-war and enemy alien detention camps have to be maintained until sufficient shipping has been provided to return the men held and so remove the need for such regulations. </para><para>During 1947, I believe, the regulations in this group can be rapidly reduced by repeal or revocation. If in future any message of alien control were necessary which is not provided for already under our immigration laws it will be provided for by normal legislation which Parliament will have full opportunity to scrutinize. I have already explained that for eighteen months a regular check has been made with a view to the progressive reduction of regulations. It is not easy to give any precise idea of this process of reduction by means of mere bald statistical tables of the degree to which controls are being removed1 by the present bill, as the operation and effect of individual regulations vary considerably. For example, regulation 59 of the National Security (General) Regulations gives a Minister practically unlimited power over industry, and the removal of this one regulation is, from this point of view, of more importance than the retention of a host of others which are concerned with lesser matters. </para><para>Nevertheless, some general idea can be obtained from the following facts: At the 2nd September, 1945, 157 sets of regulations were in operation. These sets included the National Security (General) Regulations and the National Security (Supplementary) Regulations, which contained 141 and 121 individual regulations respectively. The present bill proposes to continue 61 sets of regulations in whole or in part and to remove 104 individual regulations from the general regulations and 79 individual regulations from the supplementary regulations. </para><para class="block">Under one regulation alone - regulation 59, general regulations, to which I referred just now - there were 131 orders listed as being in operation on the 2nd September, 1946. It is proposed to continue only four of these 131 orders. </para><para>In conclusion, I stress again to honorable members that when I say it is proposed to continue this, or that, I am speaking of a bill which allows of only a twelve months' continuance of any regulation or- order. During that period periodical reviews will continue and many regulations will be discontinued as 1947 progresses. None of the matters covered by this bill will be capable of continuance beyond 1947 without being embodied in specific legislation approved by this Parliament. That is as it should be. We must see that the difficult period of transition and reconversion after total war proceeds without dislocation and unnecessary suffering. At the same time, the democratic Parliament's supreme rights are maintained. This bill restores to Parliament its right and power to review the whole question of the continuance of Commonwealth emergency legislation for the purpose of covering a part of the period of transition. I am sure that in the exercise of its undoubted rights of criticism and review, the Parliament will also give the most favorable consideration to the Government's proposals. </para><para>In order to assist the House, I have caused to be prepared, first, a short statement of the purpose for which the temporary continuance of each scheduled regulation or order is required <inline font-style="italic">(vide</inline> Appendix "A"). Secondly, I have had prepared a statement in summary form of the regulations which will 'be discontinued <inline font-style="italic">(vide</inline> Appendix "B"). This statement also shows in summary form the regulations which have been repealed since the cessation of hostilities on the 2nd September, 1945. I take this opportunity to thank the officers of my department and those of my colleague, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> for their assistance in the very difficult work of preparing these appendices, which, with the permission of the House, I shall incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para></speech>

            <para class="block">Agricultural Machinery Order. </para>
            <para>This order provides for control over various types of agricultural machinery. The supply of tractors is still insufficient to meet requirements and it is proposed to continue the control only insofar as it relates to distribution of tractors. </para>
            <para class="block">Control of Essential Materials Order. </para>
            <para>This order authorizes the Controller of Materials Supply to regulate the distribution of materials which have been specified as essential. These materials include most base materials used in engineering and building industries - e.g., iron and steel sheets, copper and copper alloys, nickel, aluminium, manganese, zinc, asbestos. </para>
            <para>Control of Footwear ( Styles and Quality ) Order. </para>
            <para>The existing control under this order includes provision for the branding of footwear, the maintenance of the quality of footwear produced (which incorporates registration of producers and the submission of samples) and also the submission of monthly figures of civilian footwear production. Under the control, the quality of footwear has, in general, been maintained at pre-war standards. The relaxation of this control might lead to the production of shoddy types of footwear and it is desired to retain the control in order to afford the opportunity for fuller discussion with the State governments regarding the incorporation nf the present provisions, or ones similar to them, in State legislation. </para>
            <para class="block">Control of Tinplate Order. </para>
            <para>The Control of Tinplate Order is being retained in order to maintain control over the end use of tinplate. The quantities of tinplate at present reaching Australia are not equal to our requirements, and control over the end use of tinplate, after being in abeyance for some months, was therefore restored on the 1st July, 1940. Under this control, tinplate may be used only for certain purposes as specified in the order, its use for any other purpose being subject to the issue of a special permit. The issue of a permit depends upon such considerations as whether the product can be packed in a substitute container, and the degree of essentiality of the product. The objective is that tinplate should be used only where circumstances make its use essential. </para>

The amendment substitutes the twelve-month period for the two-yearperiod on the ground that insufficient storage space is available to keep records for a longer period, and that retention for longer than twelve months is in any case unnecessary.

                            <para>.- The speech by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> to which we have just listened, indicates how grudgingly the Government proposes to surrender the major economic controls which it has acquired under the extraordinary and abnormal conditions of war. That is in  line with the grudging reluctance of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to surrender any of the tax-gathering capacity, which, also under the abnormal and extraordinary conditions of war, he set in motion. In fact, I consider that it would be more appropriate if we were to describe the financial document which he presented to honorable members as a " grudgit  " rather than a budget. We find ourselves up against the familiar situation which has characterized every Chifley budget, or " grudgit ", as I prefer to call it, in which ostensibly he gives us some remission of tax but after we have sat back and examined his benign proposal, we find that we are being mulcted in a greater volume of tax than ever before. This budget is no exception to its predecessors. The cold hard fact remains that the Australians will continue to be the most heavily taxed people in the world. On his own conservative estimate the Treasurer proposes to collect from taxation this year £348,000,000 which is approximately £50 a head for every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth. I invite the Treasurer to indicate any other country in the world, English speaking or otherwise, where anything corresponding to this impost of taxation per head of the population remains. These abnormally heavy rates of tax are being continued in a period of peace. There is no excuse about the needs of war on this occasion. There is no excuse that a great section of , our adult-working population is devoted to the destructive tasks of war. Indeed, the people have returned, as the Prime Minister proudly proclaimed, to the productive tasks of peace. Therefore, the Treasurer's Budget statement is at the one time a claim of success and a confession of failure. Approximately 523,000 men and women have left the services and gone into civil production, and their numbers have swollen the ranks of tens of thousands of workers who were formerly engaged in war-time activities. But what is the result? The best that the Treasurer can offer is a minor remission of sales tax. </para>

                        <para>To point the matter rather vividly, I direct the attention of honorable members to the peak period of our war charges, namely, 1943-44. According to the Treasurer's statement, in that year we reached the peak expenditure of £548, 000,000 for war purposes. Receipts from taxation amounted to £303,000,000. This year, war charges have been reduced to £110,000,000, or approximately one-fifth of what they were in 1943-44, but, according to the Treasurer's estimate, taxation collections will amount to £348,000,000, or £45,000,000 more than he found necessary in the peak yea-r of war expenditure. It is small wonder that to-day Australia has a sick economy. The production pulse is sluggish, and instead of prescribing for it a stimulating tonic of tax reduction, the right honorable gentleman offers us a starchy diet of meat pies. "What are some of the symptoms of this malady which is affecting the Australian economy at present? They must be obvious to all honorable members. First, there is the serious lag of production, despite those greatly augmented labour forces which we have at our disposal for peace-time purposes. </para>
                        <para class="block">The Treasurer claimed that ex-servicemen are now back in the field of civil production; yet I invite him to produce any manufacturer in the Commonwealth who is not experiencing greater difficulty to-day than he did in the war years in getting the necessary components for the articles that he makes. In almost every line of production, these difficulties are no less, and, in most instances, they are even greater than they were in the most difficult period of the war. </para>
                        <para>Contributing factors, of course, are the serious shortages of fuel and power, which are affecting every State. The shortages of fuel are, in the main, the result of the failure to acquire adequate supplies of coal, and they have been accentuated by transport difficulties, which in turn are the result partly of a lack of fuel and power, and partly of the industrial dislocation that has upset our economic life. One of the more serious aspects of these transport hold-ups has been the slow movement of our shipping between ports, and the slow turnabout while the vessels are actually in port. These matters have led to a flourishing black-market in many of the commodities that are in short supply, a hold-up of housing, and, as I mentioned, the go-slow in shipping. We are told that there is a shortage of man-power in Australia, but the shortage is one of man effort rather than, of man-power. Indeed, the shortage of man effort has been confirmed by our experiences since the conclusion of hostilities. The potential is there. The productive capacity is there. The man-power, quite clearly, is there, because more people are engaged in our factories than ever before - about 20,000 above our war-time peak and some hundreds of thousands above the numbers engaged in factory production in the prewar period. Yet these shortages persist! </para>
                        <para>So I turn to what has been the major factor contributing to our shortages, and that is the nation-wide industrial dislocation which we have experienced in recent months. In order that we may see this industrial situation in proper perspective, I shall place on record a few simple facts relating to it, because honorable members on both sides of the House express conflicting views about it. Honorable members opposite claim that the Labour </para>
                        <para class="block">Government has a much better record of peace in industry than we had when we were in office. Others declare that these industrial disturbances are merely an inevitable feature of the transition from war to peace, and that they are occurring in " all' parts of the world. Therefore, I propose to cite a few of the facts. I do not claim that the political parties on this side of the chamber, when in office, had an unblemished record in industrial matters. We know that there were many stoppages from 1938-39 onwards, and that there were many serious hold-ups and enormous losses which reduced production below the  leved  of which the country was capable. The worst year after 1931, and before the present Government took office, was 1940. when, as the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> reminded us, we had a protracted strike on the coal-fields of New South Wales. In that year, approximately 1,500,000 working days were lost through industrial disputes. According to the Statistician's figures, the number of disputes in that year was 350. In the Labour Government's regime the worst year recorded up to the present year, which I think will set a new record, was 1945, when 2,100,000 working days were lost, and industrial disputes totalled 945. So, if we are to throw stones at each other in regard to this matter, I am. entitled to draw attention to the fact that in our worst year, 1,500,000 working days were lost in a total of 345 disputes, whereas in 1945, with Labour in office. in five State parliaments, and in the Commonwealth parliament, there was an all-time record number of disputes, namely 945, and a loss of 2,100,000 working days. But a solution of the problem will not be assisted by hurling accusations at each other because of our failure to deal with these matters in the past. I turn now to Great Britain to see whether there is any substance in the story that we in this country are no worse off than people in other parts of the world. In 1945, in Great Britain, there were difficulties, it is true. The number of working days lost in that year was 2,800,000. Setting that figure .against the 2,100,000 days lost in this country in the same year, and taking into account that Great Britain has about seven times the population of this country, it will be seen that, proportionately, we have been losing working jays at about six times the rate at which they have been lost in Great Britain,; and E repeat that this year, according to our common experience, new record figures for industrial disputes and days lost will be established. It is true that the situation after the last war was very much as it is to-day. We had a series of industrial hold-ups, and .a heavy loss of working days; but there are unusual features in the present situation which already have been referred to by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang),</inline> and again yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> Some of our most serious industrial disputes of recent times have not been strikes against capitalistic employers, but against government instrumentalities and government-controlled concerns, and they have not been strikes against allegedly unsympathetic governments, but against instrumentalities controlled by State Labour ministries, and by this Commonwealth Labour Government. So, the old story that there cannot be industrial peace under any government but Labour, and that socialism would be the complete answer to our industrial difficulties, has been exploded once and for all. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think that anybody in this chamber will accept that as a valid criticism, and. I advise the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> not to go deeply into that matter; if he does he will find that the score adds up rather more liberally on one side than on the other. The fact remains that in several States of the Commonwealth, Labour governments have been in office for many years. I refer particularly to Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania, and coming closer to home, New South Wales. There has been ample opportunity in those States for any government, if it believed that a State instrumentality was being conducted unsatisfactorily, or was obviously antagonistic to its employees, to replace the controlling personnel of that instrumentality with men who, from the point of view of the government concerned, would be considered more satisfactory. </para>

                        <para>Another unusual feature about this matter has become <inline font-style="italic">more</inline> evident in the last few weeks or months - the organized retaliation that bodies of employers are setting up against these developments. T state these things as factors in the picture that we have to study, and I draw the attention of the committee to this undeniable fact: Our arbitration system which has been endorsed by the people of Australia by vote, over and over again, and which is the official policy, I believe, of all political parties in this country other than the Communist party, has come under attack by the organized forces of communism in those unions dominated by Communist leaders. These individuals have set out to smash the arbitration system and to sabotage it as a worth-  while institution in- this country. It is an unhappy fact that our arbitration system has not. worked satisfactorily during the last few years, and the principal reason is that it Iia?, not received the full backing of the governments for its decisions. An industrial law, no less than any other law, is impotent unless it is backed by the authority of the Government, and carries its own sanctions for breaches of it. A law without a sanction is futile; but that has been the situation. Our arbitration laws have been defied with impunity and challenged with success, with the result that we find to-day, bodies of employers, convinced that they cannot look to the governments or to the Arbitration Court for protection, relying upon such strength as they can muster by their own organization to resist what they regard as direct action by their opponents. We on this side of  the chamber make our position quite clear. We condemn direct action, whether by organizations of employees or employers. Either way, it is a breach of the law and should be stamped out by any self-respecting government. There should be no place in this country for the so called " right to strike ". There is no more justification for a right to strike than there is for a right to murder, to steal, or to violate any other law of this country. </para>

                        <para class="block">How is it then, that we hear to-day the claim that the worker's last and only weapon is his right to strike? Surely that is an echo of the days when these conditions did not exist; when arbitration tribunals were not functioning. Surely that is one of those political catch-cries that have been handed down through the ages. Do honorable members opposite, who claim that they stand by the system of arbitration and back the authority of our tribunals, condemn this assumption of a right to strike? Do they declare it to be an anachronism, something that belongs to a barbarous past? Of course not! The Prime Minister himself, the leading citizen in authority in this country, proclaims that the workers have a right to strike, and in approving that right he approves, by implication, the employers' right to lock out. How can we hope to maintain authority and industrial justice in Australia when the law of the jungle is sponsored by the head of the Australian Government? What of the right to work? Whenever a few men exercise the right to strike, they deprive many others, perhaps thousands, of the right to work. The exercise of that weapon by the miners on the coalfields of New South Wales has deprived many thousands of men in Victoria of the right to work, because Victoria cannot get fuel or gas without coal. I do not say these things in condemnation of the working men. I can well understand their feelings of frustration and their growing belief that direct action can provide the only remedy for the ills from which they suffer. They see around them rising prices, flourishing black markets, and costly houses. They feel that they are getting nowhere fast, and they have decided that now is the time for them to ' hop in for their cut ". If the courts gave decisions promptly on matters which arc the  subjects o  of grievances, and if those decisions were backed by the Government, we should have some hope of maintaining law and order in the industrial field. The Government's supporters ask us what we would do if we were in office. I have already said something of what, we in opposition would do if we were in power. We would endeavour to enforce the rule of law. I referred earlier to the worst industrial loss that an anti-Labour Government sustained when 1,500,000 working days were lost in 1940. I remind the Government and its supporters that the government, of the day fought that issue on the simple question of whether the decision of the full Arbitration Court should be observed or not. The court had given a decision with respect to the coal-miners. The miners had resisted it by going out on strike. It  would h  have been a  imple m  matter for the Government to do what this Government has since done time after time. It could have given 4 Sl surrendered the authority of the court, and paved the way for innumerable other disputes. Instead of doing so, it fought out the issue. We had very little trouble on the coal-fields for years after that, and industrial production generally greatly improved. This issue of the enforcement of industrial law and order must be fought out again sooner or later unless our system of government is to degenerate from a form of democracy to a form of anarchy. </para>
                        <para>Insistence upon the rule of law would -not be enough. That would be a comparatively slow process. Other treatment must be applied if the workers are to be made to respect the Government and the authority  of the courts, after all the years during which the courts have been relatively powerless to settle industrial troubles. I believe that any government with clear vision would demonstrate to the working men its intention to deal courageously with the very serious difficulties with which they are contending at present. For a start, T would concentrate on the problem of housing. The workers see prices rising beyond the reach of their wages. Houses are becoming dearer. They see no prospect in the future, near or distant, of being able to get the things that they want most of all - security and good homes. The Government should bring to this problem of housing the  same  drive that we brought to our munitions programme during the war. No achievement  in  Australia during the war  was  more spectacular than the expansion of industrial production to meet the demand for munitions. I am convinced that, properly handled, the housing problem could be solved in an equally spectacular manner. Success cannot be achieved by the methods of the present Government. It will not be achieved while the Government withholds from both employers and employees all reasonable incentive to work and produce. What did we do during the war in order to increase munitions production? We obtained the services of one of Australia's leading industrialists, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Essington</inline> Lewis, and asked him to direct the munitions programme. We asked him to choose leaders from the various fields of secondary production so that we might secure their co-operation and support. Thus we had directors of all branches of munitions production, a director of labour, and other men who were willing to help the Government, both in the national interest and because they had confidence in the man placed at the head of the organization. We must do something along those lines if we are to achieve the results in house construction for which the country is crying out. We must have at the top a man who is capable of dealing with the multifarious problems that will arise. He in List be capable of commanding the co-operation and support of other men who are leaders in their own fields of production - men who produce bricks, plumbing appliances, cement, house fittings, and- all the other things that are needed to build a modern home. The pattern was laid down by a war-time anti-Labour government, and this Government must imitate it in order to be successful. The Government's record in respect of housing is pitiful. New Zealand has been much more successful than Australia in this respect, and in Great Britain house construction is going ahead by leaps and bounds. This Government's programme is sluggish, and entangled in a mass of bureaucratic red tape. The leaders of industry who should be placed at the top of our construction organization have not yet been asked to help. In any case, the Government will not secure from the people of Australia the effort that it requires unless it provides an adequate spur. During the war. we had the spur of patriotism, and employers and employees gave of their best in the national, interest. That spur if insufficient to-day. We need now the encouragement which through the ages has made nien put forth their maximum efforts, namely, the incentive of personal gain and personal advantage. Without that - and the Treasurer made clear in his budget statement that he is not attempting to provide it this year - we shall not achieve the production effort of which this country is capable. </para>

                                <para>- In the few minutes remaining to me, I do not propose to cover any new ground, but 3hall merely summarize the points that I have endeavoured to make. The first point is, that we have in Australia to-day an ailing economy. The symptoms of the malady are all too obvious and all too serious. Predominant among them is the nation-wide industrial dislocation, which has had the effect of slowing up transport, depriving us of adequate supplies of fuel and power, causing a hold-up of shipping particularly, and generally retarding the productive capacity of the country. This industrial dislocation is based on factors that have been discussed in this chamber on many occasions, outstanding among them being the effect of high taxation and the sense of frustration which has led both employer and employee to believe that they are not getting an adequate return for their labour. Honorable members who sit on this side of the chamber believe that industrial dislocation has been more widespread and more serious than it need, have been, because of the Government's failure to enforce industrial law, and ite refusal to back up by its own authority and with such sanctions as it could have mustered, the decisions of our industrial tribunals. This has convinced militant unions that they can more successfully achieve their aims by direct action; and organized bodies of employers in various States, having despaired of the Government applying its authority to the decisions of the Arbitration Court or of the court being able to solve the problems presented to it, have in turn taken direct action against their employees by means of the lock-out. In order to remedy this situation, the Government must be prepared to enforce the rule of law with the sanctions which a government would normally apply. But the rule of law cannot easily be applied to-day, having regard to the need to get public opinion behind the Government if its legislation and its sanctions are to have any real weight. If the Government is prepared to enforce the rule of law, it must adopt at the same time measures which will convince all sections of the people that they will receive a fair deal. The most convincing and spectacular way in which the Government could do this would.be to infuse a real drive into the housing programme - a drive such as we were able to secure in respect of our spectacular munitions programme during the war years. If this is to be done, the- support of capable industrialists who are leaders in that field of construction must be obtained, and a real incentive must be given to the Australian economy if we are to secure that production which we know is possible but is not forthcoming to-day. Nobody can feel satisfied that we are getting from any section of the community to-day the output or the effort which we know it is capable of giving. There is no- shortage of labour, male or female; the figures given by the Treasurer furnish ample evidence of that. Thousands more are engaged in our factories to-day than were engaged at the peak of the war years, and hundreds of thousands' more than were engaged in pre-war years. Yet the production of many commodities is lagging behind the demand for them, and is below the peak that we were able to reach during the war years, when so much was directed towards the needs of war and many thousands fewer were engaged in our factories. The Prime Minister has told us that a golden era is opening up to us\ The use of the description "golden" is perhaps significant. Gold is a precious metal, not merely because of its intrinsic value but also because it is rare and hard to obtain, and because great risks have to be taken in order to acquire it. We can reach the golden era. of which the Prime Minister has spoken only if we work hard and take the risks which are normally associated with any great period of development. It is asking too much of human nature to expect extra effort to be made and risks to be taken in time of peace unless commensurate rewards are offered. Consequently, if the Treasurer is prepared to adopt a realistic approach to the problem, and is determined to cure the maladies which afflict our economy at the present time, he- must give- to the people n.s early as practicable such a measure of tax relief as will represent a real tonic for them. I do not entertain very much hope that the amendment which my leader has submitted will receive the support of this committee. The amendment is in general terms, and calls for the recasting of the budget in order to provide for an all-round substantial reduction of tax on incomes from personal exertion. No Government  speaker  has so far shown any inclination to adopt such a course; and, having regard to out  experience in such matters,  we do not expect any early softening of the heart of the Treasurer. If the Government does not propose to afford relief in this direction, I shall give to the committee before the end of this budget debate, the opportunity to adopt an alternative reform which would give very much needed relief to those families which are .finding it difficult to carry on with the incomes they are receiving today, namely, the adoption of a child endowment payment in respect of the first child, provision for which is not made under the child endowment scheme at present. [ believe that those people who to-day are feeling lethargic and apathetic require a real stimulus in order to give  nf  their best. We need that best if we are to take advantage of the tremendous opportunities that are open to us. The Treasurer told us in his budget state-, ment that favourable opportunities exist for an export trade. Already we have fumbled some of those opportunities by moans of the factors that I have mentioned. We had a wonderful opportunity ro enter the markets of Singapore and neighbouring countries, including China. We have certainly " missed the bus " in Singapore, because goods from Britain and America have been pouring in there as well as into the Chinese ports.- The great opportunity which awaited Australia has .been lost, certainly temporarily and perhaps forever. I point out to the Treasurer that whereas to-day we insist that the Australian market must first be satisfied, other- countries which have had a longer experience in such matters, and ]'. believe have greater wisdom, are setting aside a proportion of their production in order to develop their export markets. The present period is critical in that regard. Opportunities which are presented at certain stages of a nation's history and development do not always recur. We had such an opportunity at the conclusion of the war, and to a degree we have it to-day; but if we insist that the Australian market must first be satisfied, and do not encourage exporters to set aside a proportion of production in order to obtain a footing in those markets, we shall find that they have been lost to us forever. </para>

                        <para>I believe, and I am sure that my belief is shared by all honorable members on this side of the chamber, that the document presented to us by the Treasurer will impose for an unnecessarily long period those weighty burdens which oppressed us during the war years. They are causing stagnation in our economy. If that fact be not realized, and if remedial action be not taken, for so much longer will our entry to the golden era spoken of by the Prime Minister be delayed. </para>

                            <para>.- The debate on the budget is properly said to be the most important that takes place in this Parliament during the year, and the reason is obvious. The budget is the instrument by which the Parliament determines the distribution of the national income and prescribes the kind of economic organization under which the people are expected to live during the fiscal year. In other words, they must relate their own problems to the economic control exercised by the Government. One of the most important aspects of the budget is the means whereby the Executive raises the money with which to fund the expenditures undertaken by it for the purpose of policy and for financing the programme determined to be the best in the interests of the country. The most obvious class of revenue is that obtained by means of levies on individuals, which are called income tax on personal exertion and property. There are many kinds of taxes, as may be seen by a perusal of the budget. I am not directing my remarks immediately to those imposts, but to the taxes that fall directly on individuals. I am disappointed that no relief has been given in the budget to basic wage workers. I reject entirely the reasons which have been advanced by members of the Opposition as to the need to grant relief from taxation to people in the higher income groups. The budget might well have provided for the exemption from income tax of workers in receipt of the basic wage. These are the people who are most in need of a real increase of wages. If the income tax were lifted from them, the cost would not be passed on to the community in the same way as a direct increase of wages would be. An  exemption, rather than a general reduction, is desirable, because' it would be the least inflationary method of granting relief to a. section of the community which has only its labour to sell in the industrial market. </para>

                        <para>Many crocodile tears have been shed by honorable members opposite when advocating the scaling down of taxation rates. It is claimed by members of the Opposition, that that would give an incentive to increased production. I disregard that argument entirely, for it will not bear examination. From my contact with the workers in my own electorate, and with representatives of various trade unions in Sydney, what is gnawing most at the vitals of the workers, and most inclining them to slacken their productive efforts, is that their employers and other groups are, they say, failing to observe what members of the Opposition urged the Government to enforce against the workers, and that is  the  rule of law. The largest body of people in the community who are disregarding the rule of law are those with a good deal of money who are causing black markets to flourish. We arc not paying attention to proper price regulation, or to those who are endeavouring in every way to defraud the Government by evading taxes and customs and excise duties. If the' administration of the Taxation Department were in proper shape, a great deal more money than at present would be collected in taxes from people in the higher income groups many of whom are not subject to any supervision in respect of the taxation returns which they are required to furnish. I refer to people who do not work for wages or salaries, and are, therefore, not subject to the check which is exercised over persons whose employers furnish to the department returns showing the income of their employees. There are people other than salary and wage-earners who, during the recent war period, failed to furnish proper returns of their income, ind they are still neglecting to do so. It is rather unfortunate that the examining staff of the Taxation Department should be so depleted as not to be able to make a proper investigation of this leakage. If such an inquiry were conducted, the position would be found <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be different .from, that indicated by the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden),</inline> who has frequently said that a large amount of money, of which an account has been taken, is owing to the department. I say that a great deal of money is owing to the Government, and that no account has been taken of it. </para>
                        <para>In saying that people in the lower income groups should be entirely exempt from income tax, my object is not merely to place in their hands money which they badly need to meet the high cost of living. According to the Commonwealth Statistician, the taxpayers in receipt of less than £200 a year number 4S7,649, or 24.8 per cent, of the total number of taxpayers. Therefore, it is apparent that, if they were relieved of income tax, one fourth of the staff of the Taxation Department could become available to investigate the returns of taxpayers who have evaded their just dues for years. If anything has caused a slackening of production, it is the fact that the workers have for a long time been aware of the wholesale evasions of income tax. </para>

                                <para>- I am prepared to take a sample of taxation returns in the higher income brackets furnished to the department and have an investigation of them made. If my allegations are incorrect I shall withdraw them, but I am so confident in the matter that I have no reason to fear that a withdrawal would be necessary. The complete exemption from income tax of those in the lowest wageearning group would not necessarily have the effect of increasing production. Many persons receiving less than £200 a year are in receipt of pensions. They include sufferers from silicosis, those receiving workers' compensation, and superannuated persons. Although they are obliged to pay income tax, they are not eligible to receive the old-age pension because of the other income which they receive. The group also includes persons in receipt of pensions for which they have contributed during their working lifetime. </para>

                        <para class="block">Therefore, it is obvious that the contention of the members of the Opposition that a reduction of income tax would lead to an increase of production is without foundations. I suggest that taxation should be examined by a parliamentary committee, and that it should consider State taxation as well as Commonwealth taxation. In the terms of the uniform income tax agreement, the Commonwealth will this year pay £39,3S9,000 to the States to reimburse them for having vacated the income tax field. Last year, the amount paid was £32,000,000. The total amount which the Commonwealth will pay this year to the States under the agreement is £58,462,000, but that includes reimbursement in respect of taxes other than income tax. Yesterday, the New South Wales Treasurer presented his budget to Parliament, providing for a small surplus, about £15,000. The parliamentary committee, when considering whether persons on low wages should be exempt from income tax, should consult with the States, which are receiving from the Commonwealth £58,000,000 a year - about one-sixth of the taxation income in this year's Commonwealth budget. Early in the new year, the Arbitration Court will probably make its determination on the application for a new basic wage. At the present time, the basic wage-earner is liable to pay <inline font-style="italic">x</inline> shillings income tax. If the new determination provides for an increase of £1 a week in the basic wage, the wage-earner will then be liable to pay <inline font-style="italic">x</inline> shillings, plus something more, income tax. I suggest that the parliamentary committee, in conjunction with the State authorities, should examine the possibility of wholly exempting 'basic wage-earners from income taxation, and also those who draw not more than £200 a year in salary or other income. The Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation supplied to me a set of figures showing that the total cost of such an exemption would be £13,000,000 in a full year, which would also cover the cost of a. tapering exemption on incomes between £200 and £600. The return from income tax for this year is estimated to amount to £151,000,000, and a further £5.1,000,000 is collected under the social service tax. Thus, it is evident, that the conces sion to basic wage-earners could be made at a cost to the Commonwealth of only 10 per cent, of its receipts. If a plan were worked out in consultation with the State governments, a parliamentary committee on taxation mightwell feel justified in recommending this concession, which could then be granted at a cost of less than 10 per cent, of the receipts. </para>
                        <para class="block"> Last year, Parliament passed an aci which had the effect of bringing life assurance companies under government control. It did not provide for the establishment of a government life assurance office such as that in New South Wales, but merely regulated the manner in which the assets of companies - and they total £300,000,000 according to the figures of the Commonwealth Statistician - should be distributed in the event of certain contingencies arising, and in particular in the event of the contingency assured against, namely, the death of the policy-holder. This phase of the nation's economy is so important, and looms so largely in the platform of the Australian Labour party, that we should immediately cause a Commonwealth insurance office to be established ; or, even before considering such a step, the Government should assume complete control of all insurance companies in Australia. The vastness of the operations of the insurance companies merits close investigation, as does the great financial power which they wield. Some aspects of the activities of these companies to which attention has been drawn by royal commissions have been rectified legislatively, but there are others which should be given attention. I refer particularly to those which have an actuarial basis. For instance, life assurance premiums are calculated on the basis of tables which are outmoded and have no real applicability in Australia. Australian companies are working on United Kingdom tables for the period 1924-1929, yet figures supplied by the Commonwealth  Statistican  over a long period of years show that the expectation of life in Australia is from three to five years more than those tables indicate. That means that life assurance companies in Australia are collecting premiums for from three to five years longer than the risk warrants. These and other matters justify the immediate implementation of the platform of the Labour party in respect of life assurance. There is no constitutional hindrance to the establishment of life assurance business by the Commonwealth Government. The Government has already entered the field of air transport, and it should enter the field of life assurance. I urge the Government to put the policy of the Labour party into operation without delay. </para>
                        <para>Some progress has been made towards the attainment of the Labour party's objective in regard to banking, but not sufficient has been achieved, and what has been done falls far short of the nationalization of the banking system which is the party's ultimate objective. The only way to eradicate some of the vicious banking practices in this country is to remove completely private operators from the field. During the life of this Parliament the Government should proceed to nationalize banking. </para>

                                <para>- I shall be pleased to answer that question because I am sure that it was meant to be intelligent. In the past, the private banks in this country manipulated the national economy to such a degree that they embarrassed any government which pursued a policy contrary to that which suited their purpose. That remark applies to all governments, not merely Labour governments. In other words, banking was conducted by the banks in the interests of the banks instead of by the elected representatives of the people in the interests of the people. </para>

                                <para>- Every honorable member agrees that the control of prices is desirable. If we had not in operation such a good system of control as we have had, and if that system had not been administered with determination, many people who now enjoy goods and services could not have afforded to buy them. Nevertheless, I believe that, in addition to controlling prices, we should have had a Bureau of Standards to control the quality and the quantity of goods offered for sale. In many instances evasion of prices control has been effected by offering for sale goods of inferior quality. Manufacturers find little or no difficulty in manufacturing an article to a price, and that policy has been pursued, by many Australian manufacturers to such a degree that prices control has, in some measure, been circumvented. Besides the lack of proper control over the quality of the goods offered for sale, there has been no proper control of quantity. For instance, before the war an A.P.C. powder contained a certain quantity of powder, but to-day, although the price remains the same, or has been increased, the quantity of powder supplied for that price is less. Another well-founded cause for complaint in regard to the Prices Commission is the long delay which takes place in fixing prices. A person who goes to the counter at the office of the commission and asks for a determination as to the price that he may charge for certain goods, may hear nothing of his application for several months. That kind of thing tends to cause stagnation in business. It would be an advantage if special officers were appointed in each capital city to deal with such applications promptly. In this connexion I speak, not of goods which are in process of manufacture, but of goods already manufactured. I realize that, in respect of the former class of goods, investigation by an accountant may be necessary to ascertain what price should be fixed. Another complaint in relation to price control is that magistrates treat offenders too lightly. Too many persons who contravene the regulations have been let off with light fines. There should be a provision that offenders in certain categories shall be given terms of imprisonment without the option of a fine. The lightfines inflicted have not acted as a deterrent. Indeed, many offenders merely regard the fines imposed on them as being equivalent to a licensing fee. It would appear that certain groups of people have readier access to senior officers of the department than have others. For instance, the proprietors of two Sydney newspapers - the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Sun</inline> - recently were permitted to increase the price of their publications from 3d. to 4d. When I made inquiries in order to ascertain whether their applications were lodged in the ordinary way in which traders generally have to deal with "the department, namely, over the counter at the office of the commission in Sydney, I learned that the matter was settled at Canberra. The prices of all newspapers may be determined by one officer in Canberra - I do not know - but it seems extraordinary that, having regard to all the circumstances relating to the fixation of prices for newspapers, and for these newspapers in particular, the companies concerned should' be able to obtain an immediate decision on an application for the fixation of a new price. Whether the increase of per cent, is justified I do not 'know ; I would be surprised to learn that it is. Apparently, in fixing the new prices the Prices Commissioner has ignored the fact that the half-penny is a unit of currency in this country. An increase of one half-penny would have represented an addition of I63 per cent, to the price hitherto prevailing. Already these newspapers have refused to take returns from their agents, and they have increased their advertising rates. It is true that the cost of newsprint has increased, but this has been offset by the increase of advertising rates. I do not know how the Prices Commissioner is able to justify a 33-J per cent, increase of the price of these two newspapers, especially having regard to the fact that both companies concerned, Associated Newspapers Limited, and Consolidated Press Limited, made substantial profits and paid large dividends last financial year. Some inquiry should be made into the method of approach to the Prices Commissioner by the representatives of these companies and into the celerity with which they were successful in obtaining the fixation of the higher price. </para>

                        <para>I propose now to deal with some phases of the activities of the Repatriation Department. One of the largest factors retarding the rehabilitation of ex-service men and women, as far as the Repatriation Department is concerned, is the existence of repatriation commissioners. In my view the ministerial head of the department should accept full responsibility for all things done by his executive officers. Some will suggest no doubt, that </para>
                        <para class="block">Ministers .are subject to political and other pressure, but nevertheless, electorally, they have to accept responsibility for the administrative acts of their officers. It is most desirable that the Repatriation Commission be abolished and that all problems relating to repatriation be left finally in the hands of the Minister. We know that in existing circumstances the Minister is unable to do anything in the matter, that he may only be guided by the determinations of his commissioners. It would also be a desirable innovation if a few ex-airmen were appointed to the department, which seems to be dominated at present by old soldiers, not of the war just ended but of the 1914-18 war, who' seem to be more concerned about hanging on to their jobs than about helping applicants for repatriation benefits who cannot help themselves. I believe that not even one exairman has been appointed to the various repatriation tribunals established under our repatriation legislation. It is indeed desirable that persons with' air force service be given an opportunity to serve their country again in a field to which they alone can bring understanding of the problems of their former colleagues of the Royal Australian Air Force. </para>
                        <para>What I have said may be summed up very briefly. In regard to the budget, there should be a complete examination of the incidence of income tax upon those in the lowest income group. The method by which such an examination could best be made might be determined by a committee of members of this Parliament in consultation with representatives of the States which have, or which may be prevailed upon to have, a financial interest in the matter. A reduction of the burden of direct taxation upon those in the lowest income group, and particularly the exemption of that class, would have the effect of placing in the hands of those who need it most a real increase of wages; it would enable them to purchase goods and services which they cannot otherwise obtain, and it would have the further advantage of reducing by approximately 25 per cent, the amount of work which the Taxation Department is at present called upon to perform. Such surplus staff as the department would  then have could be diverted to the examination and investigation of returns furnished by taxpayers in the highest income groups which are not at present, and have not been over the war years, subjected to the checks which have been imposed in respect of those received from salary and wage earners. I believe also tb at I have made in general terms a case for the establishment of a government insurance office and for the nationalization of banking, for some reform of the methods of price control, and for the abolition of the Repatriation Commission. </para>

                                <para>- The case for the immediate reduction of income tax, especially as it applies to those in the lowest income group, rests upon physical, or financial, and psychological grounds. Even if the revenue were to suffer as the result of a reduction of income tax the psychological effect would be sufficiently important to warrant it. The records of this Parliament and of the country show, however, that government revenue does not necessarily suffer by a substantial reduction of the tax levied upon those in the personal income group. During the war the world suffered in two ways. It suffered, first, mental damage, and, secondly, material damage. We must restore both if we wish to make the world anew; and I believe that the repair of the mental damage is at the moment the more important of these tasks. We in Australia are fortunate that the same means by which we can repair the mental damage will, at the same time, enable us to a very great degree to repair the material damage. The mental damage is apparent throughout the world. It is illustrated in the ill-mannered discussions before the United Nations which are reported in all countries, universal strikes and industrial and political discord. Strikes are occurring in Australia without any real reason. Many excuses are given, but no real reason for them is offered. Men are asked 'to strike in order to gain a 40-hour week, but as the result of such strikes thousands of other men are thrown out of employment and do not work at all. Employees are asked by Communist leaders to strike in order to get more wages. Yet, if the same men are asked to work overtime they refuse because they say that most of the additional money they would earn would disappear in taxes. Therefore, the reduction of taxes will benefit the nation psychologically and financially. Psychologically, it will put the patient in the right frame of mind for permanent treatment. It will give the will to work to every' one from the highest to the lowest. Financially, the whole case for a further reduction of taxes is that by providing an incentive it will expand the base of production and, consequently, widen the field that can be taxed by increasing the wealth of the community as a whole. Accordingly, a reduction of taxes does not necessarily decrease governmental revenues. Reduction of taxes should not be regarded as a gift to any section of the community. It is not charity to any particular class. It is not a bribe which is offered to any particular party. It is just plain common sense and hardheaded business. Our immediate problem is to alter the psychology of discontent among the workers, producers and the people generally by inspiring in them a desire and will to increase production. But the budget makes no attempt to achieve this objective. The Australian Country party's plan is to reduce taxes,  particularly income tax, and to ensure the prosperity and progress of our land industries because ample production will wipe out restrictions and rationing queues. Thus we shall effect a remarkable psychological transformation among our people as a whole. The Government's plan of maintaining existing high rates of income tax in order to give this money back in expensively administered social services has failed to alter this psychology. This policy may keep the Government in. office for a time, but, ultimately, it will destroy both the Government and the nation. On every hand we see strikes, not against private employers or bosses who are supposed to be exploiting the workers, but against the Government itself and Government instrumentalities, that is, against the public themselves. Gradually, a general industrial paralysis is spreading over the whole of the community owing to shortages of supplies and the inability to finish properly any job that is undertaken. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Dalton,</inline> the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, spoke on this aspect only last week. He said that he was convinced that a reduction of direct taxes under present conditions should take priority over reductions of indirect taxes as the former would more quickly restore the will to work. He added that the present high income tax rates were a greater discouragement to productive effort than taxes on commodities. Yet this budget removes only the taxes on some commodities ; it does nothing to remove the tax on incomes. Secondly, we must increase the purchasing power of money in Australia and thus wipe out rationing and black marketing by stimulating the production of the land industries, thus providing in adequate measure the essentials of life, food and clothing, which are at present in short supply. That, is the only way in which this problem can be solved. Price fixation, or rationing, will not solve it. Ft can only be solved by the production of ample supplies. By that means a better balance will be struck between our domestic expenditure. The latest report issued by the Commonwealth Statistician shows how purchases and supplies of food and clothing have got out of balance, In  1923-27 the aggregate expenditure on food shown in the basic wage regimen was 39 per cent., and- that on clothing was 23 per cent., whereas in 1944-45 the aggregate expenditure on food was only 33 per cent, and that on clothing was 28 per cent. That change is due to the higher cost of clothing. Expenditure in respect of rentals and miscellaneous items remained practically static during the period I have mentioned. The cost of clothing has risen so much that, expenditure on food has decreased by 6 per cent. The Government says that it cannot afford to reduce income tax. I recall that when I was first elected to this chamber nearly 30 years ago the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, said exactly the same thing, that, his Government could not afford to reduce taxes. But what happened. Following World War I. the then high rates of taxes were increased. That policy resulted in increasing deficits because of the operation of the law of diminishing returns. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> and I formed our coalition Government we faced up to the problem of the reduction of taxes, and during the next five years we reduced the rates of income tax by 70 per cent, below the peak rates operating during World War I. At the same time, we raised the exemption for a single man to £300, and increased the deductions allowable in respect of a taxpayer's children. Under our rates a man with a wife .and four children did not pay income tax unless he earned as much as £700 a year. We made that concession deliberately because we realized that taxpayers in the lower ranges of income expend relatively much more on goods subject to indirect taxes than a taxpayer earning, say, an income of £1,500. We took the view that the class of taxpayers who spent more proportionately on good; subject to indirect taxes should be relieved of income tax. The result of that policy was to give to the people an incentive to increase production ; and the fact of the matter was that as income ta.x was reduced government revenues rose accordingly. The present Government says that it has pruned its estimate of revenue from taxation by £61,000,000, but we find that its actual revenue last year decreased by only £4,000,000; and whilst it claims that it gave a concession of £21,000,000 in respect of taxation revenue, we find that  last year its revenue from that source actually increased by £15,000,000. The Government's claims in that respect are sheer nonsense; because the only thing that matters are the rates of taxes and their incidence. All the other arguments used by the Government are mere window dressing. Not only did the Bruce-Page Government reduce income tax, but it found also that as the result of the incentive thus given to increase production it was able to reduce indirect taxes. That is even more remarkable to-day, because a new indirect tax - sales tax - was later introduced; by the Scullin Government. One extraordinary feature is that if -a man earning £7 or £8 a week is allowed a remission of direct tax of £1 a week, he will expend more money on such commodities as tobacco and beer than he did previously, so that returns from indirect taxation increase. When the  Bruce-Page  Government was in office, the receipts from direct and indirect taxation increased, and we were able continually to reduce taxes. At the same time, the budget carried additional charges, including £6,000,000 a year for the National Debt Sinking Fund. I established the fund. It still operates, and has paid off nearly £200,000,000 of war debt. We imposed an additional charge on the budget of £:"&gt;, 000,000 by increasing old-age pensions bv 5s. a week to meet the general rise of the cost of living. Apart from that, we were able to pay out of revenue £9,000,000 for the building of three cruisers, and establish and endow the Council for Scientific and Industrial . Research with an amount of £750,000, which carried it through the economic depression and enabled it to do most valuable research work for Australia. We also started a radium bank with which to fight cancer, and paid an additional £8,000,000 a year for war pensions and the cost of repatriation. Our budget also bore an extra £3,000,000 a year as interest charges as the result of the decision to convert into a taxable debt over £300,000,000 of our war debt which had been raised on a tax-free basis. In other words, I altered the system of tax-free loans to taxable loans, so that the rich would not get more advantageous interest rates than did the poor. These reductions of tax also reduced the Commonwealth's administrative expenditure. The number of persons who paid income tax was reduced from 782,000 to 231,000, and the cost of income tax administration was reduced by £250,000 annually. Hundreds of thousands of individual? were relieved of the <inline font-style="italic">worry</inline> of preparing returns. To-day, the number of persons who pay income tax, is approximately 2,023,000. If the exemption were substantially raised, between 500,000 and 600,000 persons would bc relieved of the obligation to submit returns and pay tax, and that would make for substantial governmental economies. </para>

                        <para>In the period to which I refer, primary production prospered. The dairying industry doubled its production, and the number of persons employed in it increased from 60,000 to- 120,000. The dried and canned fruits, wheat, and meat industries all showed a similar improvement as the result of the reductions of tax, which assisted development and gave to primary producers a remunerative price for their products. A most important feature was that the effect on industry was just as striking. In six years the number of factories increased from 17,000 to 21,000, whilst the number of employees in them rose by 72,000 from 395,000 to 467,000. The value of land, factory buildings and equipment increased by £74,000,000 - from £145,000,000 to £219,000,000. Wages rose by £20,000,000 a year. All those indicators of prosperity were traceable to the removal from workers in the" lower ranges of income of the liability to pay income tax, and general reductions of tax. After the world-wide economic depression, we restored employment in Australia by similar means. </para>
                        <para>Lessons of governmental treatment of the depression point the same moral. The way out of our present difficulties is to reduce taxes and lift agricultural buying power. The attempt to combat depression by heavy direct taxes, reduction of the exemption rate on small incomes, reduction of the pensions rate, savage indirect taxes, and the inauguration of sales tax failed to arrest the decline. The first great aid to recovery caine through letting the Australian exchange rate slip to its real level. This gave the Australian farmer and exporter £1.35 Australian for what was sold in Ling-land for £100 sterling, which maintained Australian equities in farms- and homes and saved Australia a bigger deflation than we actually had.. The second' great'  aid  was the lifting of the borden of excessive import duties, imposed in the depth of the depression, ofl! the Australian cost of liVing: and Australian, prices. The tariff schedule recognized that the 25 per cent., exchange discount was a protection to local industries, and therefore should be taken into account in determining the protective duties by the Tariff Board. Reduction of taxes, the establishment; of the home consumption price for- major primacy products, and the special consideration gwen to the farming price structure through government aid brought back full factory employment.. The number of workers rose from 287.915. in. 1981-3-2 to 426,934 in 1939-40. These two experiences indicate that we must do two things to ensure our recovery, and to help us in our task of feeding the world, and building- up our share of international! trade. The first isi to reduce-  taxes  so as to give an. incentive to the worker in every, calling. The second is to ensure payable prices to i be- farmer by the maintenance of the existing exchange advantage;, and stabilized prices- to make- certain full consumption of primary products.. Rural prosperity guarantees a full market to the industrial worker and full employment of the whole nation, with maximumproduction. Primary producers and those who distribute their produce constitute at least 50 per cent of the people who are able to buy manufactured goods. Honorable members should not forget, that  during  the world-wide economic depression, the nadir of unemployment in- alT countries  coincided  with the lowest prices for all major1 products of the soil. As' I stated', the lesson which we should' learn from the period immediately after World War I., and the period immediately after the world-wide economic depression, has the same moral". The way out of our present difficulties is to'  reduce  taxes. The Treasurer can do- that, audi the result will bc to' increase the- purchasing power of the people. The retention of heavy direct and indirect taxes, including sales tax will be a serious error. We must reduce taxes in order to provide an incentive for people to work. </para>
                        <para>I propose now to compare the position after World War I. with that after World War II. At present, the population of Australia, is approximately 7,500,000; at the end of 1921, it was 5,500,000. Thus the population has increased by slightly more than one-third. In that, period, our war debt has increased by nearly £1,500,000,000- from £60 a head in 1921 and £45' a head in 1939, to £237 a head! to-day. That is. to say, our wai1 debt <inline font-style="italic">per capita,-</inline> is approximately  four  times as great to-day as it was twenty-five years ago. Intereston the war debt has increased from £16,600,000 to £44,000,000 a year. In my- calculations, I have omitted State debts, which are represented to a large degree by reproductive assets, and Commonwealth works debts, which are also, regarded' as reproductive assets. War pensions- have risen from £7,000,000 to £14,500,000 a year, and the cost of social services' from £5,500,000 to £68,000,000. Total Commonwealth expenditure has risen from £76',000,000 a year to £404.000,000 a year. Just before the outbreak of World War II., Commonwealth expenditure was £98,000,000 a year. Simultaneously, the national income, in money terms, has practically doubled since the end of World' War I., rising from £546,000,000 to £1.247,000,000, and has increased by 50 per cent, since the beginning of World War II. In dealing with national income, I am taking into consideration what possibly could have been produced by the 200,000 servicemen who at that time were not demobilized. To sum1 up, if we eliminate  the  self-balancing services like the post office and the railways, we find that both social service payments and1 the present war interest charges exceed the total tax receipts of the Commonwealth in 1920-1921. The increases- of expenditure on three items alone, namely, social services, war interest, and war pensions1, when added together; double the1 total Commonwealth tax revenue receipts in 1939. The problem' eon-fronting Australia to-day is clear. To make conditions as tolerable for individuals as they were before the war - I am sure that every honorable member of this committee wishes them to be better than they were before the war - we must at least double our national income as quickly as possible by doubling our production, and, to double our production, we need a combination of factors which must be dovetailed into one another, and must work together. The most pressing need is for a reduction of income tax to bring about a will to work and an altered psychology. Then we must have more people in this country to work. We shall no!: achieve any large-scale migration to this country unless we make it attractive in a number of ways. We must make it more attractive for the investment of local and overseas money. We must have increased production of primary products, and improved industrial equipment for our farms, mines, and factories. In the first five years after World War I. we imported to this country plant and equipment for new industries to  the  value of approximately £70,000,000 or £S0,000.00. There is another reason why we should not be too hasty in saying that our exchange rate should be altered,  merely  because we happen to have some millions of pounds in our London fund. There are many things that we must buy for this country in the form of industrial equipment that we cannot make here either because of the time factor, or because of technical difficulties. Another important need in this country is for universal availability of water and power. We must have an assured supply of electricity in all parts of the country by linking up all our power resources in one big grid. We must have efficient communication by road, rail, air, sea, and telephone. All these things necessitate expenditure; and that expenditure must be given high priority because ultimately our capacity to pay pensions and other social services will depend upon the production of wealth. We must also have progressi ve agriculture, stabilized by reproductive and constant returns. We must have a streamlined arbitration system. Our arbitration system is now the envy of the world, but it is slow in operation. There are on 'both sides of this chamber, but particularly on the Government side, many men who, all their lives, have been interested in this very matter. The time has come for us to get down to the task of making our arbitration system as efficient a machine as we can possibly make it. If we do that, we shall be able to remove much of the present-day incentive to strikes, and we shall be able to destroy the capacity of Communist leaders to hold up industry at will. Another vital necessity in this country is a more realistic basic wage index. I have seen what has happened in New Zealand. In that country, the number of commodities upon which the basic wage is calculated has been increased to approximately 115, but when one come? to examine the matter closely, one find.that although transpositions have taken place, the ultimate result is the same, because a fundamental ' condition of a basic wage must be its ability to buy an ample quantity of goods. No matter how the method of calculation may be juggled, the basic wage will not be adequate until it can supply commodities at reasonable prices. </para>
                        <para>If we are to attract migrants to thicountry, particularly from those lands in which sound national insurance schemes operate to safeguard contributors agains! periods of financial adversity, we too must have an efficient national insurance scheme, entirely independent, of currell! revenue. One of the first actions taken by the Commonwealth Government - and it was a Labour government - during the depression was to reduce old-age pensions to 17s. 6d. a week, and also to reduce maternity allowances. </para>

                                <para>- That is not correct. If the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fuller)</inline> will examine the records he will find that I voted with other members of my party for the restoration of the former rate. Social services will be cut again unless we reorganize our entire social service system so that it will be completely independent of current budgets. Finally, we must <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> a complete elimination of waste in governmental and private activities by every conceivable means. To-day I asked the Prime Minister what was happening to money that was being allocated by the Commonwealth to the States. I wanted to know if there was any " follow-up " of those payments, and whether the money was being spent by the States on the duplication of services already provided by the Commonwealth, or- whether the Commonwealth itself was duplicating existing State services. I thought that u very good labour office service was operating throughout New South Wales, but I understand that Commonwealth labour offices are now being opened everywhere. Will the Commonwealth Employment Service wipe out the State Employment Service of New South Wales or will it be a duplication of it? These questions should be answered. The Commonwealth is raising hundreds of millions of pounds in taxes and then shovelling the money out to the States, but not exercising any control over its expenditure. We have a definite responsibility in the matter, and now that we have several former members of State parliaments in this chamber, we should be able to hear some informed criticism. </para>

                        <para>There are three magnets that can ensure a rapid improvement of our economic position. The first magnet that can be used as an incentive for the consummation of all the preliminary requisites to which I have referred, is a reduction of taxes, because only by reducing taxes can we increase the will to work. Secondly, we must have constantly progressing rural purchasing power, and thirdly, immediate preparations must be made for the supply of abundant water and power, and cheap sites for industrial development. In the present troubled state of the world, even large American undertakings are willing to come to this country and my information is that  these  organizations ask for three assurances. They say, " Tell us where we can ger 10,000 horse-power, an abundant supply of water- 10,000,000 or 15,000,000 gallons a day - and cheap land, so that we can undertake our factory development plans on a big scale and establish a big community settlement, which will keep our employees satisfied in their work". They will not come to Australia and say to us : " Will you have this ready for us in five years time?" They will come to us and say: " What can you do about it now ? " It is of the most urgent importance for us to clear our -minds on this matter at the earliest possible moment. We should use to the full the water resources of Australia which, unfortunately, are lamentably small in comparison with those of other countries. I have examined this subject with the assistance of expert officers of the Commonwealth and the States, and I have discovered that the total rate of flow of water in Australia is about 60,000 cubic feet per second. Of this, about one-fifth is in the MurrayDarling system, about one-third is in the Mary River in Queensland to the north, exclusive of the Darling system, more than one-fourth is between Gympie and Newcastle on the coast, and one- tenth is between the Hawkesbury River and the Snowy River. We should be concentrating on water conservation in those regions. Experience in America can give us a lesson in this respect. Already in the huge area of the Mississippi Valley, where one would imagine the water supply to be unlimited, big cities are turning away secondary industries because the water supply is insufficient for their needs. Other cities in the same area are curtailing industrial development because they cannot provide water for the domestic needs of an increased population. The first thing to do is to reduce taxes, especially on individual incomes, thus giving to the workers an incentive to produce more goods and a general impetus to industrial development throughout Australia. </para>

In the circumstances, we reasonably expected that provision, would be made for an adequate measure of tax relief. Instead, the Government has made some trifling and disappointing reductions of inflationary taxes, such as sales tax, excise duties, and primage. The only other item is a reduction of onepenny a gallon in the petrol tax. In fact, the Government has laboured and brought forth ,a mouse. The granting of such meagre concessions at a time when there should be a marked reduction of direct taxes indicates that the Government is devoid of imagination and has lost contact with the people. That isundeniable. </para>

A reduction of direct taxes definitely gives the people the incentive to work. The working man sees a greater sum in his pay envelope each week if direct taxes are reduced, and he is free to spend the extra money in whatever way he wishes. Under the Government's concessions, a few items will benefit from the sales tax reductions and people will only be able to buy a little more of those goods. </para>

                        <para>The Government must accept a great deal of the blame for our present industrial troubles. It has shown weakness in dealing with the instigators of industrial unrest and has abdicated in favour of a few 'Communists. Also it has mistaken the real causes of the trouble, apart from the agitation of the Communists. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Davidson stated in his report on the coal industry that much discontent was due to the fact that men did not want to work overtime because they knew that they would be '" working for the Treasurer". That is a well known fact. Had the scale of tax on overtime earnings been reduced, as I suggested during the budget debate last year, that would have been an incentive for greater effort in industry. If we are to secure adequate production of goods which are in short supply, direct taxes must be reduced. The Government cannot continue tododge the issue. Had the Prime Minister been a yogi sitting in contemplation on the banks of the Ganges month aftermonth, he could not have been further out of touch than he is with the viewsofthe people an regard to taxation. Had he talked with working men in any wage group,to members of ; any profession, or to householders,hewouldhave discovered that a reduction of direct taxes is necessary and is the only means of bringing prices and wages into closer relationship. As it is, his meditations have given rise only to a miserable reduction of indirect taxes that could have been achieved by the passage of a minor bill at any time. The right honorable gentleman has made a few sales tax exemptions. This tax was introduced by the Scullin Labour Government during the 'depression. Its continuance will take us back to depression conditions again, because of its repressive effect on the buyingcapacity of the public, unless we take stock of the situation 'and make drastic cuts.Some of the reductions that have been made are good and some are bad. For instance, meatpies and vinegar have been exempted. The Prime Minister considers these to be exemptions of national importance. </para>

                                <para>- No, but I shall tell the Minister some items from which sales tax should have been lifted. The two commodities which I mentioned should have been exempted long ago. When sales tax was introduced in a minor way at the rate of2½ per cent., there weresome strange anomalies. Many of them have been removed, but the others still exist. There has never been a proper revision of the sales tax 'schedules. When the tax was introduced a man who bought sandwiches in a cafe had to pay sales tax,but if he orderedthe ingredients on separate plates he did not lave to pay sales tax. Some classes of pastry goods were taxable and others were not, although the shopper mightcarrythem away in the 3amc bag. That nonsensical kind of taxation only harassesthe people and annoys them. Sales tax, which <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> increased in some instances from the original rate of 2½ per cent. to arate of 25 per cent., is a most punitive formof taxation. It has detracted from the value of working men's wages over the years. This LabourGovernment, which says that itisaclassgovernment andstands for the welfareof the working people, and whichbears the magic teg of "Labour which has 'earned it votes which it ill deserved, ought to ensure that the purchasing power of wages is raised to the proper level instead of perpetuating inflationary taxes. Many classes of goods could be exempted from sales tax. I note that stores imported on aircraft engaged on overseas air services will, under governmental agreement, be exempt from sales tax. Nevertheless, sales tax is imposed upon aircraft. Recently, a young Englishman who served in a Spitfire squadron in Australia,, returned to England, and then decided that Australia might be a good place to live in - as it should be - decided, to come here to make his home. He flew to Australia with his wife and children in a. Proctor aircraft which he intended to use for an air taxi service. He had been in. Australia only a few days when he was visited by an official and told that he must not remove the aircraft from its hangar because sales tax on the machine had not been paid. He pointed out that had he waited, for a year and taken advantage of the Government's free service, as a serviceman, he could, perhaps, have come out without cost to himself. He also stated that he had been put to considerable expense in coming to Australia in that way. I placed the matter before the Treasury, and was told that sales tax is payable at the Customs House on. imports - as it should be, if it is payable in the country on domestic production. I understand that there is on the Treasury estimates a sum which enables the Government, if it so desires, to make a payment which, in its opinion, is demanded by justice. I represented to the Treasury that such a payment should be made in this case but do not yet know whether my submission has been accepted. It is anomalous that a man who intended to settle in Australia should be tripped up by a tax of that kind because of his inability to pay the sum demanded, and be forced to say that he would be obliged to fly back to England or on to New Zealand and settle in that dominion. I have mentioned this case in order to prove that this is an irritating tax. which should be closely scrutinized. Many more exemptions from it should be granted. </para>

                                <para>- I believe not. Even if he were, I do not think that that would make any difference. An artisan who brought a kit of carpenter's tools to Australia would not be charged duty or sales tax. Nor should a man who comes here to make a living by means of civil aviation. The Government has given very little consideration to the real issue. It could have made a definite all-round reduction of direct taxes, and thus ensured contentment in. industry. Instead of doing that, it has adopted pettifogging methods, granting exemptions here and there. Some of them, undoubtedly, are worthy ones. The exemption in respect of paints wil L assist the building industry.. But. sales tax is still imposed on hardware and other building materials, and this has the effect of keeping up the cost of building. The Government might have been a little more generous in granting exemptions from sales tax. It has been obstructive, and 'the Treasurer has been obstinate, in regard to taxation generally. </para>

                        </continue><para>Because of the manner in which trade is being hampered and baulked, we may again be heading for a depression. I do not say that lightly. Our trade is disorganized. If there is any policy at all, it is haphazard. Controls are hampering all operations. In the matter of imports, the tariff should be the regulator and the guide. Trade should not be cluttered up with war-time/- controls. The Division of Import Procurement was set up as a branch of the Department of Trade and Customs, and: the offspring has outgrown the parent. It still controls imports from the United Kingdom, and elsewhere. Certain items are badly needed, yet people are unable to purchase their requirements of them because they cannot be imported without the approval of some remote official in the Division of Import Procurement. Hundreds of restrictions are imposed. Some of them were lifted after a good deal of pressure had been exerted on the Government by the Opposition, but many of them still operate. A firm wishing to import an article has to supply many copies of the particulars to the Division of Import Procurement, and then await the approval of an official, who may or may not grant it. The tariff, which is the law, should he the only guide as to whether or not imports should be allowed. I make the reservation that some sort of regulation may be necessary in respect of imports from America, because of the necessity to conserve dollars ; but there is no reason why restrictive action should be taken in respect of imports from sterling countries. This division, which should have been abolished or whittled down considerably, is holding up two-way trade between this country and the United Kingdom. Firms wishing to export to other dominions minor items such as dripping and fats have to wait au inordinate length of time for departmental approval. <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> time has come when these shackles should be removed from trade, so that the enterprise of the merchant might be stimulated and trade might recover. Not only is trade being hampered, it is also being lost. I cite the ban on Dutch shipping. I know that honorable members opposite say, " That is not our fault ". But they are responsible for the government of this country, and by allowing a few men on the waterfront to decide what Australia's foreign policy shall be they bring down Australia's good name, and it will be besmirched for years. The matter is vital not only to manufacturers and merchants but also to the working men of Australia. A press paragraph on the subject reads - </para><quote>
                            <para>America has now acquired a virtual monopoly of trade which would have put many millions a year into the pockets of Australian traders, manufacturers and wage earners. Apart from this loss of export trade, we have also sacrificed the chance of obtaining much needed imports. The seamen tell of an American vessel which, having unloaded supplies at Sourabaya, Macassar and Batavia, took back to the States an enormous consignment of raw rubber. America is selling what it has to sell and buying what it wants to buy from the Netherlands East Indies. </para>

                                <para>- 1 refer the honorable gentleman to an answer to a question which I asked on the subject. From it he will see that 800,000 yards went to Russia. Our next biggest customer is New Zealand, and another big customer is Palestine. Whilst we should encourage our export trade, wc should not export money by sending om of this country manufactures that have been subsidized. That shows how foolish is the trade policy, if any, of this Government. It has not grappled with the matter, and runs away when faced with a difficulty, with the result that our trade is thoroughly disorganized. I have mentioned the Division of Import Procurement. The Government has not lessened the power by any official in that division to prevent imports. It has not interfered with the rebellious waterside workers who have prevented the sailing of ships that would have carried not only goods but also medical supplies to distraught people in the Netherlands East Indies. We had the spectacle of Dutch children having to load the ships, and of a pilot being refused in Melbourne for <inline font-style="italic">Tasman,</inline> which was named after the great navigator who was the first to touch the shores of Australia. He would turn in his grave if he knew that the; country had refused the services of a pilot for a. ship carrying his name which had sailed with other vessels against the Japanese during the war. No enemy mi lion would be treated in the way that <inline font-style="italic">\\e</inline> have treated the Dutch. The present  Government  has shown, not only weakness, but indifference to our trade interests. Despite the high prices now being received for our wool, the Government will be heading for a depression if it does not lay down a trade policy. No declaration has been made by the Prime Minister regarding Empire trade preference. That policy has operated in both directions since 1932 under the Ottawa Agreement. In 1930, at the beginning of the financial and economic depression, the United States of America introduced the Hawley-Snoot tariff which was so high that it drew the gold of the world to that country; but, as it did not bring any goods, it helped to precipitate a world depression. Great Britain, however, set an ex-ample in 1932 by summoning a conference of representatives of the British dominions and securing the Ottawa. Agreement. Australia's exports to Britain then went up with a bound. Britain had always taken about <inline font-style="italic">&gt;Q</inline> per cent, of our exports, and in some oases they rose to 90 per cent. </para>

                                <para>- Of course; but we hope that our secondary as well as our primary industries will be developed. Britain had been selling more to foreign markets than to Empire countries, but it set an example to the world by encouraging trade within the Empire. The United States of America and other countries have tried to break down that trade reciprocity, but the action of Great Britain helped the world out of an economic crisis. After years of trade dislocation during the recent world war, we have had no indication from the Government whether it intends to pursue a tariff policy which has greatly benefited Australia from its  inception. Great Britain has fulfilled its part of the contract, but that cannot be said of Australia's attitude to Britain. In 1938-39. we sent about 90,000 tons of butter to the Mother Country, but last year we exported to it only about 50,000 tons, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Bankes  Amery had =aid that Britain would provide shipping to lift all of the food that Australia could supply. We are not giving Britain adequate supplies of food, although flour and bread there is rationed. Britain made some millions of pounds available to supplement its butter supply, but it did not get the butter it needed. </para>

The Minister is just as far from the truth now as he was when he talked about the export of textiles. I refer him to the statement which was published in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> regarding butter exports to Great Britain. It is not surprising that he was relieved of the portfolio of Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and given a sinecure. </para>

I draw attention to a question which I addressed to the Prime Minister a fortnight ago, and which I had to ask a second time in order to obtain an answer. I had pointed- out previously that the other dominions had adopted  a generous attitude to the Mother Country. I said that New Zealand, with a population about equal to that of Victoria, had made a gift to Great Britain of food to the value of £1,000,000, and that other dominions had also made gifts or monetary adjustments favorable to Great Britain. The present Government has never made a gift of a pennyworth of food to the people of the Motherland. All foodstuffs supplied have been sold at the highest price. Any help which the people of Britain have received from Australia has been, made available through the generosity of the people of Australia, who have generously despatched hundreds of thousands of parcels to 'their kith and kin. A fortnight ago I asked the Prime Minister whether, as a Christmas gift, the Government would make a substantial quantity of food available to Great </para>

I have referred to the subject of taxation and have expressed regret that direct taxes have not been reduced and that indirect taxes, such as the sales tax, have not been sufficiently reduced. I have referred to the nebulous nature of the Government's trade policy, but the people do not know how they stand with regard to Empire preference. Our foreign trade with the Dutch has been held up, and we have not taken an adequate share in the task of supplying food to the people of Great Britain. I should also like a statement from the Government as to its defence policy. No less than. £220,000,000 has been allocated for defence, and one would wonder where the money is to be expended. We have no army in Australia to-day ; there is not a battalion that could take the field in the event of war.. There is no squadron in th© Royal Australian Air Force which is operational, and yet this huge sum of money is being expended. </para>

I should Like to know how it is proposed to spend the money which is being voted for defence. -.Science hae in  effect  made 'the world so small that we 'can  no  longer 'escape o.ur obligations. Honorable member? opposite are always reluctant to .consider the introduction -of  compulsory  military "training, and I am not going to suggest i;t now,  but  there is no other way in which to prepare against the possibility of war. While it is too soon yet to suggest how ;a suita'ble training .scheme should be introduced, -a survey and census should be made. However, nothing: is being done. The Labour Government in Great Britain proposes to continue compulsory military training. Australia's record in war is good, so fains its -fighting men are concerned, hut that does not -necessarily apply to its governments, and I suggest that if it is proper for Britain to maintain the nucleus of a trained force, Australia should also do its share.

                            the Chancellor of the Exchequer, speaking in a debate in the House of Commons when certain Labour members objected to compulsory training, said -

Nevertheless, we can no longer afford ito rest on our laurels. There are four service Ministers in the Cabinet, the Minister for the Army, -the Minister for the Navy, the Minister for Air, and the </para><para class="block">Minister for Defence. The budget provides for the expenditure of £220,000,000 on defence, but is it likely that even one of the Service Ministers will rise in his place and tell us what is the Government's defence plan, or what measures it is taking to provide for the training of military forces. The mere spending of money does not make for efficiency. That depends upon training, and upon the quality and calibre of the men. Untrained men, however gallant, cannot hope to win. We must ensure that the defence vote is wisely expended. Conditions in World War I. and World War FI. may be entirely different from those in World War III. Recently, in the United States of America the General Staff arranged a conference in an effort to discover what might be the dimensions of a future war, bearing in mind the possibility of atomic warfare. One of the new weapons is the ionosphere rocket, which recently set an American altitude record of 230,000 feet, or more than 40 miles. There has been developed in the United States of America a new troopcarrying aircraft, XC99, which can carry 400 men on a 10,000 miles non-stop trip. En addition, submarines have been developed from the new German type which can move undetected  underseas  and then emerge to hurl atomic projectors from short ranges. According to an article by .Joseph and Stewart Alsop, columnists, in the <inline font-style="italic">Saturday Evening Past, "</inline> The only sure defence of this country is now the political defence". That doe3 not mean just talking in Parliament. It means trying to make the United Nations work. At .any rate, we are trying to do that, if talking counts for anything. There is a danger, however, .that the United Nations anight prove as futile .as did the League of Nations, although -it must be admitted that the League did score some minor victories, as also has the United Nations. However, we must look carefully to the future while Russia, which is so often truculent, maintains its present attitude, and we should not forget the operations of Russian agents in Canada only a little while agoJapan is neutralized 'by defeat, and for the next twenty years Australia will be safe from the possibility of Japanese attack. Russia cannot expand across the Pacific without a Pacific fleet. There ii always the possibility of trouble in Europe, and even at the present time there are serious border clashes going on in Greece between people of different nationalities and different ideologies. Guerilla bands from Macedonia are fighting the Greeks, and Greece is maintaining a precarious existence as a nation, faced as it is with the hostility of a powerful Slav <inline font-style="italic">bloc.</inline> Only the major powers can start a world war, but if such a war begins, there is the possibility that it will be conducted with powerful rockets and pilotless aircraft flying at a thousand miles an hour, and carrying atomic bombs. It should be remembered that only one atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, but it devastated many square miles 'of the city, and killed tens of thousands of people. I quote further from the article by Joseph and Stewart Alsop giving the findings and opinions of the United States General Staff - </para><quote>

In effect the world has been reduced in size because of the scientific achievements of recent years, and the result is that Australia is now as vulnerable as other countries wore a few years ago. What are we doing in the light of these facts? What is the state of our Army and Air Force? Our effective Army and Air Force is now in Japan, as there is no squadron in Australia which can be said to be operationally effective. The Royal Australian Air Force, which performed such wonderful feats during the war and earned praise in all countries, is disintegrating. Recently, I asked the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Drakeford)</inline> a question relating to the present strength of the Air Force. In reply, I obtained some of the information I sought, but other facts were withheld. The strength of the Royal Australian Air Force is supposed to be 15,000 men, actually it is only about 11,000, including the interim force. As the interim air force enlists men for only two years' service, many of the best of our airmen, who earned high distinction in the war, were refused entry because they were too senior  in rank, whilst others regarded  the  tenure of two years as insufficient lo induce them to enlist. The Government has not done anything about a citizens' air force, such as existed before the war, and which formed a splendid nucleus of the Air Force, which ultimately included 187.000 men. I do not suggest that Australia should maintain an air force of that magnitude, but it should have a sufficient force of carefully selected men to ensure its efficiency; and it should be properly organized. In this respect Australia would do well to follow the example of Britain. I draw the attention of the committee to some views expressed by Peter Isaacson, an outstanding Royal Australian Air Force bomber pilot in the war - </para><quote>

I had in mind other place.-, but I prefer not to mention them specifically. We are too apathetic in these matters. We talk about, the industrial issues which confront us but take little heed of these pressing matters. When I returned to Australia in 1943, and on many occasions since then, T. have urged the Government to decide what its postwar air force establishment shall be, so that men who wish to continue in the forces might be given the opportunity either to do so or ask for their discharge and the most efficient be chosen. If the Government were to say that it intended to maintain certain squadrons, and would provide pensions for men on their retirement, young men would know whether or not to enter the service. Suggestions along those lines have been made by me time after time but so far nothing has been done. The experience and enthusiasm of our young men should be available to their country instead of being lost. I regret that the Minister for Air is. not in the chamber at the moment, but I hope that he will heed my remarks, and also that other honorable members will support what I have said. The responsibilities resting on the Air Force are greater to-day than ever before because Australia is now in the front line. </para>

                        </continue><para>I am convinced that big savings of government expenditure could be made, and that in consequence taxes could be reduced. One direction in which an immediate saving of £80,000,000, and an ultimate saving of another £200,000,000, could be effected would be by not proceeding with the standardization of railway gauges. The Government would do well to seek the advice of experts in various fields of endeavour. I believe that, despite the many difficulties confronting us, Australia, which has. been so blessed by Providence, will prosper, especially if action be taken to attract to these shores large numbers of people of British stock. What is needed is a government which understands the country's needs and possibilities, and adopts a sound policy. Because of the Government's inadequate proposals in respect of taxation, its hopeless trade policy, and its entire lack of a sound defence policy I strongly support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition. </para><continue>

                            <para>. - The budget is most disappointing to the people of this country. It provides practically no relief to citizens who willingly suffered great hardships during the war in the belief that when the war was over relief would be forthcoming. During the recent election campaign the Leader of the Australian Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Fadden)showed  clearly that a reduction of taxes was possible, and the Government in the light of his revelations has provided some measure of relief. It has decided that customs and excise receipts can be reduced by about £4,000,000 and that sales tax concessions shall be made, but it is not correct to say that the budget provides relief amounting to £61,000,000. Before the budget was introduced and since the war ended, concessions amounting to £37,000,000 per annum were made, so that the budget can, at most, claim to offer a reduction of indirect taxation amounting to £24,000,000. No real lightening of the burden is being offered, however, because this year the Government will obtain from the people more revenue that ever before. In general taxation it expects to receive about £405,000,000: compared with approximately £391,000,000 in 1945-46. During this financial year a further £11,000,000 is to be extracted from the people of this country by way of income tax. No relief has been provided in this budget by way of income tax reduction. The Government's generosity is restricted to niggardly reductions of indirect taxes. In customs revenue an additional £11,000,000 will also be extracted from the people during this financial year. The Government has announced some slight amelioration of the severity of the sales tax, the total reduction in this field being £20,000,000. I point out, however, that the returns from sales tax this year are expected to be so great that this reduction will result in a diminution of the yield by only £2,600,000 as compared with last year. A similar position exists with respect to other forms of taxation. The pay-roll tax is to yield an additional £1,500,000 this year and a similar additional impost is being levied by way of land tax. The people who develop this country and produce the primary products upon which i ts prosperity depends should not be taxed upon the instrument which they use for productive purposes, namely, the land, any more than a primary producer or a carpenter should have to pay tax upon his tools of trade. By way of social services contribution an additional £4,750,000 is to be provided. Further, from primary production - self-balancing items - the Treasurer proposes to secure an additional £20,000,000 this year. Thus, although the Government intends to afford relief in. certain directions, it proposes to collect by way of additional taxes from the suffering taxpayers of Australia who are groaning under the weight of taxes, particularly of the income tax which bears more heavily on our people than upon those of any other country in the world, an amount almost double the amount to be remitted. We know that our commitments in respect of the war were not greater proportionately than those of the people of Great Britain or of any other country engaged in the war, yet we continue to remain the highest taxed country in the world. It is time the Government realized its obligation immediately to reduce direct taxes to the greatest possible degree. The Treasurer should inform us why income tax levied upon persons in the lowest income group cannot be reduced. Immediate relief is absolutely essential in order to bring to fruition the post-war developments about which we heard so much from members of the Government during the war. The Government has frequently announced that in framing its post-war policy its object was to increase the population of this country, to seek markets overseas for our products, to increase the volume of production and to expand the national wealth which is so essential to meet the great interest burden on the war debt. How is this policy being pursued ? By maintaining the pay-roll tax and the existing high rates of income tax imposed on the workers of this . country, not only those engaged in industry, but also our primary producers who work far harder, the Government is deliberately hindering the development of Australia. In the interests of primary producers, who find the greatest difficulty in keeping their heads above water, and of workers generally, the Government should make a determined effort to bring about substantial reductions of direct  taxes.  It should come to the assistance of those ex-servicemen and others who have sought to establish themselves in rural industries. It has been lax in. that regard, as have also the State governments, particularly the government of the State which I represent in this chamber. The silence of the Prime Minister in respect of income tax relief is beyond understanding. The right honorable gentleman has given no satisfactory explanation as to why he has chosen merely to make small concessions in respect of the sales tax on commodities which are scarcely worth mentioning. Of what value is the lifting of the sales tax on paper straws, on meat pies and vinegar? It is time that relief was afforded to mothers by the lifting, of sales tax on baby carriages, but many will not fill the baby carriages whilst tax rates remain .at their present level. The people condemn the Government for its failure to take this opportunity to give expression to their wish that the wheels of industry be made to turn again, so that goods and commodities in short supply may be provided. Every honorable member opposite knows what is in the minds and on the lips- of the people to-day. They know that the people are saying, " "What is the use of producing more when we merely hand over the rewards of increased production to Chifley ? ". To-day there is no incentive to develop industrial enterprises and the recent abolition of double taxation in respect of overseas companies desiring to establish branches of  their  undertakings in- Australia will have little result whilst the present state of affairs continues. I trust that during the remainder of the financial year the Government will find its revenues so buoyant that it will be forced to- bring about progressive reductions of taxes without delay. </para>

                        <para>During the course of his speech on the budget the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> referred to the desirability of accepting reparation payments from Germany in the form of plants for the extraction of oil from coal. The honorable gentleman has referred to this matter on several occasions, either through the press or by direct representation to- the Prime Minister, claiming that if reparations in such a form are good enough for Russia they should be good enough for this country. He suggests that we should acquire these plants and bring German experts here to reconstruct and operate them. But what of the record of the coal-miners of Newcastle upon whom we shall be largely dependent for the production of the coal to feed these plants? Would the Australian people be wise to place their future petrol requirements in the hands of the coal-miners of New South Wales, having regard, to the industrial unrest that has hindered the coal industry in this country throughout the years? Already the coal-miners have a stranglehold on the throat of Australian industry. In the press to-day will he found reports that many mines are again idle. If a plant for the production of oil from coal were established at a field like Blair Athol could we be assured that production of the requisite raw material would not be interrupted ? Having regard to the excellent record of the coal-miners in Queensland, it might be practicable to establish, plants in that State, bat the record of the New South Wales coalminers is so bad that the people would indeed be foolish to place in their hands the production of oil from coal in this country. No doubt if such plants were established a higher import duty would be placed on imported petrol in order to protect the local product. The honorable member will probably say, as he has urged on previous occasions, that the Government should nationalize the coal mines. In New Zealand, twenty mines, which provide 40 per cent, of the coal produced in that dominion,, have been nationalized, and, relatively, they have a fine record. For the year ended the 31st March last the operations of those twenty mines resulted in a profit of £1,409. That is a fair effort; but let us not overlook the fact that in order to recover that small sum for the Treasury, the. people of New Zealand contributed, in respect of those mines, from Government revenues subsidies amounting to £480,000. Surely, no one would propose that we should adopt a similar system in this country. Yet, honorable members opposite advocate it as an improvement on the present system, and, as I have said, the. honorable member for Hunter goes even so far as to urge the Government to take out what is due to Australia as reparations from Germany in highly expensive plant for the extraction of oil from coal, the operations of which presumably, will depend upon coal mines which are to be nationalized. That would be a retrograde step. </para>

I propose to devote particular attention to the justice of the claim of public servants and others in receipt of superannuation pensions, that such pensions should be exempt from income tax. This class of taxpayer includes not only public servants, postal' employees, including school teachers and members of the police forces, but also many people who are enjoying superannuation 'benefits under schemes instituted by private enterprise. First, I make the point that, permanent public servants are compelled by law to contribute to a superannuation fund. Provided they are not over-worked, and reach the retiring age, thus qualifying to draw a pension, their pension is subject to income tax. That imposition is most unfair. An employee of the Postal Department informs  me  that he contributes to the superannuation fund for six units, which will provide him with a pension of £3 a week, or £6 a fortnight, when he reaches the retiring age-. But, under the; means test, receipt of that amount will deprive him and his wife of the old-age pension. If he&gt; were not forced to make contributions to the superannuation fund from his salary, and, theref ore, did not qualify to receive a pension at tha.t rate, he and his wife- would be eligible to receive combined old-age pensions amounting to £6 10s. a  fortnight  He has been contributing to the superannuation fund since he was fourteen years of age and is- now paying 12s. 10d. a fortnight. On the other hand, a! person who makes no contribution to a superannuation, found is eligible to- claim for himself and his wife a combined old-age pension of £6 10s. a fortnight. Under the means test, this officer is penalized because he has- been thrifty. I believe that honorable members will agree that pension payable under a superannuation scheme should not be subject to the means test. This postal official decided to take out an additional two units, that is, to increase his units to eight. When he made application to that effect he was advised that he would have to pay the cost of travelling 60 miles to a doctor for examination, and that he would not be paid in respect of any time he was off duty visiting the doctor. He was also informed that the additional two units- at his age would involve an additional contribution of 12s. Id. a fortnight. He did not proceed with that proposition. Instead, he applied to a life assurance company for a policy of £200 on which he pays a premium of 9s. 4d.. a fortnight until he reaches the age of 65 years when he, or in the event of his death his wife, will receive the sum of £200 plus a bonus of £50. He was informed that should he die a week after he took out that policy his wife would receive the sum of £200. Under the superannuation scheme, after paying 12s. lOd. a. fortnight for 30 years, his wife would, in the event of his death, receive a small payment. She would not be entitled to receive the pension of £6 a fortnight payable to him should he attain the age of 65 years" whereas in return for a life assurance premium of 9s. 4d. a fortnight for a period of sixteen years he, or his wife, would receive £250 at the end of that period or in the event of his prior death his wife would receive £200 plus bonuses accrued up to that time. The Commonwealth Public Service Superannuation Fund to-day holds approximately £12,000,000. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> has admitted that postal officers are overworked. The Government has put its claws upon the fund which it is using for various purposes. If it continues to overwork these officers, thus reducing the number likely to reach the age of 65 years, it will find the scheme very profitable. I believe that there is general agreement that pensions payable under superannuation schemes should be exempt from income tax. The Government should also exempt superannuation pensions from the application of the means test. I sincerely hope that a fair actuarial adjustment will be made between superannuation pensions and benefits accruing under life assurance policies, and that the Government will review the whole subject in order to do justice to persons who are compelled to make these contributions throughout their period of employment. I press this proposal as a member of the Australian Country party whose policy is designed to safeguard the interests of every section of the community. </para>

                                <para>- We have never done so. When we describe as bureaucrats certain bosses appointed to public positions, we do not refer to public servants. The bureaucrats are not public servants. They are public autocrats, and the general community are their servants. When this Government appointed them, they at first occupied small offices, but they quickly built around themselves big departments. The public servants work for them, and the Government is unable to escape from their toils. Indeed, the bureaucrats have the Government by the throat. </para>

                        <para>Very few honorable members have referred in this debate to the subjects of water conservation and irrigation, and relief for primary producers in drought-stricken areas. I find it strange that Commonwealth grants for drought relief are restricted to New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. Queensland is now in the grip* of the most serious drought in its history, and the desperate condition of the people who live in the parched areas deserves the attention of the Commonwealth and State governments. The three States which I mentioned have received drought relief from the Commonwealth for several years. For example, in 1944-45, South Australia received £323,000, New South Wales £750,000 and Victoria £500,000. Last year, South Australia was granted £100,000, New South Wales a credit of £1,146 and Victoria. £70,000. For the current financial year, the Commonwealth budget provides for drought relief payments of £75,000 to South Australia, £81,000 to New South Wales and £185,000 to Victoria, but for Queensland no provision is to be made. Although the sugar cane, fruit, dairying and pastoral industries of Queensland are suffering severely from the drought, the primary producers of that State will not receive any Commonwealth assistance. In the period 1944-47, South Australia will have received £509,000, New South Wales £806,000, Victoria £660,000, and Western Australia, which, like Queensland, is a Cinderella State, £40,000, but Queensland was completely excluded. Not one penny was paid to Queensland during the last two years, and not one penny will be granted to it in this year of unprecedented drought. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> has explained that drought relief is a matter for each State. If that be true, why have these Commonwealth grants been made from year to year to New South "Wales, Victoria and South Australia? It does not make sense. In the period 1944-47, the Commonwealth will have paid to South Australia £4,200,000 by way of special grants and £509,000 for drought relief. Queensland will not have received any financial assistance. What is the reason? I do not know. I urge  the Treasurer to examine the desperate plight of primary producers in Queensland. They are suffering severe privations. Even the women and children are helping to dig for water, and find feed for stock. The Treasurer should revise his policy of paying thousands of pounds a year to three States for drought relief, whilst not paying one penny to Queensland. </para>
                        <para>I regret that neither the Governor-General's Speech nor the budget contained any promise of a vigorous policy of water conservation and irrigation. For some time, I have urged the Commonwealth Government to appoint an expert authority to investigate this subject in the same spirit and with the same determination that the Commonwealth sent its experts through  the  States to inquire into the standardization of railway gauges, and to influence people in favour of the scheme. Obviously, the Commonwealth is determined to force upon the people its proposals for the standardization of railway gauges. Recently, the Premier of New South Wales announced a long-range plan for the expenditure of £30,000,000 upon water conservation and irrigation projects to supplement the already creditable work carried out by the New South Wales Government. Queensland, this year, has provided only £660,000 for a similar purpose. In the next fifteen years, New South Wales expects to expend £15,000,000 on water conservation. In Victoria, water for irrigation purposes is known as " liquid gold ". I believe that the Commonwealth should assist New South Wales to provide the amount of £15,000,000 in order to safeguard the primary producers of that State against the ravages of drought. Water conservation and irrigation works are required, not fifteen years hence, but immediately. I note that £54,000,000 has been earmarked for expenditure on the standardization of railway gauges in Victoria, New South Wales and one other State. That money, if invested in water conservation projects, would enable <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> valuable national asset to be created for Australia. Nearly every leading country in the world owes its greatness to water. Yet Australia hesitates! When we ask for a vigorous programme of water conservation the Government informs us that lack of man-power makes our demands impossible. If that be true, why did the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> force through the last Parliament, in the early hours of the morning, a bill which provided for the standardization of railway gauges. This project will provide employment for " navvies ". They should be trained as engineers, ironworkers, cement workers and specialists in the construction of water conservation and hydro-electric projects. Queensland urgently requires water conservation. If the State had extensive irrigation schemes, it could, with its long hours of sunlight and favorable climatic conditions, support more than the total population of Australia at the present time. Only water is required. The reason for the rapid population of the United States of America was the availability of abundant water. If we wish to attract people to this country, let us undertake national water conservation schemes; then they will come. To-day people are leaving Latvia and other Baltic countries in search of freedom in Great Britain. They would find freedom in this country. There are thousands of Polish citizens too who fought for the democratic cause against Germany. They are unwilling to return to their own land and, I am sure, would be prepared to come to Australia. Already they have amply demonstrated their belief in democracy. Let us bring some of them out here to assist us with our water conservation schemes. There will be enough work to provide employment for thirty years. I hope particularly that something will be done in the great Isis district in my electorate and in the Bundaberg area in which the honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Davidson)</inline> has a great interest. Recently a deputation from the Burnett River district urged the Queensland Government to inaugurate an inexpensive water conservation and irrigation scheme on the Burnett River to assist cane-growers who to-day are suffering depredations of drought. Last year, and this year too, the sugar-cane crops died in the ground for want of water;; yet every time there is a flood vast quantities of water rush to the sea. TheCommonwealth should send its own experts to theseareas to see conditions for themselves, andevery encouragement should be given to the States by the provisionof money and labour to finance their waterprojects. In theoverpopulated countries of the world, people are looking for new lands. Surely, this country is one that can offer outstanding attractions to migrants. Only a small irrigation scheme would be necessary 'to supply the Isis district. Even nowsome fertile areas produce record quantities of vegetables and fruit. In one year from the Gympie district alone 379,203 casesof fruit and vegetables were despatched to other parts of the Commonwealth. A small water conservation scheme could treble production. The same may besaid of manyother parts of Queensland which I consider to be the queen State of the Commonwealth ; but development will come about only through the provision of adequate water supplies. The (potentialities are there. All that is required is the will to act. Apparently, there is no shortage of money, because £220,000,000 is to be expended on the useless standardization of railway gauges. Why not divert that money to water conservation? The profits from it would enable the Government to undertake any other developmental schemes it had in mind. </para>

                                <para>- The amendment has been moved to indicate theOpposition's belief that substantial reductionsof incometax should be made. Ibad hopedthat the budget would have revealeda substantial reduction of ex penditure on the host of bureaucrats about whom we have heard so much lately; that it would have shown an endeavour on the Government's part to tear down the many useless edifices that were erected during the war. Had that been done, the money saved could have been rased in the developmental schemes of which I have spoken. I do not believe that any avenue of expenditure offers so many advantages or such a sound return, us water conservation. Hydro-electric schemes undertaken in conjunctionwith water conservation, would enableevery home in the 'Outback areas to be equipped with electric appliances. If we want our outback residents to remain on the farms, producing the goods that are the basis of this country's wealth, they must be given more amenities ofcivilization. Exservicemenare returning to rural areas with a knowledge of modern living conditions in thecities, gained during their preparation forwar. Thereshould be a slogan inthis country " a phone for every home ". The installation of telephones in remote areas should not be contingent upon the revenue that can be obtained from them. Amenities provided in country districts will produee revenue indirectly, because they willmake living' conditions in those districts more attractive. To-day, manythousands of mothers and children , are living in the back-blocks of this country without contact with a medical service of any kind. Wehave flying doctors, and air transport for sick people, but what is the use of these services in an emergency if many country people have , no contact with them. When agroupofperhaps three or four settlers asks for the provision of a telephone line, they are told that it will costthem £200 or . £300.Inadditionacharge is made for the service the whole time it is in operation. </para>

There is too much delay in. referring eachselection to Canberra for approval. One 'Condition upon which blocksof land are made available to ex-servicemen in Queensland is that theymusthave a certain amount of money.. For instance, it may be necessary for a prospective settler to nave £1,000 to be 'eligible to participate in a ballot for grazing lands in 'Queensland. Although the StateGovernment's re- establishment scheme provides for loans of up to £5,000 for stocking and the purchase of equipment, the settler finds that he is obliged to go to a priva te banking institutionfor funds tobuy the land itself. However,when he goes to the Agricultural Bank he is toldthat he cannot get the money unless he has the land as a security. The other branchof the Startle department will not make blue loan,althoughthe man is qualified for it, because he does not then holdthe asset. The rules are not elastic enough to allow the loan to be made, and so young men are forced away from the land.. Very fewblocks have been submitted to a ballot yet. The Queensland Government claims that, during the war, it set aside 5,000,000 acres of land thatreverted to the Grown, yet it is holding up the allocation of blocks to eager young servicemen because assistance from the Commonwealth is not forthcoming. </para>

                            <para>.This budgetis essentiallya war budget, although the war Ira's ended. Whether it was a war to end waror, as has been confidently predicted, a war to make the world safe for democracy, I cannot 'say. However, I can say with certaintythat there is much trouble in the world to-day. Although wef ought the warsuccessfully, according to military standards at all events, we did not end the troubles o'f the world by that means. Therefore, I say that this budget, the nature of which is a direct consequence of the war, is a war budget. I remember - although I am sure nobody else does - that I made a speech in this chamber at the beginning of the war. I said then that although the Labour partyandI,asamember of it, were busy prosecuting thewar,I would devote more attention to theprosecution of the peace. I suppose that peace amongst nations isstill desirable, though I doubt very much whether we have achieved the aureole of peaceto-day. I also tookoccasion in that speech to say that any member of this Parliament who failed to say the thing that he thought ought to be said was guilty 'of greater cowardice than the soldierwho deserted in the face of the enemy,whether from emotional strain or from anyother cause. Having expressed that viewthen, I endorse it at a much later date. War, the budget in respect of which we are considering, settles nothing. In sayang that, I quote a remark made byan eminent Englishman. Furthermore, one may not discuss war, or a declaration of war, if one's views have the effect of casting doubt upon the propriety or wisdom of war as a final arbitrament. Consequently, it is the practice, immediately after -the commencement of war, to place upon the statute-book, with the force of law at any rate, a regulation which prevents war from being discussed, at all events from the point of view that it is in any sense undesirable. Passion may not be curbed in warlime. Consequently, one may not say that war is undesirable, or that it settles nothing. When the last war, the budget in respect of which we are now considering, was first declared by Britain on Germany, the then Prime Minister of Australia, who was not the present Prime Minister, broadcast these words - </para>

                                <para>- That matter was never discussed in this Parliament, although I believe that, as the Statute of Westminster had been passed, if not adopted, it might have been very properly discussed as a constitutional question. My honorable friend from the Northern Territory has asked, " Why discuss the obvious?". The reason why we should discuss the obvious is that it was a vital - as some thought - or at least a very important matter for consideration from the stand-point of its being or not being constitutional . It is one of the few things we can discuss in war-time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law, an eminent statesman of Great Britain, during the progress of World War I. held and declared the opinion that if Australia desired - I believe that it certainly does not desire - to "cut the painter " or sever itself from its association with Great Britain, there was nothing to prevent it from doing so. Australia could act as it willed. I believe that that view was generally accepted as being correct. Meantime, the Statute of Westminster had been discussed and passed. I am not prepared to say now how far that affected the position - I think not at all. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bonar</inline> Law was Prime Minister of Britain at that time. Wehad his assurance that it did not matter whether the Statute of Westminster had been passed or not, in his opinion Australia could act as it willed. That was my view, too, and I do not think there is the slightest doubt that it was the correct view. Therefore, I consider thai the matter ought to have been discussed in this Parliament, at least on its constitutional side. I acquit the present Opposition, under whose direction we were then performing our duties, the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> being Prime Minister, of blame in that regard, because undoubtedly the matter was not discussed when the Labour party came into office about five years ago. That party, it will be remembered, had at that time a doubtful majority, derived from two parties, one member from each party. </para>

The present position is, as I said earlier in my speech, that we must not cast doubt on the wisdom of warfare. The regulations promulgated during the recent war prohibiting unfavorable comment on the manner in which it was conducted were justified on the poor ground of military necessity. When, in support of the 1914-18 war, my late respected leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> promised the last man and the last shilling, he was indicating competition in the technique of war. I cannot object to that, because majorities rule, even in my own party. In the war just concluded, there has unquestionably been rivalry between the Opposition and the Government. The latter succeeded at the general elections in 1943 and 1946 because it was considered by the electors to have been more successful in prosecuting the war than the previous Administration had been. That applies to the Government which immediately preceded this one and to the Fisher Government. Successful competition was the order. </para>
                        <para>One of the consequences of war is communism. The Liberal, party puts that on to us on the ground that communism is democratic or cosmopolitan. It pretends to be, but it certainly is not. Communism is suspected of being irreligious. I think it is, and, therefore, I am utterly and completely opposed to it. Although there is not a great deal of religion in the world, nevertheless, one cannot succeed politically by making a frontal attack on religion. It is, among other things, bad politics. It is much worse than that, of course, but it is also bad politics. Such is the deep-rooted sympathy with the idea of Christianity that no political party can succeed in Australia by a frontal attack, or even a snide and sinister attack, on Christianity. I make that proposition, not as a theologian, but as a politician, and as one who has had considerable experience in politics. Communists do not always vote Labour. Eather do they support the Liberals.' I say so because of my own experience. The Communist vote - and it might have been a very useful one, but in my case was not necessary - was cast indiscriminately between Liberals and Labour men. </para>

                                <para>- Well, it was my experience, and I was very careful to observe the disposition of the Communist vote in my electorate. Although the gentleman who had assumed my name in order to get to the top of the ballot-paper naturally advocated the giving of second preferences to me, the Communist, on the other hand, for his own purposes, did not give the same advice or follow the same practice. I noted with approval that both of them forfeited their deposits. It is not necessary to quote from the book against communism written by the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang),</inline> because Communists are either irreligious or suspected of being irreligious. The result is the same, because a person cannot be suspected of being irreligious and at the same time be an active propagandist for Christianity. I hold the opinion that Christianity is the greatest fact in history and the most elevating force in the world. The Liberal party has tried to associate the Labour party with communism, and it is because I regard communism as a great danger, and .war as an even greater danger, that I have selected these two subjects for my short address on the budget, which reflects the period of the war. </para>

                            <para>. - I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> This budget was described by the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> as a masterly budget. No doubt that description will serve well enough. One thing is certain, nothing like it has been seen before. We can very well understand why the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> did not introduce it before the elections. I can hardly suppose that the people would have crowned it with garlands or welcomed it with open arms. It offers them nothing of substance; it proposes to reduce indirect taxation by a fractional amount and, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, insofar as it does relieve the community of the burden of taxation, it is designed to promote  the well-being, of the wealthier section of the community. The Leader of the Opposition in. his policy speech set out what we conceived to be a sound, progressive policy attuned to the circumstances in which we find ourselves. The war has involved us in colossal expenditure; it has cost us £2,111,000,000 up to the date the last calculation was made; and of course the cost is still piling up day by d'ay. The community has to bear this burden. It has borrowed large sums of in  oney;  it has incurred great liabilities not only in regard to matters which arise naturally out of the war, but also in other directions. The Government is pouring: out money like water; it is scattering' largesse with royal disregard of the consequences, and this year we are called upon to expend on defence no loss than £221,000,000. I remember very well that when the shadow of the coming conflict had darkened the heavens honorable members on the Government benches, who were then in Opposition, opposed a grant of £5,000,000 for defence, and even when the Munich pact had been consummated' they opposed a grant of Jess than £10,000,000 to build up our defences. Now they ask us in the name of democracy and of progress to agree to- a grant of £221,000,000 for defence. In those all too infrequent references to defence that he has made, the Prime Minister has said that the next war will be fought by scientists. I listened with great interest to what the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> told us to-day of the terrifying future that opens up before us - of aeroplanes flying at 1,000 miles an hour, of rocket bombs that wing their way to their targets without a pilot, of the awful effects of the atomic bomb-. And he told us, too, of the steps taken to meet this menace by the other nations of the world, particularly the United States of America and Great Britain and. of course, by Russia, which looks with a distrustful eye on the efforts of the scientists to preserve peace or to wage war. All the- great powers believe that effective land, sea and air defence forces are still necessary. In any case if, as a community, we- are to deal with the atomic bomb - if any community can deal with it. - there certainly should .be some kind of training or discipline in the community ; but we find that compulsory military training, which was at one time one of the basic planks of the Labour party's platform - and I take some credit for being responsible for its inclusion in that platform - is brushed aside on the ground that the scientists will wage the next war and accordingly there is no need for such training. Apparently we are to be the mere targets for the bomb, and what does a target want with training? All it has to do is to stop still and wait for the bomb. What this country and the world wants is peace. Peace is vital not only to the- progress of this country but also to its very existence: How is peace to be preserved? The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has gone to some trouble- to tell us that the rule of law is now to prevail in the international sphere. I remember very well hearing that promise being .made and received with joyous shouts by all the world in 1918. The- League of Nations established the rule of law. War was outlawed. The great enemy which had brought us to within an ace of destruction was humbled in the dust; and there was nothing then standing that menaced world peace if .the League of Nations, which had been formed to preserve the peace, exercised its powers. We know very well that it did not do that. It would have been quite easy to have prevented World War II. Under the Treaty of Versailles, which has been denounced by those who do not understand it or have never taken the trouble to acquaint themselves with its provisions, Germany had been rendered impotent. But the League of Nations failed because, although it spoke in the name of the peace-loving nations of the world, it had no force at its disposal to give effect to its decisions. We are told, of course, that the United Nations organization is quite different. The peace of the world which is vital to us, as it is to every other civilized nation, depends upon the rule of law, and the rule of law, upon which civilization itself rests, is in its turn dependent upon adequate forces being ,at the disposal of peace-loving- nations. When we are told that the- minds of men are disturbed at the possibility of another war, I. ask honorable members' from what quarter can 'such a war come? Germany and Japan are now " down and out ". There can he bo danger to world peace from them. I speak not of tribal disturbances which may occur hee and there, but of world war; And  the peace of the world cannot be seriously  menaced  except by one of these three great powers. On the other hand, it is to them we look for the preservation of peace. There can be no war so long as these three powers stand together; there .can be no serious threat of war ,so long as two of them stand, backed by the other peace-loving nations and members of the United Nations. Why do .nations go to war?' Quarrels between nations; like, those between individuals, arise because one wants what another has. Nations want, first of all, security. They want access to the sea; they want ports. They want access .to raw materials. All these things are provided for in the Charter of the United Nations. They want markets for their goods, and further - and this is a matter which is vital to Australia - they want land available for their surplus peoples. The foundation of this Commonwealth rests upon what we call the White Australia policy. The last war proved conclusively to any sensible man, or woman, that standing by ourselves w.e were unable to defend this country. Of course, had the enemy landed, we should have done the best we could; but I point out that standing alone we cannot defend Australia against a major power. The White Australia policy, which has been in operation for many years, has been accepted by the world, not because we were able to give effect to a policy that slammed the doors of this country against the crowded nations of the East, but because there behind us was the British Empire. For no other reason has the White  Ausralia  policy prevailed for a generation and more, lt is vital to us that we shall maintain this policy. Therefore, I say we must consider what conditions the future is likely to create. We ane now standing on the threshold of a new world. We have been told this many times by those w.ho believe that, although in this new world there will be revolutionary changes, these will leave  us  exactly where we are - in undisturbed possession of all our .present rights and privileges. 'Other people are to adjust themselves to the new  conditions  ; but not us. What is the position? The world to-day is occupied hy people who are where they are mainly as the result of war. War has shaped the distribution of territory in Europe, and over the world. The movement of people from worn-out pastures to better grazing over the hill, or across the border, has gone on from the beginning of man's occupancy of the earth to the present day. I remind honorable members of what the position of this country is. We have a continent for a heritage. It is a great and splendid heritage. Unfortunately, in this country there are too many "knockers", people who go about decrying it, declaring, for example, that we cannot maintain that population which, on the face of it, the country should be able to absorb. 'I remind honorable members what this country is. After over 160 years of white settlement we have a population density, as the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline> .reminded us last night, of approximately 2.5 persons to the square mile, whilst that of the United Kingdom is 508.3 persons to the square mile, that of the Netherlands 679.5 persons to the square mile, and that of Belgium 696.7 persons to the square mile. In comparison, the population density of China, which is about 105 persons to the square mile, and that of Japan which is 397.4 persons to the square mile, are not very impressive. The population of the world has increased in a most disturbing way from our point of view. In 1.S50 it was 906,000,000; and in 1880 it was 1,170,000,000, whereas to-day it is 2,156,000,000. Thus, the population of the' world has increased by over 1,000,000,000 in 66 years. The world around us is densely populated, whilst we have only 2.5 persons to the square mile. Now, we have set up a world, government - or, df that is too strong a term - a government, at any rate, whose duty will be to -deal out even-handed justice not only to us but also to those people who want elbow-room, an opportunity to live, and a place in the sun. If the pressure becomes strong enough, there will be -arc insistent demand that we shall open our gates. In that event, who will stand at our right hand, and keep the bridge with us? Certainly, it will not be the United Nations. I notice that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> has been assiduous in his efforts to enlist the support of the United Nations for our position in the Pacific. If trouble occurs in the Pacific, who will stand by us? If this vital plank of our policy is questioned, who will support us? We want peace. Peace is vital. Peace rests upon the rule of law; and the rule of law, in turn, rests upon adequate force ar the disposal of peace-loving nations to enforce it. Whether the United Nations will make that force available to support our policy is a matter to be decided in the future. I contend that we can look in one direction, and in one direction only, for support, that will never, fail. That support will come, not from the United Nations, but from Great Britain. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>Now, I have said that peace is vital to the world, and that peace rests upon the rule of law which must be enforced. I turn now to consider industrial peace, to which the same principle applies. Industrial peace can be preserved only by the rule of law. We have had an experience during the last year of an almost continuous state of unrest in the industries of this country. This does not occur because industry is without means of redress for its grievances. We have set up tribunals of various kinds which deal out justice on the merits of the case. But we see now on every side that the unions are resorting to direct action. To talk about industrial peace, after a great war is perhaps a counsel of perfection. We see all over the world these disturbances, and we should not be surprised at them. But I speak of industrial peace in normal times. There are forces at work now in our midst who are deliberately fomenting industrial disturbances and upheavals and who, owing to the failure of the Government to enforce the law of the country, are able to show substantial gains for their policy. I have had a wide experience of industrial affairs, and I note that the waterside unions, of which I was head for a generation, are now being led from one strike to another, and the journal which represents, or rather misrepresents them, boasts of this policy, " This is what we get by direct action ". They denounce arbitration. They stand1 for direct action. But the rule of law isessential to the preservation of our democracy, The law is made by therepresentatives of the people, and all sections of society must obey it. But the Government makes no attempt to enforce the law. </para>
                        <para>Industrial peace is essential to a continuity of operations, without which wecannot increase production. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that a reduction of taxation would supply the incentive to increase production. Our circumstances demand that we produce in Australia substantially more than we have done in the past. There is a demand now for a 40-hour working week. About that I say nothing here. The 40-hour week is not relevant to the discussion. The point is, how much can be produced? If workers can produce in 40 hours more than they can in 44 hours, so much the better; but democracy cannot live without discipline, and this demands enforcement of the law. If we require striking evidence of that we should turn from, this country to review conditions in Russia. There, the law is enforced. There, there is continuity of operation. There, production is continuous. There, strikes are not permitted. The unions in Russia are merely the submissive agents of the Government. But in Australia, the head of a great union is able to speak as freely as if he were an independent authority. In Russia, he would speak with bated breath and whispering humbleness and if he did not watch his step, he would speak no more. In Australia, it has become a crime now to produce as much as possible. Not long ago, I was in Brisbane, and I heard that a member of the Boilermakers Union was expelled from the organization because he had put in too many rivets during an eight-hour shift. In Russia, the crown is given to that man or woman who produces most. The pace is set by the  Stakonovites  of industry. The class war, as carried on in Russia, gives to those who produce the most the best that the country has at its disposal. Medals adorn their breasts, and their names are emblazoned in letters of gold, so that their fellow workers may see and- do  then  reverence, whilst those who do not produce adequate quantities are turned adrift. We must overcome the problem of falling production. 3. remind honorable members that the most powerful union in Australia is the most law-abiding organization, and the conditions of its members are determined by piece-workers. We have in Australia, the fastest shearers in the world, and the " ringer " of the shed is considered to be the leading man. If we are to live in peace and prosperity, we must produce to the uttermost of our power. We must produce more, earn more, and get more. 1 am not one of those who would suggest that labour has uo cause for uneasiness or unrest. I believe that it is the turn of the "underdog " - the man who through the ages has been oppressed, swept aside, and kept from the banquet table. I have shown by my life's work that I believe in industrial organization; but unionists in this country are being led by "reds" and " near reds ". They are following these "reds" and "near reds" as unsuspecting sheep whose throats are shortly to be cut follow the bell-wether into the abattoirs. What wc need is a realization that the rule of law is vital to this country and to civilization. A law is not worth anything without adequate force behind it, and that adequate force must be' supplied in this  country,  iti the case of the unions by the unionists themselves, and in the case of a peace-loving nation by the Australian people. They must place their forces at the disposal of those who stand for peace. </para>
                        <para>I am disturbed that the Government should have turned its back upon compulsory military training. This is the Government, mark you, which for 25 years not only denounced conscription, but also denounced my policy of giving to the people of this country an opportunity to say whether or not they believed in conscription. Yet during the war, behind the backs of the people, the Government introduced conscription. Labour in England to-day is maintaining conscription. As to whether or not that is right, in the circumstances, I shall not offer an opinion now, but I remind honorable members that in almost every country of the world to-day, people are being disciplined. In this country they are not, and without discipline we cannot carry on. Leaders of unions such as the miner; federation and the Waterside Workers Union are able to score steadily because they can "deliver the goods", without, the expenditure of very much money, and without serious risk, for they know that the Government will not enforce the law. It must enforce the law. I ask the Government to enforce the law, not for the benefit of employers, but for the benefit of the unionists, because if the law is not enforced, the trade union movement will become, as it is in Russia, a mere appanage and a tool of the government. In this country the unionist is a free man ; in Russia he is a poor, pallid, tongue-tied rat. </para>
                        <para>We are asked to approve the expenditure of £404,000,000 in the current financial year; and we may congratulate ourselves to some degree, because things might have been much worse. A year or two ago they were much worse. The Government is railing against high prices. It is urging the people to save their money. In support of its loans, it proclaims that people should put their money into government securities instead of competing for goods which are in short supply, thus forcing prices to new high levels. But when the Government gets the money it is poured out like water. Last night the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> said that the Government, which denounced the expending of money because of the tendency to increase prices, was obtaining from Commonwealth Oil Refineries' nearly £1,000,000 a year in taxation and profits. The Government is getting half of the " boodle ". and putting it in its pocket ; yet it indulges in unctuous meanings about high prices. Presumably, the high profits that are being made by the? quasi-governmental instrumentality are also being made by other oil companies. And the Government pats itself on the back for reducing the price of petrol by Id. per gallon. Let us have a little common sense. Let us look where we are going. We have lived so long immune from the disasters and disturbances that have beset other countries, that we have coram to  Regard  ourselves as being especially protected' by Providence; but it is the British- Empire that has* protected vis. balding, as we are to-day, with a population of only 7,500^000 a great wide land) which without? doubt Couldabsorb ten or twenty times that number. We . speak of immigration ; what we want; most of aiM is. an increase of the birth-rate in. this country. At one time, we had a healthy birth-rate, but it has. been going clown and down. lit picked up a little during the war. Wars, tame a stimulating influence im many directions, bat we cannot have wans merely to stimulate the birth-rate. The population of this country is- ©n the verge of stagnation. The Government speaks, of its grandiose plans for immigration, but- what are we to do with the migrants when they come here? Unless we can find remunerative employment for them, they will be a burden on the community rather than an asset to us in shouldering our national responsibilities. We must spend millions, of pounds on irrigation. Abundant rain fulls, but it is not carried to the localities in which it is most needed. There are opportunities in this land for the settlement of millions of people. Migrants could, be brought here in a- steady stream if proper preparations were made for their reception. I read to-day that a number of refugees have come to this country; but what are they going to do? They are going to set up in business. But what kind of business? Our greatest need is for land settlement. </para>
                        <para>I am content to point out. to the committee that the Government has turned its back on the only policy that is likely to serve as an incentive to production; that it has not attempted to enforce discipline;, and that it has abrogated, its position as the Government of this country and handed its authority over to the Communist strike leaders. </para>

                            <para>.- One could not help being impressed by the repetition, during this debate, of the ageold! story of strikes and industrial unrest generally, and the different means by which the difficulty might be solved, without any definite or practical proposal being submitted by members of the Opposition. The debate alfords to us the opportunity to answer once- again some of* those criticisms. and also, if I may say se, enables- me to comment on the fact that' all'1 the propositions advocated by the right honorable member for Worth Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and other <inline font-style="italic">speakers,</inline> when put to the people on <inline font-style="italic">the 23th</inline> September last, resulted in the reelection of the present Government by an overwhelming' majority, the greatest in the history of this country, and1 the endorsement of its industrial1 policy. Dur-ing the debate, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and other honorable members opposite have dealt with industrial disturbances, which, they have alleged, have been fomented and encouraged by Communists who- have been permitted to prosper under the protection of the Government. For many months, the same story has been related again and again in this Parliament. In answering some of the criticisms, I intend to deal specifically with a few instances that have been mentioned by the right honorable member for North Sydney and the Lea der of the Opposition. Listening to the right honorable member for North Sydney, one would think that he had beer, the strong man of Australian politics in his dealings, with unionists who had gone on. strike. He stressed specifically thai unions are resorting, to direct action, but conveniently forgot to mention that on the Sydney waterfront to-day more than, 8,000 workers who are prepared to follow their occupation have been locked out by their employers. He did not mention, enforcement of the law against those employers, who are adopting the course which he condemns,, and which baa been condemned year in and year out by the Employers Federation. Whilst claiming that the law should be enforced, he did not bother to say what steps he would, take to enforce it. Would he adopt the method which a royal commission proved he applied a few years ago in connexion with the coal-miners, when he attempted, by the payment of a. certain sum as a bribe to- the leader of the miners federation, to maintain industrial peace on thecoal-fields, and thus destroyed the confidence of the. men in their leaders.. </para>

But I affirm that a sum was made available by the right honorable member for North Sydney and the Leader of the Australian Country party for payment to the leader of the miners federation, in return for his endeavour to keep peace on the coal-fields. I claim that those were not  strong-man  tactics, and that they did not constitute an enforcement of the law, but on the contrary were a very bad attempt to maintain peace on the coal-fields.

                        <para>The Leader of the Opposition, in the course o£ his remarks on arbitration and industrial affairs, said that we  should have  a flexible system of conciliation and arbitration. He  condemned  employees and employers alike for strikes and lock-outs, and told <inline font-style="italic">ma,</inline> ki ' answer to am interjection, that if I referred to his policy speech I would learn  what  methods he would adopt for dealing with strikes, lock-outs, and industrial unrest generally. I did that, and found that be would declare strikes and lockouts illegal. On another occasion, he was reported in a Melbourne newspaper as having said that he would treat: as criminals those who were concerned in strikes and lock-outs. The Leader of the Australian Country party has used even, stronger language in his statement of the means that he would adopt. Other honorable members have gone almost as far as to advocate that workers who engaged in strikes should be stood up against a wall and shot. Possibly, unjustifiable strikes . OCCur in industry occasionally. Naturally, I do not condone them. Bui I do say quite frankly that peace cannot be maintained in industry by the use of strong-arm or stand-over methods, by shooting men. or similar tactics. </para>
                        <para>So much is said about strikes in Australia, that one would be led to think they do not occur in other parts of the world. Yet in America to-day, according to to-night's press, more than 140,000 of the nation's 4O0,0Q0 softcoalminers are on strike, and their leaders have said - </para>

                        <para class="block">More factors are involved in the industrial stoppages which, are occurring in Australia at the present time than the instigation of Communists. If every Communist were expelled from the unions . of this country, doubtless there would still be strikes. After six years of strife and struggle, men and women are finding it difficult to settle down in peace-time occupations and take their places in civilian life. There is a degree of unrest and uncertainty as to what their future is likely to be. Many men have vivid memories of the tragic days through which they  passed  between 1930 and 3910, when they were unemployed and their women and children were in absolute want in a land of plenty. They are fearful that they may again be beset by similar conditions^ </para>
                        <para>The workers also have a just claim for an increase of the basic wage, and many people employed in industry consider that their hours of work should be reduced. Until1 the major matters to which I have  referred, and also several minor grievances, are attended to, industrial peace cannot be brought about in this or any other country. The strong-arm tactics advocated by the Opposition will not produce harmonious relations between employers and employees. At the recent general elections the Opposition was told in no uncertain terms what the people thought of its demand for strong action against the workers. We heard the Leader of the Opposition say what he would do with the coal-miners. He threatened similar action during the strike of miners on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales in 1940. He said then that he would uphold the arbitration system; but for three months J;he community suffered severely from the effects of the strike. The stocks of coal were whittled down so severely that it has been impossible to restore them to the previous level. That was responsible, to some degree, for the recent shortage of coal for lighting purposes and for the generation of electricity. After the coal-miners had been on strike for three months, the right honorable gentleman visited the coal-fields and begged the miners to go back to work. That is a sample of the rigid enforcement of the law that might be expected from the Opposition if it were again in power during an industrial upheaval. </para>
                        <para>The Labour Government has endeavoured to ensure to the workers the best possible conditions of employment in order to produce harmony on the industrial front. Its policy is one of cooperation between employers, and employees. It denies that all of the faults lie on tl, e side of the people who work for wages. I do not condone strikes. 'But they are due to many factors, and until we can remove the causes by modernizing the arbitration system and providing a better basis of compensation, we cannot expect industrial peace. My greatest regret is that the proposals submitted to the people at the recent referendum for the granting to this Parliament of increased powers in respect of industrial conditions were not accepted. Had an affirmative vote been recorded, the arbitration system would have been given a flexibility which is sorely needed. It is apparent that the proposals advanced by the Opposition have no practical value. No constructive suggestion has been made. At the recent elections the Opposition claimed to be able to supply all the answers to our industrial problems, but the Australian Labour party won nearly all of the seats. </para>
                        <para>According to the Opposition, general harmony would prevail in industry if taxes were reduced and the employers were allowed to make increased profits. The Leader of the Opposition declared that the reductions of tax for which the budget provides are negligible and of no use to workers on fixed wages. My considered opinion is that the reduction of sales tax by the amount of £16,000,000 or £17,000,000 will be of great value to the community. The burden of this impost falls most heavily on people in the lower and middle income groups, and the reduction of the tax on clothing and other commodities will prove of direct benefit to the people. I hope this impost will ultimately be completely removed. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that the reduction was not sufficient tu supply an incentive to increased production. I presume that he would prefer a substantial reduction of direct taxes. Recently he toured the Commonwealth and promised a flat rate reduction of the income ta.\ by 20 per cent., in order to give to the people a greater incentive than they now have to work. In his opinion, apparently, that is all that is needed to improve the economic position. Under his proposals, citizens such as factory workers who are paid about £300 a year, would receive a reduction of income tax of about lid. a week. Does anybody imagine that that would prove an incentive to increased production? The proposals of the Leader of the Opposition are farcical. A person in receipt of £400 a year- would, under this scheme, receive a reduction of income tax of only 2s. 7d. a week, but the man in receipt of an income of £5,000 a. year would get the substantial reduction of £11 a week. What an unfair approach to the whole problem, and what a strange way to attempt to bring about increased production! Such arguments as those advanced by the Opposition are mere catchcries. We all realize that taxes are high. </para>
                        <para class="block">The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has promised to keep the position under constant review, and bear in mind the necessity for a sound economy. Consistent with the maintenance of the people's living standards, he promises that taxes will be reduced. Taxes having skyrocketed during the war period to an unprecedented height, reductions must necessarily be brought about gradually, and by a government that the people can trust. </para>
                        <para>Reference has been made to a lag in production said to be attributable mainly ro the taxation policy of the present Government, but a. check shows that production has increased by comparison with the results obtained in pre-war years. The quarterly statistics issued by the Commonwealth Statistician show that the total value of production in all industries in Australia in 193S-39 was £3S8,355,000, whilst in 1944-45 the total was £639,962,000. Therefore the present value of production is almost double that of the pre-war period. The real reason for the shortage of commodities is that, because of the Government's sound economic policy, all men and women who are willing to work are, in fact, employed, so that the spending power of the community has been greatly increased, resulting in an increased demand for goods. Besides this, of course, the production of ordinary consumer goods was, in part, suspended during the war while the nation concentrated on the production of war materials. ' Present conditions are in marked contrast to those which prevailed between 1930 and 1939, when there was such wide-spread unemployment that thousands of people could not pay rent for homes, or buy ordinary necessaries. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> blamed the Government for commodity shortages ; then, in the next breath, he said that we should not worry about shortages on the Australian market, but should concentrate upon producing for export. "Whilst I appreciate the need to maintain and expand our export market, our first, care should be to produce goods for the home front. We should cater first for our own people, after which we can look further afield. </para>
                        <para>There has been much talk about high taxation destroying the incentive to pro duce. The other day, I picked up a financial journal in which I read that Tooth and Company had increased its profits to £862,956, an increase of about £5,000 over the previous year. Another company had increased its profits by £24,000. after allowing for £14,000 more for taxation than in 1940. It is evident that existing tax rates did not keep those firms from producing. I do not say that taxation should not be reduced, but we must understand that it can be reduced only gradually. As a matter of fact, persons on. fixed incomes, particularly in the lower range, who could not earn overtime, were hardest hit by taxation. A direct remission of a few pence per week would not be as beneficial to them as would increased family endowment and better social services. Even if a few shillings are taken from them in the form of a social service tax, they will be more than compensated by family endowment benefits, hospital benefits, and other social services. </para>
                        <para>The present method of assessing the basic wage is  out-moded,  and should be brought up to date. The method ha? hardly varied during the last 40 years, and since it was first introduced many items of expenditure have come to' be regarded as necessary which were formerly unknown, or were regarded as luxuries. As a result, it is very difficult for a man. on the basic wage to carry on. With a little more luck, and with some assistance from the Opposition, the Government would have carried its referendum proposal, authorizing Parliament to set down a better method of compiling the basic wage and lay down broad principles governing industrial conditions, leaving to the Arbitration Court the responsibility to apply them in detail. </para>
                        <para>All sections of the community are greatly concerned over the present proposals to fix a 40-hour working week. I believe that this Parliament should have power to prescribe maximum and minimum working hours, as has the Parliament of New Zealand. Parliament, which consists of the elected representatives of the people, and has a good understanding of the requirements of industry and a proper appreciation of what is due to the worker, is well qualified to lay down broad principles for the control of industrial conditions, hours and wages. Ct is unfortunate that the referendum proposals providing for the granting of this power to Parliament were not agreed to. I hope that they will be submitted again  shortly. </para>
                        <para>The budget provides for an expenditure during the current financial year of £444,000,000, which is substantially less than the amount expended last year. The Government has to meet a wide range of commitments, many more than had to be met before the war. The Treasurer has given an assurance that expenditure is being cut down wherever possible, .so that the burden on the taxpayers may be md need. Australia's .financial stability is such as to have commanded the admiration of national leaders throughout the world. The Treasurer deserves credit for the way .in which he has managed the country's -finances. Not the least factor in the attainment of that result has been the system of prices control which has been in operation. A comparison with the United States of America is all to the advantage of Australia. In all parts of the world there is nothing but praise for ..Australia's achievements in this connexion, but I agree with the honorable member for Watson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falstein)</inline> that the regulations should be more rigidly enforced. There is need to tighten up these controls and to curb the activities of those people who are charging unreasonable prices for the goods that they offer for sale. I hope that the  proposals submitted by the honorable member for Parkes will have the endorsement of the Government, and that the law will be enforced against offenders. The system which has been in operation in this country has protected the people by maintaining their purchasing power, and it is to be hoped that any shortcomings in the system will be remedied quickly. I commend, the Treasurer on his budget, and particularly on the success which has attended prices control. </para>
                        <para>Speaking earlier to-day, the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> said that housing conditions in Australia are deplorable and the Government is doing little to improve them. I am astonished that the honorable member should have the audacity to make such a 'Statement, as he should know how little was accomplished in this direction by the Government of which he was a member and other governments which be supported. In pre-war years, when non-Labour governments were in office, there was a shortage of houses, but those governments did little or nothing to remedy that state of affairs. In my electorate, more bouses a-re now being built 'by. the New South Wales Housing Commission, in cooperation with the Commonwealth Government, than were built in the rest of Australia by previous governments. There is, however, a grievous problem still to be faced. In pre-war years the building of homes was left to private enterprise, which was more concerned about making profits than with providing homes for the people.  The result was that, even before the war, no progress had been made towards overtaking 'the leeway. The situation was aggravated during the war by -.shortages of man-power and materials for the building of homes. It will be seen, therefore, that lie present Government .started well behind scratch, but it has made an honest attempt to  cope  with the shortage of houses, and has done good work in that connexion. Every effort must be made to meet the demand for houses and to give to every person who desires to own his home a chance to do so. </para>
                        <para>The housing target set by the Government for the year ended the 30th June, 1946, was "24,000 dwellings, to be either completed or in course of erection. That objective was realized ; the Commonwealth Statistician's figures show that during that year 13,000 dwellings were completed and over 15,000 were in course of construction on the 30th June. Those figures included a carryover of 4,000 dwellings which were under construction at the. beginning of the year. The programme for the current financial year provides for the construction of 42,000 dwellings, and it is hoped that the rate of progress will 'be accelerated so that in another twelve months it will have reached 50,000 a year. At no time had the Government promised to erect 70,000 dwellings in a year. It is hoped, however, that the number of dwellings erected will increase each year and that the building of homes, which was seriously interfered with during the war, will proceed at such a. pace as gradually to overtake the demand. Commonwealth and State governments have united to assist the building industry during the next ten years. Men will be trained in various trades, and it is expected that 33,000 men will receive training during the next two years. The trainees are not expected to reach full efficiency until 1950. It will be seen that the Government is making an earnest attempt to overtake the leeway. Its record in this sphere of activity compares more than favorably with that of any other government in either the Commonwealth or State sphere. </para>
                        <para>In dealing with the subject of repatriation I lay special emphasis on the needs of ex-servicemen suffering from war neurosis. It is not right that men who served their country in the fighting services should be treated in mental asylums, tn many instances, treatment for serious war neurosis could have been avoided had the men received proper attention when the trouble first made its appearance. I have in mind the case of a man who was declared insane and sent to a mental asylum, only to be discharged after it was found that a mistake had been made in the diagnosis of his complaint. That, unfortunately, is not an isolated case. These men are entitled to specialized treatment. There should be a new approach to this problem. </para>
                        <para>The recent referendum gave to the Commonwealth power to provide social services for every section of the community. The present Government has a splendid record of achievement in connexion with the provision of social services for the people. It has provided increased pensions to invalids and aged persons, and has inaugurated a wide range of other social services, such as the provision of hospital benefits and the treatment of persons suffering from tuberculosis. The Commonwealth Government now has the power to devise and carry out a comprehensive scheme in the interests of the health of the nation. A big field is open to it. I hope that before long all our social service legislation will be consolidated in one measure and that a comprehensive range of health and social services will soon be in operation throughout Australia. That would not only conf er great benefit on every section of the community but would also place the seal on our achievements as a Government in the field of social services. No doubt that will be costly but additional grants will be made as time  goes  on. The Parliament now has power, which it never had before, to deal with these matters, and I feel sure that the Government will take advantage of this power to extend the benefits of its social services programme within a short time. I have taken this opportunity to give my views in relation to some of the problems that have been commented on by honorable members opposite and generally to traverse the difficulties that confront the Government at the present time.  Athough  the war is over the task of rehabilitation is not an easy one. A tremendous leeway has to be made up in every avenue of national activity and it will require the united efforts of al] those interested in the welfare of .this country to achieve the results we desire to bring about. If we pursue the policy laid down by the Government, we shall make up the leeway in production; we shall provide the social benefits which are the rightful lot of every citizen of Australia, and we shall achieve harmony  among  all sections of the people ; but if we adopt the shortsighted policy of honorable members opposite, who put political prestige before the national interest, Ave shall not attain any of these objectives. Let us consider our problems from a broad national viewpoint. We certainly shall not solve them by adopting the policy of honorable members opposite who condemn everybody and refuse to seek the fundamental causes which give rise to unrest. In its task of stamping out the fundamental causes of the problems which beset us, the Government gets very little assistance from honorable members opposite. Let them work with us for the general well-being of the community. I commend the Treasurer for the budget which he has presented to this chamber. The right honorable gentleman has presented an honest budget compiled after due consideration of the financial position and having in mind the necessity for benefiting, as far as financial circumstances will permit, every section of  the  people. The budget proposals are sound and logical and I am pleased to have had this opportunity to present my views upon them. I am also glad to have been afforded an opportunity to explode many of the arguments advanced by honorable members opposite during this debate. I look forward to a new era of prosperity for Australia under the sound leadership of the Prime Minister and the Labour Government. </para>

I have been in the chamber throughout the day, yet other honorable members who have been here for  only   part of the day have received precedence in the call from the Chair. My point of order is that I should have pre-audience over honorable members who have been absent from the chamber for the greater part of the day. </para>

                            <para>- In this debate, the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> gave what was, in substance, a pre-election speech on the subject of industrial unrest. Australia to-day is unique in one respect. Its Government, which formed our Avar administration and was responsible for the unpopular acts of a war administration, and for the burdensome taxation of a war administration, has been returned to office. That does not apply to Great Britain, where the major section of the war-time ministry suffered eclipse, whilst the result of the recent elections in the United States of America shows that it does not apply to that country either. There, the Democratic party is in the process of being destroyed as a government, having accumulated around its neck the unpopularity of a war-time administration. I do not propose to discuss at length the reasons for the success of this Government; but it does not say very much for public confidence in the Opposition that, despite its immense opportunities to capitalize the unpopular features of the Government's war-time administration, it is unique in the world in remaining the opposition in this country in the first stages of the peace. I thank honorable members for the rousing reception which they gave to me when I rose in my place. The honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lang)feels</inline> that he has a grievance. He should sit on the Opposition side. If he did so, he would have received the call before me. Mentally, he belongs to the Opposition.  His  activities during the last decade put him with the Opposition; and his presence on this side of the chamber amounts to a deception of the public. He is not a member, or a. supporter, of the Government ; and the Opposition's plot to secure him the call by arranging that no honorable member opposite would rise, clearly shows that the Opposition also accepts him mentally as one of its members. Such action is as tactless as the reference which the Leader of .the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> made in Tasmania during the recent election campaign to the descendants of convicts. We may well thank him for thus assisting to return to this Parliament a majority of Government candidates in that State. </para>

                    <para>I propose to discuss the subject of industrial unrest which the honorable member for Fawkner raised in the usual manner. " We must have the rule of law ", he asserted. "We must have respect for arbitration. The trade unions are abusing their strength. We must have a restoration of industrial discipline ". All the ancient <inline font-style="italic">cliches</inline> were trotted OUt. A lawyer has no responsibility other than to explain the position to the judge. He has no administrative responsibility. He has no responsibility to cause activity outside. Therefore, we never yet have got from members of the Opposition who are lawyers an explanation of what they mean by " industrial discipline". They do not say, "We shall call out the police", or "We shall confiscate, union funds", or "We shall dissolve the trade unions ". They do not refer to the coercive act3 which will impose industrial discipline.  They  dare not, for several reasons. The  first  is that, politically, they would be destroyed to an even greater degree than they are now. The second is that they know that the Commonwealth does not possess industrial powers to enable them, if they were in office, to coerce the trade unions. In 1926, the government of the day, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> attempted to obtain powers for the purpose of coercing the trade unions.

                    </quote><para class="block">Those were the coercive powers which the Bruce-Page Government sought to obtain for the purpose of destroying the trade unions. The people overwhelmingly rejected the proposals relating to industry and to commerce. The major industrial State, New South Wales, rejected them. Victoria and Queensland agreed to them. South Australia rejected them by more than 190,000 votes to 78,000; Western Australia by more than 112,000 votes to 46,000; and Tasmania by more than 51,000 votes to "41,000. The Bruce-Pago Government, after attempting other coercive industrial acts, was emphatically thrown out of office by the Australian community. </para><para>The matter of industrial unrest must be removed from the atmosphere of false assertion and counter-assertion in which it rests. It is usual to say, "We stand for arbitration, and when the court has made its decision, the workers should accept it in the same sense as a decision is accepted in criminal jurisdiction ". But that never has been so, and not all the oratory in the Parliament will ever make it so. The industrial decisions of an arbitration court, by their very nature, will never be accepted as final by any of the parties to the dispute, whether they be employers or employees. It is not a decision in the realm of exact law or exact fact as is a decision in criminal jurisdiction. There is no proof that the decision of the Arbitration Court gives a just distribution of purchasing power as between the owners of the means of production, and those who sell their labour. Those decisions which are made from time to time as to how the wealth of the community shall be distributed, will never be accepted as final by those who consider that they are not getting an adequate share of their production, in the same sense as a decision in criminal jurisdiction is accepted. Every honorable member in this chamber knows that to be true. Yet, year after year, nonsense is talked about how Arbitration Court decisions should be accepted as final. People have been saying that ever since arbitration courts were established, but the decisions have never been accepted as final. The Arbitration Court is a means of getting as close as we can to industrial peace, but with the present distribution of wealth in the community, there will not be industrial peace. There cannot be industrial peace in our form of society. 'Coercion, which the Opposition does not dare to say openly is its policy, would not succeed for the reason that the very people who go on strike - for example, members of I be Locomotive Engineers Union in West ern Australia, who are now paralysing the economy -of the State - are the essential people in the community who cannot be replaced. If 23,000 coal-miners in New South Wales do not go to work, we cannot find 23,000 persons who can mine coal in their place. If 700 key locomotive drivers in Western Australia do not go to work, we cannot find men to replace them. That is particularly true in the present situation of virtually full employment. We cannot lead men by the hand down the mines and compel them to hew coal unless we have a state of counter-revolutionary conditions, and where the full machinery of coercion is applied. That was a. characteristic of the Nazi state from its rise in 1933 until its fall. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I am not here to pander to the honorable member's phobias. It is not possible within a democratic society to carry out such coercion, so we must make the best of the situation, using the Arbitration Court as an instrument, and even going beyond that tribunal by using common sense as an instrument, and a humane approach to the problem of the workers. </para>

                    </continue><para>There are times when the industrial workers in key unions accept arbitration, and there are times when they do not. Et is important, if we are to understand this problem, for us to examine the times when the industrial workers do accept arbitration. During the economic depression, industrial workers in Western Australia tended to cling to arbitration. There was no talk of respect for the law when the Mitchell anti-Labour Government set aside the decisions of the Arbitration Court and reduced wages by 20 per cent. A bill for that purpose passed rapidly through the Legislative Council. I should like to see legislation setting aside a decision of the Arbitration Court to increase wages by 20 per cent. pass as rapidly through any Legislative Council in Australia. Of course, that would not happen. There is no talk of respect for the final decision of the Arbitration Court when we set aside a determination and reduce wages during an economic depression. We find that, in respect of the decision of the Arbitration Court concerning wages, the employers had a sovereign need to continue to produce, and that they could not do so unless wages were reduced. In circumstances of an economic depression, the slowness of .arbitration is a means of preventing the downward trend of wages. In circumstances of a boom such as we are now experiencing, the slowness of  arbitration  is a means of preventing the upward movement of wages. Therefore, in a boom, we find a tendency on the part of industrial workers not to accept arbitration, whilst the employers emphasize it. But during an economic depression, there is a. tendency on the part of industrial workers to accept arbitration, and for employers to use their political representatives, and any other instrument that they have, to set aside the decisions of the Arbitration Court and reduce wages. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- &lt;Th at has nothing to do with the statement which I . am making. It is a splendid appointment. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunphy</inline> is handling the present dispute in an excellent manner. I am merely pointing out one aspect of reality, namely, that the slowness of arbitration in depression times acts as a safeguard to the worker, and in boom times, acts against his interest. I should like to hear from honorable members opposite what are the means by which they intend to impose industrial discipline, and why, if they believe that they have the constitutional power in  this Parliament to do so, they bothered to hold j&gt;. referendum in 1926 seeking that power. Let us get expressions such as " industrial discipline ", and " the rule of law " out of the realm of airy generalization, and into the realm of specific fact. If Parliament passes an invalid and old-age pensions bill, something physical must happen in the universe. Money is handed 'over the post office counters. So, presumably, if Parliament passes a bill to impose industrial discipline, something physical must happen, and we should like to know what the proposal of the Opposition is. Is it confiscation of union funds, or the dissolution of trade unions? Of course, it is still possible in any middle-class constituency to talk of "the rule of* law ", " industrial unrest and communism, because after all, not much political analysis is made by the bulk of the electors; but in terms of real policy, we should like to know the physical means whereby the Opposition would impose industrial discipline, I point out, too, that arbitration is not accepted by employers in every instance. In 193S, when an award was made by the State Arbitration Court of Western Australia increasing the basic wage by 6s. a week, the management of a screw factory said, " These wages are too high. These are circumstances in which the return to us is not sufficient to induce us to continue to operate our factory. Therefore, we shall not continue to produce. We shall close the factory ". What is that but a strike? What is that but a decision that the return to the investor is not sufficient to induce him to continue to invest or to operate the factory; and what is the moral distinction between an investor saying, " These are circumstances in which I shall not go on producing because my return is not sufficient ", and a worker saying, " These are circumstances in which I shall not go on producing because my wages are not sufficient"? There is no moral distinction. There is a practical political distinction in that the whole structure of our society as it has evolved tends to defend the rights of property, and the man who has only his labour to sell has no property rights in the same sense as they have been evolved for others; but there is no moral distinction. Trade unionism is good sound capitalism. It, is an agreement not to sell labour at less than a certain price, just as there are agreements between all kinds of companies not to sell their commodities for less than a fixed figure. If it means anything at all, the Opposition's attitude on this question of industrial unrest is an invitation to class war. </para>
                        </talk.start></continue><para>Another practice that seems to be a feature of budget speeches, is to state first that taxes are too high and then, when the Estimates are under discussion to pick out all the popular points such as service pensions and say, "Expenditure on these items should be increased ". After submitting proposals which, if adopted, would involve a vast increase of expenditure, the endeavour is made to derive some political kudos for having proposed a substantial reduction of taxes. This game has gone on ever since parliaments have existed, but it does not get the community anywhere, or help it to understand the real problem*! that it is facing. Not in this debate, nor in the debate on the Financial Statement that took place before the elections, have we heard from the Opposition what expenditure should be cut. Honorable members opposite have not suggested that the £72,000,000 expended on deferred pay last year should not have been provided for this purpose, or that' the £130,000,000 expended on service pay last year should not have been provided. These two items total £202,000,000, whereas the net proceeds from income tax amounted to £132,000,000; yet they claim that notwithstanding that discrepancy which ha? had to be met by borrowing, income taxshould be reduced. </para><para>The Government has drawn attention to the substantial reductions of expenditure that can be expected this year. The Opposition's thesis is that these reductions should lead to drastic reductions of taxes. I say that if we are compelled to borrow, we have no right, to reduce taxes at all. We were compelled to borrow last year when certain reductions of taxes were made, and the effect of these reductions was to increase the burden on the community in the future, because increased borrowing means that an increased interest bill will have to be met by future taxpayers. During the war,  we  were informed that the most honest way that the community could face up to its problems was not to " Pass the buck " on to prosperity, but to meet its commitments out of taxation. Many of these commitments still exist, but drastic cuts of governmental expenditure, all of them ignored by the Opposition in the debate so far, have been made. For instance. the expenditure by defence and service departments last year was £307,000,000, whereas this year, the estimate is £124,000,000 representing a reduction of £183,000,000. Similarly, the estimated expenditure on production departments has fallen from £15,000,000 to £13,000,000. As one naturally would expect, lend-lease expenditure has fallen considerably, the figures being £5,000,000 compared with £26,000,000. Expenditure oh the payment of war gratuities was not an item of the budget last year, but this year £5,000,000 is required for that purpose. The cost of public debt charges and interest on war loans, has risen from £41,000,000 to £46,000,000. Expenditure on re-establishment and repatriation - the Opposition has been very sharp in its criticism of the Government's proposals as being too slow and too mean - is being increased from £.14,000,000 to £35,000,000. The lend-lease settlement with the United States of America, which did not appear last year, accounts this year for approximately £8,000,000. To Unrra last year we gave £6,000,000, and this year we shall give £15,000,000. Expenditure on agricultural subsidies which were needed when we were cut off from our overseas markets during the war, is reduced from £33,000,000 last year to £23,000,000 this year, and other items have fallen from £10,000,000 to £4,000,000. These are drastic reductions of expenditure. We still have to provide, in the coming year, £15,000,000 for services pay and £17,000,000 for deferred pay, and there is no suggestion by the Opposition that these commitments should not be met. In addition, the National Welfare Fund requires £64,000,000 for expenditure on social services as against £51,000,000 last year. We are also tax-gathering for the States, and the reimbursement of the States this year will require £45,000,000, or £S.000,000 more than last year. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- Nor is it suggested that in 1947-48 there should be no uniform taxation. The States believe that they should be given clear notice by the Commonwealth of the end of uniform taxation; but no State is so unreasonable as to suggest that at the present time, with all these war costs still in the budget, the Commonwealth should raise money for this purpose, and that there should be differing rates of taxation in the States. There has been no impediment to the States expanding their expenditure. Western Australia ha3 never previously had such high revenues as it now has; therefore, uniform tax cannot be said to have been an impediment to any schemes which it might have desired to carry out. The State Government asked for a grant of £750,000, and received it. It then asked for an additional grant of £950,000, and received it. It asked that a deficit of £912,000 with which it had ended the year's operations should be met, and that was done. The total of the special grants above the ordinary reimbursement of revenue which it had lost because of the operation of uniform tax, was more than £2,600,000. </para>

                        </continue><para>There has never been a specific analysis of the budget by members of the Opposition. Using the convention that any grievance may be aired before  His  Majesty is granted Supply, they do everything except analyse the budget, and invariably indulge in generalizations. There are one or two observations which I wish to make, concerning price-fixing and some other Commonwealth controls. There can be no question that price-control has not been nearly so effective as wage pegging. There is no doubt in 'my mind that there has been a fall of real wages as a result of the upward movement of prices and the pegging of wages. I draw the attention of the committee, and of the Minister who represents the Minister for Trade and Customs, to one or two unsatisfactory features of price control. About eighteen months ago, the method adopted for fixing the prices of vegetables in Western Australia was to fix the prices at which they might be retailed. During this year, the method was altered, and the only price-fixing which now operates relates to the retailer's margin of profit. The prices paid to primary producers for many important vegetables could increase indefinitely. The result has been spectacular increases of the prices of some vegetables. This tendency has been reinforced by the absence of an embargo on the export of certain, vegetables to southeast Asia, especially for sale in the tremendous black-market of Singapore: I express no resentment at the fact that permission has been given to export vegetables, even .though they were in short supply. We have a great diversity of food, for which there is urgent need in destroyed areas. But in my view the Commonwealth should have controlled the exports, and should have extracted some guarantee that the commodities would not be sold at black market prices. If the exports accentuated a shortage, the Commonwealth should have adhered rigidly to the original form of price control, namely, control of the actual selling price, and not control of the retailers' margin of profit. </para><para>The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Haylen)</inline> referred to black-marketing operations in connexion with motor cars, and the widespread evasion of pricefixing laws in that connexion. I commend his utterance. But I consider that we ought to go the whole way, and say what preventive measures we propose to adopt. Wie have often been told that our economy is in grave danger from a runaway inflation. If that be correct - and I accept the statement' that it is - then black-marketing is a crime which should be the subject of the most severe punishment. It is of no use merely to ?ay that -the prices of motor vehicles or of any other commodity are to be fixed. Some coercive machinery must be established for the enforcement of the law. I shall state my meaning specifically, because I do not deal in generalities. Since black-marketing in the sale of motor cars is so widespread, the Commonwealth Government should have a corps of agents to visit motor dealers and offer to purchase cars at the fixed prices. If the "stunt" of asking £200 above the fixed price is indulged in, the seller should be paid with marked notes, and should then be arrested and imprisoned. </para><interjection>

                                <para>- There cannot be effective wage-pegging without effective price control. I know that the wage- earner is not in a position to buy <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> motor car. I doubt whether a. politician in receipt of £1,000 a year would purchase a motor car at the present time unless he could be assured that the- sale was well controlled. Nevertheless, the price of a motor car or truck affects the purchasing power of the ordinary wage earner, because it becomes a part of the capital of the business man, and raises his costs, iff bought at the black-market price, the cost is passed on. to the community in the form of increased pricesfar the commodities which the truck carries- or the firm handles. So, -if we are- to have arbitration courts saying to the workers, because of the wage-pegging regulations of February, 1942, " Your wages shall not increase ", then, in order to be consistent, we must have some real means for ensuring that prices also shall not increase. The honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden)</inline> may describe such action as Gestapo, action if he chooses; nevertheless, if we expect the community to accept wage-pegging, it is essential that we shall have some real means for ensuring also that price, control shall be effective-. </para>

Nevertheless, the suggestion that there was something nefarious was likely to be misunderstood over the air. </para><para>In the budget speech are certain statements concerning works in the Australian Capital Territory, in Papua and New Guinea and in the Northern Territory in respect of which vast expenditures are outlined. I hope that in the course of this debate reference will be made to the policy which the Government intends to pursue in the Mandated Territories and the dependent islands. In 1944, with a fan-fare of trumpets, the Australian-New Zealand pact was signed. Certain promises were made concerning the wellbeing of the native peoples, but so far those promises have apparently remained on paper. They may have been carried out in fact, but very little information regarding them has been given to the people. I should like to know specifically what policy of welfare promotion the Government intends to pursue. Is it training natives as medical orderlies in association with the health scheme? Is it training natives as teachers in association with the educational scheme? In furtherance of missionary enterprises, what specific assistance does the Government intend to give to- the missions which are working in the Mandated Territories and the dependent islands? There is growing criticism in south-east Asia of the way in which European nations have discharged their obligations to the coloured peoples in the Netherlands East Indies. There has been a considerable advance in the position of the natives, in that in a year of chaos they have extracted certain concessions from the Dutch. The successful establishment of Chinese independence will be a great stimulus to coloured peoples throughout south-east Asia to press for improved political, economic and social status. It would be highly advisable to forestall any such demand by having a positive policy, such as was outlined in the AustralianNew Zealand pact, towards our own coloured people, and we should show how it is being applied by specific acts. l am sure that every honorable member will welcome the proposed reductions of sales tax. The Opposition has come out with a policy of drastic reductions of direct taxes. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> in his policy speech prior to the recent general elections, declared that indirect taxes such as the sales tax should be reviewed from time to time, showing plainly that in his opinion direct taxes should be lowered before there is a reduction of indirect taxes. When the sales tax was originally implemented - and I regret to say that it was introduced by a Labour government - members of the Opposition quite rightly, in my opinion, as the debates of 1931 will show, pointed out that indirect taxes, unlike direct taxes, were not scientifically graded and that their incidence would be heaviest on the people in the lower income ranges. They said that the family man would pay more than a wealthier single man or a wealthier married man with smaller family obligations. That line of talk was entirely correct, but it is astonishing to see it reversed by the Leader of the Opposition by one of those quick somersaults for which he has become notorious. He says that this means of remitting taxes is unfairest to the man on the lower income, and that the reduction of direct taxes would be fairest. The astonishing proposal made by him, and. again exposed by the honorable member for Martin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly),</inline> was that there should be a flat-rate reduction of income tax of 20 per cent, on all incomes, which in the case of men in the higher income groups would result in reductions of £585 a year, whilst the reduction in respect of low incomes would amount to only lid. a week. Obviously, the first means of benefiting the lower incomeearners while we still have enormous war costs to meet should be by a reduction of indirect taxes which bear indiscriminately on people in the lower income groups. The scientific approach to the problem is to reduce the sales tax on necessary articles like clothing, because the income tax is scientifically graded and falls heaviest on those best able to bear the burden. </para><para>Many references have been made by members of the Opposition to the need to increase production. They present a perfectly correct statement and play variations on it. The statement is that the present surplus of spending power should be underwritten by increased production. That is true. They did not, of course, say the reverse during the last depression, namely, that surplus production should be met by increased spending power. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> proposed a fiduciary note issue to increase spending power, at a time when inflation could not have been brought about if we had tried to do so, honorable members opposite did not accept the obverse of the argument that spending power must be underwritten by production. The honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt),</inline> claiming how the Government's taxation proposals were discouraging production, proceeded to say that the present employment levels in Australia established records, and that there was virtually no unemployment. If taxes are discouraging the employer from producing, why is he engaging men to work? The answer obviously is that the Government, through its budget proposals, particularly through social services and military pay, has been distributing purchasing power to the community. We often speak too lightly of taxation as a means of frustrating inflation. Last year £72,000,000 was made available to ex-service personnel in deferred pay, £132,000,000 was expended in pay to members of the services, £53,000,000 in social services, £33,000,000 in agricultural subsidies, and £12,000,000 in war pensions, all of which  went straight back to the community. The tendency was to shift the purchasing power to where the greatest tendency to spend exists, with a result that an unprecedented demand has been created for goods. If a person tries to do shopping in Canberra, he finds that all commodities available are purchased readily, because supplies are limited and the purchasing power of the people is great. So there is not much scientific notice by the Opposition of the effect of taxation on spending power. The Government has been rather a distributor of spending power after the money has been collected through direct and indirect taxes and by other means. That, of. course, explains the paradox why, when taxation was at a record high level during the war, savings in the hands of the community rose from £239,000,000 to £660,000,000. I should like to hear some honorable members opposite attempt to reconcile the contention that taxation is destroying incentive with this consistent tendency of savings to rise. Not only has the amount of savings risen spectacularly, but the number of depositors trebled during the war, thus indicating that there was an increased number of people able to save. </para><para>The major points in the budget speech have been covered adequately in this debate, and I turn finally to the expenditure which we may envisage because of the new constitutional powers conferred on the Government. I refer, not to direct money payments which the honorable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blain)</inline> termed 'vote-buying", but to disbursements under the authority granted to the Government to institute pharmaceutical, medical and dental services. </para><continue>
