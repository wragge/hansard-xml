                        <para>- I preface my question to the Postmaster-General by saying that I am receiving at my office many complaints from dissatisfied constituents in the Kingsford Smith electorate about the exorbitant charges imposed by the Postmaster-General's Department for rental and installation of telephones. Will the Minister have these charges thoroughly investigated with a view to making worthwhile reductions? Will he also direct that rental charges be discontinued since it is claimed that the cost of a telephone is covered by the original installation charge?</para>

                        <para>- Installation charges and rentals for telephones were inquired into during the preparation of the last Budget and the charges currently made were decided on by the Government at that time. I have intimated quite clearly to honorable members that at  the time the Postmaster-General's Department was incurring an annual loss of telephone services because revenue from charges was not enough to meet capital costs and depreciation plus the cost of maintenance. If I remember correctly, a telephone was costing something like £57 annually and the average return was £50, leaving the Department with a loss of £7 on every telephone, both business and private, being installed. I do not hold out any hope of a reduction in telephone charges.</para>

                        <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Health. I ask: Has he seen a suggestion made in a letter to the "Australian Medical Journal " that the names of antidotes for poisons be listed on poison containers? Will he consider implementing legislation to make this compulsory? If this is not within the Minister's power,  will he endeavour to persuade each of the State Governments to take this action at the earliest possible moment, as such a procedure could be the means of saving many lives that would otherwise be lost?</para>

                        <para>- I saw the letter to which the honorable member has referred. The labelling of containers of poisonous substances is within the jurisdiction of the Stale Governments, and the States enact their own laws on the subject. At present, all have in force regulations that have been introduced to ensure that the antidotes for certain poisons, at least, if there are any specific antidotes, are stated on the labels of containers, together with advice that a victim of poisoning be taken to a doctor for treatment at the earliest possible opportunity. All poisons are not covered in this direction and in most cases there are not specific antidotes. However, I will see that further investigations are made into this matter to ascertain whether the suggestions made by the honorable member can be carried out.</para>

                        <para>- I do not want to make this look like a Dorothy Dixer, but the honorable member was courteous enough yesterday to tell me that this matter was exercising his mind. The answer is this: The Commonwealth has not discriminated against Tasmania in any way in its grants for technical colleges. Tasmania is receiving equal treatment with the other States in the grants for technical facilities in schools which were announced at the 1963 election and were subsequently given legislative form. During this financial year, under this scheme the Commonwealth has paid to Tasmania £167,100 towards the total construction programme estimated by the State to cost £285,000. I do  not know how much of this money has actually been spent, but clearly the Commonwealth has more than matched what the State itself is doing in the way of capital facilities in technical colleges this year. The Commonwealth will provide the same amount of  money for this purpose in each of the next two financial years.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As to the proposals I announced to the House last week for the development of tertiary colleges based on technical colleges, the Commonwealth is prepared to assist Tasmania in exactly the same way as any other State. However, it is true that no  Tasmanian technical college was included in the list of colleges recommended by the  Martin Committee on the Future of Tertiary Education in Australia for interim capital grants during 1965 and 1966. Presumably the Committee did not have before it any specific proposals for capital works in technical education at the tertiary level in Tasmania, which could be put to construction quickly.</para>

                        <para>- I address my question to the Treasurer. I refer to the recent decision to increase bank interest rates. In the past it has been the policy of the Government to request that interest rates affecting export industries should not alter. Is the Treasurer aware that bank interest for new loans to rural and export industries can  now be 7t per cent.? Did he make representations to keep those interest charges down? If so, what happened to these representations?</para>

                        <para>- It has been explained from time to time in this place that the Government gives priority of consideration to the export industries. The Government's views are conveyed to the banking system through the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia.  I had an analysis taken out of the loans made to various categories of borrowers. It showed that the rural borrower stands in a preferred position. That does not mean that  all rural borrowers borrow at the same rate of interest or that there is no movement in rates as the general rates move up or down. The purposes for which rural people borrow vary, too. Those variations are reflected in the rates. Broadly speaking, the policy of the Government continues to be one of preference for borrowings by people on the land for export purposes.</para>

During the recent Senate election, particularly in Victoria, there was much criticism of the long delay in finalising the count and the calculations involved. In this modern age, where computers are being used for all types of counting and calculations, will the Government consider introducing computers into our electoral system?</para>

                        <para>- I have noted some of the comments that have appeared in the newspapers and I have asked the Commonwealth Electoral Office to keep me informed on trends in the use of computers. It would not be impossible to use computers in a Senate count, but I doubt whether there is much advantage to be gained from their use. We might be able to clip two or three days off the time that is taken. To use computers, first of all one has to transfer the preferences of the voters from the ballot papers to punch cards. The punch cards are then used to transfer that information on to tapes. Then the tapes are fed into the computers, which do the calculations. The Commonwealth Electoral Office has made studies of this  subject. It has been calculated that about 4,000 girl-days would be needed to transfer  the preferences from the ballot papers on to the punch cards. So one can see that  quite a lot is involved in getting the information into the computer.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>If it were possible to have voting machines, we could short-circuit the operation by not needing to have girls put the information on to punch cards. The information would go on to the punch cards automatically, straightaway. However, the countries in which voting machines are used do not use the preferential voting system; they use the first past the post system. Even if we were to use voting machines, I point out that there are 10,000 polling places throughout Australia and many of them would need to have more than one machine. So we can see that a large number of machines would be needed and a great deal of money would have to be spent on installing all of the machines.</para>
                    <para>However, I do not think that we should just let the matter go at that. Sooner or later we probably will have some form of voting machine, some form of calculator or some  form of computer. I might add that if we did use a computer in a Senate election we could use the Hare-Clark system of voting, and then we could do the calculations to the nth degree. My Department is looking into this matter further and is getting all the available information for me. In a few years' time, or maybe many years hence, we  might have voting machines and computers.</para>

                        <para>- The honorable member correctly cites the facts when he says that I gave an
              assurance during the course of the discussion of the legislation last year that
              opportunity would be provided to interested or affected persons to make their views
              known to the Government in the interval between last year's session and this
              session so that we could consider any further amendment of the legislation which
              experience might show to be desirableMuch work has been done in relation to
              representations which have reached us from a variety of organizations and individuals.
              Quite recently I received a very representative deputation from taxpayer organizations
              and accountancy bodies, and I have received, as has the Commissioner of Taxation,
              representations from various organizations from all parts of Australia. The
              representations have been sifted through and weighed by the Commissioner and will
              shortly be in a form which can be considered by a committee of the Cabinet and later,
              of course, by Cabinet as a whole. Following that, no doubt there will be some amending
              legislation to come before the Parliament. I question whether it will be possible to
              introduce amendments before the end of this session. I am working towards that goal,
              but I utter the cautionary word that we may have to wait until the Budget session to
              deal with the matter finally. However, I can assure the honorable member that the
              process is well advanced. If any further representations are to reach us I hope they
              will do so speedily.</para>

                        <para>- Has the Minister for the Army given any consideration to the proposal that the
              Army should erect Army staff dwellings on the foreshores of a section of Middle
              Harbour, Sydney? Does he know that this proposal has met with widespread disapproval

              disfigurement of the natural beauty of Sydney Harbour involved in the proposal? Does

                        <para>- The answer to the last part of the honorable gentleman's question is "
              No ". There is a definite requirement for many Army installations in capital
              cities, not only for local defence purposes but also to meet the needs of armed forces
              personnel who must of necessity be from, and be stationed, in our capital cities. The
              other part of the honorable gentleman's question relates specifically to a
              proposal to build some Army houses at Middle Head and other places. Careful
              consideration has been given to the views of the bodies mentioned by the honorable
              gentleman. In particular, attention has been given to the view that building on these
              parts of Sydney Harbour detract from what might be regarded as the beauty of the area
              and a national heritage. On that point I might say that it is precisely because these
              areas have been reserved so long for defence purposes that they have been retained in
              their present state. As to the specific matter in question, it is proposed to build on
              Middle Head no more than 27 houses in three separate groups. One group will replace
              some extremely unsightly temporary houses that have been there for a long time. After
              carefully considering the situation I am convinced that the building of these houses
              will have little, if any, effect on the overall appearance of the foreshore of Sydney
              Harbour in that area. The houses are part of an overall programme agreed upon by the
              Government last year to eliminate the waiting list for houses for Service personnel.
              The particular contract contemplates the building of 80 houses to meet the needs of
              Army personnel serving in units located north of the Harbour. It will meet the needs
              of people in this category for some time to come. I do not contemplate any
              substantial, if any, further building of houses in that area. In addition, I make this
              point in relation to Middle Head and the adjoining area: The prospects of finding
              sites for further economic building of houses, after completion of the houses
              envisaged in the current programme, are extremely small. That information should give
              an additional assurance to the people who are worried about preserving these areas in
              their natural state.</para>

Unless special circumstances exist, the Department accepts responsibility for the payment of the fees.</para>

I might say in advance that on 4th March I wrote a letter to him on this subject and I also raised it in- the House last week. I trust that the Minister can now give an answer to my question. Has the Chairman of the Australian Wool Board informed the Minister that the New China News Agency world Press release of 31st December last was wrong when it stated that the Board had protested against the arrest of the nine Chinese Communist spies in Brazil? Did the Board send any reply to the cable from Peking asking it to protest? If so, will the Minister place on the table of the Library the reply to the cable sent to the Board? If the Board did not send any reply, will it take action against the New China News Agency which is now established in Queens Road, Melbourne?  </para>

                        <para>- My question to the Postmaster-General refers to the introduction of colour television into Australia. Has the Minister noted a statement by a member of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board that the Board will recommend to him whichever system of colour television is chosen for use in Britain? Will the Minister avoid repetition of the lack of planning that has resulted in such inept use of the frequency spectrum as to deprive Australians of the joy of frequency modulation broadcasting and has constricted available channels? Will he try to infuse new life into the Board and require it to discharge its obligations properly by making its own full investigation and recommending whichever system is best suited to Australian conditions? These may well be vastly different from those of Britain.</para>

                        <para>I understand that a statement was made by Mr. Mair, who until Monday last was a member of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. No recommendation has come to me from the
 Board on the introduction of colour television, and from conversations that I have had with the Chairman of the Board from time to time I do not expect to receive any advice on the introduction of colour television for a long while in the future. In relation to frequency modulation broadcasting I inform the honorable member that two or three years ago the Government set up an advisory committee under the chairmanship of Professor Huxley. That committee made its report and the Government accepted its recommendations.  A statement setting out the decision of the Government was made by my predecessor, Sir Charles Davidson, early in 1963, and during the latter part of last year I again made a statement on this matter. A copy of both statements would be available to the honorable member, or to any honorable member, if he cared to call at my office.</para>

                        <para>- Protests about this programme have been directed to me, and in two or three cases to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, but I believe that more particularly they have been directed to the stations which telecast the programme and to the sponsors of the programme. The matter has been under consideration by the Board which has offered no advice to me at this stage. It is, I think, substantially a Board responsibility, or more particularly, a responsibility of the stations concerned. I might make the comment that the programme is telecast in Melbourne on an abridged basis compared with the telecast which goes out in Sydney and Brisbane and perhaps other places.</para>

              variety of fuels in Australia, and also in view of the uncertainty about the future of
              imports of oil from Indonesia following the recent decision of that country with
              respect to American oil interests, has the Government considered formulating a
              national fuel policy as a firm guide to decision, action and priorities in the future?
              If 20 per cent, of Australia's oil supplies comes from Indonesia as statistics
              indicate, has the Government investigated alternative sources of oil if supplies
              should happen to be cut from that country in the near or distant future?</para>

                        <para>- My question, which is addressed to the Minister for External Affairs, refers to
              the fact that the bomb exploded yesterday from a car parked outside the United States
              Embassy in Saigon was not of a nuclear type. Is the Minister aware of any good reason
              why this bomb was not of a nuclear type other than the very cogent reason that
              Communist China does not yet have a nuclear bomb available for its agents in various
              countries?</para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable member will appreciate that any answer to his question
              would be, to some extern, speculative. I would assume that, in this act of terrorism
              against civilians, the enemy would have chosen a weapon that would be sufficient for
              the purpose that it had in mind and which also was readily available to it. The enemy
              chose a bomb which has caused loss of life and suffering to a number of civilians. I
              take it that the meaning of the honorable member's question is this: If mainland
              China had developed nuclear weapons and had a portable nuclear bomb, it would have
              been possible for that country to have made such a bomb available, and it would also
              have been possible for the bomb to be transported to the spot and exploded in which
              case, of course, the damage, the loss of life and the serious consequences would have
              been much more widespread than they would be if a conventional bomb was used.</para>

                        <para>- I address a question to the Minister for Shipping and Transport. Is Mr. R. W. Miller negotiating for the sale of his three oil tankers to the American owned shipping company National Bulk Carriers? Has Mr. Miller been forced to take this action because of
              the skulduggery indulged in by the foreign owned oil refineries in Australia, which
              deliberately withheld cargoes when Miller's tankers were available and offered
              cargoes when his tankers were fully occupied? Is this policy similar to that which was
              pursued in the United States of America by Standard Oil some years ago, when that
              company owned or controlled almost all of the rail cars in that country? Did that
              policy finally result in the Standard Oil organisation having substantial fines
              imposed on it by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which controls restrictive trade
              practices in the United States? What action does the Government propose to take to
              protect Australian coastal tankers against unfair tactics? In the event of
              Miller's tankers being sold and being withdrawn from the Australian coastal trade,
              will the Minister instruct the Australian National Line to purchase tankers for this
              trade and in that way protect Australia's overseas balances, ensure employment for
              Australian seamen and remove the previous unfair competition between coal and oil?</para>

              the oil companies of unfair tactics, will be interested to know that R. W. Miller and
              Co. Pty. Ltd. made a very handsome profit from its tankers, which enabled it to
              increase its dividends. That is shown in the balance sheet which was published in the

                    <para>I would remind the House that the Department of Shipping and Transport recently appeared in conciliation proceedings before Mr. Justice  Gallagher and made a clear statement of the policy which it has followed in granting permits to tankers, other than Australian flag tankers, to operate on the Australian coast. The parties appeared to be reasonably satisfied with the policy being followed and, as a result, Miller's claim was adjourned sine die. I think that fact, together with the profits made by Miller's tankers in the period of less than 12 months during which they have been operating on the coast, provide the best evidence that the Department is pursuing a very fair policy in connection with Australian flag tankers.</para>

If this is true, can the Minister enlarge on the subject? I have in mind secondary industries in decentralised areas which at present are producing industrial components with skill and efficiency.  Would an application to the Government for financial assistance for such secondary industries to extend their production of equipment required for defence and for Australian development be given sympathetic consideration?</para>

As with primary industry, I am sure the Government would give careful consideration to any proposal to assist industrial research of various kinds. The honorable gentleman has referred to an occasion when I was dealing with the state of the electronics industry in particular. Modern electronic techniques do not find very much application in civilian equipment, but they are needed for military equipment. If we are to develop these kinds of techniques, we must issue either developmental  contracts or contracts for equipment embodying these principles. However, support for secondary industries in country areas depends not so much on research and development  as on product development and production expansion. These are not appropriate subjects for action by the Government.</para>

                            - The two reports 1 am tabling emanate from the Third Commonwealth Education
              Conference, held in Ottawa from 21st August to 4th September 1964. The first is the
              official report of the Conference proceedings, as approved by the delegates of member
              nations represented. The second is the report of the Australian delegation which was
              led by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Allen</inline>
                            Brown, Deputy High Commissioner
              to the United Kingdom. Honorable members may recall that the first Commonwealh
              Education Conference - the foundational one - was held at Oxford in 1959 and the
              second at New Delhi in 1962. The fourth Conference will be held in Nigeria late in
              1967 or early in 1968. We have hopes that the fifth Conference will be held in
              Australia. The Conferences are of course not just isolated meetings. They are the
              periodic points of review of the Commonwealth Co-operation in Education Scheme.
              Essentially the principle behind the Scheme is the sharing of education facilities
              among Commonwealth countries for the purpose of strengthening Commonwealth ties and
              improving educational standards. One aspect of it - the Commonwealth Scholarship and
              Fellowship Plan - provides opportunities for good students to study in an interesting
              variety of Commonwealth countries, as it has attracted not only the older members, but
              also many of the newer ones in Asia, Africa and the West Indies to offer awards. The
              number of scholarships available amounts to over 1,000 altogether. The greater part of
              the Scheme, however, concerns help from the older countries to the new and to promote
              the development of education. As Australian assistance of this kind is available to
              Commonwealth countries in Asia under the broader provisions of the Colombo Plan, this
              Scheme, as far as Australia is concerned, is directed towards non-Asian, principally
              African, members.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start></continue><para>Australian assistance under this Scheme is of three main types. First, provision is
            made for the supply of a small number of Australian educationalists to fill key posts in
            the education systems of developing countries. There are 15 of these serving overseas at
            present in positions involving teacher training, inspection and supervision, the
            establishment of new technical courses, the introduction of correspondence courses and
            the like. Second, arrangements are made for educationalists holding positions of
            responsibility in developing countries to visit Australia for a few months to study
            Australian educational institutions and practices in fields related to their own
            responsibilities. Thirteen such people are at present visiting Australia. Third, awards
            are provided to enable teachers and other educationalists from developing countries to
            undertake short courses, mainly a year in length, which will equip them to specialise in
            a particular field of education or increase their competence in a field in which they
            have already specialised to some extent. In the past few weeks 60 teachers have arrived
            in Australia to commence courses of the kind and a further 15 are expected in May.</para><para>The training needs of these teachers are often very different from those of the
            normal Australian teacher trainee, because of differences in their background of
            experience and previous training. Frequently special programmes have to be designed for
            them, either individually or in groups. One such programme is the course for the
            Certificate in Education for Overseas Teachers which commenced last year at the
            University of Queensland and provided concentrated training for people who are or will
            be teachers' college staff in developing Commonwealth countries. Another, which has
            been designed by the Western Australian Education Department and begins in May, will
            give training in the principles and techniques of school inspection. In addition, a
            special course mainly in infant teaching method is at present being conducted in Sydney
            at the request of the Uganda Government for 30 primary teachers. The expenses of this
            course are being met jointly by the Uganda Government and the Australian Government.
            Honorable members will realise that such activities cannot be carried out without the
            co-operation of the State Departments of Education and the universities and I am happy
            to say that their support has at all times been most generously given.</para><para>I might now say a few words about the main points of interest for Australia at the
            Ottawa Education Conference. Australia promised a 50 per cent, increase in its
            activities under the Scheme, principally, as</para><para class="block">I have explained, on teacher training activities. It was thus
            gratifying that the Conference found teacher training to be an area in which the
            greatest need lay. While for a time many of the teachers needed by developing countries
            will have to be recruited from overseas, the Conference emphasised that every country
            should aim to reach as soon as possible the point where it could recruit and train
            enough teachers for its entire teaching force from among its own people.</para><para>Other matters regarded by the Conference a$ of major importance were cooperative
            action aimed at reducing illiteracy among adults, and the development of technical
            education, especially the training of technicians. No expansion in the Commonwealth
            Scholarship and Fellowship Plan was recommended but it was agreed that the Plan was
            working well and had achieved a high prestige. Some thought was given, however, to ways
            in which the plan might be used to stimulate university growth amongst the less
            developed countries.</para><para>
                        In conclusion,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline>
                        would point out that
            Commonwealth Co-operation in Education is not the only education aid Australia gives to
            developing countries. Besides the Colombo Plan there is also the scheme known as the
            Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan, and the system of Australian International
            Awards provides scholarships to countries not covered by other schemes.

                            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                            the Opposition does not in any way
              oppose this Bill, which is very specialised and very narrow in scope. It will merely
              extend the bounty year in which bounty can be paid on the production of raw cotton in
              Australia beyond the calendar year, as at present provided, to 28th February. This is
              to be done because the annual season within which cotton is grown, ginned and sold
              does not end conveniently at the conclusion of the calendar year so as to allow the
              bounty to be paid by the end of the calendar year. I suppose that we could have some
              kind of debate on the technical and geographic reasons for the spreading of the cotton
              season beyond the end of the calendar year, but I think that there would be little or
              no profit for the House in such a discussion. As the Bill is so narrow and so
              restricted in its scope I will not endeavour to be irrelevant by discussing the cotton
              industry as a whole in Australia. Had the Government desired the House to discuss
              these matters, undoubtedly the second reading speech delivered by the Minister for
              Housing
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bury),</inline>
                            who represents the Minister
              for Customs and Excise
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Anderson),</inline>
                            would
              have told us something about the development of the cotton industry in Australia. The
              Minister might have spoken about the Ord River scheme and he might have given us some
              indication of the progress and development of cotton in this country, but he has not
              done so. Therefore, I propose to follow his lead, and I shall not be irrelevant to the
              extent of discussing the industry. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill.

                            .- I support this measure, which tidies up the arrangement for paying a bounty to
              cotton growers. However, unlike the honorable member for Yarra
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. J. F. Cairns),</inline>
                            I do not think that this is a
              measure that can be dismissed in a few words. The cotton industry in Australia is an
              extremely valuable primary industry. This piece of legislation is small in scope,
              certainly, but it is the forerunner of many other pieces of legislation dealing with
              an industry which is destined to develop in Australia as time goes by.

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The cotton industry, as we know it now in Australia, is only four years old. It is
            true that we grew cotton as far back as the American civil war when we had 12,000 acres
            of cotton under cultivation, but between that time and the early 1960's very little
            progress was made with the growing of cotton. Certainly some cotton was grown in
            isolated parts - in the Dawson Valley and in various other parts of Australia under dry
            farming conditions - but we never achieved a very great yield and we never had a
            properly co-ordinated and fully operated cotton industry. In 1961 two American growers
            came to Wee Waa, a town which is in north-western New South Wales and in my electorate.
            The American growers, who were experienced and competent men, came there as a result of
            work which was done by two residents of that area. The first was a Hungarian agronomist
            who conducted extensive experiments on cotton growing in the Wee Waa district and
            produced some quite remarkable results. The second was the editor of the local
            newspaper, the "North Western Courier" at Narrabri, who publicised the results
            of those experiments.</para>
                    <para>
                        As a result of the publicity the Americans, who lived in the cotton growing district
            of California, heard about the work done by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Derera</inline>
                        in the Narrabri-Wee Waa district and decided to up stakes and come out
            to Australia. They had a good look around before deciding on the Wee Waa district as
            being the perfect district for growing cotton, and in the first year, 1961, they put
            down 65 acres. The results of that first year were so satisfactory that they not only
            increased their acreage substantially in the following year but also succeeded in
            attracting to the area a large number of other cotton growers from the United States and
            some Australian growers. The result is that now the Narrabri-Wee Waa area produces half
            the cotton grown in Australia and is destined to go on until it grows perhaps three
            times as much as is presently being grown. That will meet about half of Australia's
            demand for cotton, which runs now at about 120,000 bales.
                    </para>
                    <para>I expect that within very few years the Narrabri-Wee Waa area will supply at least
            half of that amount of cotton and that it will be grown under ideal conditions. It is
            true that before we can achieve that desirable end many hurdles must be overcome. For
            example, we must develop a perfect seed and a perfect variety of cotton for the
            district, and we must know more about the requirements of the soil. We must know what
            trace elements are needed, what amount of nitrogen is needed and various technical
            matters of that kind. These matters, I am quite sure, will be overcome. They have been
            overcome successfully up to date because we have seen a progressive increase not only of
            acreage but of yield from this area.</para>
                    <para>
                        It is also true to say that other parts of Australia can produce cotton quite
            successfully. We see it being grown in the Ord River district, in the Murrumbidgee area
            of New South Wales and more extensively nowadays under irrigation in Queensland. But of
            the districts that can grow cotton, not all can grow it as economically or efficiently
            as the northern parts of New South Wales. For example, the cost of production on the Ord
            River must be many times the cost of production in northern New South Wales and costs
            will always be a handicap to growers in north western Australia. But wherever cotton is
            grown in Australia, it is plain that sooner or later we will have an exportable surplus
            of this commodity. That will provide a very welcome change from the present time when we
            have to spend about
                        <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline>
                        million of very
            precious capital on importing cotton from overseas.
                    </para>
                    <para>The story of cotton, especially in northern New South Wales, would not be complete
            if I did not mention one particular feature of development in that area. Following the
            success of the independent farmers, Messrs. Kahl and Hadley, who came here from
            California in 1961, more Americans have come to Australia and established themselves as
            independent farmers. In addition, more Australian farmers have settled in the district.
            There are now about 30 American and several Australian farmers in that area, and this
            flow of individual and independent farmers into the district has continued and has
            increased in tempo. About a year ago the Government of New South Wales allowed a big
            American company, one of the largest in the world, to establish a branch on an estate in
            the Narrabri area. This large concern holds some 7,500 acres in that area. The company
            has worked its holding as one estate and has had accorded to it by the Government of New
            South Wales water rights for the whole of that area, which means that it can hold three
            times as much land and still farm effectively and efficiently.</para>
                    <para>
                        The arrangement that the New South Wales Government has entered into with this
            concern is a very unusual one, to say the least. I do not propose to probe it very
            extensively other than to say that, at some unspecified time in the future,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Renshaw,</inline>
                        the Premier of New South Wales who made this
            arrangement, proposes that the American proprietors will grant rights to working lessees
            for the area. These working lessees,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Renshaw</inline>
                        said, will be given an assured annual income, irrespective of results, plus a percentage
            of the profit on the working lessees' land. In other words, these working lessees
            will be nothing more than employees of the American company; they will not even be
            tenants. This is a remarkable thing for a Labour government to do.
                    </para>
                    <para>In this House the week before last we heard members of the Opposition make
            accusations that the Federal Government was encouraging American capital to come to
            Australia to buy out Australian resources. Yet in New South Wales, under a Labour
            Government, we see exactly that situation. Labour's deeds and Labour's words do
            not coincide. In New South Wales Labour has sold a large tract of country and a large
            area of valuable resources to an American concern. The profits from that undertaking
            will be remitted to the United States. About 20 Australian or American farmers will be
            denied an opportunity to settle independently in the area. The progress of the district
            will be handicapped.</para>
                    <para>It is an axiom that foreign or absentee ownership of property is not a desirable
            pattern. Over the years we have worked to achieve the settlement of individual farmers -
            men who will live permanently on the land, men who will spend their money locally, men
            who will sink their savings back into the land in order to develop it. But in the
            Narrabri-Wee Waa area of New South Wales we have a complete contradiction of that.
            Americans have been granted valuable water rights for 7,500 acres of land. I am informed
            that they will have rights to one-eighth of the water available from the Keep it Dam
            storage. They will not develop the area in the way that private ownership of that land
            would allow. As I have said, the profits will be remitted to the United States. If the
            land is ever sold to Australians for settlement, it will be sold at a very handsome
            profit as a fully developed and going concern.</para>
                    <para>This matter should be brought out into the open. It puts the truth about
            Labour's stand in perspective. Members of the Opposition attack the Commonwealth
            Government for selling Australian resources, whereas their own colleagues in New South
            Wales do even worse than that; they do great damage to the principle of
            decentralisation. That is the position in relation to the settlement of the American
            company in the Narrabri area. The position is misunderstood by many people because many
            red herrings have been drawn across the trail. It is unfortunate - in fact, it is
            deplorable - that the quiet development of the Narrabri-Wee Waa area, by independent
            farmers settling and working their own land, should have been halted or interfered with
            by this action of the New South Wales Government.</para>
                    <para>I support this measure. As I said, it is a machinery measure which is destined to be
            the forerunner of many other measures associated with the establishment of a large and
            prosperous cotton industry in Australia. If the cotton industry can be soundly based on
            the results of co-operative effort by independent farmers, that will be so much the
            better for Australia as a whole and for the principle of decentralisation, to which some
            political parties pay lip service but which they do nothing to encourage.</para>

                            .- I wish to address a few remarks to this Bill, particularly as it affects
              Queensland and my electorate of Dawson. Until just recently, Queensland was the major,
              if not the only, producer of cotton in Australia, and 85 per cent, of the cotton
              produced in Queensland is produced in the Dawson and Callide Valleys, in my
              electorate. The Raw Cotton Bounty Bill 1963 was introduced for the purpose of
              extending assistance to the Australian cotton industry for a period of five years.
              Previously the Cotton Bounty Act guaranteed an average price of 14d. per lb. on seed
              cotton until 31st December 1963. The 1963 Bill, which was introduced by the Minister
              for Primary Industry
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Adermann),</inline>
                            made some
              very important changes in the manner in which assistance was provided. Instead of the
              bounty being based on seed cotton, it was based on raw cotton according to quality,
              with a rate of a little more than 16d. per lb. as a basic rate and consequential
              adjustments depending on whether the quality of the cotton was higher or lower than
              average.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In my opinion, this is a good, common sense approach to improving the production of
            cotton of high quality with a long staple length, which is the primary requirement of
            the Australian spinners. This quality approach has been the fundamental basis of most
            primary industries in Australia. It is the reason for the remarkable success of the
            industry with which I am so closely associated - the raw sugar industry. That industry
            has bought and sold both cane and sugar on that basis for many decades. There is no
            doubt that that has been the major reason for the tremendous leap forward in efficiency
            which has occurred in this leading home and export industry, the sugar industry.</para>
                    <para>Until recent years most of the cotton produced in Australia was produced in
            Queensland, and particularly in my electorate of Dawson. The centre of the cotton
            growing industry is a small town called Biloela. At the moment it is also the home town
            of the great Moura coal field and of the great Calcap power station and the Callide Dam,
            which are now in the course of construction. However, cotton is still one of the most
            important enterprises based on Biloela. Production in that area and other areas in the
            Dawson and Callide Valleys in my electorate comprises approximately 85 per cent, of the
            Queensland output.</para>
                    <para>There is no doubt in my mind - 1 do not think there is any doubt in the minds of all
            the technical advisers - that the future of cotton is based on adequate irrigation
            facilities. In my electorate a start has been made already in this field, although only
            on a comparatively small scale. In the shire of Banana, surrounding Biloela, about 3,000
            acres are under irrigation at present. In addition, about 20,000 acres are being used to
            grow cotton by dry farming methods. That area is being irrigated progressively, with the
            help of underground water; but construction of large surface dams is also required. This
            can occur only with the help of the State and Commonwealth Governments. A large
            irrigation scheme should be established on the Dawson River to keep this prosperous
            industry going. I recommend that the Commonwealth Government in particular should go
            forward with the provision of more surface irrigation schemes in this area. I have been
            informed that one of the future projects which the Snowy Mountains Authority will tackle
            is the irrigation potential of the Dawson Valley.</para>
                    <para>A further important step to be taken is the establishment of a ginnery close to the
            cotton growing areas. This must be done, because the value of such a provision has been
            proven wherever cotton has been grown. So it is pleasing to note that the Queensland
            Cotton Marketing Board has purchased land close to Biloela as a site for a cotton
            ginnery. However, it is important that the bounty be continued until the industry gets
            properly under way and well on its feet. It gives me great heart, as it might do to all
            cotton growers in my electorate, that the Bill indicates that the Government intends to
            press forward with its policy of helping cotton growers until the end of the five-year
            period and beyond it to February of the following year.</para>
                    <para>Although other parts of Australia have become cotton producing areas, the Dawson and
            Callide Valleys still rank high as cotton producers, and many of the residents depend on
            this important crop for their livelihood. The last official figures I could obtain
            relating to cotton production are contained in the Queensland " Hand Book " for
            1964. They disclose that the acreage sown to cotton in Australia in 1962-63 totalled
            37,700, of which 35,300 acres were in Queensland and 2,400 acres in New South Wales.
            Figures of the acreages in Victoria and Western Australia were not available for
            publication. In that year New South Wales cotton production totalled 3 million lb. and
            Queensland production 13 million lb. I quote these figures to show the important place
            Queensland occupies in the growing cotton world and what the continued strength of the
            cotton industry means to that State's economy and particularly to the Dawson
            electorate.</para>
                    <para>
                        I fully realise that there have been dramatic increases in the acreages planted to
            cotton since then, particularly in New South Wales, but I have no official figures. I
            merely wish to impress upon the House the importance of cotton growing to Queensland
            generally and to my electorate particularly. This is why I have quoted figures to show
            that Queensland still ranks as a leading cotton grower in Australia. I appreciate that
            this is primarily a machinery bill, but it does indicate the Government's continuing
            support for an expanding industry. I sincerely hope that that support will continue well
            into the future. This Government's help, together with planned irrigation - again
            with Government help - and intensified research, which must come from the industry
            itself, will enable us to become a world leader in the production of this crop. 1 hope -
            along with my colleague, the honorable member for Gwydir
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Ian Allan)</inline>
                        - that in future Australia will become a cotton exporter. At
            present we are producing cotton which, outside of a drought period, is of a quality
            equal to that of cotton produced in most other countries and at a cost better than that
            of most countries and equal to that of the countries with which we will have to compete.
            I support the Government in its desire to stabilise a great and expanding industry
            further.

                        <para>.- 1 suppose that some members of the Australian Country Party may think it odd
              that a representative of a city constituency embracing such important places as
              Woollongabba and Bulimba would rise to support this Bill, but I am a tolerant
              Australian who is desirous of assisting anybody who is playing a role in developing
              Australia. It is pleasing to find members of the Australian Country Party departing
              from their traditional policy and supporting what is, in effect, a policy of
              protection. It is proposed to maintain a bounty, which is a form of protection, for
              this important industry. Cotton is a commodity which is playing an increasingly
              important role in the economic and industrial life of Australia. It is a commodity
              which provides a big field for development in our primary industry.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        I listened most attentively to the honorable member for Dawson
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Shaw),</inline>
                        who was no doubt actuated by two motives -
            first, the desire to see this industry advanced and, secondly, to speak to the
            constituents of Dawson about its importance. But I can divorce myself from the
            accusation of merely speaking to my electors on this matter. I take the role of an
            Australian wanting to see the development of an important industry. The cotton we use in
            Australia is primarily imported, coming principally from the United Arab Republic -
            Egypt in the main - the Sudan and the United States of America. It is a costly commodity
            for us to import. Figures supplied by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics
            indicate that for the seven months ended January 1965 raw cotton cost Australia over
            £5 million and in piece goods - cotton and linen - over £23 million. These are
            large figures in anybody's language - approaching £29 million - so honorable
            members can see how important it is for Australian producers to supply this commodity
            for internal consumption. The demand is very great. Queensland, as the honorable member
            for Dawson pointed out, is the principal Australian producer of cotton, but other parts
            of Australia lend themselves to great development in this regard. Cotton growing is
            being attempted in northern New South Wales. I hope that the project in that region will
            be successful. Pilot farms for the growing of cotton have been established in the Ord
            River district of Western Australia. The results from those plantings, aided by
            irrigation, have been most encouraging. If I were a Western Australian I would say that
            fantastic returns are being obtained from cotton growing on the pilot farms in the Ord
            River district.
                    </para>
                    <para>A grand opportunity exists in various parts of Australia for the development of a
            cotton growing industry. The industry need not be confined to any one State. I know that
            Australians are most generous people at heart. Recently, we decided to spend millions of
            pounds in the Indian sub-continent to help develop the Indus basin dam, which will
            enable India and Pakistan to develop their cotton growing industries. I agree with the
            honorable member for Dawson that greater consideration should be given to the
            construction of dams on rivers in northern New South Wales and in the divisions of
            Dawson and Capricornia in order to develop the cotton growing industry. Discussions
            about the use for irrigation of the waters of rivers in northern New South Wales and
            southern Queensland have been held over a long period between the Governments of New
            South Wales and Queensland. I hope that finality will be reached soon in those
            discussions and that construction of the dams will proceed.</para>
                    <para>
                        The measure is a commendable one. I do not offer any opposition to it. I hope that
            it will promote the development of this important industry. For too long Australia has
            been dependent on the export of its primary products in order to stabilise its economy.
            This is a costly matter to Australia because we are suffering at the moment, as I am
            sure you,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline>
                        will agree, from a
            recession in prices obtained for the important primary products that we export. We
            should do all we can to supply the demand of the Australian public for primary products.
            Here is an opportunity for the primary producer to produce a commodity that is sought by
            manufacturing industries in this country. All that is needed to establish on a firm
            basis the cotton growing industry in this country is for the Commonwealth to make money
            available. I hope that more measures of this kind will come before the Parliament.

                        (Mallee) [3.58J.- As honorable
            members are aware we are discussing the Raw Cotton Bounty Bill which is a bill for an
            act relating to the granting of a bounty on the production of certain raw cotton sold
            for use in Australia. The Bill was introduced on 17th March last. Today is 31st March.
            Some time has elapsed since the Bill was introduced. This is usual with bills of this
            nature. "Hansard" of 17th March contains the second reading speech made by the
            Minister for Housing
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bury),</inline>
                        in which he
            explained the Bill. Speeches made on the Bill by honorable members some weeks later will
            appear in another edition of " Hansard ". I propose to read to the House a part
            of the Minister's speech. He said -

                    <quote>
                        <para class="block">The effect of this proposed legislation would be to bring the
              commencement of the bounty year more into line with the ginning year and allow an
              additional two months in which to dispose of the season's crop. It would also
              extend the terms of the Act for a further period of two months; that is, the present
              Act will cease on 28th February 1969 in lieu of 31st December 1968.</para>

                    <para class="block">That is something that may give a little more encouragement to people
            who produce cotton or who are contemplating its production. Anything that will make the
            way easier for the people who are pioneering this industry in Australia is, I am sure,
            appreciated by all honorable members.</para>

                        T listened with great interest to two of my Australian Country Party colleagues -

                        They
            all seemed to be in agreement that more cotton should be produced in Australia and they
            gave valid reasons for holding that view. From the honorable member for Dawson, we heard
            about the great Dawson Valley. We heard about the Gwydir River. The honorable member for
            Griffith, coming as he does from a metropolitan electorate, spoke about the great
            potentialities of Queensland generally.

                        <para>- Quite unbiased. I have noticed that so far in this debate speeches have been
              made by members from New South Wales and Queensland. I do not desire to be parochial
              or biased but I remind the House of the great Murray Valley through which runs
              Australia's greatest river, the Murray, into which a great deal more water has
              flowed recently as a result of continuation of work on the Snowy Mountains project The
              stage has now been reached where, if the Murray should fall to only 20 per cent, of
              its normal flow, water from Lake Eucumbene will be diverted into the Murray to bring
              the river's flow back to normal. I mention this because in the Murray Valley are
              men who have been experimenting - some have got beyond that experimental stage - with
              cotton growing. Many have learned the hard way. Now some have mechanised cotton
              pickers. The industry in that area seems to have a bright future.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In the House, recently, I advocated that water should be carried by pipeline to
            where it is needed. Cotton must have irrigation and if we can supply the necessary
            irrigation by means of such projects as the Snowy Mountains scheme or the Chowilla Dam,
            or by piping water to areas that grow cotton prolifically, we will overcome our present
            disadvantage of having to import so much cotton. On a number of occasions I have
            advocated that we should develop certain primary industries - cotton growing is one -
            for which we have a home market, because generally speaking the home market is the best
            of all markets. If we had a well established cotton growing industry not only would we
            be able to supply our home market but we would not be forced to spend many millions of
            pounds on importing such large quantities, thereby reducing our overseas balances. If
            you export goods you build up your overseas balances and if you grow in this country
            products that formerly you imported you do not draw to the same extent on your overseas
            balances. So by producing for our home market and at the same time reducing the drain on
            our overseas balances we obtain a dual advantage. Although the Bill does not embrace all
            the matters that have been raised by honorable members it has given them an opportunity
            to place their views before the Parliament. I am glad that the Bill has the support of
            every honorable member of this Parliament.</para>

                        <para>.- On several occasions, the most recent being 15 days ago, I have had cause to
              lament the tardiness of the Department of Shipping and Transport in carrying out
              obligations which the Australian Government has undertaken with other countries under
              international conventions. On this occasion I am happy to note and to applaud the
              relative speed with which the Department is carrying out its obligations. In fact, it
              appears that the Commonwealth will be in a position to benefit from the Convention
              once the necessary number of countries has ratified it.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>When the principal Act was before us in April 1960, I pointed out that it sought to
            implement, as far as the Commonwealth thought it could do so itself, the terms of an
            international convention drawn up in 1954. The convention had come into operation in
            July 1958. The Government took the first steps to investigate the position as it
            affected Australia in 1959. The Commonwealth Act was passed through both Houses in May
            1960. The Commonwealth then adopted the attitude, as it still does, that it was
            necessary to have complementary acts passed by the six States. The States passed acts
            between November 1960, when Western Australia and New South Wales did so, and November
            1961, when South Australia did so. I have not checked whether the Commonwealth had
            ordinances made in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. At all
            events, the Commonwealth deposited its acceptance in August 1962 and was able to derive
            the benefits of the convention three months later. After a lapse extending from July
            1958 until November 1962, the Commonwealth at last, by this cumbersome procedure of
            complementary legislation, was able to secure the benefits of the convention.</para>
                    <para>On this occasion, the Parliament is being asked to pass a law to implement the 1962
            amendments to the 1954 convention. The amendments will come into force when 20 countries
            have ratified them. At the moment 13 countries have ratified them. Accordingly, we are
            well in time to obtain the benefits of the convention if the States pass their
            complementary legislation as quickly as they did on the last occasion.</para>
                    <para>
                        Perhaps I might go into some further detail on the necessity for complementary
            legislation, because the Minister for Shipping and Transport
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Freeth)</inline>
                        referred to my remarks of 15 days ago in his second reading
            speech on this Bill. He pointed out that there had been and always should be harmony and
            co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States in policing regulations on the
            pollution of the sea. I think we need to look at this proposition a little more closely.
            Is it necessary for the Commonwealth and the States all to pass laws in order to carry
            out international obligations? My own predilection is, I frankly confess, for the
            Commonwealth to carry out the international obligations by itself, if it can. The powers
            of the Commonwealth Parliament can be greatly augmented under the external affairs power
            in the Constitution. If the Commonwealth enters into an international treaty or
            convention, usually it has the power to implement that treaty or convention itself. When
            the principal Act was before us five years ago I expressed the view that the Government
            was being too timid in carrying out its obligations and taking advantage of its
            opportunities under the Constitution. In view of the two civil aviation decisions given
            by the High Court in the -last 12 months, I am convinced that the Commonwealth
            Government is too timid in carrying out these obligations.
                    </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth has the opportunity and it has the responsibility. Only the
            Commonwealth can be represented at an international conference. Only the Commonwealth
            can deal with other nations at a conference or in correspondence. State Governments
            cannot do so. They have no international standing. They are not recognised by other
            national governments. So, even if one believes it is desirable that the States should
            pass complementary legislation, the fact is that they cannot participate in the
            international legislative process; only the Commonwealth Government can speak on behalf
            of Australia.</para>
                    <para>The Minister's attitude seems to infer a doubt whether States will carry out
            their obligations under the law unless they participate in passing the acts in
            Australia. I do not think we should make that aspersion about the State Governments. If
            the Commonwealth Parliament, using its authority under the external affairs provision,
            makes" a law, we should assume that the States will carry out that law. Federalism
            already involves too much procrastination and duplication. We should not promote that
            process unnecessarily.</para>
                    <para>This convention well illustrates how the Commonwealth and the States between them
            could not obtain the benefits which the Commonwealth, and only the Commonwealth, can
            obtain by an international arrangement. Wherever one may believe that Commonwealth and
            State jurisdictions may overlap, dovetail or end along our coast, nobody has suggested
            that any of the Governments, singly or jointly, could exercise jurisdiction 50 or 150
            miles oft the coast. Under this Convention Australia can have benefits for 150 miles off
            her coast. We can see that ships do not befoul Australian waters, not just for the 50
            miles which applies off most coasts, but, except from Thursday Island west to Port
            Hedland, for 150 miles. Accordingly, it is very greatly to Australia's advantage to
            ratify this Convention. This is a splendid illustration of the advantages which a
            country can obtain only by an international convention. The Commonwealth can obtain
            promptly and fully secure these benefits by itself passing laws under the external
            affairs power. We should assume that the States would be perfectly willing to cooperate
            with the Commonwealth in implementing a law which the Commonwealth - so the High Court
            now reaffirms - is entitled to make by itself.</para>
                    <para>I referred 15 days ago to another convention on which the Minister and his
            colleagues have taken the attitude that complementary legislation should be passed. It
            is the 1957 International Convention relating to the Limitation of the Liability of
            Owners of Sea-going Ships. If we adopt the attitude that the States should share in the
            legislation necessary to implement this Convention, then we must recognise that State
            laws on its subject matter will not take effect until the British Government has given
            its approval to them. The Constitutional Review Committee referred to this general
            problem in its report of November 1959. I have referred, on the last occasion in
            debating the Seamen's Compensation Bill in November last, to the precise position
            which had arisen in Australia in the " Birchgrove Park " tragedy. The liability
            of owners for compensation or damages to the relatives of persons who lose their lives
            at sea, or to persons who are injured at sea, is calculated on the basis of a certain
            number of pounds per ton of the ship. The sum so calculated is then divided by the
            victims, and the amount they can get is subject to the dividend so resulting. The State
            Parliaments are limited by the British Merchant Shipping Act of 1894. It is possible for
            the State Parliaments to pass laws giving better rights to a person bereaved or injured
            in an accident at sea, but the laws which they pass have no effect until the British
            Government confirms them under section 735 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.</para>
                    <para>
                        From an answer which the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert
              Menzies)</inline>
                        gave me on 17th March, it transpires that no State laws relating to
            this subject have been confirmed by the British Government. In the " Birchgrove Park
            " case it was accepted that the relatives could not usefully sue for damages since
            the ships were so small, and the victims so numerous, that the damages would have been
            limited to a few hundred pounds. In the end, without admitting that they were liable to
            pay the amounts, the ship owners paid the amounts set out in the State Workers'
            Compensation Act. lt will be remembered that the ship was operating between one port and
            another within New South Wales. The Prime Minister's reply to my question informed
            me that the State Workers' Compensation Act was not confirmed by the British
            Government. No other such State act has ever been confirmed by the British Government.
            Accordingly, there is a complete curb on the damages or compensation. Certainly, the
            limit to the damages or compensation which can be secured by persons who are injured, or
            by persons who lose breadwinners, in accidents to ships trading between ports in the one
            State, is very low. The Commonwealth Parliament oan only pass laws which concern ships
            trading between States, within Territories, and between States and Territories or, if
            they are registered in Australia, ships trading with other countries. This Convention
            gives the Commonwealth power to apply the 1957 scale, as against the 1894 scale, to
            persons so bereaved or injured.
                    </para>
                    <para>If the Government persists in the attitude it has adopted, that complementary State
            legislation is necessary to implement this 1957 Convention, then we must face the
            situation that we require, first, a Commonwealth act, secondly, six State acts, and
            thirdly, British confirmation of those six State acts. It is true that the British
            Parliament in 1958 applied the 1957 scale. That is to say, it increased the amount for
            personal loss from £15 to £73 and for property loss from £8 to £24.
            But it applied the increase to ships in Britain. The British Government can make orders
            applying the scale to any British colonies such as the Australian States; it has not
            done so. The Australian States can pass laws which will take effect if the British
            Government confirms them under the 1894 Act. They have not done so. Accordingly, I
            suggest that this other international convention in the maritime field, on which the
            Government believes it must have complementary legislation, should be looked at afresh.</para>
                    <para>It is true that this Convention is not yet in force. It comes into force when it is
            ratified by ten States of which at least five have a tonnage equal or superior to one
            million gross tons. The Convention so far has been ratified by France, Britain, Spain,
            Ghana, Sweden, Algeria and Finland. That information was given to me last November.
            There may have been some subsequent ratifications. I imagine that of those nations
            France, Britain and Sweden, at all events, and maybe Spain, own ships with a tonnage
            equal or superior to one million gross tons. Australia cannot secure the benefit of this
            Convention until it has been ratified by a sufficient number of countries, but I hope
            that the Minister will have another look at the position under this Convention to see
            whether it is not possible for the Commonwealth itself - in the light of the High Court
            decisions in the civil aviation field in the last year - to pass the necessary
            legislation, and promptly. Otherwise I believe there can be no justification for waiting
            for the passage of State legislation and for British confirmation, which has not been
            obtained hitherto. I thank the House for forbearing with my excursus on this subject. I
            was encouraged to make it by the Minister's reference to my remarks 15 days ago.</para>

                            I rise to support the Bill,
              which seeks to amend the Pollution of the Sea by Oil Act 1960. The Bill itself is not
              a long one, but the amendments mark another important step forward in effecting the
              control so essential to bring about what is known in shipping parlance as' clean
              water. The legislation itself has quite a human impact' I take this opportunity to
              congratulate the Minister for Shipping and Transport
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Freeth)</inline>
                            on introducing the Bill so that the principal Act can be brought
              into conformity with the amendments to the International Convention for the Prevention
              of Pollution of the Sea by Oil in 1954. The necessary ratification of the Convention
              is now being given by this Government. I was particularly pleased to learn from the
              Deputy Leader of the Opposition
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam)</inline>
                            that
              he approved the Bill in all its aspects and that he had no quarrel whatsoever
              regarding any alleged delay in bringing in the legislation. As a matter of fact, I
              sensed that he was highly complimentary of the Government for what it was doing.

                            <para>- Yes, we have a submarine base, too. Because of the waterways and fine beaches
                in the electorate, I am interested in the Bill itself. I am indeed overjoyed that
                the 1954 Convention which seeks to bring into line the legislation of the 32
                signatory nations to this Convention is so designed to bring water pollution under
                control. This Bill deals with a subject which has caused considerable concern to
                many interests for a number of years. I refer here to that much maligned but august
                body, the shipowners, and also to small craft owners, whether they be owners of
                yachts, motor propelled craft, port authorities, those who go down to the sea or
                down to the beach to swim, fishermen and others. So. 1 reiterate that this is a very
                important piece of legislation, simple though it may seem.</para>

                    <para>I am very pleased to be able to say in this chamber that the New South Wales
            Maritime Services Board, over a number of years, has taken a very keen interest in
            ensuring that Sydney Harbour and the territorial waters outside it are kept clear of oil
            pollution. The Board has been most zealous in ensuring that this cleanliness is
            observed, lt will be of interest to honorable members, I feel sure, to learn just how
            masters of foreign going vessels before the 1954 Convention was ever hinted at were
            notified of what the authorities of the Maritime Services Board required them to do when
            they brought their ships into the port of Sydney. The notification of the masters was
            carried out very effectively but very easily. A pilot coming aboard a vessel within the
            three mile territorial limit of the Sydney Harbour Heads would take with him, and does
            still, the "Port of Sydney Regulations " which fully advised the master of the
            vessel as to his responsibilities in ensuring that there could be no spillage of oil
            from his ship while the vessel was within the territorial waters and especially while it
            was lying at berth in Sydney Harbour. In addition to this notification to the master
            himself, a very large notice was placed on board appropriately situated in the ship so
            that all members of the crew could make themselves fully aware of the stringent
            regulations which apply to the port of Sydney.</para>
                    <para>I have no doubt that other main ports of Australia carry out the same rigid
            regulations as are carried out in the port of Sydney so as to ensure the same
            cleanliness of water in other main ports as there is in Sydney. The regulations were
            designed to ensure not only that oil would not be spilled into the Harbour and
            territorial waters of Sydney, and to prevent pollution, but also that a danger element
            such as a fire hazard would not be created as the result of oil, be it a white spirit or
            black oil - that is, bunker oil - which could catch fire and cause damage. As I
            understand the situation, the principal Act which we have as a Commonwealth document has
            already been adapted by the State Governments, especially the Government of New South
            Wales.</para>

                        <para>As from a date three years after the present Convention comes into force in
              respect of any of the territories of a contracting Government, that Government shall

              the reception, without causing undue delay to ships, of such residues from oily
              ballast water and tank washings as would remain for disposal by ships, other than
              tankers, using the port . . .</para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The important thing is that provision is made for these oil receptacles. I was of
            the opinion that these were provided, but on making inquiries I have found that the main
            ports have not oil receptacles readily " available. Apparently further inquiries
            have to be made before a suitable type of receptacle can be made available into which
            merchant ships can discharge their residual oil. This applies to the main ports. I am
            informed that the oil port of Botany Bay already has oil receptacles for the use of
            tankers. So that port, and no doubt other oil ports, have facilities which comply fully
            with what is required by the 1954 Convention. It would seem to me that there is an
            urgent need for equipping all ports with these receptacles. Most modern ships have their
            own separating, refining and distilling systems with which they are able to separate oil
            from bilge water. If oil receptacles are available in the main ports, these ships,
            knowing that they will be able to effect the necessary discharge into suitable
            receptacles, will have no excuse whatsoever for dumping residual oil at any point
            outside territorial waters. The residual oil which is left after the refining process by
            modern separators has about the same consistency as butter.</para>

            free from pollution by oil. Those laws provide for very heavy penalties, and the masters
            of the various ships, knowing of these penalties, have substantially complied with the
            laws. I should mention also that the laws administered by the Maritime Services Board
            are designed not only to prevent the pollution of the waters through the discharge or
            the spillage of oil by ships but also by the depositing of rubbish and debris from
            factories and refineries situated around the foreshores. As it has to police not only
            the laws relating to spillage of oil from ships but also the laws relating to the
            dumping of rubbish and debris from factories and refineries, the Maritime Services Board
            has a fairly large staff of inspectors. I believe I am correct in saying that, by strict
            policing of its own regulations, the Maritime Services Board has done a good job in
            ensuring that there is little or no pollution of Sydney Harbour.</para>
                    <para>As honorable members are no doubt aware, those charged with the responsibility of
            dispersing or breaking up spillages of bunker oil have a difficult task, in that this
            bunker oil is a very heavy, tarry substance which floats on the water. The method
            adopted for disposing of spilled oil is to put a boom around the concentration, so as to
            keep it from spreading, and then attempt to break up the oil by directing strong jets of
            water on to it. In these more modern times, an appropriate detergent is used to emulsify
            and break up the oil.</para>
                    <para>Fortunately, from my perusal of the records, it would seem that in Sydney Harbour
            there are not many occasions when oil is spilled in substantial quantities. As honorable
            members will appreciate, tankers lend themselves to this type of offence. For many
            years, they did create a problem, but now there are so many regulations relating to the
            discharge of oil to shore refineries - regulations relating to the manner in which they
            connect their pipes and the times at which their pipes can be connected - that they are
            very well controlled indeed and cause little or no oil pollution. There was an occasion
            some years ago when a merchant vessel was being loaded with bunker oil from an oil barge
            and when the watchman whose duty it was to ensure that the oil was pumped aboard
            correctly fell asleep, with the result that some tons of oil spilled into the water, a
            great deal of trouble was caused in effectively dealing with the spillage. The method
            used was as I have described. A boom was put around it and strong jets of water were
            played on it in order to break up the oil.</para>
                    <para>So far as I can ascertain from the records, in recent years there has only been one
            fire of any consequence resulting from oil spillage. On that occasion, a quantity of
            white oil - petrol in this instance - was spilled from a tanker at the Caltex wharf. The
            oil then flowed around Ballast Point and into Morts Bay, where it came into contact with
            sparks from welding that was being down on a vessel under repair. Although this caused a
            fire, the fire did not cause much damage, nor was anyone seriously injured. I pay full
            tribute to the work of the Maritime Services Board in keeping Sydney Harbour free from
            oil spillage and water pollution. I have no doubt that the Board will continue to do a
            very fine job with its up to date port facilities.</para>
                    <para>The major problem connected with policing the oil pollution laws is to catch the
            culprit in the act. In this case, of course, the culprit would be the master of the
            vessel from which oil was spilled. There are so many ways in which the offence can be
            covered up that the spilling has to be seen in progress before the person held to be
            responsible can be arrested. Unfortunately, as I read the Bill, the wording will provide
            the master of a vessel with so many avenues for claiming mitigating circumstances that
            successful prosecution will be extremely difficult. No doubt the wording will receive
            further consideration, because it is essential that every possible assistance be given
            to the authorities to enable their officers to make an arrest whenever an offence of
            this kind is committed.</para>
                    <para>Speaking again of Sydney Harbour, I say that oil pollution, even in small measure,
            is a very serious nuisance, for the consequences can be extremely costly. As anyone
            knows, a film of oil on the surface of the water is very damaging to small craft, both
            sailing yachts and motor driven vessels. The seriousness of any pollution of Sydney
            Harbour by oil can be gauged from the fact that there are on that stretch of water 1,300
            yachts in addition to many other craft, including numerous motor driven vessels. Oil
            clings to the topsides of small craft, necessitating washing down completely and,
            invariably, repainting. All this, as I have already said, is costly. If it can be
            established that the oil on the water had spilled from a particular vessel, the master
            of that vessel has to meet the cost of cleaning and repainting. In such circumstances,
            no cost is incurred by the owner of a yacht or other small craft. However, establishing
            the vessel from which the spillage took place presents difficulties for the harbour
            authorities. One can say quite properly that oil pollution would be a very much more
            serious menace to all those who use our territorial and harbour waters if authorities
            such as the Maritime Services Board, which functions in New South Wales, did not take
            strict measures to control spillage and enforce laws designed to prevent pollution.</para>
                    <para>Oil pollution also seriously affects beaches, as is well known to all honorable
            members. I recall that a few years ago I had occasion to recommend to friends that they
            visit Balmoral Beach in Sydney. I told them that this was a very good surfing beach that
            they would find to be clean and free of rubbish. A few days later, my friends told me
            that never again would they go to that beach. On the Sunday when they had gone there,
            they found it covered with a film of oil which, unfortunately, had spilled from
            submarines moored nearby. This is the only occasion that I can recall on which this
            delightful beach was so affected. If any honorable member wishes to visit this beach -
            it is a magnificent one that is worthy of a visit by anybody - he need not be deterred
            by the fear that he will find it polluted by oil. On the occasion that I have mentioned,
            the oil had to be cleared from the beach by the local council, which was put to
            considerable cost.</para>
                    <para>
                        Here is an interesting sidelight,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy
              Speaker.</inline>
                        No doubt honorable members have seen small oil slicks on harbour
            waters such as those of Sydney. These have not come from ships, but have been formed in
            an interesting way. A certain amount of oil falls from cars standing on bitumen streets
            and is washed by heavy rain into gutters and stormwater channels which lead it into the
            harbour. This is just another form of pollution with which harbour authorities have to
            contend. Unfortunately, there is no means of inflicting penalties because, in the
            ordinary sense, there are no culprits at whom a charge can be levelled.
                    </para>
                    <para>Bearing in mind the problems associated with the prevention of pollution of our
            territorial and harbour waters by the spillage of oil, I have great pleasure in
            supporting this Bill wholeheartedly as a very progressive measure. It is in no way
            controversial and I am sure that it will meet with no opposition.</para>

                            and the officers of the Department of Shipping and Transport on the introduction of
              this measure, which relates to a matter that we must keep in the forefront of our
              minds from now on. The problem to which the Bill relates results from our modern way
              of life. It is a sign of the times. Before the Second World War, pollution of the sea
              by oil was of far less magnitude than now. In those days, most of the ships plying the
              ocean trade routes burned coal, and the residual ashes were pumped or shovelled over
              the side. For this reason, the seaways of the world were not contaminated by oil
              sludge as they are now. This contamination comes about in many ways and it will be
              very hard to prevent, as I shall explain more fully later.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Minister, in his second reading speech, referring to the amendments to the
            principal Act proposed in this measure, said -</para>

                        <para>They extend the prohibited zones and they place a total prohibition on the
              discharge of persistent oil in respect of new ships of over 20,000 tons gross tonnage.</para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">
                        That is very good, I take it that the intention is to see that such
            vessels are fitted with separators and other machinery necessary to clean the oil fuel
            and to remove oil from waste before it is discharged. That kind of equipment will be
            very difficult to put into ships already constructed, because sufficient space is not
            available in the engine rooms of vessels already in service. However it will be a good
            thing if new vessels of more than 20,000 tons gross are required to have this kind of
            machinery fitted. I suppose it will be only a matter of time before we have operating on
            the Australian coast oil tankers of up to 20,000 gross registered tons. The tankers at
            present plying on our coast are of no more than about 12,000 gross registered tons.
            Vessels such as the "Caltex Liverpool " and the " Hemigypta ", to name
            ships owned by competing companies, and the tankers operated by R. W. Miller &amp; Co.
            Pty. Ltd. are about 12,000 gross registered tons and carry between 15,000 and 18,000
            tons of cargo. It would be very difficult to fit cleaning machinery of the kind that
                        <inline font-style="italic">I</inline>
                        have mentioned into those ships, because, as I
            have said, the space available in the engine room is not sufficient. But such machinery
            can be fitted in new vessels. There is a trend in the world today towards vessels of
            greater size,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline>
                        Some ships plying
            to Australia and elsewhere throughout the world carry up to 130,000 tons, and one vessel
            at present under construction will carry up to 150,000 tons. A number of ships carrying
            as much as 90,000 tons of cargo come to Australia and enter Port Phillip or Sydney
            Harbour.
                    </para>
                    <para>Let me explain what happens when a tanker discharges its cargo of oil. The ship
            becomes very unstable as it rises out of the water with the lightening of the load.
            Indeed, it becomes just like a big steel balloon floating on the water. So, as soon as
            the oil cargo is discharged, salt water is pumped in quickly to take its place and
            restore the vessel to a stable condition. This means that a ship that entered port with
            a cargo of 90,000 tons of oil may leave carrying 50,000 tons of salt water and oil
            mixed. Of course, when the ship reaches the port where it is to be reloaded it must get
            rid of the mixture of salt water and oil, so this is pumped overboard. If the weather is
            fine, before a ship comes within the 300 mile limit, or whatever it may be, from the
            loading port, it starts to pump the oil overboard. Honorable members doubtless realise
            that the whole 50,000 tons cannot be pumped overboard, and that some of the water and
            oil mixture has to be pumped ashore into settling tanks so that new oil can be loaded.
            In the main, when there is a continual filling of holds, tanks or compartments with oil,
            the remaining oil is removed by pumping salt water into the tanks and then pumping it
            out. When that happens an oil sludge is left on the ocean surface.</para>
                    <para>The same thing occurs with cargo ships which have double bottoms in which the oil is
            carried. Honorable members can visualise a migrant ship, for example, bound from Europe
            to Australia, making Suez the last port of call and travelling direct to Fremantle. It
            is burning oil all the time and, consequently the trim of the ship is altered. If it is
            burning oil from the after end the ship goes down at the head, and if it burning oil
            from the other end there is the reverse effect. In order to counteract that, salt water
            is pumped into the double bottom tanks. However, when the ship needs to load more oil to
            take it home for bunkers or whatever it is the salt water mixed with oil has to be
            removed. I suggest that in Australia we need tank cleaning ships at the ports of Sydney
            and Melbourne-</para>

                            <para>- Yes, Newcastle if you like, but that port hardly warrants one because of its
                size. Particularly in Sydney and Melbourne a tank cleaning ship is needed in each
                port. The big ports of the world have these tank cleaning ships.. They are not ships
                that go to sea but are ones that have spent their lives at sea and have come back.
                To save them going through a big overhaul they are confined to smoother waters. Such
                a ship is capable of going alongside the ship that wants to get rid of the oil
                sludge and of sucking it out of the ship into its own hold, leaving the other vessel
                ready to load clean oil. I have been asked on several occasions: " Why is there
                not a tank cleaning ship in any port in Australia?" If a ship has to go into dry
                dock or needs to get rid of oil there should be a vessel which can come alongside
                it, take the oil out and, if necessary, clean the tank so that the ship can go into
                dock. In the main that is how the tanks are emptied in overseas ports.</para>

                            <para>- I should think that in Australia it would be provided by private enterprise.
                That is the way it is done in most ports, although I do not know what is done in
                Russia. In London and New York tank cleaning ships operate and do a very good job -
                a job that is most necessary.</para>

                    <para>I should like to pay tribute to the Department of Shipping and Transport for what
            may be termed the stringency of its regulations. I believe that regulations cannot be
            too stringent. The Australian regulations, especially those relating to cargo, are among
            the finest in the world. I know that on the Australian coast we have accidents with
            shackles carrying away and that sort of thing, but the laws laid down by Australia are
            very good. I believe that laws should be laid down with respect to fittings, pipelines
            and other equipment on the tankers and ships that load oil. Perhaps the Department could
            ensure that such equipment is maintained to a certain standard. Such a requirement would
            minimise the spills which occasionally take place. There is always an argument about
            whose section of the pipe carried away. Those on the ship will maintain that the pipe
            belonging to the oil company on the wharf was at fault. To those on the tanker or ship
            loading the oil it is always the other fellow's fault. I suggest that that aspect
            should be investigated to reduce the number of spillages that take place in Australia.</para>

                        As the honorable member for Warringah
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Cockle)</inline>
                        said, it is very hard to pin down the source of the oil pollution.
            Ships travelling from port to port, for example from Sydney to Brisbane, wait until it
            is dark and then pump the sludge over the side. When 20 or 30 ships are travelling
            between these ports, with 15 going one way and 15 the other during the night, it is very
            hard to say from which ship the oil came. It is pleasing to know that ships are now
            required to carry an oil record book. On Australian ships, and British ships also, it is
            rather easy to go on board and ask to see the oil record book in order to ascertain how
            much oil is in the tanks, and whether some has been transferred from one tank to another
            or has been pumped over the side. But on some ships it is not possible to look at these
            books.
                    </para>
                    <para>A few nights ago, when speaking on a bill, I mentioned ships flying the flag of
            convenience. I did not mean to upset the Minister for Shipping and Transport, but
            evidently I did. It was unintentional. All I was trying to do was to agree with the
            honorable member for Warringah and to point out what Hags of convenience are and their
            purpose. In matters such as the discharge of oil it is hard to police ships that are
            flying flags of convenience as they are not bound to the strict code of ethics to which
            ships from other countries conform. In many respects it is not their fault. I do not
            want to say too much about this subject, but I believe that the operators of ships
            flying the flag of convenience do not follow out the same high standards in their
            profession as do people from other nations. If I had any say in the matter I would not
            deal with a ship that flew the flag of convenience because if the owners were not proud
            enough to fly down their own flag they would certainly need investigation.</para>
                    <para>
                        I commend the Government for bringing in this legislation. It will have a far
            reaching effect on several things - not only the pollution of the sea. When oil is
            discharged on to the sea it affects many people, and, in addition, the bird life and
            fish life. When heavy detergents are used and there is a spill the oil sinks to the
            bottom and the marine life inhabiting the bottom of the ocean is affected. I heard the
            honorable member for Wilmot
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Duthie)</inline>
                        speak about
            that, and I am sure that he will say something about it in this debate. I wish the Bill
            speedy success. I hope that its provisions will be looked at from time to time and that
            Australia will keep its slate clean in relation to the carriage of oil and the pollution
            of the sea by oil.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        I remind honorable members that the sea can become polluted by oil that has not been
            discharged from ships. As honorable members know, at the present time drilling
            operations are being undertaken 18 miles off the Victorian coast. It will be interesting
            to see what happens if the drills strike oil. I dare say that some oil must escape into
            the sea before the flow is stopped. I understand that the Attorney-General
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Snedden)</inline>
                        is discussing this subject with the State
            Governments to see whether this aspect will be policed by the Commonwealth or the
            States. 1 know that the States are just as earnest in this matter as the Commonwealth
            is. I know that something good for Australia will come from this drilling, but I dare
            say that if the Commonwealth becomes the authority to administer this area the royalties
            will come to the Commonwealth rather than to the States. I do not know what the position
            will be, but that is something for the States to consider. I merely want to point out
            that the sea can be polluted by offshore drilling and that it will be necessary for the
            laws to be tightened up to ensure that there is no pollution. Again I commend the
            Minister and his Department for bringing this measure before the House.

                        <para>.- I have much pleasure in rising to support this Bill, which amends the Pollution
              of the Sea by Oil Act 1960. At this stage in the development of Australia it is
              important for us to sit up and take notice of what is happening as a result of the
              tremendous increase in the use of oil in and around Australia. It is important that we
              protect the wonderful asset that we have in Australia in our beaches. It is also
              important that we protect our ports which have been or are being established at
              tremendous expense. If all concerned with the problem of the pollution of the sea by
              oil - governments, both Commonwealth and State, port authorities and the shipping
              interests - accept their share of the responsibility, we will make progress.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Over the years we have seen the tremendous amount of damage and expense that can
            occur as a result of pollution. Recently in the port of Fremantle in Western Australia
            there was a major spill age of oil. Many thousands of gallons of oil were ejected into
            the inner port of Fremantle. That posed many problems. In addition to the damage that
            was done, the cost of absorbing or picking up the oil was tremendous. Of course, the
            authorities would recover the cost from the shipping company if it were proved, as it
            was in this case, that one of the company's employees was responsible for the
            spillage of oil.</para>
                    <para>There are many aspects of this matter. I have referred to damage to our beaches. In
            Western Australia, as in other parts of Australia, there are many beaches which are very
            important and which we want to retain in their present form. There is some erosion of
            beaches as a result of industry. That is happening at present in the Kwinana area of my
            electorate. We know that industry has to advance. We have to accept the consequences of
            that. But oil pollution is a different matter altogether. By means of legislation such
            as this, careful policing and a little care on the part of the shipowners, we can
            overcome much of the pollution. There are dangers to the ports and the ships. In this
            field the shipping companies should show a sense of responsibility. In the case that I
            mentioned, one ship was responsible for ejecting thousands of gallons of oil into the
            port of Fremantle before the trouble was detected. The oil itself was a tremendous
            hazard. It could have caught fire and caused complete chaos in the port.</para>
                    <para>I notice that clause 7 of the Bill refers to the inspection of machinery. This is
            very important. I believe that port authorities in Australia will have to look into this
            problem and the extent to which human factors enter into the matter. The question may be
            whether an officer of a ship, who is responsible for doing a certain thing, such as
            turning on the correct tap, does it. I believe that if the shipping companies will not
            accept a greater responsibility in this field the port authorities will have to accept
            responsibility for ensuring that personnel are placed on ships, as pilots are, to see
            that the sort of thing that happened in Fremantle does not happen again. At the moment
            the responsibility is on the shipowner. The case in Fremantle is not the only one that
            has occurred. In Western Australia we have had evidence of oil being spilt from many
            sources, particularly close to the refinery at Kwinana.</para>
                    <para>Separation units have been mentioned. We recognise that they are expensive pieces of
            machinery, but I believe that the oil industry is sufficiently financial to do something
            about this matter. As I have said, the oil companies and the shipping companies, which
            are largely responsible for this problem, should take a greater interest in it and
            should be responsible, to a large extent, for supplying the necessary equipment in
            ports. I do not think it is always the responsibility of the port authorities or
            governments to supply this equipment. The refineries and bunkering facilities are part
            of the oil industry. It is a tremendous industry in the world today. It is growing every
            day. That is certainly the position in this country. We have struck a little oil in
            Australia. I hope that we will strike more. As we progress, huge quantities of oil will
            be either coming to our shores or leaving our shores.</para>
                    <para>Because of the relative isolation of Australia, particularly the southern ports, and
            the long leads across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, a tremendous amount of bunkering
            will be done in Australia. Fremantle is one of the largest, if not the largest,
            bunkering port in the southern hemisphere, because of the long leads in all directions.
            This oil trade in our Australian ports will continue to grow. The bunkering service at
            Fremantle is a splendid one. But whatever machinery the oil companies or the port
            authorities have installed or may instal, without the correct policing of that machinery
            we will still have this problem.</para>
                    <para>I support the Bill and call upon all people who are active in fields in which oil
            pollution may occur to do everything that they can to accept their responsibilities and
            to overcome this problem. We cannot afford to lose our beaches. There is no need for us
            to lose them if this matter is policed correctly. We cannot afford to take any risks at
            all in our ports. We can imagine what would happen in some of our ports if we had a
            major catastrophe in the form of a fire. In addition to the tremendous material losses
            and the possible loss of life, our trade would be bottled up to a large extent. We
            cannot afford to have that happen. I believe in correct policing and stringent controls
            in this field. I noticed that, although there is a maximum fine of £1,000, a lesser
            fine was imposed in respect of the recent incident in the port of Fremantle, to which I
            have referred. I believe that in certain circumstances a fine of even £1,000 is a
            little light, compared with the damage and inconvenience which may be caused. I support
            the Bill and I am sure that every other member will support it, too.</para>

                            .- I wish to add a few words to this very interesting debate. I congratulate the
              Minister for Shipping and Transport
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Freeth).</inline>
                            I might not be able to congratulate him on other occasions, but on this occasion I
              congratulate him sincerely. It is good to be able to say that the Government is
              honoring its obligations arising from the international conference on ways and means
              of increasing the safety of bird and fish life by preventing pollution of the sea.
              However, one paragraph in the Minister's second reading speech indicates that it
              will be a long time before the provisions of this Bill become operative. The Minister
              said -

                cleaning vessel should be provided on the Australian coast to take oil sludge from
                ships. It may be that the Australian National Line could build this ship and hire it
                out to private enterprise. This would be one way of reducing the quantity of sludge
                which is tipped from ships.

                in and around Australia. The Tasmanian species makes transcontinental flights to the

                            <para>- Yes, in some areas. Experts claim that the number on the four islands of the
                Furneaux group would exceed 2,600,000 birds every season. This species nests in
                south-eastern Australia, around Tasmania and from Gabo Island in Victoria to Saint
                Francis Island in South Australia. Another species nests in islands off
                south-western Australia. It is an important bird, and I want to stress the dangers
                to it of oil pollution. If pollution spreads in this area the industry could be
                seriously affected. On the flight south along the coast of Asia many of these birds
                settle on water at night to rest and continue their journey in the morning. Many die
                on the way down because they settle on oil polluted water. The industry could be
                greatly damaged if the waters are polluted as a result of increased activity in the
                search for oil off the continental shelf or through increased negligence on the part
                of shipping and the adoption of the expediency of tipping sludge overboard from
                ships. Scores of people make a living from mutton birds in the season. The industry
                is of considerable economic importance to Tasmania.</para>

                            <para>- That is so. I thought 1 should mention this matter in view of the dangers
                referred to in the document from which I have quoted. I want to stress, now, another
                danger. The honorable member for Batman referred to the effect on fish deep down in
                the water of oil sunk as sediment. The scallop industry and the crayfish industry on
                the Tasmanian coast could be affected if oil sludge were sunk as sediment. Some
                people may use this method of removing oil from the surface. It is of no use
                removing oil from the surface if it will kill fish under the surface. The fishing
                industry is worth £15 million a year - £885,000 of it from Tasmania- and
                14,149 people are dependent on it.</para>

                    <para>Finally I want to refer to the danger of pollution resulting from increased activity
            in the search for oil. This pollution could come, not from oil discharged from ships,
            but from oil brought up from the depths of the earth. In the last five months there has
            been fantastic development in the search for oil offshore. We are glad to see this
            increased activity and we hope that the search is successful but at this stage I think
            we should take cognisance of the fact that this search offshore could lead to pollution
            of the sea. Another danger is that a light thrown from a ship - it may be a cigarette
            -could ignite the surface of the sea in the vicinity of drilling rigs. Only one drill is
            working at the moment off the Australian coastline but I prophesy that within 12 months
            many will be working.</para>
                    <para>Haematite Exploration Pty. Ltd. has rights to explore 35,325 square miles around
            Tasmania. Tasmania is virtually only a dot in the area. The company is supposed to
            finish its preliminary search by October this year. The 5,800 ton floating rig "
            Glomar III " is drilling Australia's first offshore well in the continental
            shelf area of the Gippsland Basin in eastern Bass Strait - off Ninety Mile Beach. The
            drill is located 16 miles from Ninety Mile Beach and is programmed to a depth of 10,000
            feet. The Esso organisation has chartered the drilling rig from Global Marine
            (Australasia) Pty. Ltd. for its work. Where else may we expect offshore drilling? The
            interest in this new search for oil is increasing at a great rate. Shell Development
            (Australia) Pty. Ltd. has completed a large marine seismic survey in a 4,910 square
            miles area off the coast of New South Wales. We may expect drilling operations to
            commence there in the next six months. The American company, Gulf Oil Corporation, by
            arrangement with the Australian Oil and Gas Corporation Ltd., is exploring offshore
            areas on the north Queensland coast extending an average of 150 miles out to the Barrier
            Reef and beyond. Offshore drilling will later take place off Geraldton in Western
            Australia, where seismic surveys have been made. Similar surveys have been made in the
            St. Vincent's Gulf area of South Australia on behalf of Beach Petroleum N.L.</para>
                    <para>
                        Shell Development (Australia) Pty. Ltd. this month began a new survey in Queensland
            waters in the Hervey Bay area, which will be known to the honorable member for Griffith
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coutts),</inline>
                        where the Shell organisation and
            Pacific American Oil Co. jointly own an authority to prospect, embracing an area of
            6,590 square miles. In association with Burmah Oil Co. of Australia Ltd. a seismic
            survey was completed of an area of more than 2,000 square miles off the north-west coast
            of Australia and in the Timor Sea. The survey, which was completed last October, cost
            £250,000.
                    </para>
                    <para>I have given these figures, taken from the latest issue of a document dealing with
            the search for petroleum, to show what a tremendous amount of work is being done in
            marine seismic surveys and what we may expect in drilling operations within the next 12
            months. I have given this information in order to draw the Minister's attention to
            the need to face up to the danger of pollution that may result from offshore oil search
            as distinct from oil sludge from ships. I concede that the Bill does not refer to oil
            pollution from wells. Perhaps the Minister may see fit to draft legislation to deal with
            the problem of offshore drilling as it affects Australia. I support the Bill.</para>

                            .- In my opinion this Bill is the most important piece of legislation on the
              notice-paper. It is appropriate that such an important piece of legislation should be
              discussed at length. The importance of this legislation has been emphasised by the
              variety of speakers, in the professional sense, whom we have heard- We have heard

                            <para>- Poor chap- living in ignorance. We are indebted to the Minister for going to
                so much trouble to prepare such a lengthy statement to explain the purposes of the
                Bill. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has done a lot of research into the
                ramifications of the Bill and the conventions involved. The Minister has told us
                that the Bill deals with the effect of the discharge of oil and oily mixtures on
                fishing operations, beaches, bird life and the like. The honorable member for Wilmot
                has dealt quite effectively with the effect of oil on bird life. I do not want to
                follow that line because the honorable member spoke in a most delightfully clear and
                explanatory way. But the effect on fishing operations of the discharge of oil should
                be of major concern to all Australian Parliaments involved. Many attempts have been
                made to promote the fishing industry in this country. It is of importance to
                Australia, not only because it is a means of conserving our overseas reserves but
                also because it provides an edible diet which contrasts with the diet of meat that
                the Australian people seem to prefer. Unfortunately, the Australian fishing industry
                cannot meet the demands that are made on it and we are compelled to import enormous
                quantities of fish. I think that in a 12-month period we import about
                £12,000,000 worth of fish. This amounts to about £1 per head of
                population. This is a considerable sum and would be materially increased if our
                fishing grounds were polluted by the discharge of oil and oily mixtures. So it is
                good to have a Bill of this nature introduced into the Parliament. I do not want to
                commend the Minister, because I might be accused -of being too kind and I do not
                want to speak in such kindly terms of a member of the Government. I merely say that
                this is a worthwhile piece of legislation and, in co-operation with the States, can
                have a good effect on the Australian economy and on the fishing industry.</para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>As the Minister has said, the Bill deals with the discharge of oil and oily mixtures
            off the Australian coast. The Third Schedule, which is contained in this Bill, deals
            with the effect of the legislation on various coast lines around the world. I am sure
            that all honorable members have completely informed themselves as to the coasts of the
            maritime world that are dealt with in the Schedule. However, I will repeat that portion
            which relates to Australia. The Australian zone extends to 150 miles from the nearest
            land along the coasts of Australia, except off the north and west coasts of the
            Australian mainland between the point opposite Thursday Island and the point on the west
            coast at 20 degrees south latitude. The Queensland coast comes within the provisions of
            the Bill. That is very important from my point of view and I want to refer to the
            troubles that beset some of the beaches around the Brisbane area. We have a pest called
            hyacinth which grows in enormous quantities in the upper reaches of the Brisbane River.
            During the wet season, which should occur in January and February but which
            unfortunately did not occur this year, it comes down in huge quantities, covers the
            Brisbane River and eventually is swept out into the bay. It then comes back on the tide
            into the very pleasant watering resorts around Sandgate and Redcliffe. It causes
            considerable worry to the municipal authorities who have to dispose of it. We can
            imagine the problem that would be created if this pest became contaminated with oily
            substances discharged from vessels. It would create a fire hazard in these well
            populated areas.</para>
                    <para>I now go further down the coast to the Gold Coast. My friend from Wilmot described
            the flight of birds from the northern hemisphere to Tasmania in such numbers that they
            darken the sun. I want to refer to the movement of birds, very delightful ones, from the
            southern parts of Australia to Surfers Paradise, where the sun darkens them.</para>

                honorable member for Wills, they are very delightful chickies too. It is very
                pleasant to lie on the broad expanse of white sand on the beach at Surfers Paradise
                and survey the rollers coming in from the Pacific Ocean and also anything that is
                between the seaboard and the beach. But how disastrous and unpleasant it would be
                if, having applied an oily substance to one's body Whilst lying on the beach to
                defeat the evil effects of the sun's rays on the skin, one entered the surf only
                to be covered by an oily substance that had been discharged into the sea by ships.
                This would be disgraceful and I can assure honorable members that it would be a most
                unpleasant experience.</para>

                    <para>The tourist industry in Surfers Paradise is worth many millions of pounds in foreign
            currency. Tourists also bring many millions of pounds to Queensland from the southern
            parts of Australia. The people who have invested large sums of money in promoting the
            tourist industry on the Gold Coast and who have provided the means of entertaining
            visitors have a large investment that could easily be damaged by the pollution of the
            sea by oil. The rollers of the blue Pacific and the white sands of the beaches provide a
            marvellous playground for the less fortunate people of Australia who live in the
            southern States. I speak not merely in the interests of the people of Surfers Paradise
            but also in the interests of those people in the southern States who go to the Gold
            Coast to enjoy their holidays at various times. I hope that this Bill will help to
            preserve this glorious playground of the Pacific as it is now. I hope that the operation
            of the Bill will be simplified and that the shipping industry will co-operate to ensure
            that its purpose is fulfilled. The Bill provides very severe penalties for offences
            committed under it.</para>
                    <para>As my friend from Wilmot remarked, although the Minister hopes that the Bill will
            come into operation soon, there are indications that this will not be for some time yet.
            I hope that it will come into operation in the very near future. Australia has much to
            gain from the implementation of the Bill and much to lose by the pollution of the
            waterways and the sea, of the beaches and the fishing grounds which provide a livelihood
            for many people and a sporting venue for thousands of others. I wish the Bill a speedy
            passage.</para>

                            this Bill will apply, as far as the
              Constitution allows, the provision of a British act of 1832 to your own situation and
              that of the Presiding Officer in another place. I am credibly informed that if a
              Presiding Officer contests an election for either House and is re-elected to that
              House, his salary is paid until he or his successor is elected as Presiding Officer.
              Up until now you and your colleague in another place have had the glory of your
              respective positions until you were re-elected, but you have not had any continuing
              power. This Bill will give you the same power as the Speaker of the House of Commons
              has had since the year of the first Reform Act. It is clear that legislation of this
              character has. had ample trial in the British Parliament. One would concede that this
              Parliament should avail itself of similar legislation.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I said that the Bill purports to do all that the Constitution permits, because under
            section 35 of the Constitution the Speaker ceases to hold office when he ceases to be a
            member. He ceases to be a member if the House is dissolved. Nevertheless, this Bill and
            other legislation merely permit a person who has been the Speaker to continue to receive
            the emoluments of that position and now to carry out the functions of his position. The
            Opposition believes that this is, if no longer an urgent piece of legislation, still a
            worthy piece of legislation. We support the measure.</para>

                            <para>- He said it had and he also said that if the honorable member had any doubt
                about the matter I would, at an appropriate time, say that the Government was
                satisfied that it did have this power. To put the matter in short compass, I think
                it is desirable to say so now, because the interjection of the Deputy Leader of the
                Opposition might give rise to some constitutional doubt, whereas in my opinion there
                is no room for doubt at all.</para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Perhaps the position can be simply stated by saying that there is no constitutional
            reason why the statutory powers need have been conferred on a Presiding Officer in the
            first place, and there is equally no constitutional reason why provision should not be
            made for such powers to be exercisable in certain circumstances by a person who ceases
            to be a Presiding Officer or who is the Chairman of Committees. All that this Bill does
            is to pick up the constitutional power of the antecedent bill, as section 204 of the
            Electoral Act, section 9 of the Public Service Act and Regulation 49 of the Treasury
            Regulations, for instance, do. Taking the first illustration, the power for section 204
            of the Electoral Act, resides in section 47 and section 51, placitum (xxxvi), of the
            Constitution. If the antecedent legislation is within power, quite clearly this Bill is
            within power. There has never been any doubt about the constitutional validity of the
            antecedent bill. Equally there is no doubt about this.</para>
                    <para>
                        I thought it necessary to say these things as the matter was raised by the Deputy
            Leader of the Opposition and as the Bill does relate to acts which will be taken perhaps
            by yourself,

            somebody else at some other time. At that future point of time somebody might refer to
            " Hansard " and say that at the time of the introduction of the Bill the then
            Deputy Leader of the Opposition had some doubt about the constitutional authority and
            that there had been no statement made to contradict his doubt. I, in that sense,
            contradict it now.

          the proposed amendments are of a formal nature designed to give effect to practice or to
          make alterations found necessary in the light of events since 1963. There are, however,
          some matters to which I should draw attention.</para>
                        <para>In addition to the proposed amendments, the Committee has recommended that proposals
          to fix a time beyond which the House should not sit each day and to reduce speaking times,
          be deferred for the time being in order that the subjects may be discussed by the parties.
          In paragraph (6) of the report the Committee supports proposals for the establishment of a
          rule to govern the seeking and obtaining of leave to incorporate material in " Hansard
          " but is of opinion that this is inappropriate for inclusion in Standing Orders and
          can well be left for arrangement through party channels. The Committee suggests that a
          Minister or member seeking leave to incorporate material should first show the matter to
          the member leading for the Opposition or to the Minister at the Table, as the case may be.
          It would be understood of course that any arrangements in this way would be subject to the
          principles stated by the Chair on 17th September 1964 namely, that the final decision as
          to the practicability of incorporating material such as graphs, maps, blocks etc., and
          incorporating matter of a libellous or improper nature or which is irrelevant, is a matter
          for the Presiding Officer.</para>
                        <para>Turning to the Schedule, the House will see that it is proposed to omit Standing Order
          No. 62 which states that " A member shall not read his speech ". The Committee
          states that parliamentary practice recognises and accepts that, wherever there is reason
          for precision of statement such as on the second reading of a bill, particularly one of a
          complex or technical nature, or in ministerial or other statements, it is reasonable to
          allow the reading of speeches. As, in other cases, it is difficult to apply the rule, for
          example, "Reference to Copious Notes ", it is proposed to omit the Standing Order.</para>
                        <para>The amendment of Standing Order No. 110 will allow the precedence provision which now
          applies to a censure or want of confidence motion which is accepted by the Government as
          such to apply, as well, to a censure or want of confidence amendment which is similarly
          accepted. Typical examples of censure amendments which would come under the amended rule
          would be those moved to the Address-in-Reply or to the Budget.</para>
                        <para>The Committee recommends an amendment of Standing Order No. 144 which is defective in
          that it does not make it clear that although a Minister may not be asked to announce the
          Government's policy, questions seeking an explanation to clarify policy and its
          application, and questions to ascertain whether a Minister's statement in the House
          expresses policy, are in order. The other amendments recommended by the Committee are of a
          formal or drafting nature.</para>
                        <para>Standing Order No. 14 provides that when the House is informed by the Clerk of the
          absence of the Speaker, the Chairman of Committees shall, as Deputy Speaker, perform the
          duties of the Speaker. The amendment proposes that on these' occasions the Chairman of
          Committees should have the title of Acting Speaker instead of Deputy Speaker in order to
          provide a distinction between the Chairman and the Temporary Chairmen who relieve him in
          the Speaker's chair and are also referred to as Deputy Speaker.</para>
                        <para>Standing Order No. 15 provides that when the House is informed by the Clerk of the
          absence of both the Speaker and the Chairman of Committees, the House may elect a member
          to,, act as Speaker for that day only. The Standing Order has been re-drafted to clarify
          the procedure which is followed and, in addition, the limitation in the existing order
          that the member elected shall act " for that day only " is omitted as serving no
          useful purpose. Instead, it is proposed that the member elected should act, subject to any
          other order of the House, for the whole period of the absence of the Speaker and the
          Chairman.</para>
                        <para>Standing Orders Nos. 14, 133, 148, 150 and 211 are proposed to be amended by omitting
          the many references to " the Clerk at the Table " and inserting the words "
          the Clerk". The reference to "the Clerk at the Table " is inconsistent with
          practice, as on. occasions, questions, answers to questions, and notices are delivered to
          the Clerk when he is not at the Table. Standing Orders Nos. 23 and 24 provide that in the
          absence of the Clerk his duties shall be performed by the Clerk Assistant or by the Second
          Clerk Assistant, and that, during any vacancy in the office of Clerk, his duties shall be
          carried out by the Clerk-Assistant. Following the re-organisation of the Department of the
          House of Representatives the titles of these other officers have been changed from
          Clerk-Assistant to Deputy Clerk and from Second Clerk-Assistant to Clerk-Assistant. The
          amendments proposed give effect to these altered designations.</para>
                        <para>Standing Orders Nos. 81, 220, 226, 291 and 292 refer to annual Appropriation and
          Supply Bills in terms which derived from the long titles of these Bills which were in use
          at the time of the adoption of the revised Standing Orders in 1963 - for example, " a
          Bill to grant and apply a sum for the service of a year ". As the long titles have
          since been changed and could perhaps be subject to further change it is proposed to use
          the short titles such tas " Appropriation Bill " or " Supply Bill ". Other
          amendments are consequential. Standing Order No. 91 deals with speech and other time
          limits. One of the proposed amendments is a formal insertion in the Standing Order of the
          provision in Standing Order No. 1.3 that no member may speak for more than five minutes
          during the debate on the election of Chairman. Another is a formal amendment of a subject
          heading to make it consistent with the words used in Standing Order No. 110 dealing with
          censure or want of confidence motions. As the Standing Order is defective in that, in
          effect, it does not fully cover speech time limits on the second reading of a bill
          introduced by a private member as distinct from a Government bill, the third amendment
          expresses the practice which has been followed and prescribes times which »re the
          same as those now applying to Government bills.</para>
                        <para>Standing Orders Nos. 104 and 106 provide, amongst other things, for the alternation of
          General Business and Grievance Days. The formal amendments proposed make it clear that, in
          accordance with practice over the last two years, this alternation is determined in
          respect of sitting Thursdays and not by the calendar. The amendments proposed to Standing
          Orders Nos. 133 and 211 provide that the formal duty of reporting to the House notices
          received by the Clerk shall be transferred from the Speaker to the Clerk.</para>
                        <para>Standing Orders Nos. 138 and 139 allow a member who has given notice of a motion to
          change the day for moving the motion to a later day, or to alter its terms, by notifying
          the Clerk. It is proposed to insert in Standing Order No. 138 a requirement that a change
          of day shall he reported to the House by the Clerk at the first convenient opportunity and
          to insert in Standing Order No. 139 a requirement that an alteration of terms shall be
          similarly reported by the Clerk and that, unless so reported the alteration shall not be
          made in the notice paper. These changes are consistent with the existing requirements in
          Standing Orders Nos. 133 and 211 in relation to notices which are given by delivering a
          copy to the Clerk.</para>
                        <para>The provision in Standing Order No. 220 that second reading amendments shall be
          relevant to the " subject-matter of the Bill " is inconsistent with long
          established practice allowing an amendment which is relevant to the whole Bill - that is,
          matter within the title, clauses, and schedules - and appears to impose a restriction
          which does not in fact apply. It is proposed to clarify the Standing Order by providing
          that second reading amendments shall be "relevant to the Bill ".</para>
                        <para>The effect of Standing Order No. 333 is that committees may not sit during sittings or
          over an adjournment without the consent of the House. As consent is now generally included
          in the resolution appointing a committee, or is freely given later, it is proposed to omit
          the restriction as being no longer of consequence. Standing Order No. 370 provides for the
          delivery of messages to the Senate by a Clerk at the Table or by the Serjeant-at-Arms. As
          for very many years messages have been delivered by the SerjeantatArms only, the reference
          to a Clerk at the Table is proposed to be omitted as unnecessary.</para>

                            it is I think a tribute to the Standing
          Orders Committee which carried out the major review adopted in 1963 that the amendments
          now proposed are not far reaching and are primarily of a tidying up nature. I commend the
          Committee's recommendations to the House for adoption.

                            . I think that the House will generally welcome the statement by the Leader of the
              House
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt),</inline>
                            and especially will it
              welcome his statement with regard to periodical reviews of the Standing Orders.
              Whatever we may say in our wisdom or in our unwisdom, there will be times when we will
              wish to review a matter. As you know,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, the</inline>
                            Standing Orders Committee has, unhappily, met very infrequently in the past, and I
              hope it will meet more frequently in the future.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>There are three matters to which I wish to refer. Two of them were referred to a
            moment ago by the Treasurer. The first relates to the length of speeches. I feel that we
            speak at far too great a length now. Our speeches would be more effective if they were
            shorter, and the business of the House would be got through better. I know there are
            times when every honorable member would like to speak at length. If a member has a topic
            which interests him particularly, he should be entitled to speak on it at length. But we
            find very often that members who have no particular interest in a topic are told by
            their Whips to speak for the full period. This, I think, is an abominable practice. It
            should be possible for the House to shorten the length of speeches. I shall not move an
            amendment in relation to this matter. It is one that touches all members fairly nearly,
            and the Standing Orders Committee considers that it is something which should be decided
            by the members themselves after due consultation. I would therefore ask the Standing
            Orders Committee to convene meetings and to invite private members to attend those
            meetings and express their views on this matter.</para>
                    <para>The same principle obtains with regard to the second matter to which I wish to
            refer. I think that the sittings of this House are not arranged in the best interests of
            either the House or the country. We spend far too much time travelling in relation to
            the time we spend here in Canberra. If we sat for two weeks, perhaps for a full two
            weeks, and then got up for a week, travelling time would be reduced, the strain on
            members would be reduced, the debates would be better and members would have more time
            in their constituencies. This again is a matter which I believe touches the individual
            member. I have no intention of pressing it at this point. Here again, I think the
            Standing Orders Committee should convene meetings and invite private members to express
            their views.</para>
                    <para>There is, however, a third small matter which I intend to press in the House
            tonight. It relates to private members' business and Grievance Day, which normally
            occurs on Thursday morning. As we know from bitter experience, this time, which should
            be reserved for private members, is very often cut into by special debates which occur
            under Standing Order No. 107. As honorable members know, Standing Order No. 107 provides
            that, if a given number of members rise in their places, their colleagues can take up
            the time of the House which should be reserved for private members. 1 propose moving an
            amendment to the Committee's report in this connection. That amendment is designed
            to provide that on Thursday mornings private members' business shall be sacrosanct
            and that if anybody wants to raise a special matter for urgent discussion, that shall be
            done outside of private members' time. I think that is a reasonable proposition. It
            relates only to Thursday mornings. The amendment which I propose to move reads -</para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Omit " as recommended by that Committee ", insert "(a) as recommended
              by that Committee and (b) by adding to the first paragraph of Standing Order 107 the
              words ' Provided that, notwithstanding the provisions of Standing Order 101, on
              Thursdays the Speaker shall not read such statement until precedence to' general
              business under Standing Order 104 has expired or the " Grievance" debate
              question under Standing Order 106 has been disposed of, as the case may be.'".</para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The effect of incorporating those words would be to amend the Standing Orders, and
            that amendment would have the effect of preserving to private members their rights on
            Thursday mornings. It would always be competent for the House, in a case of genuine
            emergency, to suspend the Standing Orders so that on a Thursday morning any special
            matter could be proceeded with; or it would be competent for the House to allow that
            special matter to be proceeded with on Thursday afternoon. Therefore, what I am
            proposing does not really affect the routine of the House. But it is important, I think,
            to preserve to private members their rights on Thursday mornings, rights which have, in
            the past, been invaded by what 1 think can be described as an abuse of the Standing
            Orders. I therefore move the following amendment -</para>

                            .- I second the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Mackellar
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth).</inline>
                            I think it is very reasonable. It does
              not impose on the House any great strain. It recognises the singular position of the
              private member in this House. I would hope that nobody would gainsay that this is not
              an Establishment consideration. The Standing Orders are the rules whereby this House
              conducts its business, and they are open to abuse. I hesitate to give examples of the
              abuses that I have known since I have been here. It is possible for an Opposition,
              under certain circumstances, to prevent a private member's motion from being
              discussed. I am bound to say that I have no personal complaint to make in this
              respect. It is again possible for a private member to so tie up General Business that
              no private member's motion can be discussed until the business spelt out by the
              private member in his motion has been dispensed with.

                        who is Leader of the House, will accept the fact that the
            amendment does not embody a revolutionary proposal. It will leave open to the Government
            and the Opposition the course of suspending the Standing Orders if they believe that a
            proposal made by a member and having the support of eight others should be discussed. I
            appeal to my right honorable friend to recognise the reasonableness of this proposal. I
            hope he will accept the amendment.

                            I support the amendment. In so
              doing, I want to say something about Grievance Day itself. I spoke on this subject
              some nine years ago and I propose to say something further about it now. The Grievance
              Day procedure affords private members an opportunity to speak in this House on behalf
              of their electors, individually or collectively, in an endeavour to have rectified any
              troubles they may have. Since World War II, Grievance Day has been called on with the
              following frequency - 1943-44, three times; 1944-45, twice; 1945- 46, five times;
              1946-48, six times; 1948-49, six times; 1950-51, once; 1951-53, five times; 1953-54,
              once; 1954-55, twice; 1956, four times; 1957, twice; 1958, twice; 1959, three times;
              1960, six times; 1961, three times; 1962, five dmes; 1963, once; 1964, once; and 1965,
              to the present date, once. I cite these figures to illustrate that Grievance Day is
              not called on very frequently. I believe that it is not called on as often as was
              intended by those who framed the present Standing Orders.

                            <para>- I have not those readily available, unfortunately. I wish I had been able to
                obtain them and give them to the House. Unfortunately, the figures that I have given
                are the only ones that I have at present. it has long been recognised in the House
                of Commons and other Commonwealth assemblies that the major part of parliamentary
                time must be devoted to Government business. I think all of us in this House
                recognise that. But, in principle, control of the business rests with the House
                itself. In practice, of course, the House has by standing order delegated control to
                the Government with a saving provision for private members' business and with
                other minor reservations. As a result the Government is given very far reaching
                control over the time of the House. However, when the Government considers that the
                need arises and has party support even the time allotted to private members'
                business can be devoted to Government business by a vote of the House suspending the
                relevant standing order.</para>

                        merely wish to point out, as I hope I have done already, that the
            opportunities for private members to raise matters under the Grievance Day procedure
            have been quite limited. I think every private member on both sides of the House
            appreciates that there are certain occasions when the Government must have precedence
            for its business. I suggest that the amendment proposed by the honorable member for
            Mackellar
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline>
                        is a very simple one. It
            is simple in the sense that it will not effect any drastic alteration. I think it ought
            to be acceptable to all honorable members.

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
              Speaker,</inline>
                        I cannot agree with all that my friend, the honorable member for
            Mackellar
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth),</inline>
                        has said, but I do find
            myself attracted to the amendment that he has submitted. This matter may be examined
            from the standpoint, first, of the Government, secondly, of the Opposition, and,
            thirdly, of private members. In this context, I refer to the Opposition as such. It is
            composed, of course, of a number of private members, but I distinguish its interests as
            the Opposition from the interests of private members pursuing the particular matters
            that interest them as private members. The Government is interested in getting its own
            business through the House as expeditiously as possible. But it must also recognise the
            proper right of the Opposition to discuss matters of public importance as well as to
            bring forward motions of censure and the like. The interest of the Opposition is in
            ensuring that, if it can derive some benefit from discussing a matter of public
            importance, it has the time and the opportunity to do so. But the time of private
            members may be taken up by the Opposition. This has happened.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        I put the situation quite simply: The time of private members may be taken up in
            discussing a matter of public importance that may affect the Opposition and be in the
            interests of the Opposition as such. The Opposition has the right to raise such matters
            of public importance for discussion,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, and</inline>
                        the
            Government concedes that it has this right. But I believe that the time for the
            discussion of such matters should not be taken at the expense of private members on
            either side of the House. Therefore, I support the amendment proposed by the honorable
            member for Mackellar. The time needed for private members' business should not be
            taken by the Opposition, but the amendment will not circumscribe the time to which the
            Opposition is legitimately entitled for the discussion of matters of public importance.

                            my inclination also at this
              stage is to support the amendment. I believe that anyone who has a basic belief in and
              regard for the proper functioning of the Parlia- ment must look very carefully to the
              preservation of trie rights of private members. I have no complaint at all to make
              about the Government's attitude. Indeed, perhaps I should not be on my feet now,
              being, shall we say, rather new in this place; but I have had parliamentary experience
              elsewhere. I believe that the Parliament as a whole must take care of the rights of
              private members. As the honorable member for Bradfield
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Turner)</inline>
                            has just explained, the Government has the job of getting its
              business through. This task must be discharged if the Parliament and the Cabinet
              system are to function properly. I trust that I would never vote in such a way as to
              take the business of the House out of the Government's hands. To do so would be to
              adopt a bad principle.

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        At this stage, the amendment appears to me to be quite mild and reasonable. It seems
            designed to protect the rights of back benchers and to assure them of a reasonable
            measure of time in which to raise matters that are troubling them and their
            constituents. I do not know whether I should signify at this stage that I do or do not
            definitely support the amendment. Indeed, I do not yet know whether I do support it. I
            should like to hear something from the Government about it. I heard only in the last few
            minutes that this matter was to occur and I have not had time to study the amendment.
            However, I say as sincerely as I can that I believe it is proper for the Parliament
            carefully to watch the rights of private members. I do not consider that the amendment,
            if accepted, will make much difference to the effective dispatch of Government business,
            and my inclination at this stage is to support the proposal made by the honorable member
            for Mackellar

                            has raised three
              matters. Concerning two, he apparently thought that the proper course, having regard
              to the manner in which the rights of members would be affected, would be for the
              Standing Orders Committee to study his proposals carefully in the time normally
              available to the Committee. I would have thought that, to be consistent, he would have
              adopted the same course with the third matter. Frankly, I do not think it is one to
              which the House should react quickly or on which it should make a snap judgment.

                                - I will explain why, if you will wait. First, I want to deal with the
                implications which came very strongly in the speech of the honorable member for
                Franklin

                                when he cited some
                cycle of the Grievance Days which had been available for private members'
                discussion over a long period of years. The figures can leave an entirely misleading
                impression, not only with the public, but even with newer members of this
                Parliament. I think one would have to go a long way to find any parliament anywhere
                in the world where more time is available to the private member than occurs in this
                Parliament. I shall proceed to establish that.

                            <para>- I said that the figures could give a misleading impression of the time
                available for private members to put to the House matters relating to their
                constituents, because in most years we have had two large debates in which private
                members have been able to speak on any matter on which it has seemed fitting for
                them to speak. There has been each year, of course, the Budget debate which has beer
                followed by a long Committee discussion which has enabled the private member to
                cover almost any topic that he has chosen to speak about. There has been the
                Address-in-Reply debate which has occurred in most years. In addition, in recent years
                we have had the well established practice that time is available on the motion for
                the adjournment two nights a week for discussion by private members.</para>

                            <para>- It is unusual, perhaps, but I am glad to say that in this Parliament we have
                managed to get away from some of the less desirable practices of the past which made
                for bad discussion and certainly resulted in a great deal of inconvenience for
                members of the Parliament - private members and members of the Government as well.</para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>We have in this Parliament a question time practice which is almost unique.
            Certainly nothing like it occurs in the House of Commons. This Parliament is modelled on
            the Parliament at Westminster. Private members of this Parliament have very many more
            opportunities to make their own viewpoints known to the public through the Parliament
            and to the Ministers of the Government by a direct personal access to Ministers, which
            certainly does not occur in many other parts of the world. I do not say this with other
            than a commendation and an appreciation of the fact that these circumstances in this
            country do enable a private member of the Parliament to make his viewpoint known and to
            look after the affairs of his constituency. But, of course, we cannot concede to the
            member, any more than can be conceded to a government or an opposition, everything that
            he wants to do in a parliament. We are limited by time and we are limited by
            circumstance. But, by and large, this Parliament has given a very faithful, democratic
            expression to the views held inside this country by those chosen to represent the people
            in the Parliament, and I do not think we want lightly to change existing practices.</para>
                    <para>I have said that to counter any impression which may be held that we are regardless
            or unmindful of the very proper desires - indeed the rights - of private members to
            express themselves in this place. I am a parliamentarian before I am a member of a
            cabinet and, so far as I am concerned after a very long membership of this Parliament,
            this is the institution which must be supreme and which, in the final analysis, will
            determine the fate of governments. Unless a government so conducts itself that its own
            private supporters feel that they have been reasonably dealt with it will not hold the
            treasury bench for any longer than its private supporters think it deserves to do so.</para>
                    <para>Having said that, may I come back to the amendment? On the face of it ths amendment
            seems to be relatively innocuous. I do not argue that it is a matter of such fundamental
            importance that the nation would shake or governments should fall if the amendment were
            to be carried, but I do feel that it deserves more careful study than we have given it
            so far. The amendment, if carried, would affect the timing of urgency debates which an
            opposition or, for that matter, a body of government supporters may wish to bring before
            the House at a particular time. A matter which is deemed by the Parliament to be one of
            sufficient urgency to justify an interruption to other business hardly carries that
            character about it if the Parliament has previously decided that private members'
            business is to occupy supremacy of place in relation to it. After all, it is only a
            decision of the Parliament which can decide whether or not the matter of urgency is to
            be debated. Should that right of the House be either negated or in some other way
            reduced by a standing order of this kind? I, for one, wish to have much more time to
            study the implications of it than occurs readily to me in the short period that the
            amendment has been in front of us and I, for my part, ask the honorable member for
            Mackellar not to press his amendment to a vote at this point but to have the Standing
            Orders Committee study the matter and report back to the Parliament. It will be time
            enough then for the Parliament to indicate by vote how it reacts to whatever view the
            Standing Orders Committee may take of the amendment.</para>

                                on this amendment. My recollection
                was that the honorable member for Mackellar had put this point to the Standing
                Orders Committee of the last Parliament and also to the Standing Orders Committee of
                this Parliament which is reporting now. However, he has expressed his view on
                earlier occasions and the Standing Orders Committee has unanimously rejected it in
                whatever form it has come.

                    <para>The honorable member has put his proposal in a seductive form by asserting that it
            is in the interest of private members. He asserts that in some fashion urgency debates
            are not in the interests of private members. Every debate on a matter of urgency has
            been initiated by a private member. I cannot remember an urgency proposal ever having
            been raised by a Minister. The reason that the general business day has been displaced
            on a few occasions in the last couple of years is that some members, including ones who
            have spoken this evening, have abused the process. If we like to be smart, we can tie up
            the general business days for the whole of a session. Successive members, or even one
            member, can give notices of motion for the second, third, fourth and fifth days on which
            general business is called on. If he is smart, any private member can sew up general
            business for the life of a whole Parliament, and he can do that on the first day on
            which the Parliament sits.</para>
                    <para>When the Twenty-fourth Parliament first sat just over three years ago, two members
            of the Government parties - one not yet a Minister and one who had long ceased to be a
            Minister - put two notices of motion on the notice paper for general business.</para>

                general business, except the fluoridation of the Canberra water supply, could be
                debated in this House. That is an abuse of the processes of the House. Two honorable
                members precluded every other private member from debating any other matter. Can
                this matter be said to be urgent after all this time?</para>

                    <para>Let me give chapter and verse. The first notice was given on 19th September 1963,
            for 10th October of that year. A debate was held, and no vote was taken. On 19 th March
            1964 another notice was given. The motion was debated on 16th April of that year and no
            vote on the substance of the motion was taken. On 19 th May of last year a notice was
            given in a form which precluded any other general business being debated until there was
            a vote on the motion. So, at last, the House voted on it on 18th March of this year.</para>
                    <para>The honorable members who plead for the rights of private members should not
            complain when the great bulk of private members in this House - those in the Opposition
            - take the opportunity to submit what are ordinarily called urgency motions; - proposals
            to discuss matters of public importance. At least eight people have to support any such
            proposal before the subject can be debated by the House. It is not a matter of just one
            person, on his own account, putting a motion on the notice paper and preventing any
            other general business from being debated. Eight people have to rise in the House and
            support any of these urgency debates. All the members who have so risen have been
            private members. If honorable members do not think that the matter is important, they
            can quell the debate. The truth is that no honorable member can say that any of these
            urgency debates were not supported by private members. In fact, they were spoken to by
            private members on both sides of the House. Every one of the matters raised in those
            debates was more urgent and more important than the reiterated question of fluoridation.</para>
                    <para>The honorable member for Mackellar has put his proposal, in one form or another, for
            some time. The Standing Orders Committee has rejected it unanimously. My party has
            considered the report of the Standing Orders Committee on each occasion. Each report has
            been given plenty of notice in the Caucus and before it has come before the Parliament.
            We believe that in this respect the honorable member for Mackellar is serving the
            interests not of private members in general but of a handful of dissidents like himself.</para>

                                - As a member of the Parliament for a good many years, both as a member of the
                Opposition and as a supporter of the Government, I have steadfastly advocated that
                there should be more time for private members' speeches and advocacies in this
                chamber. So I think I should say a few words on this subject now. I do not want to
                go into the finer details that have been put forward by the Leader of the House
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline>
                                and the Deputy Leader of the

                                I agree with most of
                what they have said. As a matter of fact, the mover of this amendment told me that
                he was moving it in order to get more time for private members. I said that I
                believed that private members should have more time. Therefore, I feel that I should
                state my case clearly now.

                        As has been stated, mainly private members take part in urgency debates. I want to
            make only one point. Actually, it has been highlighted already by the honorable member
            for Franklin
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkinder).</inline>
                        He said that matters
            covered by the amendment do not take the proceedings of the House out of the hands of
            the Government, and that if the Government suspended the Standing Orders when it became
            necessary, it could then bring on whatever business it liked on days listed as Grievance
            Days. However, if the members who will now support the amendment voted against the
            suspension of the Standing Orders, it is possible that the proceedings of the House
            would be taken out of the hands of the Government. As a Government supporter and as one
            who appreciates that the Government should be in charge of the proceedings of the House,
            I believe that that would not be in the best interests of the Parliament. I believe that
            private members should have more time and also believe that we should advocate that
            continually in this chamber. To the best of my ability, 1 have been doing that and
            impressing on the Leader of the House and the Government the fact that private members
            have important matters to bring forward. However, I do not think that a responsible
            member pf this Parliament - I hope that I am such and I hope that everyone else is, too
            - can say that after a government has been elected with a majority the proceedings of
            the House and the running of the Parliament should be taken out of its hands through a
            vote on a subject which is not vital national policy.

                            . - In about 38 years of parliamentary experience, I have never heard a more
              hypocritical, silly and stupid argument than the one that was put forward by the
              Deputy Leader of the Opposition
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam).</inline>
                            He
              concentrated all of it on the matter that was raised by the honorable member for
              Moreton
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen),</inline>
                            namely, fluoridation. I
              remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the Opposition voted in favour of the
              motion moved by the honorable member for Moreton, yet tonight he uses that as an
              argument for saying that private members should not have their rights in this
              Parliament. After all, this involves one and a half hours on Thursdays. I am one
              member of this House who has been frustrated because the Labour Party - the Opposition
              - 'has felt embarrassed at a motion I have put on the notice paper and has
              introduced a matter of urgency for discussion in order to try to prevent my motion
              being debated. This has been done several times, not only to me but to other honorable
              members.

                        The Treasurer

                        does not think it is very important; he has left the
            chamber. I feel that in this House private members' rights have been abrogated to
            such an extent that if we do not stick up for them soon none of them will be left. We
            have had a cataclysmic period when we have been unemployed, and have met a month later
            than in the ordinary course of events. We have ordered troops into the front line in
            Borneo and yet have met a month later. I feel that we are in danger of losing our rights
            as private members and therefore I support what I believe is a very sensible amendment,
            moved by the honorable member for Mackellar, that private members - for only one and a
            half hours on Thursdays - should have their rights preserved.
                    </para>
                    <para>It is all very well to say that we can discuss matters during the Budget debate or
            during a Supply debate, but everybody knows that subjects of more importance arc
            introduced generally on Grievance Day or as motions by private members. We have been
            told we can discuss matters on the motion for the adjournment of the House on Wednesday
            or Thursday night, but every honorable member knows that this motion is rarely moved
            before 10.30 p.m. It would be much better if private members had their rights on
            Thursday mornings for one and a half hours. This would not stop an urgency debate being
            initiated after that period has elapsed. I hope the private members in this House, and
            the Minister too, will see the sense, reason and logic in the amendment and will see
            that private members are not reduced in this House to just a voting peg on which to hang
            a hat.</para>

                            .- I want to get the record straight: I did not vote for the motion introduced by
              the honorable member for Moreton
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen)</inline>
                            about fluoridation, just to get it off the notice paper. I voted for it because I
              believed in it. I am against fluoridation, and I do not care who knows it. Honorable
              members are confused by the amendment moved by the honorable member for Mackellar
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth).</inline>
                            It is bound up with
              parliamentary tactics. Sometimes when the Opposition seeks to introduce matters of
              urgency for debate the Government is reluctant to make time available on a
              broadcasting day but does so on private members' day. Because I am in opposition I
              am happy to have the debate on that day. I believe an urgency debate is important and
              probably paramount over anything a private member might want to raise. I say this only
              in respect of Opposition proposals. We look upon the time for such debates as extra
              time. It may be that the Parliament will decide that there should be no urgency
              debates on private members' day, and perhaps we will all be satisfied with that. I
              think sufficient time could be found during the sittings of the Parliament for urgency
              debates to be held on other days. However, the general principle behind what the
              honorable member for Mackellar says is quite right. The same applies to what the
              honorable member for Chisholm
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Wilfrid Kent
                Hughes)</inline>
                            said. We must not do anything as a parliament to further reduce the
              time during which private members can raise matters of importance to their
              electorates, or even national issues. We must protect their rights.

                        I am a member of the Standing Orders Committee and I am not happy about the
            situation. I believe that the Treasurer
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold
              Holt)</inline>
                        was correct when he suggested - and my Deputy Leader
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam)</inline>
                        agreed with him - that further time should
            be given to examining the amendment in its present form rather than voting on it
            tonight. I believe that the Treasurer virtually guaranteed that he would be prepared to
            refer the amendment to the Standing Orders Committee for further examination. I agree
            with his suggestion, because the proposal in its present form was not considered by the
            Committee when it unanimously rejected a previous suggestion of the honorable member for
            Mackellar.
                    </para>
                    <para>We should not indiscriminately dash the hopes of private members in this House. The
            Government has ridden roughshod over private members on occasions. When we on this side
            were in government, we did the same thing. All governments get the idea that they are
            all-powerful and that the private member is just a nameless unit in a great mass. I
            oppose this growing tendency in this and other parliaments. The amendment pinpoints what
            I would call the sacredness of private members' time. We have private members'
            day, question time and the motion for the adjournment of the House when we can raise
            matters affecting our electorates, but although the Parliament is growing constantly,
            more time is not being made available to private members. We must watch this situation
            and must not permit any more erosion of private members' time. This debate may serve
            as a warning to the Government to keep private members' day inviolate.</para>

                            has some germs of truth in his amendment, but it should be
              considered more deeply from both sides of the House. This is one of the few occasions
              since I have been here when there has been an attempt to discuss matters objectively
              from both sides, although I think that the honorable member for Chisholm
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes)</inline>
                            departed from that high level
              in his remarks. The fact is that private members have very little time in which to
              place business before the House. I am rather unsympathetic to the crocodile tears of
              honorable members opposite on this question of private members' time, particularly
              as those who were here last night voted to gag me. This is the point to be considered.
              It is no good coming in here at moments like this, full of high dudgeon about the way
              private members are treated, when on almost every occasion that I can recall, almost

                            and other members of the Ministry when

              members opposite means that they have had a change of heart, I am all for it.

                        and the Treasurer one would think that this
            was the most free-flowing parliament in existence. What happened last year? During 12
            months there were nine occasions on which General Business could be called on. It was
            called on three times and superseded on six occasions. None of this was brought about by
            actions of members on this side of the House. Of the six occasions on which General
            Business was superseded, on one occasion it was due to a debate on a matter of urgent
            public importance and on five occasions due to Government Business being dealt with.
                    </para>
                    <para>This matter should be deferred and sent back to the Standing Orders Committee for
            further consideration. The matter should then be referred to the parties for
            consideration of the contingent measures necessary to ensure that private members'
            business can be brought on as frequently as possible.</para>
                    <para>One of the things that concerns the people of Australia as much as this Parliament
            itself is the way the Parliament meets. Today is the eighth day on which the Parliament
            has met this year. Prior to Parliament's meeting on 16th March it last met in
            November last year. I am not aware of efforts by honorable members opposite to call the
            Parliament together earlier than March of this year. The honorable member for Chisholm
            may have been attempting to have the Parliament called together earlier. It may be worth
            while amending the Standing Orders to provide that Parliament shall be summoned if 75
            per cent, of members wish it, despite the feelings of the Government on the subject.</para>

                the House, which is incidental to the running of Parliament, there are many measures
                we could consider which would give to the Parliament greater control over the times
                at which it meets and the occasions on which it meets, and which might prevent the
                long and detrimental recesses which have become a feature of this Government's

                            .- I am thoroughly in agreement with the honorable member for Mackellar
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth).</inline>
                            He has spoken a lot of sense tonight,
              as he often does. Much of the time of this Parliament is wasted. I refer first to the
              length of speeches. This is governed somewhat by the batting order and whether you can
              obtain the best time. Another matter which influences speeches is whether the
              proceedings of the House are being broadcast. When this happens honorable members wish
              to make the most of their opportunity to be heard on the air. Time is wasted, also, in
              travelling. Some of us can return to our electorates at week-ends, but others cannot.
              Those who can return to their electorates work here for three days and go home to
              their electorates for four days. But those who cannot return to their electorates work
              here for three days and then have virtually four days holiday in Canberra.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        It is alleged that a private member can have his say on Grievance Day but the
            Treasurer
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt),</inline>
                        who is a great friend
            of mine, has given four reasons why private members should not have their little say on
            Grievance Day. First, he said that we have an opportunity to air our grievances during
            the debate on the Budget. Now, the Budget debate takes place in August. If we wish to
            air a matter affecting our constituents which happened in September we must wait until
            the following August in order to do so. By then, of course, the matter probably is
            stale. The Treasurer has said that we may raise matters during the debate on the motion
            for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. Well, supposing a matter cropped up in July
            last. There being no Address-in-Reply debate this year, almost two years at least would
            elapse before the opportunity arose to raise the matter in this way.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        Then we have the debate on the motion to adjourn the House. The honorable member for
            Chisholm said that this usually takes place at about 10.30 p.m., but I think he was
            looking on the bright side. As far as I am concerned the debate usually takes place at
            11.30 p.m. or after midnight, and that is not a reasonable opportunity for raising
            matters. At such times not many members are present in the chamber and, quite likely,
            the Minister concerned with the matter will not be present. In those circumstances a
            member does not have much redress. The Treasurer said, also, that we could air our
            grievances during question time. I think you,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir,
              will</inline>
                        agree that if we were to air the grievances of our constituents at
            question time you would soon rule us out of order.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        So we get back to the subject of what has been taking up members' time on
            Grievance Day. Generally speaking it has been debates on matters of urgent public
            importance. I submit that such debates do not involve the airing of grievances of our
            constituents but of party grievances and that one person is selected by the Opposition
            to raise a matter just to waste time. The honorable member for Mackellar proposed an
            amendment to provide that matters of urgent public importance could be debated after
            grievance time and that if the matter is of sufficient importance, which it seldom is,
            the debate could continue into the afternoon. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam)</inline>
                        was naturally opposed to the
            amendment because as things now stand he and his party may waste the time of the
            Parliament by bringing up something of a semipolitical nature.
                    </para>
                    <para>The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made a great point about eight members being
            required to support a debate on a matter of urgent public importance. I would like to
            see the day when one of these debates is supported by only eight members. Opposition
            members are so well regimented to waste our time that every one of them, except one who
            may be asleep, supports these debates when they come before the House. It is not much to
            ask that private members be allowed 10 minutes each on every second Thursday to raise
            matters affecting their constituents. Every member would deal with a different subject.
            Many subjects would be before the Parliament instead of the one subject that hitherto
            has been brought up simply for political purposes in the way of a debate on a matter of
            urgent public importance.</para>

                            .- As I am reminded by a colleague, the honorable member for Flinders
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lindsay)</inline>
                            is the only member of the Parliament who
              can sleep during question time. It is said on this side of the House that the good
              Grenadier
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Major, who</inline>
                            is a friend of mine, has
              never been the same since the Grenadier Guards staged a mutiny in Singapore. It is
              interesting to see tonight a full line-up of what we might call the " Government
              rebels ", in full flight and rebellion on this great issue of the Standing Orders.
              What a contrast this is to what took place in the last Parliament, when a rebellion of
              this kind would have brought a good government to the country. But tonight rebels like
              the honorable member for Chisholm
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Wilfrid Kent
                Hughes)</inline>
                            have been very forthright. The honorable member said that he will
              rebel against the findings of the Standing Orders Committee. What a magnificent
              gesture. Tonight we see behind the honorable member perhaps the greatest open group of
              rebels in the Government's ranks, standing on the great issues involved in the
              report we are discussing and the amendment before the Parliament.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        Let us look at the honorable members who have spoken. The honorable member for
            Chisholm has spoken on this issue. He has forgotten the rebellion that should have taken
            him to the cross benches. After all, aid to Indonesia evidently is not nearly as
            important as the Standing Orders are, so he is back with the Liberal Party again. Other
            honorable members who have spoken are the honorable members for Franklin
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Falkinder),</inline>
                        Moreton
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Killen),</inline>
                        Bradfield
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turner),</inline>
                        Angas
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Giles)</inline>
                        and Flinders. Then we had our old
            friend and rebel of days gone by, the honorable member for Mallee
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull).</inline>
                        He has again stepped forth in his old
            colours, and has very gently pleaded for the rights of private members. These honorable
            members suggest that Opposition members should support their efforts to upset the report
            of the Standing Orders Committee, although the Opposition has endorsed it. When has it
            been the responsibility of the Opposition to support some of the political scatterbrains
            on the Government side who have spoken tonight? We are a responsible Opposition. The
            honorable members for Moreton and Chisholm and others endeavour to tie up the notice
            paper all the year round, but tonight, in the guise of protecting the rights of private
            members, they seek to gain the support of the Opposition.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">But they cannot expect our support on these issues. The Opposition
            believes in the rights of private members, and sees behind this proposal a sinister move
            further to whittle away the rights of members on this side of the House who seek to
            express their views in their capacity as private members.</para>
                    <para>
                        As the honorable member for Wills
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bryant)</inline>
                        said, one would have thought tonight that the Treasurer
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Harold Holt)</inline>
                        was a great democrat who never prevented any one from speaking.
            I have here the report of the Clerk of the House which gives a summary in statistical
            form of the work of the Parliament last year. It shows that last year there were 40
            closures, or 40 occasions on which the gag was moved in this House. All the rebels who
            have tonight thundered into the House, claiming that they are defending the rights of
            private members, have voted to stop Opposition members from expressing their views as
            private members. Did you ever hear anything so silly or hypocritical? We will not
            support these proposals because honorable members opposite are not sincere in submitting
            them. They seek to go before the people as rebels against their own Government on the
            great principle of improving the Standing Orders of the Parliament. If honorable members
            opposite want to help private members, they should vote with us when the gag is being
            used against us. When great issues of defence and national affairs come before the
            Parliament and we are stopped from speaking by the gag that is so ruthlessly used, let
            the honorable members for Chisholm and Moreton and others rise in their places and see
            that justice is done to private members on this side of the Parliament.
                    </para>
                    <para>I agree with those who say that private members are restricted. The Government
            allows a debate on the adjournment only when it cannot possibly avoid such a debate.
            Honorable members should be given the right to speak on the adjournment every night of
            the week, if they wish to do so. The Treasurer, in his most generous way, said that
            members can speak on the adjournment of the House twice a week, on Wednesdays and
            Thursdays. How jolly decent of him! It is really good of him to make that suggestion. On
            two nights a week, for about half an hour, members of the Parliament, including those on
            this side of the House who represent roughly 50 per cent, of the electors, can make a
            couple of speeches, and the Treasurer says he is generous. The motion that the House
            adjourn should be moved not later than about 9.30 or 10 on certain nights and any member
            who wishes to do so should be permitted to speak on issues confronting the nation and of
            interest to his electorate. There can be no justification at all for keeping us here
            until the dead of night so that we may be restricted and our rights as private members
            whittled away.</para>
                    <para>Honorable members on the opposite side of the House, who are trying to get us
            tosupport proposals that have been pushed into the Parliament hurriedly, would be doing
            a greater service to the Parliament if they spoke up at meetings of their parties and
            insisted on the rights of members being preserved. This is supposed to be a democracy.
            From time to time we read in the newspapers that members of the Liberal Party can do as
            they like. They would be acting for the good of the Parliament and for the good of their
            own party if they insisted upon the rights of private members being observed,
            particularly during adjournment debates and on Grievance Day. In the report to which I
            have referred, the Clerk of the House said that last year Grievance Day was called on
            only one day. No doubt this was because the Government did not wish us to discuss some
            matters and because the honorable members for Moreton and Chisholm and others sought to
            tie up the notice paper with matters that the Government did not support, that the
            Opposition did not support and that only a few honorable members wanted to debate. When
            the rebels are put on the spot they find that the picture is not as rosy as they have
            painted it.</para>
                    <para>
                        I mention these matters so that the Parliament and the people will know that
            tonight, under the guise of doing justice to private members and providing more
            opportunities for honorable members to speak, these honorable members have made certain
            proposals which have behind them the sinister motive of gaining special benefits for a
            few selected members on the other side of the House at the expense of Opposition
            members. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Whitlam)</inline>
                        expressed the point of view of honorable members on this side when
            he said that this was a subterfuge and that we could not support it because its real
            intention was hidden. As one who has supported the recommendations of the Standing
            Orders Committee, I think we ought to reject the proposal that has been put forward by
            the honorable member for Mackellar
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth).</inline>
                        He would make a greater contribution to the preservation of the rights of private
            members if he supported some of the views that I and other Opposition members have
            expressed tonight instead of endeavouring to foist upon us an amendment that has a
            meaning that is entirely different from the meaning it purports to have.

                            .- The honorable member for Grayndler

                            can never be counted on to pour oil on troubled waters. I do not know
              whether I will be any more successful, but I would like to try to inject a little bit
              of balanced thought into this matter. The Treasurer
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Harold Holt)</inline>
                            suggested that it would be reasonable to refer the report back
              to the Standing Orders Committee for some further consideration in the light of the
              points that have been made tonight. Honorable members should realise that there was a
              great deal of truth in the statement he made about the opportunities that are afforded
              to private members during the normal course of business of the House to raise matters
              of particular concern and interest to them. With respect to the honorable member for
              Flinders
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lindsay),</inline>
                            I think he rather
              distorted the Treasurer's meaning. The honorable member suggested that the times
              that the Treasurer had said were available to honorable members were not suitable
              times for the kinds of matters that private members wanted to bring up.

                national issues. The Opposition and the</para>

                    <para class="block">Government are organised on party lines for the purpose of debating
            these great national issues. Of necessity, the hobby horses that all of us have and
            would like to ride at times must take second place in the National Parliament. Every
            private member in this place has a fundamental duty, as a private member, to have views,
            to express them and to vote according to his views on the great national issues which
            the Government or the Opposition choose to raise.</para>
                    <para>As the Treasurer pointed out, if a private member feels strongly on some point, he
            has the opportunity to raise it at question time every day that the House meets. He has
            the opportunity to raise it during general debates, such as those on the Budget and on
            the Address in Reply, and on other occasions, such as during debates on ministerial
            statements on a variety of subjects when a very wide field is open to honorable members.
            The recent debate on foreign affairs opened the whole field of foreign affairs the world
            over. On many occasions a private member has opportunity to introduce into debate or
            questions he may ask in this House matters on which he has strong personal views. I
            suggest that it is only the commonsense and tradition of this House that has established
            this pattern under which an important priority is given to Government business and the
            great national issues - some of which may, indeed, be raised by the Opposition. If the
            views expressed by any one member on any of these occasions are expressed with
            sufficient conviction, persuasion or force they will be taken up by one party or another
            - by the Opposition or the Government - and will become an issue which concerns every
            member of the House. Those are things which it does not require a Grievance Day debate,
            or a private member's motion, to bring up. They are things which become issues for
            the whole House.</para>
                    <para>I suggest that this aspect has been considered by the Standing Orders Committee - an
            all party committee of this Houseand that the Standing Orders Committee has realised
            that the Government and Opposition have vital interests. Private members should have a
            fundamental interest in seeing that the important business of the nation is carried on
            and is not unnecessarily or unduly interfered with by our giving an undue proportion to
            the kind of things that some individual members might be obsessed with in their own
            little way. Private members, of course, should not be denied the right to express
            themselves on matters that they consider important, but they should have a due sense of
            proportion in relation to them.</para>
                    <para>
                        I fully support the suggestion by the Treasurer
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
              Harold Holt)</inline>
                        that if it is considered that a proper sense of proportion has
            not been given to these things the Standing Orders Committee is the body that should
            look at the matter. It should not be left only to honorable members who habitually think
            that they have matters which they should raise, but which the rest of the House does not
            recognise as being of paramount importance. I think that the Standing Orders Committee
            might reconsider this point in the light of the arguments put forward tonight.

                            .- I think the point made by the Minister for Shipping and Transport
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Freeth)</inline>
                            is very important. The deficiencies of this
              House lie much more in the deficiencies in its debating of important national
              questions than in the deficiencies that I admit do exist in the debating of things
              that are of personal importance to some member or other. I recognise the significance
              of the participation of the individual member in the affairs of this House, and of the
              importance of the individual member in the whole tradition of democracy and democratic
              debate as we know it. I am not understressing that. I recognise that a Parliament of
              this kind must provide good and adequate opportunities for the individual member to
              submit matters that are of importance to him. I think that the opportunities could be
              greater than they are in this House. Rather than take up time on this amendment moved
              by the honorable member for Mackellar
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Wentworth),</inline>
                            and talk in the way that he proposes we talk, what the House
              needs more, and what has a higher priority, is consideration - and it could well be
              given by the Standing Orders Committee - to making it possible for the House to come
              more closely to grips with matters of national importance.

                    <para>The Minister mentioned that we had a debate last week and during part of this week
            on foreign affairs. The striking thing about that debate was that the House hardly
            communicated with itself on the matters that were raised. Honorable members tended to
            come into the House and put forward the views that they held. They were largely party
            views. There was hardly any exchange of ideas or influence across the House. The
            characteristic feature of that debate was almost a complete lack of communication
            between members. This is something we ought seriously to consider. I suppose that one of
            the most important features in that debate last week was whether or not, and the extent
            to which, there was aggression from North Vietnam. The great events that were disturbing
            us and the world at that time were taking place because of the submission of a White
            Paper by the United States, which stated that there was aggression from the North.</para>

                                - As far as I know this matter was not considered by anybody in that debate.
                There was no examination, either critical examination or examination of approval, by
                anybody on the other side of the House of this basic document which had been
                submitted. I have a suggestion to make to the honorable member for Mackellar and the
                honorable member for Flinders
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lindsay)</inline>
                                -
                &amp; member whom we very rarely hear - which they could follow if they are really
                concerned to find a way for the individual member to make submissions, initiate
                realistic debate, exchange influences and communicate with other members. The two
                honorable members, and some others on the other side, sometimes join in some
                pointless, ineffective, sham revolt from the other side of the House. In doing that,
                they no doubt satisfy themselves and compensate themselves for the fact that they
                have to remain rather dumbly in line for the rest of the year. If they were really
                concerned to find a way of constructive expression, instead of this expedient of
                private members' motions on a Thursday morning, when an individual member here
                and there may deal with matters for which he gets publicity in his local newspaper
                and some personal publicity, they would be concerned, as the Minister mentioned a
                few moments ago, and which I emphasise now, to find a way of constructive
                expression.

                    <para>I think that the honorable members who have spoken from the other side of the House
            are, with one or two exceptions, simply following the old line that they follow every
            now and again of trying to give the impression that they are freethinkers and radicals
            and are willing to speak out, as they have done this evening, but with very little
            effect indeed. We have had a revolt on the other side that is going to fizzle very
            ingloriously before the evening is out.</para>

                            .- At the commencement of the debate I really thought, and I still think, that
              there is an enormous amount of merit in what the honorable member for Mackellar
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline>
                            has said. In fact, I think there
              was a good deal in what the honorable member for Flinders
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lindsay)</inline>
                            said also. After hearing the contributions from members on
              the other side of the House, and realising their insincerity - naked and unashamed -
              especially that of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Whitlam)</inline>
                            and the honorable member for Grayndler
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly),</inline>
                            my views were confirmed. I believe that to vote in favour of
              this motion would simply play into the hand of the Opposition, because I believe that
              recently we have seen how the Opposition uses so-called urgency debates to bring
              forward the most fatuous matters.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>We all know that the party line over there is very strict, and that once an urgency
            proposal for discussion has been concocted in the party room - and obviously in haste,
            because the Opposition's urgency debates are usually ill conceived - honorable
            members opposite pop up one after the other like jacks-in-the-box as soon as the latch
            is pulled back, and they have their say in accordance with the party line. Usually
            urgency debates are simply a manoeuvre used by the Opposition to stifle the business of
            the House.</para>
                    <para>While I strongly believe that every effort should be made to accord honorable
            members every opportunity to record their grievances and have them debated, I believe
            also that there is already little enough time available for the business of this House
            for us to be able to occupy further time with grievance matters. The amount of time
            given to them is fair. An honorable member interjects to ask about my grievances. I have
            not any grievances. I am so proud of the record of this House that I believe that
            occasions for grievances are very rare indeed. As I say, I am confirmed in my views by
            the utter insincerity of some who have taken part in this debate. In fact, as I observed
            the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I was very strongly reminded of the chameleon and
            its ability to change its colours. I was reminded, too of Austin Dobson's poem "
            The Ladies of St. James's " which says, amongst other things -</para>

                    <para class="block">At the moment, this rosy hue, I believe, is burgeoning into a full
            flowered parlour pink. This simply underlines the fact that urgency debates which occupy
            the time of the House are subterfuges to obstruct Government business. Therefore, I
            think that if we vote for the amendment moved by the honorable member for Mackellar, we
            are going to obstruct still further the business of the House. But I do urge that the
            recommendation of the Treasurer be given effect and that this matter be referred to the
            Standing Orders Committee in order that something can be done to circumvent this wilful
            obstruction of the business of the House by honorable members opposite.</para>

                            I would not have risen to
              take any part in this debate were it not for the idle and wilful misuse of the word

                            Let me remind the honorable member who throws that word about
              so blandly that even if he is new in this place he has been here long enough to know
              what has been the normal procedure in considering proposed amendments to the Standing
              Orders of this House. Nobody knows that better than the honorable member for Mackellar
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline>
                            who, I feel I can say quite
              honestly, has submitted more propositions to the Committee than any other honorable
              member of this House. The honorable member for Mackellar knows full well the procedure
              that is followed by the Committee. He knows that any proposed amendment that is
              submitted is well considered by the Committee, the members of which are appointed by
              this House. When the honorable member for Bowman talks about sin cerity, he should
              remember that the Prime Minister
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert
                Menzies)</inline>
                            is a member of the Standing Orders Committee. The Prime Minister
              does not deal with the business of this House in an idle fashion. He is just as
              sincere about the work that comes back from the Standing Orders Committee as is the
              Deputy Leader of the Opposition

                        Leader of the Opposition, who is a member of

            side of the House who at this stage seeks an extension beyond the limits that have
            already been decided by the Standing Orders Committee. This is the basis which honorabe

                                - We have heard a lot concerning the rights of members and the wasting of time
                in this House. I have never seen such an example of the wasting of time as what has
                taken place tonight. There is machinery to deal with every kind of subject matter of
                this character. Let me repeat what I said earlier: There is nobody who knows this
                better than the honorable member who has moved this amendment. He knows that
                consistently year in and year out he has submitted matters, many of which have been
                accepted, to the Standing Orders Committee. The honorable member for Mallee
                                <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Turnbull)</inline>
                                does this, too. He is happy about the
                adoption by the Standing Orders Committee of a proposal which suits his point of
                view.
                            </para>

                    <para>
                        The Standing Orders Committee, in view of the composition of it, is in a better
            position to consider what is in the best interests of all members of this Parliament
            than is Parliament itself when it engages in a debate of the kind we have witnessed
            tonight. I say to the honorable member for Mackellar that I agree entirely with what has
            been put by my friend, the honorable member for Yarra
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. J.
              F. Cairns).</inline>
                        This Parliament is not the place for. hobby horse riding. This
            Parliament is the place for the determination of national problems. So often, even in
            ordinary debates - and I suffer from this malady - honorable members forget that we are
            sent to this Parliament to deal with national questions. We forget that the government
            of the day is handling national problems. We are prone very often to come to this place
            - and this applies to all honorable members - to ride our own hobby horses. All we ask
            for and all we seek is a pair of spurs to enable us to ride our hobby horses more
            vigorously than we would in the normal course of events. We do so because we want to
            suit our own personal ends. The Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the
            Minister for Shipping and Transport
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Freeth)</inline>
                        spoke sound common sense when they said that this Parliament, if it did its job, should
            pay attention to national matters and not pay so much attention to hobby horse matters.
            If we do so, this Parliament will stand higher in public esteem. The members of this
            Parliament are not held in very high esteem by the public. One of the reasons, in my
            view, is that honorable members are too inclined to get on to their own hobby horses and
            talk about matters which affect themselves instead of dealing with the matters that
            affect Australia, its people and its development.
                    </para>
                    <para>I say to the honorable member for Mackellar that he knew full well, when he was
            having this amendment circulated, that there is a proper procedure to be followed. He
            knows that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and
            the rank and file members of this Parliament believe that the Standing Orders Committee
            will do the best that can be done if some change in the Standing Orders is necessary. We
            are dealing with the report of the Committee now. The proper course for this Parliament
            to adopt is to allow the suggestion of the honorable member for Mackellar to go to the
            Standing Orders Committee. Let the matter then be considered at the party level and be
            returned to the Parliament, if it is adopted at the party level, for endorsement. We
            should follow that course instead of indulging in the kind of debate that we have had
            tonight. If we want to get the best out of parliamentary procedure and the Standing
            Orders Committee which we have appointed, all the suggestions which rightly come from
            the members of that Committee should be properly- considered. Finally, I say that some
            of the words that have been uttered in this debate about the need for national thinking
            should sink into the minds of most of us, and we should try, if we can, to lift the
            level of this Parliament and its debates much higher in the opinion of the people than
            we have done over the last decade.</para>

                            honorable members who have
              supported this amendment have been variously branded as rebels or scatterbrains. I do
              not consider myself to be a rebel and if one has to be a scatterbrain to support the
              amendment, I have joined the ranks of the scatterbrains tonight. I am doing so on a
              matter of principle. It is not because I have any chip on my shoulder. It is not
              because I have wanted to make much use of the Grievance Day debates on Thursday
              mornings. I think most honorable members recognise that T do not speak a great deal in
              this House, nor do I think that anybody can say that I consistently join the handful
              of members who might vote against the Government with any regularity. I do believe
              that we should preserve that hour and a half on Thursday morning for private members.
              I am a great believer in the philosophy that the wheel turns. One of these days - it
              will probably not be in my time - the people who are sitting on this side of the House
              will be in Opposition and those who are now in Opposition will be on the Government
              side. I believe that urgency debates, which frequently take up the time of private
              members on Thursday mornings, have been highly organised. I am not criticising the
              Opposition for that because we would probably do the same thing under similar
              circumstances. I am not accusing honorable members opposite of insincerity; they are
              merely using the forms of the House to get across their own particular philosophy. As
              I said, I do not blame them, but the wheel turns and I believe that the day will come
              when many honorable members opposite who are now wanting to retain the right to move
              debates on matters of urgency on Thursday mornings will be on this side of the House
              and will be crying out for the freedom of private members' day. If the day ever
              comes when I am sitting in Opposition then, if I should want to speak on Thursday
              morning - on Grievance Day - I do not want to feel myself frustrated by a motion for a
              debate on a matter of urgency from the other side of the House.

                    <para>Unfortunately, I understand that we have not the right to vote on the question of
            referring the matter back to the Standing Orders Committee. I understand that we express
            our wish by standing up to be counted and, whether I am a rebel or a scatterbrain, I
            believe in the preservation of private members' rights, and, for that reason,I
            intend to support the amendment.</para>

                                - I was not successful in my campaign. Although every honorable member knew that
                some members - in fact, quite a number of them - were reading every word of their
                speeches, when the matter was referred to
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.
                  Speaker</inline>
                                he said he was not sure whether the member then addressing the
                Chair was reading his speech or referring to copious notes. I have fought for a long
                time for recognition of this Standing Order, believing that members should make
                their speeches without reading them for the simple reason that, as I said, to do so
                was representation by proxy and any member could get anyone in the community to
                write his speech and he could then come into this House and read it. In that case
                the speech would be the expressed opinion not of the member but of somebody outside
                this House. I stated cases in which speeches by different members were so uniform
                that I suspected that they had been written by the one man. This happened on two or
                three occasions for two or three different members.
                            </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Although I advocated for a number of years that Standing Order No. 62 should be
            complied with, I found that I had no support from any quarter. I suggested that even if
            it were necessary in introducing a bill for a Minister to be allowed to read his speech,
            other members who engaged in the debate should make their speeches without reading them.
            The stage was reached in this place that when I wanted to quote from a report members of
            the Opposition would rise and say: "The honorable member is reading his speech
            ". This attitude has been exhibited already tonight by honorable members. When I
            quoted from the report of the Standing Orders Committee a few moments ago some honorable
            member said: "You are reading your speech ". I came to realise, as honorable
            members must admit is the position, that if a member can read his speech when the
            Standing Orders state that he shall not read it, there is no sincerity in the House. If
            there is one thing that we require from this House of the Parliament of the Commonwealth
            it is sincerity.</para>
                    <para>
                        At that stage I immediately took the view that if 1 could not have this Standnig
            Order adhered to it should be eliminated. Consequently, I made a special report to the
            Standing Orders Committee asking that it be eliminated. Tonight the honorable member for
            Blaxland
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison)</inline>
                        said that I should
            be pleased because the Standing Orders Committee had accepted a submission from me. But
            the acceptance by the Committee of the submission was only a second best. What I wanted
            was the observance of this Standing Order. When I could not get that, it became a matter
            of whether members wanted to go on reading their speeches, with everyone knowing all the
            time that they were reading them, and nothing would be done about the practice.
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        My campaign began years ago when I still travelled to Melbourne by train. Passengers
            would say to me, " That was a splendid speech in the House of Representatives last
            night by " - and they would name a certain member. I knew all the time that it might
            have been good reading, because the honorable member had read this speech. Yet if I were
            to say to people that a number of the speeches made in Canberra by Ministers or even by
            the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Menzies)</inline>
                        were read
            they would be amazed. If they have not visited Canberra and have not seen what happens
            they are of the opinion that a member stands up and speaks his mind - not the mind of
            someone else. It is not his own speech and an expression of his own mind; it is the mind
            and words of someone in some other part of the country in a speech that has been brought
            to Canberra.

                    <quote>
                        <para>As Parliamentary practice recognises and accepts that, whenever there is reason
              for precision of statement such as on the second reading of a bill, particularly those
              of a complex or technical nature or in ministerial or other statements, it is
              reasonable to allow the reading of speeches and, as the difficulty of applying the
              rule against the reading of speeches is obvious, e.g. "reference to copious notes
              ", it is proposed to omit the Standing Order.</para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">What of the future? I think the House will accept that suggestion and
            support the Standing Orders Committee. Although over the years in this House I have
            strongly advocated that this Standing Order prohibiting the reading of speeches be
            adhered to, what will happen now if my suggestion that the Standing Order be eliminated
            is accepted? It will mean that any honorable member can read a speech. Surely, after all
            this, even I will be able to read a speech without any honorable member saying that I am
            reading it.</para>
                    <para>
                        A few minutes ago, the honorable member for Grayndler
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly),</inline>
                        with whom I have crossed swords on many occasions in this place,
            interjected: "The honorable member for Mallee would go better if he did read his
            speech ". The interjection suggests that he thinks that I would make a better speech
            if I read it. There is one thing about this matter; when I make a speech in this House
            it is my speech and it is sincere. But when a member comes to what he thinks is the end
            of a sentence and stops, suddenly realises that it is not the end of a sentence and has
            to continue because someone has written the speech for himhe does not know when a.
            sentence begins and ends - he is not expressing his own view on a subject. All honorable
            members should now be satisfied. I felt miserable about the Standing Order not being
            adhered to. Now I take the other view and say: " Let us have sincerity ". I
            think every one of us wants sincerity, so I ask every honorable member to support the
            Standing Orders Committee and eliminate this Standing Order that brought only
            insincerity to the Parliament of the Commonwealth.

                                well, I thought I was. I
                thank you for your tolerance. I wish to make just a few remarks in reference to what
                the honorable member for Mallee has said. It is true that that honorable member has
                conducted a campaign against the reading of speeches, but it is also true that,
                although he may not have read his own speeches, time and time again he reads at
                great length passages from speeches reported in " Hansard ". He has done so
                for many years, and most of his speeches have been taken up with long and tedious
                extracts from " Hansard ". To all intents and purposes, under the guise of
                making speeches that are not read, he reads other speeches from " Hansard "
                to supplement his remarks.

                        Rarely have I heard such a glaring indictment of the Liberal Party's research
            group than that made tonight by the honorable member for Mallee. It is known that all
            the information given in the read speeches that he quotes is provided by research groups
            outside the Parliament. Practically every member of the Liberal Party, and members of
            the Country Party to a great extent, have used this material in the speeches they have
            read in this Parliament from time to time. Honorable members on this side of the
            Parliament are fully informed on the matters of the day. Practically without exception,
            we have made speeches which have not been read, although we certainly have copious
            notes. However, time and again, on banking legislation, international affairs and
            intricate economic matters, we have heard speeches read word for word by honorable
            members opposite from the honorable member for Moreton

                    <para>Tonight the attack made by the honorable member for Mallee was not levelled at the
            Opposition, and it was not levelled at the reading of speeches. It was a sinister attack
            by the Country Party on the prepared speeches which are presented in this Parliament by
            members of the Liberal Party.</para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may excuse himself as much as he likes. But we have seen
                the research men around. It is understood that in New South Wales alone many people
                are employed by the Liberal Party to provide speeches for Liberal members of the
                Parliament. They are engaged at great expense for that purpose. Some of the prepared
                speeches have some substance in them, although many that are read in this Parliament
                are read very poorly, but that does not alter the fact that they are read. There is
                no doubt that members of the Liberal Party, who have sought to have this provision
                removed from the Standing Orders, will find that many of their highly paid research
                men will be wasted unless members are able to read their speeches.</para>

                    <para>I do not want to say any more. I rose merely to put the honorable member for Mallee
            right and to show that he reads his speeches to a large extent by quoting from "
            Hansard " and other reports of what has been said. I say in all sincerity that his
            speeches would be much better if they were read carefully after being prepared
            carefully, even by someone else. That is not a personal remark. It is just an
            observation about something that would help to improve his standing in his electorate. I
            hope that I have brought him up to date and that he now knows the position in regard to
            read speeches.</para>

                        There was a time when one man stood against the whole world. He had
            twelve disciples. One of them betrayed him and the other eleven denied him. Probably, in
            the House of Commons, there were times when
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir
              Winston</inline>
                        Churchill might not have found a single friend to support him, but
            history showed that he was right, There could be a time in this Parliament when one man
            is right and 121 are wrong. I do not care whether that one person is right or wrong. I
            say that, right or wrong, he has a right to have his vote recorded.
                    </para>
                    <para>I am raising this matter because I believe that the individual should not be
            steamrollered by any party, whether it is a party on this side of the House or on the
            other side of the House, or a conspiracy between two parties. An individual has his
            rights, and I stand for those rights. It is not enough simply to say that a division
            shall not be proceeded with unless more than one member has called for a division. It is
            true that, a few minutes ago, it was difficult for more than 90 members to sit on one
            side of the House. Indeed, it was rather an amusing sight to see such friends. Of
            course, it would be even more difficult for one member to sit on one side of the House
            and the other 121 to sit on the other. So, for mechanical reasons, naturally I would
            agree that, if only one member wanted a division, the division should not be taken in
            the ordinary way. The mechanics would forbid that being done. But a member should have
            the right, although he be the one person against the motion, to have his dissent
            recorded.</para>
                    <para>It may be said that, if he calls for a division and he cannot find a single other
            person to support him, from the very fact that he has called for that division it may be
            inferred that had there been a division he would have been opposed to the motion. But
            that is an inference. I say that such a member is being brushed aside by this Standing
            Order. In dignity, he has the right to be allowed to dissent, and I believe that his
            dissent should be recorded in the record of the proceedings of the House and in "
            Hansard ". He should be given the right and dignity of having his dissent recorded.</para>

                        I do not propose to bring forward any amendment at this stage. I commend this matter
            for consideration by that august body, the Standing Orders Committee, which is said to
            be so representative of all members of this House. It may be representative of the
            Government's point of view and of the Opposition's point of view. But I am
            speaking for individuals. I know that the honorable member for Yarra

                rebel or a disgruntled person. There are some people, even in this chamber, who take
                a view because they believe in it, and not for the kinds of reasons that have been
                thrown up in the course of this debate, such as because of reflections that have
                been cast upon them. I say that, when the Standing Orders are reviewed again, an
                individual should be given the right to have his dissent properly recorded in the
                record of the proceedings of this House.</para>

                            I wish to speak only very
              briefly in the general debate. My reason for rising will be understood clearly when I
              say that the first thing I wish to do is congratulate the Standing Orders Committee on
              its action in respect of the limitation of speeches. I believe that we are all only
              too well aware that on too many occasions members of this Parliament speak purely for
              the sake of speaking. Unfortunately, the Whips frequently ask members - sometimes of
              necessity, perhaps - to take their allotted time. That is a most regrettable practice.

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Another feature of parliamentary debate which I believe is very tiresome to members
            themselves, and must be even more so to the listening public, is the inconceivable
            amount of padding that is put into various speeches that we have to suffer. I recall
            that a few years ago I spoke on the Japanese Peace Treaty. I spoke for between 10 and 15
            minutes and said what I wished to say in that time. The honorable member who followed me
            - he is no longer a member of the Parliament - spent about 20 minutes castigating me for
            speaking for such a short time. That shows the absurd limits to which this kind of thing
            can go. I believe - I think other members of this Parliament also believe this - that
            members should attempt to finish their speeches before the expiration of the time
            allotted to them. Frequently, half of a speech could be omitted and it would still be a
            reasonable presentation, much more easily assimilated by members of the Parliament, the
            " Hansard " staff and the unfortunate people who have to listen to parliamentary
            debates. 1 wish to refer to only one other small matter which I think is important,
            namely, the title "Temporary Chairman of Committees ". I hold a view on this,
            not because I happen to be one of the honorable members who is a Temporary Chairman of
            Committees but because I have always believed that the title " Temporary Chairman of
            Committees " is a misnomer. It is probably sufficiently understood by members of the
            Parliament, but I think that the public and people outside who are interested in the
            Parliament should not be misled. From a public point of view this is clearly a title
            without a clear or proper meaning. So I suggest to the Standing Orders Committee - and I
            have in writing so suggested - that it might well consider adopting the very simple and
            correct title, "Deputy Chairman of Committees". It is a title easily understood
            and it explains the actual position. I think it would be acceptable to the Parliament.</para>

                            .- Very briefly and without detaining the House, I wish to bring to the notice of
              the Parliament the number of questions on the notice paper which have been there for
              some considerable time without being answered. I refer first to a question which has
              been on notice, in my name, since 4th March 1964. That is the best part of 13 months
              ago. It was addressed to the Prime Minister
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert
                Menzies)</inline>
                            and it will be seen from the notice paper that it concerns the air
              conditioning of the Canadian Embassy in Canberra and the air conditioning of
              Commonwealth establishments and offices. Thirteen months is not an unreasonable time
              in which to expect the Prime Minister to obtain an answer to what is not a complicated
              problem but is a human one. The fact that the question has not been answered should be
              investigated.

                        As if that were not bad enough - and I cite other examples because my colleagues are
            involved - on 15th September 1964 Question No. 544 in the name of the honorable member
            for the Northern Territory
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline>
                        was
            addressed to the Minister for Labour and National Service
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon).</inline>
                        It, too, remains unanswered. The question was put on the
            notice paper over six months ago. That is a fair time for the Minister for Labour and
            National Service, slow thinking as he is, to take to work out an answer. It would appear
            from the question that it is extremely important to the honorable member for the
            Northern Territory, and 1 wonder why there has been such a delay in answering it.

                        addressed Question No. 707 to the Prime Minister. It remains
            unanswered. Notice was given of Question No. 728 by the honorable member for Hindmarsh
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron)</inline>
                        on 27th October 1964. It was
            addressed to the Prime Minister and it remains unanswered. Question No. 754 was placed
            on the notice paper by the honorable member for Oxley
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.

                        on 28th October 1964. It was addressed to the Postmaster-General

                        and it, too, remains unanswered.
            Furthermore, Questions 792, 796 and 797, of which notice was given on 10th November
            1964, remain unanswered. Questions 811 and 814, addressed to the Minister for Labour and
            National Service and to the Minister for Territories

                        respectively, have been on the notice paper since 17th November 1964

                    <para>The Government prides itself on the skill and speed with which it can deal with the
            business of the country, but tonight I cite questions for which we have been seeking
            answers since as long ago as 4th Mardi 1964. I am reasonably generous. I have not
            referred to questions put on . notice since 31st December 1964, which is three months
            ago. I should like to know why the Government will not answer these questions. Has it
            not the answers? Have the Prime Minister and his ministerial colleagues some information
            about the matters dealt wilh in these questions which they do not want to reveal to the
            Parliament?</para>
                    <para>
                        Having listened tonight to speeches about the rights of private members I do not
            think it unreasonable to ask why our rights are not preserved by our getting answers to
            questions within a reasonable time, instead of waiting for 13 months in one instance and
            several months in other instances. I ask the Minister at the table, the Minister for
            Housing
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bury),</inline>
                        to convey to the Ministers
            concerned that the members of the Opposition would like their questions answered. Some
            of the questions are not easy to answer, but with the facilities available
            departmentally and otherwise it should be possible for the Government to obtain the
            answers. 1 do not think anything is more unfair to members of the Parliament who are
            writing for replies to questions in the interests of their constituents than to be kept
            waiting for such long periods. The fact that no effort has been made to answer the
            questions further aggravates the position so far as we are concerned. I would suggest,
            therefore, that the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labour and National Service, the
            Postmaster-General and the Minister for Territories give immediate replies to these
            questions in order that members, even if not satisfied with the replies, will at least
            be informed of the Government's intentions. As I have said, the questions I am
            concerned about are those asked last year. I think that a minimum of 90 days and a
            maximum of 13 months of waiting for replies to questions shows tolerance in the extreme.
            The Government has an obligation to answer these questions, to discharge their from the
            notice paper and to give satisfaction to the honorable members who have asked them.

                        in your wisdom will see that something is
            done to have these questions answered, because members cannot wait much longer for
            replies to questions on which they want information urgently.

                            .- The matter I raise concerns the Department of Civil Aviation. The House will
              know that at Tullamarine airport construction operations are proceeding. I understand
              that a large Australian-American company has the contract for the reconstruction of
              the runway. The company has had to open a very large quarry in the vicinity of the
              aerodrome to obtain its metal requirements. I have received complaints from three
              residents in the vicinity of the aerodrome that the company's blasting operations
              are such that the structure of their homes has been seriously affected. We all know
              that an essential feature of contracting for any public utility, from the point of
              view of profits to the contractor, is the time factor, and that if time can be saved
              by inserting excessive quantities of explosives and bringing down large quantities of
              stone with one shot it will be done by the contractor. I hope that the Minister for
              Civil Aviation
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Henty)</inline>
                            in another place
              will take some steps to stop this nuisance. 1 quote now from the three letters I have
              received. The first states - 1 am writing to complain about the severe charges that
              the people at the jet port are putting in when they are blasting. Our house is solid
              bluestone and very old, but new cracks are appearing since the blasting. We have
              recently had the walls plastered and painted and cracks are appearing everywhere. The
              blasts shake the building dreadfully and I fear some drastic damage will be done
              unless these severe blasts are stopped. "The second letter states - I feel I must
              write to see if something can be done to lessen the blasting at the jet port. I know
              it's got to be done and what a good thing it is to have a development so close to
              our township, but the walls in my house are getting .further apart. The whole place is
              affected by it. As I am a widow and haven't the means to have any repairs done I
              feel something will have to be done somewhere along the line. The other day everything
              fell off the kitchen mantelpiece, breaking a clock and several ornaments. The place
              shudders before the blast goes off. The bluestone walls are in a very bad way. We seem
              to have taken

                    <para class="block">
                        I wish to raise another matter that concerns the Department of Civil
            Aviation. Recently several residents of my electorate, which adjoins the airport,
            complained that Boeing 727 aircraft were causing damage and breakage to windows in their
            homes. I promptly made written representations to the Director-General of Civil Aviation
            and suggested that something be done to alleviate this nuisance. I suggested also that
            the persons concerned should be compensated for the damage they had sustained to their
            homes. After all, the compensation would not be very costly. It would be a matter of
            only a few windows. I received from the Director-General a communication informing me
            that endeavours would be made to alleviate the nuisance but disclaiming any
            responsibility for the payment of damages. If public transport authorities were
            responsible for doing damage to homes, they would reasonably assess the damages and make
            compensation. I know that this may set a precedent, but I request the Minister for Civil
            Aviation
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Henty)</inline>
                        to contact the
            Director-General and indicate to him that he is expected to compensate these citizens
            for the damage they have sustained. We are committed to using 727's, but the airport
            is unsuitable for them. In these circumstances they constitute a danger to homes in the
            area and have caused damage and created a nuisance.
                    </para>
                    <para>The Government has been prompt in placing new aircraft at the disposal of Australian
            travellers. I do not disapprove of that, but if these aircraft cause damage and create a
            nuisance, some attempt at least should be made to alleviate the nuisance and to
            compensate the people for damages sustained. I ask the Minister to endeavour to have
            these matters promptly attended to and to see that something is done for these
            unfortunate people. These people do not quarrel with the establishment of the airport.
            They realise that some nuisance must be borne, but anybody who has had anything to do
            with blasting operations will know that the attitude usually is: Push it in; blow it up;
            knock it over, no matter who is hurt in the process. There is a responsibility on the
            authority concerned to exercise some supervision and to see that in this case the
            regulations of the Victorian Mines Department governing the use of explosives are
            applied. It is true that Commonwealth authorities are not obliged to observe State
            regulations, but there is a general understanding between Commonwealth and State
            authorities that in circumstances such as these State regulations will be observed.</para>

                attendance here, large numbers of people in my electorate continue to send me here.
                It is my duty to represent their interests and to be treated as befits the

                answer the Minister was misleading to the point of prevarication. In answering my

                    <para class="block">I am interested in the reasons. The fact that this Government does not
            recognise the German Democratic Republic is not a reason. There must be reasons behind
            our not recognising this country. I had hoped that the Minister, who has numerous senior
            officers behind him to advise and inform him, would have been able to place on record in
            " Hansard " an explanation of this difficult position. I am not criticising in
            any way the non-recognition of East Germany. But I believe, as a member of this House,
            that I am entitled to a considered answer to a question such as this. On such an
            important policy matter, it is not good enough for a Minister to hide behind the
            Standing Order that deals with the asking of questions relating to policy matters. I
            asked simple and direct questions. I hoped that I would be given simple and direct
            answers. The fact is that East Germany is a separate nation. I believe that it has
            become a separate nation in its own right. There are 17 million Germans there and there
            are some 60 million or 70 million Germans on the other side of the wall, as it were. But
            East Germany poses one of the questions that face the world and one of the questions
            that we will have to resolve. It is fair enough to ask to be given the information that
            we need to consider the problem.</para>

            although we are intimately concerned with these countries because thousands upon
            thousands of people born there are now resident in Australia. Honorable members should
            then obtain the list of countries in which we are represented and in which we have
            strong representation. They should then try to work out the logic or principle behind
            the arrangement of our representation overseas.</para>

                        that questions on

            questions should be full and complete and should pay a proper and courteous regard to
            the needs of members of the Parliament. Lack of this is, 1 am afraid, one of the
            symptoms of the continuing and increasing arrogance of the Ministry. The Minister for
            Territories
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnes)</inline>

            of this House be appointed to consider the conditions of the people of Yirrkala and the
            Northern Territory. Nearly every honorable member could give chapter and verse, line by
            line, of case after case in which Ministers have treated the Parliament in the way I
            have said. I believe that this must cease. I am deeply disappointed in the Minister for
            External Affairs. He brought to his office a long history of diplomacy but he has chosen
            to treat me and the House in the way I have outlined.

                            .- On 10th November last, the Prime Minister
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir
                Robert Menzies)</inline>
                            announced the introduction of selective compulsory military
              service. That announcement came as part of a defence review in which the Prime
              Minister outlined proposals for an expansion of the Defence Forces. As a result of
              this decision to introduce selective national service, more than 2,000 recruits will
              in a few weeks time descend upon Puckapunyal near Seymour in my electorate. The
              trainees will form a recruit training battalion, for which barracks and other
              accommodation is being constructed. It is necessary, of course, for them to be taught
              the arts of modern warfare by experienced instructors.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Some hundreds of these men will come from all over Australia to Puckapunyal. Some of
            them are single but many of them are married men with families who, in the present
            circumstances, have no prospect of obtaining accommodation for their families and who
            face a long period of separation, unless urgent action is taken by the Government. This
            is the matter that I bring before the Parliament tonight. Prior to the announcement by
            the Prime Minister, there was already an acute shortage of accommodation in the area.
            There was a shortage both of houses built specially for Army personnel under the Army
            housing programme and of normal civilian accommodation in the nearby town of Seymour.
            Many members of the Army were and are renting flats or rooms at exorbitant rents so that
            they may live with their families. Many of the rooms and flats are substandard. The
            Victorian Housing Commission in the last few weeks has condemned and ordered the
            demolition of 14 homes in the area. There is virtually no prospect of any married
            soldier who comes to the area obtaining a satisfactory home, flat or rooms to rent.</para>
                    <para>
                        I have had correspondence about this situation with the Minister for the Army
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Forbes)</inline>
                        over a period of several months. I
            have pointed out the urgency of the problem and have expressed my concern, the concern
            of the Shire Council of Seymour and the concern of the citizens of Seymour and
            Puckapunyal at the situation, and no doubt I have also expressed the concern of serving
            soldiers who have suffered or will suffer from the shortcomings of the Government's
            Army housing policy. I want to refer briefly to the correspondence that 1 have had with
            the Minister for the Army. In reply to the first representa tions I made, the Minister,
            among other things, said -

            be taken to provide such additional houses as may be necessary. But I and the soldiers
            and their families would like to know when this action will be taken. Apparently the
            Government and the Minister have a definition for the word " urgent " that is
            different from my definition. Already four and a half months have passed since the
            announcement was made regarding selective service training, but the only housing
            programme that we have is expected to be completed at the end of this year or early next
            year and will only meet the needs that were apparent before the introduction of
            selective service training was announced. Hundreds of instructors will be coming to the
            Seymour-Puckapunyal area. Undoubtedly many of them will be married and will have
            families. Many of these men have already arrived, but their families are not with them
            because they cannot find accommodation. They face the prospect of separation from their
            families for a long, long time. The Seymour "Telegraph", a newspaper which is
            published in the area, recently printed a very powerful editorial. It was moved entirely
            by the very human problem that confronts these soldiers and their families. I have not
            time to quote it all, but referring to a woman who had approached the newspaper seeking
            a flat or a house, the editorial made the following comment -</para>

            Surely he should not be faced with years of separation, leaving his wife to cope with
            all the family problems that may arise? Surely wives of Army personnel, already
            encountering difficulties which civilian wives do not face, are entitled to some home
            life?</para>
                    <para>This is a matter of grave concern to the citizens of the Seymour area and to the
            soldiers and their families. I appeal to the Minister and to the Government. I believe
            that the Minister needs the backing of the Government in this matter. Something urgent
            should be done. Two letters have been received from the Minister saying that urgent
            action will be taken, but a considerable amount of time has passed and no plan has been
            announced. So far as the soldiers are concerned, they have no bright prospects. There is
            no light on the hill for them so far as housing is concerned. They face the prospect of
            many months, and perhaps years, with their families living away from them, perhaps in
            other States. In many cases their families are living with their parents or other
            relatives, and these servicemen are able to visit the families perhaps only once a month
            or once every couple of months. That is not good enough.</para>
                    <para>Something urgent has to be done and I ask the Minister and the Government to take
            urgent action. These soldiers and their wives need assistance. They need homes in which
            they can engage in normal family life just as any other Australian family can. They are
            entitled to this. They are not second class citizens; they are first class citizens.
            Surely in endeavouring to encourage young men to join the Army the Government should see
            that those who have joined the Regular Army have the normal facilities that every
            Australian outside the Army enjoys.</para>

                        <para>I would observe that in the last few days I seem to be in a position where some
              people are abusing me for building houses for Service personnel and others are abusing
              me equally for not doing so. In relation to the main and general point made by the
              honorable member for Bendigo I remind the House that the Government has recognised,
              and specifically did so by its announcement in June of last year, the principal point
              that he has made in supporting his representations tonight and those made in
              correspondence to me previously. A deliberate decision has been made by the Government
              to undertake an accelerated housing programme for the Services. The object of this
              programme was to eliminate the waiting list for houses in all three Services
              throughout Australia as it stood at that time. This is clear recognition by the
              Government that it regards housing as an extremely important factor in attracting and
              retaining servicemen and in providing facilities that are the serviceman's due in
              view of the disabilities he faces in Service life. No quarrel exists between the
              honorable member for Bendigo and the Government on that score. The Government has made
              its intention perfectly clear.</para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        I come now to the matter that the honorable member raised in relation to the
            Puckapunyal and Seymour areas. As he knows, and as other honorable members will agree,
            this has always been a difficult area from the point of view of accommodation, mainly
            because of its isolation. I notice that the honorable member for Bendigo is nodding his
            head in agreement. I hope, therefore, that he will plead with the Leader of the
            Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell),</inline>
                        in view of the
            extraordinary suggestion that that honorable gentleman addressed to me in a question. He
            asked me whether I would arrange to transport all Army establishments away from the
            capital cities into areas like Puckapunyal. Were the Army to do this it would create all
            round Australia exactly the same sort of problems that we have now at Puckapunyal.
                    </para>
                    <para>I am astonished too because I understood the Leader of the Opposition to say,
            towards the end of last year, when attacking the Government on the introduction of
            compulsory service, that he believed that there was no necessity for compulsory national
            service because the Army could obtain its soldiers by voluntary means. Although he
            suggested that it should obtain its soldiers by voluntary means he has, in effect,
            advocated taking all Army establishments away from the capital cities and putting them
            in isolated places. I want to say to him and to the honorable member for Bendigo that
            soldiers and their families are as much entitled to the amenities to be found in our
            larger cities as are anybody else.</para>
                    <para>I come back now to the question of Puckapunyal, although I believe that the point I
            have just made is extremely relevant. I should not like it to be thought that the Army
            has not provided any married quarters at all in the Puckapunyal-Seymour area. We have
            currently 552 married quarters in this area. In June last year we let contracts for the
            construction of 65 houses under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Those
            houses have been becoming available and I expect the last of them will be available
            before June of this year. In addition, as the honorable member mentioned, provision has
            been made for the Commonwealth Department of Works to build 81 houses in Puckapunyal
            itself. Tenders are at present being called for the building of those. Although it is
            true that they are being built to meet the situation that existed prior to the
            Government's decision to expand the Army, the construction of these 65 additional
            houses in Seymour and 81 in Puckapuyal will improve the present position considerably.</para>
                    <para>As the honorable member said, the Government made a decision in November to expand
            the Army, and in the process of that expansion it is proposed to put one of the recruit
            training battalions for national servicemen at Puckapunyal. It is proposed also to place
            there an additional battalion that will be created as the result of national servicemen
            becoming available. As a result of that decision, we therefore have an additional
            requirement for houses. I do not deny that. I told the honorable gentleman so in my
            letter to him. I told him also that steps are being taken as a matter of urgency to
            provide the additional houses. I do not see what greater assurance I can give than that.
            I told the honorable gentleman that, and all he did was write back to me and say that he
            was not satisfied with what was being done. What more can you do in relation to this
            situation than to give an assurance that steps will be taken to provide these additional
            houses as a matter of urgency?</para>
                    <para>I have directed my Department that, within the overall army housing programme,
            Puckapunyal will be given the highest priority in recognition not only of the expansion
            there but also of the difficulties involved in the isolation of Puckapunyal.
            Nevertheless, I will not hide the fact that we will be short of quarters in that area in
            the immediate future. In that situation, to tide over the period until all the married
            quarters we require become available at Puckapunyal, I propose to take two steps which
            will help to alleviate the position. The first step is to extend the operation of
            temporary accommodation allowances, a means by which a soldier who is not able to obtain
            an Army house can obtain private accommodation and have the rental of that house
            subsidised so that he will not pay a rent greater or much greater than the rent he would
            pay if he was in an Army house. This will be extended, in relation to soldiers who are
            posted to Puckapunyal, to the Melbourne area. This is not entirely satisfactory because
            it does mean separation of the soldiers from their families. But it is better than
            nothing, and it will help to some extent to alleviate the situation.</para>
                    <para>The other step that I am taking in this respect is to provide, as far as possible,
            that single men are posted to fill these particular positions at Puckapunyal until
            houses become available. This should again reduce the strain on the available
            accommodation. The honorable gentleman suggests that you can conjure houses out of the
            air almost overnight. He directed some of his specific criticisms to the situation which
            prevailed after the decision was taken to expand the Army. That was only three or four
            months ago. The way the honorable gentleman spoke suggested that he thought the houses
            should be there now. This is not real life, particularly in a situation of great strain
            on the overall position in the building iudustry. What I hope is that because we have a
            substantial work force already on the spot at Puckapunyal building for the recruit
            training battalion, and the accommodation for this additional battalion, its
            availability will assist us to make these homes available much more quickly than they
            otherwise would have become available in view of the prevailing state of the building
            industry.</para>

                            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                            there are two matters that I desire
              to mention in the adjournment debate this evening. The first is that already
              introduced by the honorable member for Wills
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.
                Bryant)</inline>
                            concerning the Minister for External Affairs
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck).</inline>
                            The second is a matter that concerns the
              Postmaster-General
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hulme)</inline>
                            and it is the
              encouragement of Australian television programmes. This evening, the honorable member
              for Wills made a very strong case against the Minister for External Affairs when he
              said that the Minister was not trying to give information to members in answering
              questions that had been placed on the notice paper. This criticism applies also to
              questions which have been asked of the Minister in this House. I think this House is
              entitled to expect a good deal better from the Minister, because he came to his post
              with a good deal of ministerial experience, ability for work, and a reputation as a
              historian. We believed that the honorable gentleman would give serious study to his
              new portfolio and that, before very long, he would emerge as a man capable of giving
              the House and the nation a good deal of information and solid facts in relation to
              this very important portfolio.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I think the Minister in respect of his portfolio has been a very great
            disappointment to us. I do not know whether he believes in the tradition that appears to
            have been established by Ministers for External Affairs in this Parliament, that
            external affairs and the facts of our external relationships are not matters which
            should be the subject for public debate. One of his right honorable predecessors - Lord
            Casey, as he now is - on one occasion publicly expressed the theory that these matters
            were too sensitive, too difficult to understand and too important for ordinary people to
            be able to participate in a debate or discussion about them. The honorable
            gentleman's predecessor was not noted for being willing to give this House or the
            Australian people much information in respect of his portfolio. I wonder, therefore,
            whether the present Minister for External Affairs is accepting the theory that these
            matters are too sensitive, too vital and too important for ordinary people to be trusted
            with them.</para>
                    <para>I do not think that this attitude is good enough. I believe that the Minister's
            performance is consistent with that theory. If it were not that in some respects he
            treated his earlier portfolio in a similar way, I would think that this attitude was
            something that he had perhaps recently acquired. When we are asking the nation to take a
            stand which may well lead it into war in which its very survival could be at stake, I
            consider it is most important that on matters on which the nation has to make up its
            mind it be given official information.</para>
                    <para>Take the very important question of Communist China. The Minister in his speech on
            international affairs - his one main speech in 12 months - 'asked the Australian
            nation to accept the assumption that mainland China was aggressive and was dedicated
            almost to our destruction. Neither the Minister nor anyone else has given us any factual
            information of the military structure of mainland China. The Minister does not pretend
            to supply us with evidence to support the proposition. I would like to direct his
            attention to an article published in "Newsweek" on 15th March 1965, just a
            couple of weeks ago. The article is similar to articles which have been published
            recently in such papers as the " New York Times", the "Washington Post"
            and the London "Times". The frequency of the currency of articles of this type
            seems to indicate, first, that they are based on official information and, secondly,
            that that information is pretty well established.</para>
                    <para>The article in " Newsweek " contains a map showing the placings of the 35
            field armies possessed by mainland China, its air bases and its naval bases. The article
            contains also a summary of detailed information about the structure of these three
            forces and tells us that they - . . despite Peking's efforts to hide them, are
            reasonably well known to the West thanks to espionage and frequent U-2 fly-overs. "
            Red China is not the walled-off society people think," says one Pentagon official.</para>
                    <para class="block">This information, as the article tells us, is coming from officials
            all the time. The article continues - "There isn't that much that is
            hidden."</para>
                    <para class="block">The article goes on to deal with things that are not hidden, and gives
            details of the three armed forces of China - the army, the air force and the navy.
            Certain conclusions are drawn about these forces, such as -</para>

                    <para class="block">The article comes to the conclusion that China is a formidable
            military power. It then continues -</para>

                        <para>However that may be, one of the most suiting facts about China's military

                        I would like to
            know - and I think it is time we demanded to know - whether this kind of information is
            true or not. Are the Chinese military forces organised for defence rather than attack?
            Do they conform to the pattern illustrated here or not? When the Government expresses
            the view that was expressed last week by the Minister for External Affairsthat we are in
            imminent danger and are facing a great threat from an aggressive China - it should prove
            its case if it can do so. I have submitted clear evidence to the House. I have quoted
            from "Newsweek" for convenience, but similar evidence is contained in other
            authoritative British and American newspapers. The Minister now has a clear
            responsibility to give us some information. He should stop treating us as members of a
            junior class in some girls' school, as he has been doing ever since he took over his
            present portfolio.

                        I come now to the second matter to which I wish to refer. Television was introduced
            into this country in
                        <inline font-style="italic">1956.</inline>
                        Almost immediately after
            it was introduced, people in many parts of the country stated that it would be necessary
            to do something to ensure that television programmes would have a high Australian
            content. Slowly, as we began to see the kind of programmes we were getting - mostly
            imported, and imported at cheap dumping rates - the demand for a higher Australian
            content became more extensive and more persistent. When new television licences were
            being granted and companies were formed to apply for them, almost every applicant
            company stated: "We will guarantee to provide programmes with a very high Australian
            content". The Government refused to take up any position, and finally its own
            supporters in another place moved for the appointment of ti select committee to
            investigate the question. Eventually a Senate select committee was formed. It conducted
            its inquiries during 1963 and submitted a report at the end of that year. Briefly, that
            committee came to the conclusion, first, that a film industry could not be established
            in Australia without Government assistance, and secondly, that it was impossible to
            increase the Australian content, particularly of drama programmes, unless some
            Government assistance were given. Only last week, at a television congress held in
            Sydney, which was attended by 430 delegates from various parts of Australia, many of
            them experienced in the production of television and other programmes, there was general
            agreement with the report submitted by the Senate select committee, which identified the
            things most necessary to be done to solve this problem.

                        Last year, when several amendments to a Bill seeking to increase the licence fees
            for television stations were being considered in this House, the Postmaster-General
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hulme)</inline>
                        and the Treasurer
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline>
                        indicated that at last the Government
            was prepared to consider some means of encouraging the production of Australian
            programmes, some means of solving the problem which existed despite an understanding
            between the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the stations that between 40 per
            cent, and 50 per cent, of the programmes televised would be Australian productions. The
            present undefined quota permits of anything in which Australians participate being
            classified as a part of the quota. News sessions, football telecasts, cricket telecasts,
            cooking demonstrations, quiz programmes, indeed everything under the sun, are included
            as a part of the Australian quota, although they add nothing to the standard of the
            programmes. The real objective of a quota should be to improve the standard of
            programmes, but our quota system has failed completely to achieve this up to date.

                    <para>The Postmaster-General looked at the situation last week, when I asked him a
            question. He said that the Government was studying the situation. I want to know how
            long it will be necessary for the Government to study it. Am I to ask questions next
            week, in two months' time, or even in six months' time to discover whether the</para>

            already by the select committee which was appointed at the request of the
            Government's own supporters. The Committee studied the matter for a year and
            submitted its report in October 1963. I ask the Minister, who is now in the House,
            whether he will give us a clear indication as to how much more study he considers it
            will be necessary to give to this matter and how much more delay we must suffer before a
            decision is announced.</para>

                            .- Earlier this evening the honorable member for Wills
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bryant)</inline>
                            questioned the accuracy of some information I had given to
              the House in answer to questions which he had put on notice. He also suggested that I
              had been in some way discourteous to him personally because the answers I gave were
              not as full as he wished them to be. I want to say - I say this not to the honorable
              member but to you,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline>
                            and to the House -
              that when I tabled those answers they were, to the best of my knowledge and belief,
              correct. When I heard that the honorable member for Wills was dissatisfied with them,
              I checked them again. I wish to say that I am sure that they were accurate, and that I
              have not in any way misled the House or given any information that was not correct in
              every respect.
                        </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>
                        The second remark I wish to make concerns the wish of the honorable member that the
            answers might be fuller. I would submit that an answer to a question on notice is not an
            appropriate medium for conducting a debate. Indeed, if we were dealing not with
            questions on notice but with questions asked in the House, you,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                        would intervene to prevent debate from taking
            place in answers to questions. I want to say principally that when a Minister answers a
            question he is not supplying information personally to the member who performs a service
            to the Parliament by posing the question; he is giving information to the whole of the
            Parliament. Beyond the Parliament, he is giving information as a statement by a Minister
            on behalf of the Government. That information is then available to, and is read as a
            Government statement by many persons outside the House.
                    </para>
                    <para>With one exception, the questions asked by the honorable member concerned the
            relations of Australia with the governments of other countries, so that anything said by
            a Minister in answer to such questions would be just as interesting to the governments
            of those foreign countries as it would be to the honorable member himself or to other
            members of this House. Because the questions did concern our relations with other
            countries, as indeed so many statements made by a Minister for External Affairs must do,
            and having regard to the interests of Australia and the Australian people, it was
            necessary to phrase the answers with exceptional care and discretion, knowing that they
            would be read by the governments of other countries and that they did concern our
            relations with other countries. If the answers seemed guarded, that was certainly not
            because we wished to palm off the curiosity of the honorable member for Wills but
            because, in our sense of what it was discreet and proper to say about our relations with
            other countries, we thought that the answers should be brief.</para>
                    <para>
                        The honorable member for Wills and the honorable member for Yarra
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. J. F. Cairns)</inline>
                        also developed the theme that they and
            other members of the House were being denied information. I am sorry that they should
            feel that way. Apart from what takes place in the House, there is a wealth of
            information that is readily available to all members from my Department, and which will
            be made available to them on request. We have our regular publications, which I think
            are distributed to members. If they are not, then I shall be pleased to make sure that
            they are distributed to all members. In addition to that, any member with experience
            knows that if there is a particular question on which he would like further information
            he has only to approach either myself or the head of my Department and, if no question
            of the security of documents or of the classified nature of documents is involved, the
            information will be supplied.
                    </para>
                    <para>Although this is not the place to canvass this particular subject, I would also
            remind honorable members of the Opposition that, by their own decision - which, of
            course, it was proper for them to make - they have denied themselves access to the
            information which is available to all members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.
            Honorable members on the Government side of the House, having chosen to join the Joint
            Committee on Foreign Affairs, enjoy the benefits and advantages to be derived from
            frequent meetings and discussions with persons in possession of information on
            particular subjects. They also enjoy the advantages of discussions among themselves on
            matters pertaining to foreign affairs. That opportunity is still open to honorable
            members of the Opposition if they wish to avail themseslves of it.</para>

              let him have them. I have them because I asked the Clerk of the House to obtain them

                        saw fit to misrepresent the implications of a question that I asked today about the use
            of certain Army land adjacent to Middle Harbour in Sydney. My view of the current
            situation in Australia is that every defence establishment ought to be removed from our
            capital cities. About 60 per cent, of our people live in six capital cities. I believe
            that the Navy should not have shore stations on Middle Harbour or at Neutral Bay. I
            think that establishments such as these should be in the Nowra area on the South Coast
            of New South Wales. All the headlands in the Middle Harbour area and elsewhere about
            Sydney Harbour, and particularly Middle Head, North Head and South Head, should be
            converted into reserves except for areas required by the Army for essential purposes. I
            do not want any of this land to be handed over to speculators, developers or any people
            who may think that there is a lot of money to be made out of it. I think it ought to be
            preserved as natural reserves and part of our national heritage, and I believe that this
            could be done. I do not consider that the Army should hold much of this land.
                    </para>
                    <para>I do not believe that the headquarters of the Army in New South Wales should be in
            Sydney at all. It ought to be at Ingleburn or even farther out. In World War I, the Army
            headquarters and the nerve centres Of the Army in Victoria, apart from Victoria Barracks
            in Melbourne, were at Broadmeadows, which is 12 miles from Melbourne. In World War II,
            they were at Puckapunyal, 60 miles from Melbourne. I believe that they should now be up
            near Bandiana on the Murray River. If I had my way, I would put important Army units
            there, because those who served in the Army would then have an opportunity to send their
            children to school in Albury, which is a big city and which will one day be a university
            centre. This would afford the children of Army personnel the advantages of a better
            education. It is true that from Puckapunyal children may go to Bendigo where, one day, a
            university college may be established.</para>
                    <para>I want to ensure that every person who serves Australia in the armed forces has
            rights at least equal to those afforded to others. Indeed, serving personnel in the
            armed forces, because they are sent to serve at points all over Australia, should
            perhaps have special rights in this respect. I believe that we ought to move all units
            of the armed forces out of our capital cities if possible, because the capital cities
            are vulnerable to attack. We should move Service units to smaller cities where there are
            available all the educational facilities required for the children of serving personnel.
            I believe that this is in accordance with present practice throughout the world. I do
            not want to deny anybody the opportunities of superior education, and I certainly do not
            want to deny to those who are dedicated enough and patriotic enough to want to spend
            their lives serving in the armed forces the advantages that other people have.</para>
                    <para>
                        We live in a grossly materialistic age today, and it is shocking that people who
            simply pursue wealth have great advantages over others who want to serve their country.
            I recall something that Adlai Stevenson wrote recently. I think it was brilliantly
            expressed. He wrote: " We try to oppose the godless materialism of the Russians with
            a more godly materialism of our own ". That expresses the spirit of the age. I hope
            that I have put the position right,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, bearing</inline>
                        in
            mind that the Air Force nerve centres in Victoria are at Point Cook and Avalon and not
            right in the heart of Melbourne. Where they are situated, they are close to Geelong, a
            centre where additional educational facilities will be provided very soon.

                            the honorable member for Yarra
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. J. F. Cairns)</inline>
                            has raised the question of
              government assistance to promote the use of Australian programmes on television. Last
              week, he asked me a question about the
                            <inline font-style="italic">matter. 1</inline>
                            intimated in reply that I had had a good deal of research done on the problem, that
              more was being done and that I hoped to receive a report in the not too distant
              future. I did not say that the matter was before the Government. I merely stated that
              I was seeking this information. It will require reading and sorting out before I am in
              a position to present to the Government any of my thinking on the subject. About
              November of last year, I intimated that I hoped, within six months or so, to inform
              the Parliament whether the Government might be able to do something. I am now moving
              in that direction, but I cannot guarantee that I shall be able to make a pronouncement
              exactly six months from the time when I expressed my earlier hope. However, I am doing
              my best in relation to something that is a very great problem. The honorable member
              for Yarra suggests government assistance in this area and that, but at present I am
              not prepared to accept the proposition that greater government assistance represents
              the total solution to the problems involved.

                        I have refrained from commenting on the report of the Senate Select Committee on the
            Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television- the Vincent Committee - and I
            shall refrain from commenting on that report, except to say that it indicated the
            tremendous problems associated with the television industry. I would not make a judgment
            on any of that

                        I have had an opportunity to make my own inquiries in a fairly broad basis. I cannot
            avoid the honorable member for Yarra asking me questions each day or each week, but I
            assure him that I am not at present in a position to state anything definite. The matter
            is being investigated actively and considerable research is being undertaken. That
            investigation and research, for my part, will be completed at the earliest possible
            moment, but a decision is still some time away.

                        <para>It is the primary duty of the Department's fire and rescue service to rescue
              persons from an aircraft that has crashed on or in the vicinity of an airport. In
              addition the service endeavours to prevent or limit aircraftor building fires. Since a
              predecessor, some ten years ago, made the statement that the primary duty of the
              airport fire service was to look after buildings,the whole question of the aims of the
              service has been reviewed. Towards the end of 1956 it was decided to adopt the present
              policy and the re-equipment programme of the Department's fire and rescue service
              was modified accordingly. By the time the International Civil Aviation Organisation,
              in 1958, recommended the universal adoption of a similar line of thinking, the
              Department's fire and rescue service re-equipment programme was well under way.</para>

                            <para>The Court building in Canberra has two Supreme Court rooms and arrangements
                could be made for the use of one of these rooms by a single Justice of the High
                Court. Indeed, arrangements are currently being made for a number of cases to be
                heard by a single Justice of the High Court in Canberra later this year, probably in
                June. Further, one of the Supreme Court rooms was used recently by the Full Bench of
                the Industrial Court. The Court room and other facilities, however, would hardly be
                adequate for the purposes of a sitting of the Full Court of the High Court.</para>
