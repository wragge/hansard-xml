          <para class="block">Is the Prime Minister aware that, with the rate of 1 1.2 per cent struck last week on six-year Commonwealth bonds, official interest rates are now 1 .7 per cent higher than they were when he made his pledge in 1977? Is he also aware that the Treasurer has proposed a further increase of 0.5 per cent in semi-government borrowing rates, that the rates on some small, and most large, trading bank overdrafts have also risen by at least half a per cent and that commercial debenture rates have risen? In view of the substantially higher interest rate structure that is now emerging, how does the Prime Minister intend to honour his 1977 election pledge to reduce interest rates by 2 per cent? Or is it the case, as we strongly suspect, that he never meant to honour that pledge? </para>

            <para>-The statements that were made during the course of the 1 977 election campaign by the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister and me about interest rates have already been the subject of much debate in this House. As has been pointed out from this side of the House on a number of occasions, the statements then made by the Prime Minister were properly based on reasonable expectations deriving from advice which the Government had available to it at that time. As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, the circumstances of the Australian economy and, indeed, of the world economy have altered over the past two years. This has had an effect on a large number of economic indicators. The real question to which we should be addressing our minds is how Australia is faring in a difficult world economic environment. We ought to be looking at comparisons about how this country is doing with inflation and interest rates rather than the sorts of comparisons about which the Leader of the Opposition has spoken. Let me give the Leader of the Opposition some idea of how Australia has fared in the interest rate area over the past eight or nine months- during the course of this financial year. I am advised that, for example, bank lending rates for prime borrowers in Canada went up by 3 per cent. </para>

              <para>- Before I sat down a moment ago the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, I think, asked: &#39;What about inflation?&#39; I am more than happy to answer his interjection. The average rate of inflation over the past 12 months in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries has been, according to the consumer price index, 12 per cent. During that period the rate of inflation, according to that same measure, has been 10 per cent. Our rate of inflation is now significantly below the average of the industrialised world. That is in sharp contrast to what it was four or five years ago. It is doing even better, in a comparative sense, than it was in late 1 977. Over and above that, our rate of inflation is also a touch below the trade weighted average of our principal trading partners. The fact is that this country, in the face of very difficult international economic circumstances, is out-performing most of the industrialised world. That is something about which we should be extremely pleased. </para>

            <para>-The action of the Transport Workers Union in the port of Burnie has been completely irresponsible and is in total disregard of a decision of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The TWU, as the honourable member has said, has stopped all cargo going through the port of Burnie. This latest development is only the culmination of a dispute which started in the early weeks of January. It involves a demarcation dispute with the Waterside Workers Federation. It is worth noting that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission made an order in relation to this demarcation dispute following legislation which was introduced by this Government and passed by this Parliament specifically to deal with disputes of this kind. By disregarding this order the TWU has thumbed its nose at the people of Tasmania. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In addition, the Australian Council of Trade Unions has a long-standing policy to minimise the effects of industrial disruption, particularly of shipping services, on the people of Tasmania. It has accepted an obligation, as the leader of the trade union movement in Australia, to settle demarcation disputes. If the people of Burnie and Tasmania are to be relieved of the results of this irresponsible action, the ACTU has to carry out its obligations, which it has already accepted in respect of demarcation disputes, and ensure that the Transport Workers Union heeds the order made by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and allows normal shipping services to resume through the port. </para>

            <para>- I refer the Treasurer to money supply figures released yesterday which show an annual rate of growth in money supply of 13 per cent for the 12 months to January and also to the figures for the previous three months which show an annual growth of 19 per cent. Since the Treasurer has said that the Government will not allow anything to subvert its monetary policy objectives, what steps will the Government be taking to ensure that the money supply does not exceed the target of 10 per cent? Specifically, will he proceed with his previous commitment to provide tax cuts or will the Government use the extra oil revenue to reduce the Budget deficit and thereby reduce the amount of cash in circulation? </para>

            <para>- I am sure that the honourable member for Gellibrand, as a student of money supply figures, would be aware that money supply figures for a limited period can be affected by factors which, stretched out over a 12 months period, have a lesser effect. He knows that the figures to which he referred included two matters which may well not have the same effect over the remainder of the year. To start with, those figures included the very large private capital inflow of over $550m that was recorded in the month of January. Whilst the Government believes that there has been an underlying improvement in the level of capital inflow into Australia, it remains to be seen whether the volume of inflow continues at, precisely that level. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The second point to be made is that those figures also include a very large component of rural credits advances and I am advised that this will be the last month in which a large contribution from rural credits advances will go into the money supply figures. Over the remainder of this financial year one can expect not net additions to the money supply out of the Rural Credits Department, but rather net repayments to the Rural Credits Department from growers. So both of those factors will have a mitigating effect on the money supply. </para>
          <para>The honourable gentleman also ought to remember that one per cent on the money supply is about $400m. There is an enormous margin for error in trying to make precise calculations as to outcomes. It is a pretty hazardous operation to say: &#39;On the basis of this, X, Y and Z will be the precise outcome at the end of the financial year&#39;. Our monetary objective, which is to achieve an outcome of about 10 per cent, remains. That is a major objective. It is a principal purpose of our policy. We do not intend to be diverted from it. The question of how we achieve that policy is something which, from time to time, depends entirely upon the circumstances and from time to time it also depends critically on making judgments about what the final outcome will be. I caution the honourable gentleman that one ought not to jump to conclusions on the basis of figures for a limited period. </para>

We look forward very much indeed to his visit during the earlier part of this year. The Vice-Premier is the third most important person within the People&#39;s Republic of China and he will be the most significant visitor to come to Australia from the People&#39;s Republic of China. As the honourable gentleman would know, relationships between the People&#39;s Republic of China and Australia have developed well over recent years. With the modernisation of China&#39;s industry there will be increasing commercial and trading opportunities of which Australia should be well placed to take advantage. Therefore, we look forward to very useful discussions across the broad range of interests of the People&#39;s Republic of China and Australia which, no doubt, will cover not only bilateral matters and trade matters but also the international situation. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Housing and Construction: When does he expect the general rise in interest rates that is now under way to filter through into housing rates? What impact will the higher rates have on the monthly mortgage repayments of Australian home owners? Is it not a fact that for a family on average weekly earnings wanting to buy their first home a one per cent rise in interest rates will reduce their borrowing capacity by about $2,000, thereby widening the already substantial deposit gap for new home seekers? Do the impending interest rate increases reinforce the case for the Labor Party&#39;s home ownership grant scheme which is designed to reduce the deposit gap by substantially increasing the amount of mortgage finance available to families wanting to buy their first home? </para>

            <para>- The question of interest rates on housing has been raised before. In common with all other governments, this Government likes to see interest rates on housing as low as is proper and reasonable in all the circumstances. No government likes to see interest rates on housing go up and the policy objectives- of government are normally directed towards keeping the level of interest rates on housing at a point which is as low as practicable. I am not prepared- nor is any other member of this Government prepared- to give any undertaking or assurance about the level of interest rates in a particular area, and that applies to housing rates as it does to any other area. The most important thing that any government can do for home seekers and home owners in the Australian community is to follow general economic policies which keep levels of inflation and cost levels generally as low as possible throughout the community. Any government that believes it can do that in the longer term by not following a responsible monetary policy does not understand properly how the system works. </para>

Can the Minister advise the House of the situation in relation to those allegations by the person concerned and of what actions may be taken in future if such a situation arises? </para>

            <para>- I have read Press reports referring to a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> who was posted to the Australian Embassy in Rangoon as a building and services officer and who was arrested in Nepal on 16 November 1978. At this time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> was on recreation leave. He had advised the Embassy that he would take this leave in Bangkok. He was charged with attempting to smuggle into Nepal three suitcases containing watches and pocket calculators. He made a written statement to Nepalese Customs authorities admitting the offence. In this statement <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> also admitted to having travelled to Nepal in August 1978 with a similar consignment. He stated that he had received $US 1,000 for carrying the first consignment and about SUS600, with $400 to be paid later, for the second consignment. I would like to emphasise that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> received normal consular assistance from Australian and British representatives. The Australian High Commission in New Delhi, which has consular responsibility for Nepal, learned of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> &#39;s arrest on 25 November 1978. The Consul travelled to Nepal specifically to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> four days later and he subsequently saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> on three other occasions. As well as this, the British Consul visited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> in prison on 22 occasions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My Department has no record of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> bringing to the attention of the visiting officers the poor conditions alleged in a recent Press report, or of the alleged beatings. The Australian High Commission in New Delhi and the British Embassy in Katmandu made representations to the Nepalese authorities to have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> brought to trial or released. Twelve months after his arrest <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> was tried and sentenced to two years&#39; imprisonment, with the time served up to that date being taken into account. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunes</inline> was released under the King&#39;s pardon on 29 December 1979 and was assisted home by the Department of Foreign Affairs. In all these cases the Department and the Australian representatives overseas have acted in the interests of Australian citizens finding themselves in trouble overseas. </para>

These arrangements were being made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harrison,</inline> the Third Secretary at the Moscow Embassy, in his role as Olympic attache. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harrison&#39;s</inline> appointment as Olympic attache was made by the Australian Olympic Federation to the Soviet Olympic organising committee. I should like to emphasise that it is not a government to government appointment. The appointee is usually not an official and need not even be a national of the country whose Olympic body appoints him. In the present case, the Australian Olympic Federation requested the services of a diplomatic officer, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed because of the protection afforded him by his diplomatic status and his access to Soviet officialdom. In view of the Government&#39;s firm view that Australia should not participate in the Moscow Games, appropriate steps will be taken with respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harrison&#39;s</inline> continued availability and designation as Olympic attache. </para>

            <para>- Is the Prime Minister aware that the shrinking disparity between the price of liquefied petroleum gas and petrol, which is now inhibiting the conversion of vehicles to LPG, is directly attributable to the fact that the Australian oil price is now lagging import parity by up to $5 a barrel and that, under the Government&#39;s policy, LPG is priced precisely at the full world parity price? Does the Government intend to follow through its world parity pricing concept by raising the Australian oil price to the true world price so that the normal gap between LPG and petrol will be re-established, or will the Government achieve this by the alternative of abandoning its high-priced export parity LPG pricing policy? </para>

              <para>-The Government remains committed to oil parity pricing because it is the only policy which will look after the future interests of this country. The oil price is fixed on Saudi Arabian light crude. We know quite well that the Government announced in June of last year that there would be some flexibility in the flowing through of those price increases to the Australian consumer. It has been normal, while the policy has lasted, for the price adjustments to be made about January and about June. Therefore, the fact that the $2 price increase did not flow through a few weeks ago was very natural and if the honourable gentleman had any capacity to look ahead I think he ought to have been able to foresee that. It does not represent any breach in the Government&#39;s oil parity pricing policy which, let me repeat, is important in a number of respects. It is important to achieve adequate conservation of a scarce resource. It is all very well for the honourable gentleman to say, as he does, that he will take whatever the price is when Labor comes to government- which it never will- and then only put it up in accordance with changes in the consumer price index or in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries price, whichever is the lesser. Under a Labor government that would probably be the <inline font-style="italic">OPEC</inline> price increase because Labor&#39;s inflation would be higher than the OPEC price increase. </para>

              <para>- Honourable gentlemen opposite do not like it very much because they know quite well that that is the kind of circumstance that their policies would create. Under those circumstances, the honourable gentleman is quite misleading when he tries to suggest to the Australian public that the Labor Party would offer cheap petrol to the consumers of Australia, because it would not. Indeed, cheap petrol for Australian motorists would be a very selfish policy because it would mean that this generation of consumers would use up more than its fair share of a scarce Australian resource. I do not believe that the Australian electorate will support a policy that says: &#39; We are going to use up all the oil that is available to us; we are not going to leave any oil for our children &#39;. </para>

          <para>In addition to that, of course, major developments would not get under way unless there were oil parity pricing policies. The experiments that are now being undertaken- the pilot studies in relation to the liquefaction of brown coal and in relation to the development of the Rundle shale oil deposits- just would never move ahead. </para>

              <para>-The honourable gentleman also asked a simple question about oil parity pricing and is getting a simple answer in relation to it. Unless there is oil parity pricing, significant developments that will add very greatly to Australia &#39;s liquid fuel reserves will not take place, whether they be pilot plants for the liquefaction of brown coal, experimentation with black coal or major developments at Rundle which we hope will be able to move forward in the foreseeable future. Development in these areas is dependent upon there being a price for oil which makes those particular projects viable, which makes those particular projects economic. That, of course, is of great importance in the Government&#39;s overall pricing policies and in making sure that Australia achieves a level of self-sufficiency for the future. That is our intention and that is what we are going to do. The main thrust of our policies will certainly be continued. </para>

            <para>- I am concerned that the Australian Wheat Board has not been able to present its reports to Parliament by the requested dates. The failure to do so is not occasioned by any failure of the Board to recognise its responsibilities, or any lack of endeavour by the Board to meet the requirements of the Senate. Indeed, I was pleased to notice that the Rae Committee recognised the efforts of the Board in its conclusions, in that it stated:   the steps now taken by the Board, including the appointment of suitably qualified additional staff and the introduction of new accounting systems and practices appear to be likely to ensure that future financial statements and reports will be both timely and accurate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Regrettably, the Board has found that the exercise of changing the accounting systems from a pool year to a financial year has been somewhat more complicated and complex than was first thought and it has not been able to meet the requirements of the Senate Committee. The fact is that at the moment the field audit by the Auditor-General&#39;s Office of the Australian Wheat Board&#39;s accounts for 1976-77 is nearing completion and the Board &#39;s financial statements in final form have been received by the Auditor-General. Subject to there being no unforeseen difficulties, the preparation of the Auditor-General &#39;s report will commence shortly. Because of this I think it proper, appropriate and certainly logical to await the completion of the final audit by the Auditor-General before taking any decision on any further action that might be necessary. Having said all that, I should say that I have sought from the Board further information and assurances about its activity in terms of staffing arrangements and what it is doing in respect of the accounting problem to see whether the problem can be overcome more quickly. </para>

I refer to the Government&#39;s oft-professed claim, confirmed here again today, that its oil pricing policy is an energy conservation action and not a revenue raising device. In view of the fact that from this source the Government will receive $450m over the Budget estimate, will it now agree to set aside these funds in an identifiable energy fund to be used for research into and development of alternative energy sources? Further, will the Government ensure that future imposts from price rises will be so set aside? </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman knows full well that the taxes that come from oil do flow through to general revenues. It has been the long-standing policy of all Commonwealth governments, which I would imagine the honourable gentleman has supported, that revenue from one particular source is not predicated for a particular purpose. Rather, the Commonwealth makes judgments about the main areas of priority and allocates funds accordingly. It ought to be noted that considerable additional funds have been allocated in relation to our energy policies to research and development in recent years. </para>

          <para>When I was in the United States the  President  made it perfectly plain that the results of any research that the United States is undertaking in relation to energy matters would be available to us. Therefore, there is no point in Australia&#39;s duplicating work that is being done by countries which have much greater resources than we have. There is point in Australia&#39;s undertaking work that has a particular relevance to Australia&#39;s own circumstances but not in spending money on duplicating what others could do. Indeed, the resources which others devote to research are so large that the work could never be duplicated by other sources. The Government will continue to make judgments about these matters in the light of the broad priorities that it sees. I refer the honourable gentleman also to a statement that the Treasurer made on this very subject. </para>

Is the Prime Minister aware that, when Hitler invaded the Saar, the Rhineland, the Ruhr and Austria, each action was defended individually, in isolation and on its merits, and that this enabled him to argue: &#39;I have never absorbed into Germany any but Germanic peoples&#39;? Is the Prime Minister aware that therefore the process of expansionism was ignored by the world? Will he do all in his power to ensure that the Russian invasion of Afghanistan is not viewed in splendid isolation in a similar manner? </para>

            <para>-The Government will certainly do everything it possibly can to achieve just that. I would have thought that nobody wants to have to learn or to relearn the lessons of the 1930s. Last week in this Parliament we debated this particular matter and ended up, to a significant extent, with a resolution which, I believe, was bipartisan. The resolution called on all countries, either separately or jointly, to take what action they can to bring home to the Soviet Union the extent to which its actions in Afghanistan have created, and continue to create, a feeling of revulsion and abhorrence around the world. I believe, very much, that the main thrust of what the United States is seeking to do at the present time is designed to prevent the world, step by step, moving along the kind of path that it took from 1936 to the end of that decade. We do not want the kind of statements that were made on other occasions. Neville Chamberlain, on 27 September 1938, said: &#39;How horrible, fantastic and incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks here because of a quarrel between people of whom we know nothing&#39;. He was referring to Czechoslovakia. Of course, I know very well that the honourable member for Blaxland has made it perfectly plain that Afghanistan - </para>

              <para>-Order! The honourable member for Fremantle will remain silent. The Standing Orders of this Parliament have existed since Federation. They were copied from the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, which have a history of some hundreds of years. What is occurring in this House today is not unique to us. It has occurred many times in history. On all those occasions in history the Parliament has decided that the rules of debate and the standard of decorum must be maintained. If they are not maintained, the Parliament will collapse. I am sure that that is not the wish of anybody in this House. Therefore, if a statement is challenged and the manner of challenging it is pursuant to the Standing Orders, I will co-operate in allowing the Standing Orders to be used to challenge the statement that is seen as false, but I will not permit honourable members to resort to the use of unparliamentary language which imputes motives to other members of this House or which results in rowdy outbursts. I ask the Parliament to conduct itself with the dignity which the Australian people expect of it. I call upon the Prime Minister to continue his answer. I call upon those members of the Opposition who may disagree with anything which is given in answer to pursue their remedy under the Standing Orders. </para>

I would have presumed that to establish the case necessary to justify the suspension of Standing Orders it would be desirable to illustrate the pith of the argument against the Prime Minister. That, very simply, is that we have found him to be consistently dishonest in this House. To a degree, I suppose, it is bearable.

              <para>- I would not be proposing to move for the suspension of Standing Orders against the archangel. We want to make the point that this man is far removed from that sort of quality. This man has brought disrepute on the office of Prime Minister. In the several years that he has been Prime Minister of this country he has lowered the prestige and has demeaned the integrity of that office. He has done untold damage to it. Today his behaviour rose to new and unequalled heights. There were two substantial occasions, among many, that one could have detected today where he wilfully and maliciously set about thoroughly misrepresenting the position of honourable men in this House. The first was the case of the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> when the Prime Minister was totally unreliable- I avoid using the word dishonest&#39;- not only in his outline of a statement made by the honourable member for Blaxland which is on record in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> but also in impugning the objectives of the honourable member for Blaxland in relation to energy policy. The Prime Minister would not be so ill-informed as to have made those assertions through innocent error. They were wilful and malicious. But, of course, the most outrageous example was the wilful misrepresentation by the Prime Minister in relation to the attitude of the Opposition to the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. We find that intolerable and unacceptable. The Australian community would find such mean, low behaviour deserving of the most severe condemnation and repugnant to its sense of fair play. The Prime Minister has no sense of fair play. He is the sort of man who, if he did not pinch one&#39;s marbles, would take them home if one was not watching. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Prime Minister consistently has demeaned the office of Prime Minister since he became the Prime Minister of this country. At Question Time he resorts compulsively to misrepresenting what has been stated by the Opposition. One can only conclude that this is a very desperate act by a very unprincipled and desperate man- not the sort of man who should be leading this country; not the sort of man who should be striving to inspire a sense of achievement, cohesivenesss and integrity in the community. He is incapable of inculcating any of those qualities in the community as he himself is deprived of them. In this Parliament his personal behaviour consistently shows that he is bankrupt when it comes to the finer qualities which are necessary to instil in the community confidence and trust in the prime ministership and the government of this country. When it comes to handling matters of truth we have never had a more reckless Prime Minister. It is on these grounds that the Opposition finds it necessary to move for the suspension of Standing Orders so that we can debate the serious shortcomings in this man&#39;s integrity; in the calibre of the man who is Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> if you cannot trust the Prime Minister- you cannot; you know better than most people - </para>

              <para>- I conclude by asking: How can our fellow Australians have respect for the leadership of this country when, by his own behaviour, the Prime Minister destroys any justification for respect at all? He has no credibility. He displays no integrity. What are ethics to this man who is prepared every day to assault brutally the fundamental principles of truth, consistency, honesty and virtue- the finer qualities which are essential if we are to have respected leadership in this country? This country faces extremely difficult economic and social problems at a time when the evidence is that through international forces and government administrative incompetence they will get far worse in the 1980s. Today the great challenge for national leadership is to establish trust and social cohesiveness. This man is a divisive force within the community. He believes in confronting. When it suits him he believes in being totally and unrepentantly dishonest. </para>

            <para>- I think the House is entitled to know that certain members of this House have taken certain views in relation to Afghanistan. For quite some time I have taken the view that it would be much preferable for this Parliament and this nation to have a bipartisan view on Afghanistan and all those things that ought to flow from it. I was originally much encouraged in that because of the attitudes I had had expressed to me by the Premier of Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lowe.</inline> When we announced the original measures as a result of the Soviet movement into Afghanistan, he said that he understood and agreed and that we could have done nothing else in the circumstances, including one matter of some significance to Tasmania. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We had hoped that through the development of policies and discussions with other leaders there would emerge in Australia a consensus about the sorts of things that ought to be done as a response. There is a consensus around the world that the Soviet Union has created a highly critical and dangerous situation. That view is shared by the United States. Europe, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia, recognising that if action had not been taken by the United States and others we would have been moving into a highly dangerous and critical period. This Government and many others believe we would have been moving along a path that was set originally when there was no reaction to Germany&#39;s move into the Rhineland in 1936. It is therefore a sad thing that, while admittedly condemning the Soviet&#39;s invasion of Afghanistan, the Leader of the Opposition and those behind him seek to frustrate Australia, seek to frustrate this Government, in the pursuit of every measure we want to take. The Leader of the Opposition has made it perfectly plain that, while a boycott of the Olympic Games, for example, would get effective world-wide condemnation through to the Soviet Government and people, he will not do anything to work for that boycott. Indeed, having stated originally that he could support it and would support it if there was significant international support, he then moved to a position where he opposed it. He did that in such a way that he was actively campaigning against a measure he himself had indicated would bring home to the Soviet Union the world&#39;s abhorrence perhaps more effectively than anything else. Then there was the appalling statement by the honourable member for Blaxland - </para>

              <para>- I am making the point- one could go on and on- that spokesman after spokesman for the Australian Labor Party, while condemning the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan on the one hand, would seem to be seeking to offer excuses, seeking to offer reasons why nobody should do a damned thing about it. That is just not good enough for this Government and it is not good enough for this people. </para>

The words which must be withdrawn are the words which are unparliamentary and which attribute or impute motives of dishonesty to the person using the words. I heard the Prime Minister purport to quote what honourable gentlemen had said and then put a construction on it. That cannot be required to be withdrawn. The right honourable gentleman can put a construction on it. The honourable gentleman who used the words can then, under the Standing Orders, make it clear that the construction put upon his remarks by the Prime Minister is not the construction which was intended or alternatively is an incorrect construction, but it is not a matter for withdrawal. Unparliamentary expressions must be withdrawn. Nothing which the right honourable gentleman has said requires withdrawal. </para>

You have ruled that way. I would put to you that a reflection on the patriotism of the Opposition, either individually or collectively, as we have witnessed not once but several times from the Prime Minister today, is contrary to your interpretation of the Standing Orders in relation to proper standards of conduct in the House. That, essentially, is what members of the Opposition are asking you to rule on affirmatively and therefore consistent with rulings you have given on similar matters in the past.

            <para>-On Wednesday, 20 February, the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> asked me whether a reply to a question on notice with which he had been furnished during recess should not have appeared in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the first day of the sessional period. The objective of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is always to publish on the first day of sitting of a sessional period answers to questions on notice which have been provided during the recess. However, if the volume of such answers is large, it is sometimes necessary to hold over some of them for publication in subsequent issues of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> A large number of answers to questions on notice was provided during the last recess and as a result the Government Printer had to hold some over for publication on days following the first day of sitting. It is presumed that the question about which the honourable member for Reid was inquiring is question No. 5058 and the answer to this has now been published in the daily issue of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 21 February 1980. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister went on to say that I had excused the Russian behaviour in Afghanistan. He quoted from a speech which I gave extemporaneously to a conference in New South Wales. That speech was very selectively quoted in the Press, but even those quotations were accurate. As reported in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of 28 January 1980 1 said: </para>

        <para class="block">That remark was interpolated on the basis that Australia was not in any position to involve itself militarily in that part of the world, that I regarded the Soviet invasion as unforgivable, but that it was not as a result of any expansionist desire to take over other countries. My references to Afghanistan and Pakistan related to the poverty and degradation of those countries and that no other country would want to inherit those problems. I sought to argue the point that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was essentially, from its point of view, a matter which had to do with a border state, Afghanistan, which had been in the Soviet&#39;s orbit. I went on to say that I believed that there was no attempt by the Soviet Union to invade other countries. I make the point that the Office of National Assessments agreed to my approach. That is more than it does with the approach of the Government and, in hindsight, I stand completely vindicated. </para>

            <para>-Last Thursday night the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris)</inline> during his speech on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan referred to remarks attributed to me and reported in an article in the Hobart Saturday evening <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> of 9 February. I wish to make it clear to the House that the article in question did not accurately reflect my views and, in particular, that the sensational headline, namely, &#39;A fighter who sees a need for war&#39; was a gross misrepresentation of comments that I had made during the interview with the reporter concerned. Naturally, I abhor war, as I am sure does every honourable member of this House. As I explained to the reporter in the interview, like others I am apprehensive about the present tensions building up in Afghanistan and certain other parts of the world and I sincerely hope that Australia and other Western nations can succeed in their efforts to find a peaceful solution. For some reason those comments were not included in the article, which seriously misrepresented my views. Therefore, I wanted to take this opportunity to put the record straight. </para>

            <para>-The Prime Minister quoted remarks that I made as part of an assessment of the problems in Afghanistan. I indicate that, as far as I am able to ascertain, the remarks were quoted accurately. However, the Prime Minister then placed an interpretation on those remarks namely, that in assessing some of the reasons for the Soviet Union&#39;s entry into Afghanistan I was making excuses for the Soviet Union. It is, I think, dangerous for an honourable member, or for anyone, to make judgments based on inaccurate information. The Prime Minister has said that on this matter we should have a bipartisan approach. Such an approach could be possible if the Prime Minister were prepared at least to participate in such an approach. However, this type of statement, wherein he seeks to attribute false motives to me and to other members of the Opposition, gives no opportunity for a bipartisan approach. The Prime Minister in deliberately trying to make political capital and to denigrate the character of honourable members who try to make an honest assessment of the situation, who therefore examine all the facts, and arrive at a conclusion similar to that of the Prime Minister on the Soviet invasion, does a disservice to any suggestion of a bipartisan approach. </para>

        <para>I wish to refer to another instance of misrepresentation. The Prime Minister has indicated that members of the Opposition have had the opportunity to participate in a bipartisan approach. That is not correct. Members of the Opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> have been offered no access to security briefings or Government information on this matter. That has been deliberately withheld- for obvious reasons- because, on the Government&#39;s arguments, we could not agree with the Prime Minister. </para>

There is no way in which the contribution that I made to the Afghanistan debate could be interpreted or distorted so as to produce the kind of conclusion which the Prime Minister attributed to members of the Opposition.

            <para>-The honourable gentleman in fact was not making a personal explanation. He was taking a point about my ruling. I adhere to my ruling which is that if any honourable member puts a construction on something which another honourable member has said, that cannot be said to be imputing motives. All that can be done is for the honourable member who disagrees with the construction to take advantage of a personal explanation, the Standing Orders or whatever; and I will adhere to that. The word construction&#39; was the word that the honourable gentleman himself used in the point that he was just making. As to improving the standard of the House, I must point out to the honourable member for Shortland that he continued to speak after I had asked him to resume his seat. I remind the honourable gentleman that throughout the majority of Question Time he was interjecting. I have had to draw attention to the honourable gentleman on other occasions. Therefore, I suggest to the honourable member that when he calls for a lifting of the standard of debate in the House he may use his knowledge of Parliament and of what Parliament stands for to be an exemplar for the rest. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Shortland raised the question of your having used the word prevaricate&#39;. I am sure that is not exactly the word you meant to use about what he had to say because the general meaning of the word, as I understand it, is to mislead to the point of telling an untruth. Whilst there are a number of definitions of the word in the dictionary, that is the one that would normally be associated with its use. I suggest that whatever the word should be, the word &#39;prevaricate&#39; was not the one that ought to be recorded against the honourable member for Shortland. </para>

He has drawn my attention to the <inline font-style="italic">Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.</inline> That gives several meanings for the word prevaricate. Principally it gives the meanings: To deviate from the path of duty, to go aside from the right course, method or mode of action. That was my meaning in using the term, as I have already explained to the honourable member for Shortland. He has pointed out to me that there is a meaning derived from the Latin which is used in law, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Oxford Dictionary,</inline> and which could lead a person about whom the term was used to be offended. I assure the honourable gentleman that that was not my intention. If I use the word in the future it will be in terms of the meaning which I attribute to it; that is, to deviate from the path of duty, as a member, or to go aside from the right course- as a member- method or mode of action. </para>

            <para>-It is a pity to find the Parliament in the situation where, over four sitting days, the Government has refused to debate two matters of public importance. I ask the House to bear in mind that the Opposition forwent the first opportunity to discuss a matter of public importance on the first Tuesday after the recess in order to discuss the Afghanistan issue. It is very crude behaviour by the Government and one that it will not prosper in if it continues because the Opposition will use the forms of the House to guarantee that the Opposition&#39;s rights are protected. </para>

Once again the Government has found itself in a position where it has had to amend the Atomic Energy Act which was amended twice last year, three times in 1978 and on numerous occasions before that. As with these previous amendments, the Government has again failed to address itself to the fundamental inadequacies of the Atomic Energy Act, inadequacies which have been pointed out by the Opposition on many occasions. This Act was introduced in 1953 for purposes quite different from those for which it is now being used. It was originally drafted at the beginning of the Cold War. It was designed to enable the Australian Government, through the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, to control the exploitation of uranium in the territories and throughout the Commonwealth for defence purposes. Uranium mined and exported under the authority of this Act during the 1 950s and the 1 960s was destined for nuclear weapons use. </para>
          <para>This legislation is not relevant and is out of date. Therefore, the Government is forced to make numerous piecemeal amendments in an attempt to make it relevant but, of course, this has failed. This pattern of amendments will continue until the Government addresses itself to the inherent problems created by the use of this Atomic Energy Act for the peaceful purpose of mining uranium. </para>
          <para>The purpose of the Bill now before the House is to sort out difficulties created when the Atomic Energy Act was amended in 1 978. At that time the Government introduced changes to give the Commonwealth very wide scope to control the mining of uranium and other prescribed substances, as well as operations connected with uranium mining, without regard to the wishes of the States. This amendment led to confusion concerning the Commonwealth&#39;s ability to authorise the mining of uranium. </para>
          <para>Under the legislation it may have been possible for the Commonwealth to authorise the undertaking of uranium mining in a State even if this was contrary to State policy, and even though the exploitation of mineral resources is principally a State matter. The Government is seeking now to clarify the difficulties created by this change. At last it has recognised that there may be a Commonwealth-State conflict over such a matter. In amending this Bill the Government makes it clear that Commonwealth authority to mine uranium will be subject to the consent of the State concerned unless authority is given for the purposes only of the defence of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>Whilst the Opposition is not opposed to this amendment the fact that it has had to be made demonstrates two things: Firstly, the arbitrary nature of the Government to the uranium development issue; and secondly, the inadequacy of the Atomic Energy Act as the legislative basis for uranium mining and development in this country. Other amendments contained in this Bill relate to the penal provisions in the Atomic Energy Act. The Bill seeks to remove two of these provisions. One provision reads: &#39;That no action can be taken against the Commonwealth in the event of unlawful arrest, detention, search or seizure&#39;. The second provision reads: &#39;That the doing of an act preparatory to the commission of an offence is in itself an offence&#39;. Under this measure, the Commonwealth believes that someone who might be about to create an offence can be charged with the offence itself. </para>
          <para>The Opposition fully supports the removal of these provisions but we believe that the amendments do not go far enough. There are many unnecessary repressive and secretive provisions contained in Part IV of the Act which the Government has not sought to remove. About a dozen such provisions still remain. Some of these represent a serious threat to the civil liberties and rights of the Australian population. For instance, under sections 44, 45 and 46 of the Act a person can be prosecuted for various offences without necessarily showing that he or she was guilty of a particular act. He or she may be convicted on the circumstances of the case, on his or her known conduct as proved. The Commonwealth has the power to convict without actually proving him or her guilty. Further, under section 50 a person reasonably suspected of having committed or attempting to commit an offence under other sections of the Act can be detained, searched and arrested without a warrant. These are all carryovers from the days after the Manhattan project in America at the beginning of the Cold War in the 1950s when Australia was about to move into the field of nuclear science. </para>
          <para>If this Government is seriously concerned about the infringement of civil rights arising from the penal provisions of the Atomic Energy Act the question has to be asked: Why then has it not taken the opportunity to do something about the provisions? It seeks to remove two of the minor provisions but leaves these excessively repressive provisions in the Act. These provisions follow from the primary purpose of the Act to control defence-related use of uranium. They are not appropriate for an Act which also deals with the commercial exploitation of uranium, lt is possible to paint the scenario that if another substance was prescribed one could have all of these draconian provisions applying, say, to coal mining, tin mining or any other kind of mining within which anyone who even looked as if he were about to commit an offence, or in fact was committing an offence, could be detained. Imagine people working in the coal industry being arrested and being detained without a warrant. These are some of the problems that still remain. The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry recognised the problems that existed in the Act and objected to the use of the Atomic Energy Act for this reason. In the second report it quite specifically states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The security provisions of Pan IV of the Atomic Energy Act, some of which seem extreme in the current context, were doubtless enacted with defence considerations in mind. While they remain, public access to information is seriously curtailed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In his second reading speech the Minister for National Development, <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> stated that the remaining penal provisions are being reviewed. This means that further amendments will be necessary. If it is decided that something should be done the Government should have taken this opportunity to do something about these provisions and not introduce yet another amendment to this already savagely amended Act of Parliament. The entire part of the Act is objectionable and should not have been part of the legislation under which uranium exploitation operations are controlled and regulated. </para>
          <para>This Bill also seeks to remove section 60 of the Act. This section brings within the provisions of the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act all projects carried out by or on behalf of the Atomic Energy Commission. The amendment restricts the operation of that Act to projects declared by the Minister in a notice published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Government Gazette</inline> as being defence projects and this amendment also is long overdue. </para>
          <para>Whilst not opposed to these amendments specifically- in fact the Opposition pointed out all of these inadequacies in 1978 and 1979 in the Bill- the Opposition will not support further amendments to the Atomic Energy Act. We object to the use of this Act which establishes the Australian Atomic Energy Commission as the legislative basis for nuclear energy research and development, for the regulation and control of uranium mining, and for the commercial operations of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. This Act was introduced at a time when there may have been some need to keep Australia&#39;s options open on acquiring nuclear weapons. Cold War fears of atomic espionage were used to justify the severe security provisions of the Act. </para>
          <para>This legislation, under which the Atomic Energy Commission still largely performs its functions, is obviously outmoded and outdated. It has become increasingly obvious that the Act cannot be satisfactorily amended. During recent years the many changes have clearly demonstrated this. The Act cannot be amended in a way which will make it acceptable to the Opposition. It is out of date and out of touch with current needs. Further, the Atomic Energy Commission created by this Act should not be allowed to continue to function in its present form. At the moment the Australian Atomic Energy Commission carries out a variety of functions. In the main they are: Nuclear fuel cycle research and development; radio isotope preparation and distribution; regulatory and safety aspects of nuclear operations; de facto source of nuclear energy policy advice; and where necessary nuclear weapons research and advice and a minor amount of non-nuclear energy research. In many cases these functions are conflicting. The one body has the task of promoting nuclear activities and at the same time of regulating them. </para>
          <para>For these reasons the Opposition proposes the following amendment to this Bill: </para>

          <para class="block">In moving this amendment the Opposition acknowledges that a committee of the National Energy Research Demonstration and Development Council has recently completed a review of the research activities and capacity of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and has recommended certain changes. However, the terms of reference of this committee were inadequate and, in our opinion, as a result of the recommendations made, do not go far enough. The terms of reference predetermined the result of the review towards the retention of the Atomic Energy Commission in a modified form as a national centre for energy research. They precluded a consideration of alternative forms of national energy research centres. One of the major recommendations of the committee was, in fact, to expand the functions of a revamped commission to emphasise the development of non-nuclear energy technology. I will read recommendation 7 of the committee&#39;s report. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is recommended that there be two major interacting areas of project responsibility at Lucas Heights, one to be responsible for nuclear research and the other non-nuclear. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Opposition does not believe that this would be an effective way of promoting non-nuclear energy research. The Atomic Energy Commission &#39;s historic and present domination of energy funding is a matter of concern and even though the review committee has recommended decreased funding for nuclear research the Government is yet to act upon this advice. One of the problems about building a research and development agency around the Atomic Energy Commission is that the weight of 25 years of bureaucratic expertise in the nuclear area would probably direct the whole thrust of such an agency towards nuclear related research. For that reason the Opposition suggests that we break up the Commission into separate bodies to carry out those functions currently undertaken. The conflict of interest in the functions and objectives of the Commission cannot lead to any other conclusion. It is responsible for undertaking exploration for and processing of uranium, for constructing and operating nuclear reactors and for performing nuclear energy research. It also has a wide variety of monitoring and regulatory responsibilities associated with nuclear activities. These have included both advisory and executive responsibilities and have covered environment protection, health, safety, security and safeguards. </para>
          <para>There are several consequences of this dual responsibility for nuclear regulation and performance. Not least among them is that especially in a period of government financial cutbacks, as is presently the case, competition among different pans of the Commission&#39;s work has resulted in neglect of safety and environmental protection. This became evident again at the end of last year when the Atomic Energy Commission sought approval for funds to spend on security at Lucas Heights because of a warning from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation that security was inadequate. Following the expression of public concern over the conflict of interest within the United States Atomic Energy Commission that body was divided in 1974. The regulation and safety aspects of the use of nuclear energy were given to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and nuclear research became the responsibility of the Energy Research and Development Administration. In other words, the Commission was split into two separate parts. In Canada, the United Kingdom and West Germany these functions are also separate. The same should be the case in Australia. </para>
          <para>The promotional and regulatory functions of the Commission should be clearly divided. An independent regulatory authority should be established to be responsible for nuclear related environmental protection, health, safety, security, safeguards and other non-proliferation activities. The Opposition also proposes that a government corporation be established to conduct the present commercial activities of the Commission, such as the production of radio isotopes and other activities associated with nuclear medicine. We also propose further divisions to create a nuclear science authority which would do the kind of things that the Atomic Energy Commission has done since its inception. It would be far better to have a nuclear science authority established in its own right than to attempt to submerge the present functions within an energy research and development agency. If one were foolish enough to believe that the aims of such an agency would not be diluted by the force of 25 years of nuclear research and a career structure within the existing Commission, one would be seriously mistaken. We believe there should be a nuclear science authority. Those who committed their careers to this branch of nuclear research when it was something which was viewed by most people as an important scientific endeavour are entitled to maintain their places in the career structure which they have established in the Commission. A nuclear science authority would do that, but it would be separate and distinct from the energy research and development agency function, which we clearly outline. I commend the amendment to the House. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill (No. 2). The purpose of this legislation is to provide, among other things, for State consent prior to a Commonwealth authority mining uranium and prescribed substances in that State. It will overcome certain difficulties and doubts which were inherent in the Atomic Energy Act 1953 following amendments which came into force in 1978. I think that the Government is wise to bring in these amendments which become necessary in the atomic energy field from time to time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As the Atomic Energy Act stands at present the Commonwealth has very wide control over the mining of uranium. In regard to uranium mining, operations in relation to substances that are closely connected are also embraced by the legislation. Great doubt existed whether it would be possible for the Government to authorise or undertake uranium mining without regard to the wishes of a State. Problems arise because of the strategic nature of uranium and other prescribed substances. This makes it very necessary that there should be close government controls. This, of course, does not mean that actual mining operations should be conducted by or on behalf of a government. Circumstances could arise in which there would be a conflict of interests between a State and the Commonwealth. This can be readily recognised by all those who are interested in uranium and operation of the nuclear industry. Development and exploitation of mineral resources generally is a State matter. The Bill makes it clear that Commonwealth authority to mine prescribed substances will be subject to the approval of the State concerned unless ministerial authority is given only for the purposes of the defence of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>In his second reading speech the then Minister for National Development made it quite clear that the amendment would not apply to the Northern Territory other than to the Ranger development project. In relation to the security provisions of the Atomic Energy Act it is the </para>
          <para class="block">Government&#39;s policy that penal provisions, which were largely enacted for defence purposes will not be applied to ordinary commercial undertakings. This was made clear in the debate on the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill (No. 1) in 1 978. The Government has decided to examine further the penal provisions of Part IV of the Act having regard to their application to ordinary commercial undertakings, to restrict their operation in accordance with Government policy. The review of the penal provisions is currently under way. However, it has been decided that in the meantime several amendments could be made to the penal provisions. </para>
          <para>Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill repeal sections 54 and 58 of the principal Act which provide respectively that no action can be taken against the Commonwealth in the event of unlawful arrest, detention, search or seizure and that the doing of an act preparatory to the commission of an offence is, in itself, an offence. Clause 6 repeals section 60 of the principal Act, which applies the stringent provisions of&#34; the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act 1947 to all works of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, including commercial undertakings. The clause substitutes a provision which requires that a notice be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Government Gazette</inline> by the Minister if the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act is to apply to a work of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. The amendments provided for in the Bill were formulated following receipt of a number of representations from the various State governments in Australia and from other parties who are interested in the development of uranium. They do not affect in any way the powers provided by the Atomic Energy Act 1978 enabling the Commonwealth to implement nuclear non-proliferation safeguards in Australia pursuant to the Government&#39;s international obligations. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is dead set on eliminating the Atomic Energy Commission- this was made quite clear in the debate on 9 May 1978- and is apparently keen to set up a nuclear commission in its place. We should be mining, milling and marketing the yellowcake we produce in Australia. Unfortunately, it seems to me that members on the opposite side of the House are intent on doing all they can to stop this nuclear industry getting under way. Australia is a fortunate country in that it has 25 per cent of the world &#39;s known yellowcake, and possibly many more fields of yellowcake in Australia are yet to be discovered. Yellowcake in its present form is not dangerous when it is mined and we have markets for it all over the world- in the United </para>
          <para class="block">States, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, South Africa, Japan, France, and many other countries. We should be taking advantage of this market or it will pass us by as the years go on and this would be dangerous economically for Australia. </para>
          <para>With the shortage of petroleum products in this country it is quite evident that as time goes on we will need to import huge quantities of petroleum products from overseas, and this could give us a very adverse balance of trade. However, the mining, milling and marketing of our yellowcake would provide us with a source of income which would take care of the imbalance that would be created by such action. We are a fortunate country in this regard, and in the foreseeable future we have no need to construct a nuclear reactor. This could be attempted in the years that lie ahead, but at the present time all we have to do is get on with the joh of exporting our uranium. It is pleasing to see that Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd at Mount Isa is already doing this. At present it is the only exporter in this country. The Opposition seems to be intent on stopping the country from taking this action, and it is very difficult to understand why it is adopting this attitude. As I have said, mining, milling and marketing of uranium is already under way at Mary Kathleen in Queensland. Let us hope that in the very near future other enterprises will get under way and bring export income into this country. </para>
          <para>Certainly, when yellowcake is mixed with chemicals it becomes dangerous, and it is used in atomic power stations throughout the world. Let us consider the safety features of the nuclear industry. The American Navy has been nuclear powered for some 23 years but there has not been one incident or one life lost. There are atomic power stations in Great Britain and America, and in those countries atomic power is providing 1 5 per cent of the nation &#39;s needs. Last year it was a privilege for me to travel to Japan and to see the atomic power station at Yokohama Bay. On the day we were there the spent fuel was being taken out of the reactor and replaced by new fuel. Atomic power in Japan is providing about 1 5 per cent to 20 per cent of the power needed in that country. It was interesting to note that the spent fuel was being placed in cylinders and sent to Great Britain for treatment. We then visited South Korea, where the development in the nuclear power industry was a revelation. There are two very big nuclear power stations there, and we saw two further Westinghouse power stations under construction adjacent to them. </para>
          <para>We are in the nuclear age, whether we like it or not, and we should be taking advantage of it. We know that last year there were problems at Harrisburg in the United States, and great concern was expressed about them. However, I think the extent of nuclear knowhow became apparent when the technicians were able to avert any fatalities or serious results. There is no doubt that the technical knowhow in this field today is absolutely first-class. Let us get on with the job of mining our yellowcake and exporting it for the economic benefit of Australia. It is a pleasure for me to support this Bill. One does not mind amendments being made to Acts when they are beneficial amendments. I believe that the amendments to which I referred in my opening remarks will be beneficial to the industry and to Australia as a whole. I support the legislation and oppose the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- I second the amendment moved by the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating).</inline> Firstly, I want briefly to reply to the honourable member for Paterson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr O&#39;Keefe)</inline> who talked about the great economic benefits that will derive from Australia&#39;s involvement in the uranium mining industry. I challenge Government members and the Government itself to bring forward any information at all on the so-called economic benefits. I placed a question on notice to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> seeking any information on the long-term and short-term economic benefits to Australia of the uranium mining industry. The Government failed to make that information available because it does not know the answer. The truth is that the Government has entered into only one contract since it has been in office, and that contract is with the South Korean Government. Of course, we know about the stability of the South Korean Government. We know that since this Government entered into that arrangement the  President  of South Korea has been assassinated. This Government has an appalling record of entering into arrangements with governments with very questionable backgrounds. We hope it will consider the whole basis of the delicate problem of the uranium mining industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Bill is related to the uranium mining industry, which is interrelated with the nuclear power industry, which in turn is related to nuclear weapons and nuclear war. The report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry- the Fox report- states in its third recommendation that the nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. The report went on to say that this is the most serious hazard of all. This Bill is another example of the Government &#39;s failure to consider the real issues associated with the mining and export of uranium and the nuclear fuel cycle. It does nothing to resolve the many serious problems of uranium mining and nuclear power. These problems are at the core of the widespread concern in the Australian community about uranium mining. </para>
          <para>Problems such as the disposal of nuclear waste, the proliferation of nuclear weapons- I will say more about that later- the impact of mining on the delicate environment of the beautiful Alligator Rivers region and the Kakadu National Park area, which is where the Ranger uranium mine is situated, and the economic effects of large-scale uranium mining development, which were so lightly touched on by the honourable member for Paterson, have not been resolved by this Bill, other Bills or statements on uranium that the Government has put before this Parliament. The issue that this Bill pretends to be concerned with- the question of civil liberties- is largely a whitewash. </para>
          <para>This Bill does very little at all to remove the repressive cold war measures of the Atomic Energy Act. Let us look at the history of that Act. It was introduced in 1953 at a time when the cold war mentality was at its worst. The Act was introduced because we were mining uranium at Rum Jungle in the Northern Territory and supplying that uranium to both the United States and Great Britain to build atomic weapons. That is why the original legislation was introduced. The debate on the matter at that time was appalling. It was of no credit to any member of the Parliament, Labor or Liberal. Because of the cold war mentality that was sweeping the country at that time, even Labor men were looking under their beds in fright. The Parliament played a disgusting role at that time. We do not want to see any more the failures to address the question of civil liberties. We do not want to see McCarthyism; we do not want to see Santamariaism. We do not want to see those fears ever again in this country. We want more freedom; we want more rights; we want more equality; we want more justice in our society. Because of this Government&#39;s decision, the Atomic Energy Act will apply only to commercial mining at Ranger and not to defence mining, as the original Atomic Energy Act provided. </para>
          <para>Let us examine the provisions of the Bill. The Federal Government&#39;s authority to authorise uranium mining in a State is confined by clause 3 to the defence powers. It removes some of the powers which were introduced less than two years ago and which drew strong opposition from the State governments, including Liberal and National Party State governments. One can only conclude that this part of the Bill would not have been necessary had the Government bothered to consult the States before it introduced its package of uranium legislation. But the Government, in its insensitive rush to push through the legislation and clear the path for the uranium mining companies, did not even do that. The Prime Minister at that time gave the then Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> assurances that consultation would take place, but it failed to take place. The rest of the Bill relates to the draconian security provisions of the Atomic Energy Act. Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill repeal sections 54 and 58 of the original Act. These sections are a denial of any sense of natural justice and should be repealed. But the Bill leaves untouched the other 13 sections of Part IV of the Act, all of which raise serious concerns about secrecy, industrial rights and civil liberties. Clause 6 of the Bill requires that if the Approved Defence Projects Protection Act, certain provisions of which interrelate with this Act, is to be applied to any works of the Atomic Energy Commission, this must be gazetted by the Minister. Because of the Government&#39;s sale of the Ranger project, this Act no longer applies to Ranger. But the Bill in no way diminishes the Government&#39;s ability to use these defence powers, whether it be in industrial disputes involving the Atomic Energy Commission or against those who speak out against the activities of the Atomic Energy Commission. There are many other circumstances which have nothing to do with defence where such power could be used. </para>
          <para>The Bill fails to make any changes to the whole armoury of restrictive cold war provisions which make up so much of the rest of the Atomic Energy Act. I have already talked about the cold war mentality that prevailed during the year in which the Act was introduced. For example, under section 43 of the Act, workers can be fined $ 1 ,000 or imprisoned for six months for obstruction or hindrance of the Ranger project. A strike or other industrial action could be interpreted as an obstruction or hindrance. This section remains unamended. Under section 47 of the Act the section which I believe is the most repressive of all- a person can be found guilty on the basis of his known character. This section contravenes a person&#39;s basic right under British law- I put those words in inverted commas- to be considered innocent until proven guilty. Under this legislation, that right is thrown out the door. A person can be found guilty because of his known character. What sort of justice is that? Under section 50 of the Act, any person suspected of tampering or interfering with any property associated with the Ranger project can be detained, searched and arrested without warrant. If convicted, that person would be liable to seven years gaol. The Government has chosen not to repeal or amend this section of the Act. </para>
          <para>Probably the most disturbing feature of the Government&#39;s use of the Act at Ranger is the power it provides to restrict information in order to maintain secrecy. The Government always says: &#39;Let us trust the experts&#39;. That is the Government&#39;s whole argument. Of course the experts are so wrong. One has only to read the first Fox report to find out what the Commissioners had to say in respect of those so-called experts. The Commissioners were not very respectful at all of these so-called experts. The Commissioners said that the evidence of these experts could not stand up to any real cross-examination. But the Government still says: Let&#39;s trust the experts&#39;. People trusted the experts in the Three Mile Island incident and look at the problems involved there. We cannot trust the experts because so many things in relation to the nuclear power industry- an industry interrelated with nuclear war- are unresolved. We cannot divorce one from the other. An article in today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper deals with plutonium which is part of the waste at nuclear power stations. The article makes the point that the moving of plutonium into the weapons industry cannot be stopped if countries are intent on moving into that section. </para>
          <para>Under the Atomic Energy Act contractors and any other members of the public can be prosecuted for communicating or acquiring restricted information. The penalty is seven years imprisonment. These powers are still in the Atomic Energy Act and apply to the Ranger project. The second report of the Ranger inquiry about which I spoke earlier in commenting on these provisions stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>While they remain, public access to information is seriously curtailed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister claimed in his second reading speech that the Government&#39;s policy is not to apply penal provisions which were enacted for defence purposes to a commercial undertaking, and that they are now under review. But I ask again, are they under review? We have now been dealing with this legislation for more than three years. How long must we give the Government to review the situation? I believe that this Bill is just a sop to offset the criticisms that have been levelled at the Government. Two and a half years have passed since I drew attention to the implications of the use of the Atomic Energy Act at Ranger for civil liberties and industrial rights. If the Government&#39;s intentions are as the Minister has stated, why has it not taken an earlier opportunity to remove these powers from the Atomic Energy Act? Clearly, that is not the Government&#39;s intention. I repeat that this Bill is nothing but a sop to the widespread criticism that has been levelled at the Government for its use of the Atomic Energy Act. In fact, the whole thrust of the Government&#39;s legislative program has been the introduction of repressive and restrictive laws such as the Atomic Energy Act. I refer not merely to this Act in isolation and to the actions of this Federal Government, but also to the actions of State conservative governments. </para>
          <para>We have only to look at the amending legislation on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and, recently, to the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to see what a low priority this Government gives to civil liberties and the long-held industrial rights struggle of the workers of this country. It has no respect for civil liberties or the rights of individuals. In fact, in this era through which we are passing more and more pressure will be brought to bear to put on the statute books legislation to intimidate workers against taking action. The whole attitude of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> during Question Time illustrated that. He attempted to interpret in his own way what members of the Opposition had said. He referred to the criticism of the Soviet Union by Opposition members but said that because they had examined other aspects in their speeches they had done so with the certain purposes of softening their criticism of the Soviet Union. He was trying to interpret their meaning. </para>
          <para>What faith, what respect, can one have for a government with a Prime Minister who interprets things in that way? This is why I am asking the people to give deeper thought to these repressive laws and oppose them. In this day and age we should not be intimidated. We should not be frightened by intimidatory laws. We should have the courage to stand up and take action where necessary to make sure that these repressive laws are removed from the statute books. A clear policy of the Fraser Government has been to introduce new draconian powers for use against those progressive forces in the community which have resisted its policy. They are an integral part of the Fraser Government&#39;s strategy for achieving a massive transfer of wealth and power in Australian society from ordinary people to the corporate sector, a major part of which is owned by foreign interests, and which the Fraser Government really represents. I know that there are men of good will on the Government side. I am not trying to brand them all in the same way, but one must have a greater understanding of what is happening. The truth is that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> as a Country Party representative, can see that more and more power is being given to overseas and city-based corporations, and the small people have very little power indeed. That is the real strength of this Government. </para>
          <para>The Atomic Energy Act is inappropriate, not only as a basis for uranium mining at Ranger but also for the other scientific, industrial and commercial functions of the Atomic Energy Commission, which have nothing to do with defence at all. The restrictions on the free flow of information, and on criticism of the Commission, have for too long allowed a small entrenched elite at Lucas Heights to wield unchallenged power over a very large slice of the nation&#39;s research funds. They have escaped the scrutiny and peer group criticism that are normally associated with scientific research. </para>
          <para>The Atomic Energy Act is a product of the McCarthy period, to which I referred earlier. Repressive and restrictive measures permeate its every facet. If the Government were serious about not using its penal provision, it would not have to use the Act in respect of the Ranger project. It would repeal and redraft the legislation on mining in that area. I believe that after 1 980, this Government having been defeated, that project will never be proceeded with. That has been set out clearly in Labor Party policy. </para>
          <para>I have said that the Atomic Energy Act can be used to restrict information on the operations of the Ranger project. A vital area in which we can be sure these powers will be used is that of the health of workers, and of the Aboriginal people who take their food and water from the Magela creek system. This is the sad situation in that area. Because of the delicate environment, I feel that more and more information concerning what is going on will be restricted. We can be sure that, when there is a conflict between the commercial interests of mining companies and the interests of health, information will be suppressed under this Government. </para>
          <para>Several years ago documents were leaked from Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd and </para>
          <para class="block">Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd which showed that they were determined to deny workers any but the scantest details concerning exposure to radiation at the Mary Kathleen uranium mine. It was an internal memo which instructed doctors and other staff to keep the information from the worker. The company was afraid that it would be used in the years ahead by workers who had contracted radiation-related diseases to support claims for compensation. It was afraid that the public would become aware of the hazards associated with uranium mining. The provisions of the Atomic Energy Act which cover Ranger, and of the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Act, which applies to all uranium mines, ensure that that sort of practice can continue. Only last August, in reply to a request from a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly for information on radiation levels at Nabarlek, the Northern Territory Minister for Mines and Energy stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The information which you request cannot be released without the express permission of the company concerned. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the attitude of Government parties to the right of the public and of workers to have access to vital information which affects health. I believe that the Bill is so bad that even though our amendments might make some progress towards improving it, at the third reading stage we should and will oppose it. </para>

          <para>-This is a fair example of the way in which the Government runs this place. It cannot even bring out an agenda paper for the Parliament that will last more than a few hours. This afternoon we have seen the Parliament abused, traduced, spoilt and sabotaged by the way in which the Government operates to suppress the voices from this side of the House. The fact that it has to amend a Notice Paper within two or three hours of bringing it out just shows the way it runs the country. </para>

            <para>- Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I stated that I opposed the motion which was moved by the Leader of the House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner.</inline> He moved that Orders of the Day Nos 3 and 4 be postponed until a later hour this day. Orders of the Day Nos 3 and 4 were two Bills which were set down on the Business Paper to be discussed by this House. They were the Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Amendment Bill. What the Government is seeking to do- I oppose this- is to defer discussions on those Bills until some later time, if not this day then maybe tomorrow, depending upon how long it is prepared to allow this other debate, which it wants to bring on, to run. I severely criticise the Government for its timid attempt, if I can call it that, to play politics in a large way in an attempt to discredit the Australian Labor Party which is the Opposition in this House. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Let us look at what happened in this House today. A matter of public importance was brought on by the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren).</inline> The subject of the urgency motion was to discuss a matter of great importance to the people of Australia; that is, the failure of the Government&#39;s policies to prevent a rise in interest rates and the damaging effect a rise will have on low and middle income earners repaying home loans and on an unstable housing industry. What more important subject could we have for discussion in this House than a matter which will affect the ordinary people of Australia who are facing that real possibility of an increase in their housing repayments? It is fairly clear cut that there will be an increase in housing loan interest. Today the Government refused to allow this motion to be discussed. Why did it do that? What does it fear in having a motion discussed which will highlight the failures of the Government in the realm of housing loan interest rates and the real possibility of the hardship that will be incurred? </para>
        <para>I am speaking on principle on this issue. I am speaking as a person who values principle before politics- to be quite blunt about it- and I have suffered for it. I do not mind suffering for putting principle before politics because I refuse to play party politics per se. The principle of the issue that we are discussing here tonight is looking at the motive of the Government in pulling out notice No. 1 12 which is a motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman).</inline> Quite frankly I agree with the terms of the motion. What is the motive of the Government in deciding to allow the motion to be discussed, which was moved by an Australian Labor Party member, and then joining with it a report of the Sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on Human Rights in the Soviet Union? What is the motive of the Government in suddenly bringing out of the hat notice No. 1 12 on the General Business Notice Paper? The honourable member for Prospect, who is one of my colleagues and a very good member of this Parliament- a man whom I intensely admire- gave notice of it only on 19 February 1980. What is the motive of the Government? </para>
        <para>The Government controls the business of this House. The Opposition does not control the business of the House; the Government controls it. What is the motive of the Government in suddenly deciding that it will allow the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect to be discussed? He gave notice of his intention only on 19 February 1980. Notice of the first Notice of Motion, which was moved by a Liberal Party member, was given on 28 February 1978. Has the Government suddenly become magnanimous and bighearted in wanting to help the Labor Party, the Opposition? That is certainly not so on its form that I have seen in the 10 years that I have been a member of this Parliament and certainly not on its form that I have seen even as late as today. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Grayndler said: &#39;They are phoneys&#39;. They are phoneys. Let us look at this situation realistically. We had a shambles at Question Time today. The shambles was caused by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> saying that members of the Australian Labor Party were apologists for the Soviet Union. I did not take exception to that because there was such a shemozzle going on in this House today at Question Time that the time was not opportune. But I take exception now to the suggestion that the members of the Labor Party are apologists for the Soviet Union&#39;s invasion- I call it invasion- of Afghanistan. Nothing could be further from the truth than to say that members of the Australian Labor Party are apologists for the Soviet Union. We roundly condemned the Soviet Union last week. It was decided purely by numbers as to which motion went through in this House. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I doubt the sincerity of the Government in allowing this motion of the honourable member for Prospect to come up for discussion tonight except for one reason. The Government will attempt to belt the guts out of the Australian Labor Party and say once again, as the Prime Minister said today, that the Australian Labor Party is an apologist for the actions of the Soviet Union. The Government and the combaters on the other side will attempt- mark my words during this debate tonight to create the impression in the minds of the people of Australia that the Australian Labor Party is just an offshoot of the Communist Party. We will have the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Neil)</inline> getting up in high dudgeon. He is the greatest combater that we have in this Parliament. He has not been into the House yet but if and when he does come in, if he is allowed to speak, mark my words, the tripe and cant will pour from his lips. I hesitate to say that we, as an Opposition, have fallen into a trap on this matter, but I have the feeling at the back of my mind that, to a certain extent, we will fall into the trap set by the Government even by granting leave for this matter to come on for debate tonight. </para>
        <para>I have no truck with the Soviet Union and the way in which it treats its people in its own country or in the other countries which it has invaded such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the southern states of Africa and now Afghanistan. I have no truck with what it has done in Africa. Let us- I say this to people on my own side of the Parliament- not fall into the trap of allowing the Government to try to make political capital out of something which should be beyond politics. The way in which the Soviet </para>
        <para class="block">Government treats its own people should be beyond pure party politics. Why is the Government allowing it? Is the Government allowing it because it is in trouble? It is in trouble in this country as was shown in Western Australia last Saturday and as was shown in the seat of Castlereagh in New South Wales last Saturday. The Government is in trouble and it is trying to create a diversion. I well remember the great big red arrows on maps, particularly appearing in the Queensland Press in the 1960s and in recent times at the last election showing the path of the Corns coming down to invade Australia. Unfortunately gullible people believe that this is a fact. It is poppycock. It has been used by the Liberal Party from time immemorial. It got Menzies in and it kept Menzies in. </para>
        <para>The Prime Minister realises that people are gullible. Unfortunately there are gullible people in this country otherwise we would not have a Liberal-National Country Party in government now. They must be gullible for putting those parties in Government. I counsel caution on allowing the Government an opportunity once again to pour the bucket on the Australian Labor Party. I take exception to what the Government is doing. Honourable members should mark my words when I say that the Government will allow this debate to proceed tonight for as long as it can make political capital out of it. It will then drop it like a hot cake. I oppose the motion. </para>

          </list>
          <para class="block">I have some reservations about the final amendment and will make my position clear during the debate. Firstly, let me emphasise that the Soviet Union is not the only country in the world which interferes with human rights. Deplorably, there are a large number of countries which interfere with human rights. In fact, there are relatively few countries in the world which do not significantly interfere with human rights. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, of which I was a member, which investigated human rights in the Soviet Union, addressed itself to that particular point. It is an important point and I would like to read into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the following points made by that Committee: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is important that Australians should be made aware of the treatment by the &#39;Superpowers&#39; of their own citizens, because it would surely follow that any government is unlikely to treat citizens of another country better than its own citizens. Therefore, in order that Australia may pursue an intelligent foreign policy, it is necessary for its Parliament to have some awareness of the behaviour of the governments of those countries with which Australia has to deal. Above all, the survival of the international order is most dependent on the &#39;Superpowers&#39;. Insofar as human rights should be a critical part of such an international order, the role of the &#39;Superpowers&#39; in relation to human rights is an essential matter for examination. </para>
            <para>A second reason justifying this inquiry is that the Soviet Union is not merely a &#39;Superpower&#39; but is also a leading nation within a group of countries embracing a large part of the earth&#39;s area, and the earth&#39;s population, which presents an ideological system which, its adherents believe, should be adopted by the other peoples of the world. It must surely be helpful, in assessing such an ideological system, to look at what have been the consequences of that system in the country which was the first to adopt it and which is the leading country advocating that system. </para>
            <para>A third reason is to be found in the signing of the final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe at Helsinki in 1975. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There the important point is made that whilst we are not signatories to that agreement- we are not invited, not being a European community- in that statement good relations between countries were linked with the observance of internationally agreed principles on human rights. In fact, the Soviet Union itself quoted the Helsinki Agreement when it has criticised various Western signatories to the Agreement for alleged violations of human rights. The Committee agreed that the human rights provisions in the Helsinki Agreement are important and that their observance by the major signatory countries is a matter of concern to the Australian Parliament. </para>
          <para>While I am dealing with the Soviet Union and that report important points emerge as to why I have concentrated on Andrei Sakharov and other dissidents in this motion. At the same time I wish to emphasise a point I made the other day that there is a fair bit of hypocrisy on the part of the Government. I do not have the fear expressed by the honourable member for Banks <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Martin)</inline> that somehow or other attacks on the Soviet Union are attacks on the Labor Party. To my mind this should not be so. Let me emphasise that the first people who are eliminated in countries taken over by the Soviet Union are not the so-called capitalists but the social democrats and the democratic socialists in those countries. They are the first people to be eliminated. </para>
          <para>It is a claim of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that it overthrew the czars. Obviously that is not true. It overthrew the Kerensky Government, one of the first social democratic governments which existed in the Soviet Union. It was the Kerensky Government or the people supporting that government, which overthrew the dictatorship of the czars. It was a relatively democratic country- I stress &#39;relatively&#39; obviously- as we are talking about a war situation when the Soviet Communist Party came to power at the end of the war. </para>
          <para>Let me deal with the hypocrisy of the Government. The Government talks a lot about the Soviet Union. It does very little about the Soviet Union. The most shameful act that has ever been perpetrated by any government in this country was in 1978 when the Soviet Union informed our embassy in Moscow that it had invited a parliamentary delegation from Australia, but that no member of the sub-committee dealing with human rights in the Soviet Union was able to participate in that delegation. This Government, to its everlasting shame, did not tell this Parliament. As it happened, the people who were elected by both sides of the Parliament to go in that delegation did not know anything about the restrictions placed on the membership by the Soviet Union. The delegation did not include any members of this sub-committee. It is a very great pity and it is to the Government&#39;s everlasting shame that, by not telling the Australian Parliament, it played into the hands of the Soviet Union by allowing it to dictate who should be the members of a parliamentary delegation to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. </para>

              <para>- As the honourable member for Hawker pointed out, it is disgraceful. I hope the people on the other side of the House agree. The next point I make is in relation to what is happening at present. I think many of us from both sides of the House who are reasonably minded agree that the Soviet Union is a very severe threat to the free world. It is a country which appears to have imperialist ambitions. I will deal with that in a minute. Most importantly, there has to be some sort of united opposition to the extension of its power. The Prime Minister par excellence is trying to play what is happening at the present time according to straight out party politics. I think he should be condemned, not only by people on our side of the political fence in Australia, but also by people on the other side of the political fence who are concerned about what is happening in Afghanistan and all over the world where the Soviet Union has exhibited its aggressive intentions. </para>

          <para>Today the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in answer to a question- I cannot recall who asked the question- started to answer perfectly correctly. He said that he was pleased that a resolution on Afghanistan was finally passed last week unanimously by both Houses of this Parliament. We had some reservations about one particular sentence in that resolution as members of this House will recall, but we did not oppose the final resolution. He agreed that we all condemned the Soviet Union in the terms laid down by this Government and, having said that, he immediately went on to say that the people on this side were apologists for the USSR. I think that is a ridiculous proposition. How can one say we are apologists for the USSR if we unanimously support a resolution condemning the Soviet Union which the Government has put up? </para>

              <para>- There was no division because there was no opposition to the resolution. The only opposition to the resolution was on the question of whether this incident was the gravest threat to world peace since the Second World War. People who have followed foreign affairs, who remember the Cuban crisis, the blockade of Berlin and other episodes in the last 30-odd years will probably agree with me that it is not the gravest threat. That is a point on which we can disagree. It is not relevant to the suggestion that we are apologists for the USSR. One does not have to believe that every move of the Soviet Union will immediately lead to world war. I do not think there is very much we can say about Sakharov. I think all members of this House will agree with the general terms of the resolution, whilst some people may have some quibbles on particular points. I point out to members of this House some aspects of the Soviet Union &#39;s criminal law. I ask leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> article 70 and article 190/ 1 of the Soviet criminal law which is part of annex D of the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. </para>

          <para class="block">None of us would support that sort of legislation in our political system in our State but, at the same time, it is important to realise- I came to realise it more when I was sitting on that subcommittee that even the KGB in the USSR has become bureaucratised and more legalistic. I think that is an important point and a good point. When we were interviewing and hearing evidence from people who had, in fact, been condemned and convicted in Soviet courts, who had finally left the Soviet Union and who obviously were not friendly to the Soviet Union, they again and again pointed out to us that it is important to know what one is doing, to know the criminal law. In the last 10, 15 or 20 years in the Soviet Union from that point of view conditions have improved. In other words, the Government is trying to frame people. I think it probably in some cases still gets convictions when, in fact, the person is innocent. One of the important points relevant to the Sakharov case is that he has not been charged at all. No charge has been laid against him and no trial has been held. He was banished to a city some 400 kilometres from Moscow. That is one of the important points. In the Soviet Union before the Second World War that person would have finished up in a concentration camp or would have been executed. </para>
          <para>Only recently I re-read a Soviet publication the Hansard, so to speak- of the trial notes of what were called Trotskyites and counter-revolutionaries in the late 1930s. I would recommend those trial notes to people who are interested in civil liberties and in what happens in the Soviet Union. Things have changed for the better since then, but it is important that we continue to exert pressure on the Soviet Union to improve things. That is the most important point. All the dissidents keep on reminding us that we have to exert pressure on the Soviet Union to help dissidents. If we forget about them they finish up in gaol, or worse. We have to keep on giving publicity to the matter. </para>
          <para>A significant point in dealing with the Soviet Union- it is a point we made in our report in a round about sort of way- is that the USSR can be, and to my mind is, an aggressive and imperialist country because it is totalitarian. It is an important point that totalitarian countries can get away with aggression and imperialism much more easily than democratic countries can. I made the point the other day that there is a significant difference- quite apart from what other reservations we have- between what the US did in Vietnam and what the USSR is doing in Afghanistan. One of the most important points is that the United <inline font-style="italic">States of</inline> America could not get away with the sorts of things it was doing in Vietnam because every night pictures of what was happening were shown on television. Every night there were discussions about it. People who opposed the USA &#39;s involvement were able to get access to radio, televisions and newspapers and to argue the point. Finally they got the support of the majority and they certainly divided the United States people. </para>
          <para>None of this can happen to the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is silly for people who say the Soviet Union is dragging itself into the same sort of morass that the United States dragged itself into in Vietnam because the Soviet people will probably- if the Soviet Government does not want them to- never be aware what is happening in Afghanistan. The Soviet people will hear odd references to it when they listen to the British Broadcasting Commission or Radio Free Europe or whatever, but they will not know otherwise. The important point as far as we are concerned as individuals and speaking for myself as internationalists is that if we can bring about democracy in Russia it will help not only the Russian people but also the people of the constituent republics, whether in the Baltic states or in the more willing constituent states of the USSR, and it will help the rest of the world. A democratic country would not be able to start an aggressive war without having some sort of discussion in its newspapers and in the media in general. </para>
          <para>In the time I have left I should like to refer to one sentence in the amendment that has been foreshadowed. The Opposition will not divide on the amendment, but at the same time I disagree with it and I know that the honourable member for Hawker, who served on the Wheeldon committee with me, also disagrees with it. I refer to the emphasis on the word &#39;Jews&#39; in the phrase including the rights of minorities such as the Jews&#39;. The Jews have been discriminated against in the Soviet Union. </para>

              <para>- There are a hell of a lot of other minorities, as the honourable member for Hawker has pointed out. If we looked at the matter impartially we would know that, of all the minority groups, the Jews have done relatively well in the Soviet Union because of the support they have received from people outside. There are many other minority groups who have done far worse than the Jews. I am not suggesting for one minute that Jews are not being maltreated, are not being discriminated against in the Soviet Union, but I think it is silly for us to emphasise the position of the Jews there. People who embrace the Baptist faith or are members of other religious or national minority groups in the Soviet Union have suffered much more because they have had far less publicity and far less help from countries outside the Soviet Union. I hope that the rest of the debate tonight will deal with some of the recommendations in this report on human rights in the Soviet Union. They are important recommendations. </para>

            </item>

          <para class="block">The Government welcomes the opportunity afforded by this debate to examine the general question. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> As I was saying, I should like to begin by commending the members of the Sub-committee on Human Rights in the Soviet Union, a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, for the thoroughness and clear-sightedness of their report. I should also like to point out that the sub-committee was made up of both Government and Opposition members. The report is not a party political document. It presents a graphic picture of the systematic abuse of the basic human rights of sections of Soviet society and stands as an indictment of the Russian authorities. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republic&#39;s invasion of Afghanistan and the attempted subjugation of that country&#39;s people fully supports the report&#39;s observations. The report clearly demonstrates the abuse of human rights that have occurred and continue to occur in the USSR. It demonstrates that systematic and deliberate violations of human rights occur as a matter of course in the Soviet Union. The report&#39;s recommendations are under active consideration by the Government, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> will report to Parliament on them in due course. </para>
          <para>As with the  speaker  who preceded me, I am sure that other speakers in this debate will present information giving further support to the report&#39;s findings. Because of this I do not propose to confine my remarks tonight to the Soviet Union&#39;s bleak human rights record. In adopting this stance, I remind honourable members that the report before the House particularly noted at paragraph 10.47 that: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The effect of any such pressure on the Soviet Union will be diminished insofar as similar denials of human rights in friendly countries are not likewise exposed by critics of the Soviet Union. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">However, before proceeding I should like to add my voice to those who have deplored the internal exile of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Andrei</inline> Sakharov. As the Government has made clear to the Soviet authorities, we regard this latest act of persecution as a further example of their flagrant disregard of the human rights principles embodied in the United Nations instruments and in the 1975 Helsinki Accords. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed).</inline> It should be emphasised that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Sakharov&#39;s</inline> fate is only the latest example of such action by the Soviet authorities. Over many years they have arrested, exiled to distant pans of the USSR, or expelled to the West a number of dissidents. It is true that a country&#39;s peculiar economic, social, cultural and historical circumstances need to be taken into account when considering that country&#39;s record in the field of human rights. But it is equally true that there are some basic rights which must be accorded to the citizens of any country no matter what the circumstances. That is why the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the covenants which have sprung from it make it clear that violations of human rights are the concern of all mankind, not just the Government and people of the country in which those violations occur. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government fully supports this principle. It is therefore concerned about infringements of human rights wherever they occur. Because of this, we are working to improve international machinery for protecting human rights and to promote support for the human rights standards set out in international instruments. Australia is currently a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and will be seeking re-election for a second three-year term when its current term expires at the end of this year. We are confident that this bid for re-election will be successful. The Commission on Human Rights is the principal body within the United Nations for the consideration of human rights questions. As well as examining reported violations in particular countries, it sets international standards for promoting human rights. The thirty-sixth session of the Commission is currently meeting in Geneva. Its busy agenda includes proposals to set standards in relation to torture and other inhumane treatment, the rights of the child and religious intolerance. Australia is participating actively in these deliberations as the Government believes that the human rights of mankind generally can be advanced by the enactment and subsequent observation of such international standards. </para>
          <para>In recent times there has been encouraging evidence that regimes which persistently violate their citizens&#39; rights eventually pay the price for so doing. Examples that immediately spring to mind are countries such as Nicaragua, Uganda and the hitherto self-styled Central African Empire. </para>

          <para>Looking closer to Australia, I am glad to report that the Indonesian Government has recently honoured its intention, initially stated in 1975 and re-affirmed on a number of occasions, to release or bring to trial by the end of 1 979 all remaining prisoners detained for involvement in the 1965 coup attempt. This process of international improvement is by no means complete and the Government shares the deeply held concern of many Australians at the prevailing situation in a number of countries. </para>
          <para>A country of particular concern to the Government is Kampuchea. The citizens of that country now find themselves in a situation whereby one oppressive regime has been replaced by another. It is now almost universally acknowledged that the Pol Pot regime committed gross abuses of human rights. The Australian Government has repeatedly condemned the excesses of that regime, but that does not mean that we can condone Vietnam&#39;s actions. There is also evidence to suggest that significant human rights violations have occurred in a number of countries in Latin America. Some of these situations will be considered by the current session of the Commission on Human rights and Australia will be adding its voice to those calling for a return to standards of decency and recognition of human dignity in those countries. At the same time, the Government believes that it is important that charges against any country or group of countries should be thoroughly investigated and properly proven before action is taken. The influence of the Commission would be considerably lessened if it were seen to act hastily or without proper procedures. Those who wish to frustrate the Commission&#39;s work would be in an easier position to do so if they could point to evidence of vindictiveness or dishonesty in its proceedings. Australia has been very prominent in the last three sessions of the Commission in working to improve its procedures so that the Commission not only would be more effective but also would be seen to be more effective. </para>

            <para>-The move by the USSR into Afghanistan is principally seen in terms of its destabilising effect on international stability. It is of extreme importance to all countries because of this, but it should also be seen as yet another example of the Soviet authorities&#39; disregard of human rights beyond their own borders. By invading Afghanistan, Russia has taken from the citizens of that country the fundamental right to choose their own government. It would not be difficult- even for honourable members opposite- to conclude that the Soviet Union had also deprived the Afghan population of other human rights which we in Australia take for granted. Russia&#39;s actions in Afghanistan on this score alone should be condemned by all Australians. I would like to conclude by quoting from the Sub-committee&#39;s report, pan of a statement made in 1975 by Andrei Sakharov on the emigration of Soviet Jews and unsuccessful pressure by the United States on the Soviet authorities in this area: </para>

          <para>An analysis of the whole course of events shows that the real reason for the complex situation which has arisen was the lack of unity, of understanding, and of the necessary altruism in the West. It is deplorable that the initiative of the US Congress not only failed to receive support from other Western countries, their parliaments and public figures, but even worse, after the USSR repudiated the trade agreement, they all rushed in with immediate offers of credits. It is regrettable that the principles behind the amendment were never completely explained in the United States, and the amendment itself became a political football. I hope that the majority of American Congressmen will remain firm on this question of moral principle in spite of strong pressures exerted on them by person who do not understand the problem as a whole or who are guided by short-term, narrow and selfish interests. To make concessions in response to Soviet pressure would have tragic consequences not only for emigration but for all future relations between socialist and Western countries. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">These words aptly summarise the problem facing the United States in its efforts to bring concerted action against the USSR over its invasion of Afghanistan. As I said in this House last week, the West must join with America in demonstrating to the Soviet Union that such action is intolerable. Experience in earlier crises has demonstrated that the attention span of world opinion is limited and that what is initially regarded as outrageous can quite quickly become acceptable, if only in a spirit of resignation. We cannot allow that to happen. If Russia is allowed to sit tight and see the storm of protest blow itself out, the resultant lesson it learned would be disastrous to us all. The free world&#39;s action against Russia&#39;s invasion of Afghanistan and steps to ensure that the USSR does not continue on its expansionist path must be led by the United States. This is because the military power of the United States is vital to balancing and checking that of the Soviet Union. But at the same time this leadership must be sustained by the willing support of its allies and by a willing joint effort. </para>
        <para>Opposition members have continually attacked these measures. Given the significant destabilising effect of Russia&#39;s actions in Afghanistan, I would have hoped that they would not have attempted to make cheap political capital by opposing them for opposition&#39;s sake. I would only hope that the concern of members of the Opposition for human rights in the Soviet Union and presumably in other countries such as Afghanistan would now result in their supporting fully the Government&#39;s actions on the Afghanistan crisis. I must say, following the exhibition of the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> in tonight&#39;s debate when he, joined by other members of his party, attempted on successive occasions to prevent me from making a speech on what is a fundamental question to us all, it is the right of people in the Soviet Union to speak up clearly. It is a complete demonstration of the attitude of honourable members opposite that they should adopt this attitude tonight. </para>

            <para>-I support the motion. I was a member of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which aimed in its report on human rights in the Soviet Union to present an objective and factual body of material. Throughout the world the extent of repression and deprivation remains staggering. Amnesty International warns that serious violations continue in no fewer than 1 1 9 countries. Thousands of political prisoners remain in remote gaols without recourse to legal defence, food, water or health care. Genocide recurs on a scale to rival that practised by Hitler or Stalin. Governments violate human rights because their leaders believe it in their interests to do so, because of real or imagined threats to security, because of love of wealth and power, because of ideological stance, or because of personal idiosyncracy </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The importance of respect for human rights ought to be a contributing factor to good relations between states. In other words, it ought to be a contributing factor towards detente, which is what the Helsinki declaration is all about. It is a new principle which has been recorded for the first time and which is what gives the dissidents&#39; activity its legality. Like all important Soviet actions the recent and carefully worked out exchange of political prisoners for Soviet spies convicted by American courts has been combed over for both tactical and long range political implications. It raised the question of whether a softening of Moscow&#39;s attitudes should be seen in the release of two Jewish activists, a Ukrainian nationalist, a Baptist pastor and a leader of the watchdog group set up to monitor Soviet compliance with the Helsinki Accords on human rights. This is a key question for the United States Senate ratification debate on the soon-to-be-signed Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty. It will influence the decision now being discussed on the offering of trade concessions, which Congress has denied the Russians because of their failure to let Soviet Jews and others emigrate freely. The trade question becomes more urgent with the warm-up of the United States relations with Russia&#39;s arch rival, China. It had to pay a price but I regret to say it was a marked down price. Six months of negotiating went by while the Americans tried and failed to include Orlov and Shcharansky. </para>
          <para>As dissidents see it, the Soviet Union deserves no praise; in fact it should be condemned for its continued repression. American officials point to a dramatic upsurge in the rate of Soviet Jewish emigration, as well as the pardoning of some other Jewish activists. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henry</inline> Jackson does not agree with it, a consensus is developing to interpret these facts as justification for a one-year-at-a-time approval of trade concessions. Jackson insists on an acceptable and formal Soviet statement on emigration before granting concessions. One clear indicator of how little is new inside the closed Soviet system is the degree of Russian compliance with the Helsinki agreement. In 1975 the United States, the Soviet Union and 33 other nations signed an agreement that included a chapter on co-operation in humanitarian and other fields. Aimed at a freer flow of people and ideas, it listed specific areas of human contacts that were to be improved. </para>
          <para>Watchdog groups sprouted up in Moscow, Kiev and other cities. To get the word out they had to rely on smuggled documents and word of mouth reports to Soviet correspondents in Moscow. The result was that the most creative and courageous members were either locked up or pushed or put into exile. The Russians get marks for increasing the flow of restricted immigration of Jews in compliance with the Helsinki Accord on the unification of families. I do not deny that. But in violation of the Accord, religious freedom for the Soviet citizen remains circumscribed. Nothing has changed. Georgia Vins went to gaol because he wanted to be a pastor in his Baptist congregation. Ginzburg was fighting to be free in his own country, not in somebody elses. The number of apostates grows. </para>
          <para>Recently such leading artists as the cellist Rostropovich, opera star Vishnevskaya conductors Kondrashin and Barshai, pianists Ashkenazy and Novitskaya and ballet star Makarova have defected or emigrated. In the past month there has been a whole spurt of defections from the Soviet Union- Godunov, the Bolshoi soloists Leonid and Valentina Kozloy and sometime ago the former world and Olympic figure skating champions Protopopov and Belousova. How many more would defect if it were not for the common practice of the authorities of keeping a spouse or other close relative at home? Each defection is seen obviously as a political threat. The trial of Havel and five other leading Czech dissidents has drawn a mounting chorus of protests from abroad. The most telling protests came from the French communist party, which is generally restrained if I may say so, in its public statements on affairs in Eastern Europe. It said: </para>

            <para>We cannot accept the trials and prison sentences be substituted for the necessary political and ideological struggle. The acquittal of those on trial is now the only solution in the interests of justice and socialism. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It can be stated that what the Soviets fear most of all is nationalism, for instance in the Ukraine, but particularly the nationalism of the Baltic states of which the Lithuanians comprise the greatest dissent movement. That dissent straddles all classes of Lithuanian society. The Society Government is a vocal champion of anti-imperialism yet, within the Soviet Union, the Government faces growing agitation and unrest among some of the non-Russian people who make up more than half of its population. Its problem is remarkably like that of the former imperial powers. The main difference is that there is no salt water separating Russia from its non-Russian subjects. </para>
          <para>In the longer run, the greatest threat to the cohesion of the Soviet state comes not from the old centres of non-Russian dissent in European Russia but from Soviet central Asia. The problem is that the population of this largely Moslem area is growing fast while that of the European Soviet Union is much slower. The Moslem birth rate is so high that it is estimated that the number of Moslems will double by the end of the century. Russians are on the verge of becoming a minority within the Soviet Union. One economic problem this will cause by the year 2000 is that many Moslems will be leaving their present rural employment in search of jobs in the cities. This will call for more investment in industry in the Moslem republics and could turn them into centres of power that might challenge the central authority in Moscow. We ought to take note of that. </para>
          <para>The Soviet Government is also worried that its vulnerability to nationalist unrest could be exploited by its adversaries abroad, particularly China. Most communists in developing nations claim that a roof over their head is more important than the right of free speech. Let us examine that. In the Third World countries suffering from poverty, widespread illiteracy and a yawning gap in domestic distribution of incomes and wealth, a constitutionally guaranteed freedom of opposition and dissent may not be as significant as freedom from despair, disease or deprivation. The masses might indeed be much happier if they could put more into their mouths than empty words, if they could have a health care centre instead of a Hyde Park corner, if they were assured of gainful employment instead of the right to march on the capitol. Those of us in the west who insist on the observance of human rights as a condition of their help should not lose sight of the fact that these rights neither were discovered in the West nor always assiduously observed here. There probably was greater respect for religious freedom and greater tolerance for ethnic diversity under Cyrus the Achaemenian than exists today in some of the so-called Western democracies. We ought not overlook that. </para>
          <para>Given the present still colonial pattern of world production and exchange, one can argue that the political rights of the people in the Third World would be substantially enhanced if they could be freed from the shackles of poverty, illiteracy and ill health, if their basic human needs could be met by co-operative efforts between the rich north and the poor south. To champion the cause of human rights, is, I confess, an admirable pursuit, but let us not forget that empty heads and empty stomachs may find the due process also frightfully empty. Whilst I personally cannot subscribe to this view, it ought to be given the respect it deserves in any evaluation of this complex question of human rights. </para>
          <para>Regrettably, as I assess the situation, the average Soviet citizen- this has been ably put by the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> and we ought, on both sides of the House, to acknowledge it- has never been abroad. He can only judge conditions in his country by what things used to be like there in the past. He has never seen anything else. The best, if not the only, hope of peace for humanity lies in the gradual evolution, if that is possible, of the Soviet Union into something easier to live with. While vigorously opposing, we ought at least to keep our end up. We should do everything we can to hurry the process of evolution and help to let all the fresh air possible into the Soviet Union. The more contacts and the more exchanges of visits that take place the better. We certainly have nothing to fear from them or from any comparisons which may have been drawn between our two systems. </para>
          <para>The report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence makes several recommendations on what the West can do to secure and improve rights in the Soviet Union. The dominant viewpoint presented to the Committee by witnesses and through submissions is that the more Western publicity the causes of the dissidents receive the better. That is my view. Australia should take the opportunities presented by bilateral discussions or negotiations between the two governments and cultural, academic and scientific exchanges between individuals to express its disapproval of Soviet breaches of human rights commitments. However, Australia&#39;s international position in regard to human rights will be much stronger once the </para>
          <para class="block">Australian Government ratifies the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which it signed in 1 973. We ought to do that as quickly as possible. </para>
          <para>The Soviet Union is not the only offender regarding the violation of human rights. There are other nations where attention needs to be directed. I strongly commend the support of the Parliament to the final recommendations of the Committee, that a Standing Committee of the Australian Parliament on Human Rights be established to report on serious violations in any country, including Australia. I take responsibility for initiating that move. I regret to say that I doubt whether it will get the support of either chamber of this Parliament. </para>
          <para>I want to make one more brief observation in the few minutes I have remaining. There is one thought that has always stuck in the back of my mind. We of this latter generation ought to recall that in nazi Germany a non-Jew had complete freedom to speak publicly, whenever he chose, in support of Hitler&#39;s policy. Let me conclude with a truism. It is an extract from a book by Lord Hailsham entitled <inline font-style="italic">Dilemma of Democracy.</inline> I would not necessarily subscribe to the central thesis of the book. The following extract seems to me to put far more cogently the need for the persistent struggle for human rights. The memorable passage is on page 232. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The only freedom which counts is the freedom to do what some other people think to be wrong. There is no point in demanding freedom to do that which all will applaud. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In my view it is the Orlovs, the Ginzburgs and the Sakharovs, not the Stalins, the Khrushchevs and the Brezhnevs, who make this world a greater place in which to live. As long as we allow this type of thing to go on and as long as honourable members on both sides of the House do not have the courage to set up a standing committee on human rights, we will never have the right to vet that. </para>

              <para>-That is an example of what I was talking about. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, a nation of 250 million people, is a place where there is no freedom of immigration, no freedom of religion, no freedom of information, no freedom of speech and no freedom of political or trade union organisation. This is the type of thing for which certain people who are in Opposition in this Parliament are apologists.

          <para>Firstly, the claim was made by the honourable member that the membership of delegations from this country to the USSR was influenced by the Prime Minister. Two delegations go there from Australia each year. The fact is that there is an open vote by the Government parties as to their membership of those delegations. I cannot answer for what happens on the other side of the House, but the Government, has exerted no influence over the Opposition&#39;s membership of those delegations. The second point which I feel should be made is that at no stage did the Prime Minister say today that all the members of the Australian Labor Party were apologists for the USSR. He made the point that only a number of them were, that there was a thread among them. I think that it is disgraceful how some members of the Opposition tend to twist some of the facts which are brought out in this Parliament.

              <para>- I appreciate what the honourable member for Adelaide said but the honourable member for Reid is a member of long standing in this House. He has used the forms of the House and the Standing Orders to his own advantage on many occasions. He is a member who knows the consequences of calling a quorum when there is, in fact,, a quorum present in the House. As much as I regret that I had to move the motion which I did, I am afraid the honourable member will have to take the consequences provided for in the Standing Orders. </para>

              <para>- I disagree with the count. When I called the quorum fewer than 40 members were present. Due to the delay of making the count a substantial number of honourable members who were outside the precincts of the House moved into the House from the back and both side doors. The delay extended over such a period that one could not give a correct account. I will dissent from the count. On my count, fewer than 40 members were present. I have a fair understanding of the rules. I know that we have to have one-third present to form a quorum and I made my decision accordingly. </para>

At that time the present Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> called a quorum and he was named. At that time the person in the Chair gave the numbers. As to how many were in the House- if I recollect correctly- there was a quorum plus one. That result was given to the House before the action was taken. I think that the honourable member for Reid has a right to have the same thing done for him so that we can make sure that no action has occurred which could mean undermining the dignity of this Parliament. </para>

            <para>-I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> but I express some concern that after four sitting days in this session we have now engaged in four days of Soviet bashing and have yet to debate a single significant piece of legislation. I believe that the conclusions reached in the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled &#39;Human Rights in the Soviet Union&#39; about the extent of violations of civil liberties are substantially correct. Nevertheless, I must say that I do have considerable sympathy for the minority report put in by honourable members, including the honourable member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage)</inline> and the honourable member for Bonython <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Blewett)</inline> in which they expressed some concern as to whether the Parliament was really in a position to concentrate its efforts on one nation exclusively in its criticisms. </para>

The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has proclaimed the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics as public enemy No. 1 and as a result time was found very quickly for the motion of the honourable member for Prospect. Time was found also to consider the report &#39;Human Rights in the Soviet Union &#39;. But no time is found to consider other gross violations.

When did we ever raise the question of the regime of Emperor Bokassa in the Central African Empire- one of the most ghastly regimes in modern history- or President Masie&#39;s regime in Equatorial Guinea, or what has gone on in Ethiopia as a number of honourable members have pointed out? When have we considered them? As we have considered Russia for the last two weeks can we please consider those other regimes next week or is it to be Russia again? If the Parliament accepts recommendation 65 of the Human Rights report, I think we ought to consider very seriously the violations that occur in our region and, indeed some of the violations of human rights that occur in our States. </para>
          <para>It is significant, not to be considered in scale with what has happened in the Soviet Union, but we ought to be very sensitive about human rights in view of the reports of harassment in the northwest of Western Australia where police have been asking people how they voted. That is a very serious thing and it is something that we ought to take seriously. It is not to be considered in the same light as the great purges of the Soviet Union. We ought to remember that where violations of civil liberties are concerned we are by no means guiltless.

              <para>-The honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Innes)</inline> says that he is not well. I think that some of my colleagues will be interested to hear that we have had some nauseating hypocrisy over the question of the treatment of the Soviet Jews. I will advise the House about the treatment by the Australian Government of Jews out of the Soviet Union. The former Minister for Immigration, now the Minister for Health and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, has refused to grant the status of political refugee- which has an important political and juridical significance- to the Jews who have left the Soviet Union under pressure. In other words, the Minister supported the hardline position of his Department and called these unfortunate people &#39;self-exiles&#39; or refugees. It is all right to come into this House for a debate and bag the Soviet Union; we are all prepared to do that. But when it comes to saying, &#39;Let us look at the circumstances of the Jews who have left the </para>

          <para class="block">Soviet Union and let us consider them as prospective migrants to Australia&#39;, do we regard them as refugees or not? The Minister says: &#39;No. We do not regard them as refugees. Perhaps for the purpose of a debate we will but not so far as allowing immigration into Australia &#39;. </para>
          <para>I find that disgraceful. In fact his response has always been to say: &#39;We do not need to regard them as refugees because they can always go to Israel.&#39; What an extraordinary concept of a refugee! One determines a refugee not by where he comes from but by looking at where he is going. In the context of this debate I cannot imagine a more nauseating piece of hypocrisy. The House ought to be aware of this. </para>

              <para>-It is absolutely true. The House will listen spellbound to the oratory, the eloquence and intelligence of the honourable member for La Trobe who will, no doubt, set us right. The tragedy of the Soviet Union and the suppression of civil liberties is an old story which has been going on even since before the time of Lenin. Back in the Czars&#39; time we had the Okrana with tremendous persecution and thousands of people held in detention for their political beliefs. Right from the time of Lenin there has been a constant regime of pressure. At first that pressure was expressed by execution. Later it was by imprisonment and then exile. The penalties imposed now are not as stringent as they were a generation before but they are still to be deplored. </para>

          <para>It is worth noting that when Lenin died in 1924 there were nine surviving members of the original Politburo. Of those members of the Politburo, the people who actually brought about the Russian revolution, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bubnov Krestinsky and Rykov were executed. Sokolnikov died in gaol. Tomsky committed suicide. Trotsky was murdered. In fact, I have stood behind his desk in the study at Coyoacan in Mexico City where he was assassinated in 1 940. </para>

              <para>-That is quite correct. Only Stalin died naturally. The old Bolsheviks, Lenin&#39;s closest associates, were especially vulnerable. Stalin wanted no anti-popes to challenge Bolshevik orthodoxy. When Lenin&#39;s widow, Krupskaya, chided Stalin for his purges he is said to have made the chilling reply: &#39;Be silent or I can easily find somebody else to be Lenin&#39;s widow. &#39; In the period of the great purges of the 1 930s it has been estimated that the camps in Russia could accommodate as many as 8,400,000 persons. It has been estimated by admittedly a very strongly anti-Soviet source, but one fairly careful with his resource material I think- Robert Conquest in his book <inline font-style="italic">The Great Terror-</inline> that between 1934 and 1941 a total of 12 million to 14 million prisoners is suggested, with perhaps a million executions and two million dying of starvation or exposure. Millions were deported from Poland and the Baltic States from 1939 to 1941 and from re-occupied territories from 1944 to 1946. Conquest argues that between 1936, the beginning of the yezhovschina&#39; as it was called after Stalin&#39;s agent Nikolai Yezhov, and 1952, the last full year of Stalin&#39;s life, the death toll may have reached 12 million. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Andrei</inline> Sakharov estimates that the figure is &#39;at least ten to fifteen million people&#39;, and this does not include the three to four million killed in the collectivisation of agriculture. </para>

          <para>The Soviet Union has been a kind of political pressure cooker with a tremendous imposition of State power. But we also have the situation where the people administering that State power are conscious that once they start to lift the pressure it is literally like opening a pressure cooker when the pressure is still there. What one gets is an explosion, the consequences of which one cannot really foresee. That is one of the reasons why, if the Soviets have lightened the pressure it has been very, very moderately. That moderation has really been spread. Any change has been spread over a matter of very many years. </para>
          <para>There is black humour in the story of the three men who met in the Soviet concentration camp in the 1930s. They asked each other why they were there. The first one said: &#39;I was against Radek.&#39; The second one said: &#39;I was for Radek. The third one said: &#39;I am Radek.&#39; The Soviet Union is really an intensely conservative society. It is a highly bureaucratised society. It is a highly traditional society in many ways. It is not in any sense, I believe, a Marxist society. It is certainly a Leninist society but it is not a society that Marx would have recognised in terms of what he was writing about in the 1 9th century. Marx, not long before his death, when he saw the factions that were developing in the communist parties, was careful to explain: &#39;But I am not a Marxist myself. &#39; That is an absolutely authentic remark. The Soviet Union is not really a Marxist society; it is a highly conservative, highly bureaucratic society. In many ways it is one of the most unattractive technologically advanced societies in the world. There was a poem by Yevgenyi Yevtushenko which has a subtlety that will escape many members of the Government party but which illustrates the pressures of conformity in the Soviet Union: </para>

              <para>- I join with other members of this House in deploring the inhuman treatment which Andrei Sakharov has received at the hands of the Soviet regime. I think that the whole world is reacting as it has not reacted in other times to the scientists and authors who have been persecuted in that country for expressing their rights and what one might call human liberties. I believe that the record clearly shows that a country which can perform in this way is not an ideal country in which to hold the Olympics.

          <para class="block">There is a Labor man clearly describing what he thinks of the Soviet Government. He believes that its actions are quite inhuman and are not in accordance with what is internationally acceptable. The motion that has been moved and the words that have been expressed today by members of the Opposition clearly show their confused state of mind in relation to the Soviet Union. On the one hand, they want to take this opportunity, and I do not discredit them for it, to highlight what is being done to a highly respectable and internationally regarded scientist. On the other hand, they seem to underestimate what is happening to hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, and indeed in other countries. Of course, Afghanistan has become the keynote of international debate today because it is causing a critical situation which might inflame a world conflict and jeopardise world peace. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in particular has been very forthcoming in expressing his views as to the seriousness of the situation, doing everything possible to try to get an internationally organised commitment to make the Soviet Union register just how seriously its actions are viewed. </para>
          <para>I have been prompted to enter this debate tonight by the reaction in news reports to what happened this afternoon in the Parliament. The reaction to the straightforward political comments by the Prime Minister, who was accused of not telling the truth, of putting this House into absolute turmoil, needs rebuttal. The Prime Minister made a very factual statement, that is, that there is a string of members within the Labor Party who seem to want to find as many excuses as possible for Moscow and for the Soviet&#39;s behaviour in Afghanistan. I believe that the Australian people also are concerned about the vacillating attitude of members of the Labor Party on this question. On the one hand, they profess to be horrified and disgusted. In the next breath, they do whatever they possibly can to undermine the efforts of this Government to have concerted action taken to register an international point of view against the Soviet Union. Because the Prime Minister has the courage to expose the falseness, the weakness, the hypocrisy and the counterfeit attitudes of the Labor Party - </para>

              <para>- When two points of view are being put forward all the time, one must say in trying to analyse them that there is a good deal of humbug. Members of the Opposition are trying to have it both ways. They are betting against it, but they are not doing anything about it. The reason is that they cannot get their act together because there are so many conflicting points of view within the Labor Party. The extreme left wing pro-communist elements seem to want to take a more moderate point of view, which makes it extremely difficult for the Leader of the Oposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> to be able to have a consistent point of view. Today when the Prime Minister made the straightforward statement that some people within the Labor Party were trying to make excuses, trying to understand the Soviet attitude rather than deploring it and taking counter action, what did we get? We got one of the worst performances I have ever seen from an alternative Prime Minister of this country. It was a vile attack upon the Prime Minister, with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr</inline></para>

They all chanted in an orchestrated fashion that it was lies, hoping that if they said it enough their lie would rub off on the Australian community. They will not succeed. As far as I am concerned, today&#39;s attack was a reaction to the public opinion polls which show that the Prime Minister&#39;s standing is as high as it has ever been. This country is recognising a Prime Minister with courage, a Prime Minister who is prepared to get up and express his point of view, to try to do something about Russian expansion around the world and about the brutality and the horror that is going on today in Afghanistan. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member for Banks has taken a point of order about relevance. The fact is that during the course of this debate, to which I have been listening, the broader issues concerned have been resorted to by members on both sides of the House. Because the House suspended the Standing Orders to allow the General Business matter to come forward, because it permitted a cognate debate, and because it has before it the amendment moved by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, the general questions in the minds of all members of Parliament ought not to be prohibited from coming out in the debate. </para>

              <para>- I acknowledge that there have been expressions by all members of the House against the injustice that is being perpetrated on this Russian scientist. However, what has concerned me is the professed concern of the Australian Labor Party about the situation of other human beings who are being affected by the Soviet regime, that is, the people of Afghanistan. I say &#39;professed&#39; because we have heard so many qualified and equivocal points of view. It is not unfair to use the word &#39;duplicity &#39; in this case when referring to so many speakers for the Opposition. The honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> said: &#39;Who would want Pakistan? For that matter, who would want Afghanistan?&#39; That was one of the first reactions we got from the Labor Party. Immediately after that, within a day, we heard the Leader of the Opposition say: &#39;Afghanistan is 15,000 miles away. What does it matter?&#39; It does matter, and that is what we are concerned about. That is why the Prime Minister has been giving a lead and speaking up. But today there was a violent attack upon this man for having the courage and the leadership that the Western world needs so often. We have heard qualified and contradictory statements about trade. Members of the Opposition say on the one hand: &#39;Of course we do not want boycotts on trade; we know that they will not be effective. &#39; Then they spend the rest of the time attacking the Government for not introducing a boycott on trade. What have they done to the Prime Minister? They have got down to personal attacks again. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member for Grayndler is again performing. Members of the Opposition are trying to brand the Prime Minister with having done something dishonourable because he sold wool at auction which might go off somewhere. The fact that wool is branded &#39;Nareen&#39; does not necessarily mean that it is the Prime Minister&#39;s wool. It was not the Prime Minister&#39;s wool. Despite that the Opposition has been prepared, in an unashamed way, to continue the attack. Why? Because the Labor Party has no policies; because it has no consistent point of view. All it wants to do is try to knock the man himself. We have seen so much of that from the Labor Party in the last year. That is why I feel disgusted about the Labor Party. The issue we are debating tonight and the issue of Afghanistan are great international issues. They are issues of great international concern. I would have hoped for a bipartisan approach to this question. </para>

But, so far as I am concerned, all other human beings are important too. The point is: Where do we start to resist this form of aggression that has been undertaken by the Soviet Union? We have tried to marshal international opinion so that some punitive action will be taken to make the people in the Kremlin realise that what they are doing will not be tolerated. We are also trying to get an effective boycott of the Olympic Games by other nations. The Leader of the Opposition has said that an effective boycott would be one of the most significant ways of penalising the Soviet Union. Yet in the next breath, he tries to undermine what the Government is doing to try to make that boycott effective. He tries to discourage athletes and the Australian people from supporting what this Government is doing. </para>

            <para>-No. The honourable member for Shortland, I think, does not follow the procedures that have occurred. The Minister was called and he commenced to speak. The honourable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hurford)</inline> moved that he be no longer heard. The question went to a division. The question was resolved in the negative. The consequence is that the Minister still has the call- until now. He no longer has the call because the time for the debate has expired. </para>

I think it is obvious to members of the House that at about 3.30 p.m. today, when the Prime Minister&#39;s credibility and reputation was under serious and justifiable challenge, not one member of the Government rose in defence of the Prime Minister. Indeed, it took seven hours of hammering of Government members before one would come forward to provide a defence. </para>

              <para>- Might I observe in passing, as it were, that the defence of the  Deputy  Prime Minister was a stumbling one, but, after all, anyone who had to defend the Prime Minister would stagger under the daunting load. He is not a very defensible person. What are the main qualities of the defence of the Prime Minister? One matter that the Opposition has seen fit to express reservations about is the futility of the Government&#39;s proposed Olympic boycott. In describing that as an expression of futility we are on side with the vast majority of Australian citizens. So it seems, quite clearly, that the  Deputy  Prime Minister has set himself on a course which is in conflict with the attitudes of the Australian community. But the thing I want to raise is the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister and, indeed, his folies. </para>

              <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>you will have to provide a lexicon of what words we can use in this House. I would suggest that it would be rather slender at the rate at which we are going. The Prime Minister is being rather inconsistent in the principles he is promulgating in this House. On the one hand he is demanding that Australian athletes should bear an enormous sacrifice in terms of an Olympic boycott. I do not want to go into the details of that matter. On the other hand he is prepared to collect profit from the sale of wool which is going directly to Russia, the country he is excoriating. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The principle I want to put to the Prime Minister and the Government is a simple one. We endorse the searing condemnations of Russia which they expressed. They are justifiable. But if they go further than that and say that the principles they are espousing in terms of boycotts and embargoes should be upheld in the community, then let the Prime Minister give a glowing demonstration of exactly how much commitment he has to that principle. I have a suggestion as to how he can do so. That is simply to provide a relief fund for refugees from Afghanistan with the gross proceeds that he obtains as a consequence <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the sale of wool that ultimately ends up in the hands of the Russians. Let him do that. Let him give an accounting of exactly how much money he earns in gross from the sale of wool to Russia which will indisputably be used in the manufacture of clothing for the Russian people, including members of the Russian Army, some of whom are in Afghanistan. Let him give an accounting of that. Then, let him provide the money, as a fine demonstration of principle, in support of a refugee relief program. If the Prime Minister does that, he will be in a pre-eminent position to demolish any criticism of the inconsistency, bluntly, the dishonesty, of the Government&#39;s principles in this matter. It is unreasonable and unacceptable to penalise youth and yet to make a profit himself. </para>

He will be completely and utterly rejected by the Australian people at the next election. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> had a great deal to inform him about.

          <para>Only last week the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> was not too happy with the Leader of the Opposition at all when he was dismissed from his office as Manager of Opposition Business. We ended up with a further sellout; we ended up with a new Manager of Opposition Business. He has been allowed by the Leader of the Opposition to support him. He has been collared by the left wing in order to come in here and abuse the processes of the Parliament as much as possible. We have a panic-stricken Leader of the Opposition, a man who knows that he is seeing electoral defeat, a man who is scared stiff of the possibility of being supplanted even before the next election, and he is seeking the most base form of political popularity with the people behind him. The people behind him who are grinning most of all are the left wingers. We all know that the Labor Party really is two parties, the left wing and the right wing. Whenever one talks to the right wingers of the Labor Party, even members who are sitting there behind him now, one realises that they are scared stiff of the way he is pandering to the Left and being taken over by the Left. In New South Wales, in particular, the right wing members call the left wing members the &#39;corns&#39;. They talk to one straight out about the corns. It is long overdue for us to stop pussy-footing about with this Labor Party over here. It is divided; it is completely split. The corns comprise the left wing and that is what they call themselves. The right wing simply does not know how to handle them. </para>
          <para>Today the Leader of the Opposition came in here, with invective and with spleen, and made a speech that disgraced this House. This has been the blackest day in this Parliament in the time that I have been here. I am sure it is the blackest day for many years. All he could do was come in here and utter abuse. He screamed and raved and lost control until his face was as red as his politics. He is going to find that the Australian people will not have a bar of it. He is the man who is leading the most divided party in Australia&#39;s history. The Labor Party is about to split. He is so desperate that he has to take advantage of every conceivable means. He knows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> is even jockeying for the seat of the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> or for one of the Newcastle seats. </para>
          <para class="block">Everybody in both the Prospect area of Sydney and Newcastle is waiting for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> to decide which seat he wants. Hawke and Wran are after the Leader of the Opposition. The knives are out. I would not be surprised if they axed him before the election, because the Labor Party will have no hope of winning with that type of person as Leader of the Opposition. </para>

              <para>- Even money it is. I will be prepared to set the honourable member for St George for a significant amount of money at that price. I wish to raise another point. I tried to raise it the other day but had insufficient time to do so. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> spoke on an Australian Broadcasting Commission program approximately two weeks ago following his return from overseas.  His  speech may not have been intended to be a party political speech but, in the context of what happened in Australian politics afterwards, it obviously was one. The ABC refused the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> the right of reply. I think that was wrong. In passing I would just mention that when I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norgard,</inline> the  Chairman  of the ABC, defend his action- I think it was on the </para>

          <para class="block">ABC program <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> last Friday week- the only thing I was pleased about, as one who owns a few shares in the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, was that he is now the  Chairman  of the ABC and is no longer with BHP. He sounded like an extremely incompetent person, a peculiar person to be put in charge of anything. He was certainly not able to justify the position which he and the majority of ABC commissioners had apparently taken on that particular issue. I suppose the favourable point is that it was of benefit to BHP that it was able to unload him onto this Government. </para>
          <para>I do not think there is any need for me to defend the Leader of the Opposition against the rantings of the honourable member for St George. The honourable member is known in this House as being a bit of a joke. I think that is putting it at its highest. I have never struck anybody on either side of this chamber who has taken him seriously. I served with him on a committee dealing with defence matters. </para>

In the few minutes available to me I want to explore only one objective fact apart from personalities and to put it in an historical context. On the three occasions since the middle 1 950s that the Soviet Union has invaded another country Leaders of the Opposition have explained the Soviet action in terms of supposed faults of the West. I remind the House that when the Soviet Union went into Hungary <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> defended it. He said the position was contributed to significantly by the British and the French action in terms of Suez. The pattern is very significant for the House. The invasion of Czechoslovakia was defended because of the American presence in South Vietnam. On the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald of8</inline> January 1980, a report by Andrew Kruger states that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> unhappily said that it was as immoral for the Soviet Union to be in Afghanistan as it was for the Australians and the Americans to be in South Vietnam. The constant feature of those three statements of truth is that every one would have been welcomed by the Soviet Ambassador either in London, Washington or Canberra because every one of those Soviet actions has received some justification from the Opposition on account of supposed force by the West.
