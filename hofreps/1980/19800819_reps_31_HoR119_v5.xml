          <para>- I second the motion on behalf of my party and support the remarks of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser). Sir Seretse</inline> Khama was revered in his own country and respected far beyond it. Through the British Empire and later the Commonwealth association, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Seretse</inline> became known to millions around the world.  His  life was colourful and unusual by any standard. The son of a traditional chief, he was banished in a dispute over that chieftancy but finally achieved the leadership of his country through the democratic process. Botswana, and Bechuanaland before it, is not one of the priorities of Australian foreign policy. That, of course, is obvious. It makes it all the more remarkable that so many people in this country should share such admiration for the man who led Botswana through her preparation for independence and into nationhood. </para>

His  promotion of the concept of the Pacific Community is an example of this. In January of this year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> visited Australia. He was welcomed both as a representative of one of the countries most important to us and as a national leader who strove to increase understanding and personal contact between the peoples of different countries.

        <para class="block">Party in this Parliament with the motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> did more than any other Japanese leader of the post-war era to move his country towards a political role in world affairs commensurate with her vast economic strength. He did it not only as Prime Minister but also in a variety of important posts in a political career spanning nearly 30 years.  His  period as Prime Minister was a suitable and deserved pinnacle in that career. But possibly his most important contribution to Japan, and the world, has yet to be grasped fully by many people in the West. He was responsible for the normalisation of relations between Japan and South Korea nearly two decades ago and later with North Korea and China - a remarkable feat in the latter case since he also managed to preserve Japan&#39;s relationship with Taiwan. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline>also played a critically important role in the preservation of Japan&#39;s close and often difficult relationship with the United States of America. Similarly, he was a most significant influence in the development of the AustraliaJapan relationship. He was a good friend of Australia, with a genuine and obvious liking for this country and its people which was demonstrated as recently as his visit at the beginning of this year. I believe he should also have the greatest share of the credit for transforming the outlook of the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan in the 1960s - a change of profound importance to the Japanese people and the world. It was a change from a tradition of power for its own sake to an appreciation of human and social values in the business of government. The full consequences of that transformation have yet to be worked out within Japan, but if the process had been much delayed Japanese politics today might have been far more turbulent, far less stable and far more isolationist. For all these reasons, and indeed more, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ohira</inline> was one of the chief architects of the political miracle that has followed Japan&#39;s far more publicised economic miracle. The entire world can be grateful for his work in that role. </para>

          <para>- It is a particularly sad day that sees us noting the passing of no fewer than five former members of this Parliament. It happens that all five were members of the Australian Labor Party, with service to the Parliament dating back to 1947. That was the year Bill Morrow took his seat as a senator for Tasmania, a seat he was to hold for nine years. Bill had been a railwayman, and for ten years was the State Secretary and industrial advocate of the Australian Railways Union in Tasmania. He was a staunch Labor man of the old school. Indeed, he was born nearly a decade before the turn of the century. As a unionist and as a parliamentarian, Bill was dedicated to the service of his fellow workers. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Ted Peters entered this House in 1949  -  a year not otherwise auspicious for the Labor Party. He represented the Victorian electorate of Burke in three parliaments and then the electorate of Scullin in five more parliaments until his retirement in 1969. Ted had an unusual grounding in the ways of parliaments in that he served as Secretary to the Victorian Parliament&#39;s Works Committee for more than 10 years before his debut in this place. He gave sterling service to this Parliament and to the nation. </para>
        <para>Arthur Greenup became a member of this House in 1953 at a by-election in the electorate of Dalley following the death of former Speaker Sol </para>
        <para class="block">Rosevear. Previously he had been a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and had had a long record of service in local government. He was a tireless worker for the Labor cause and a member of the Party from the age of fourteen, when he began work. </para>
        <para>Len Reynolds and Ron Davies both served more recently and will be remembered by many current members of this House. Both entered the Parliament in 1958 and both served until 1975 - in Len&#39;s case, with one break dictated by the electors of Barton. Len was a quiet but dedicated member of Parliament, and was well liked and respected on all sides. He took a special interest in education matters, reflecting his background as a lecturer in education at Sydney Teachers College. Len had a toughness that belied his gentle character. He was a diligent and effective parliamentarian. Ron Davies was also a teacher before he entered this Parliament, representing the Tasmanian electorate of Braddon. That electorate is one of enormous variety, as its present incumbent no doubt will attest. Ron Davies&#39;s success in seven general elections demonstrates how hard he worked on behalf of his constituents. He represented this Parliament overseas on many occasions and served it well. I knew both men well; they were good personal friends, as they were of many members on both sides of the Parliament. It was a moment of great sadness when I learned of their passing. I offer to the families of all five former members the deep sympathy of the Opposition, and of their former colleagues of the Labor Party and of the Parliament. </para>

As the Prime Minister said, often we tend to forget the tremendous service that has been given by former members. Many members of this chamber would not have known any of these former members. I had the good fortune to be associated with three of them - Ted Peters, Len Reynolds and Ron Davies - and I remember those three well as being vigorous parliamentary debaters who were always prepared to make a contribution to the operations of this Parliament. They were dedicated to their party and were never backward in coming forward with contributions. It is always a sad occasion when former colleagues die, but especially sad when one has known them personally. Therefore, I would like to convey my sympathy and that of my party to the members of their families. </para>

          <para>- I am gratified that we have this opportunity to pay our tribute to former members of this Parliament. I knew three of them very well, as did the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> and had more than an acquaintance with two of them, although I did not know them so well. In particular I pay a tribute to Ted Peters, a member of this Parliament from 1949 to 1969. 1 draw the attention of the House to the great length of experience he had in the very heart of Australian politics. He became a member of the Victorian Executive of the Labor Party in 1927 when he was 30 years of age. He stayed active in politics until 1969 - a span of four decades or more - during some of the most tumultuous and troublous times, and in a way some of the most creative times, for the Australian Labor Party and Australian politics. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Those of us with some knowledge of the political history of the period will recall, for instance, the 1930s and the problems of the Premiers&#39; Plan and the great conflicts that occurred throughout Australia in all political parties and which caused a split in the Labor Party. As has been pointed out, during that period Ted Peters was a public servant as well. He was Secretary to the Public Works Committee of the Victorian Parliament for 10 years. He was also a member of the first board of the Victorian Teachers Tribunal which was set up by the Labor Government in Victoria in 1947. He was a government representative when it began to establish the actual basis for the employment of teachers within the Victorian education system. </para>
        <para>Ted Peters was a part of the old guard of the Victorian Labor Party before 1955. Those of us who took a part in the tumults of that time could only gather more and more respect for Ted Peters as time went on. I recall that at the Victorian special conference in 1955 he was the only one of the old Executive who chose to stay with the Victorian branch of the Labor Party and to stay with the Federal Party. I recall the rancour of that conference. Ted Peters always showed exceptional personal and moral courage and political strength in standing his ground. He was a person who over the years became more radical than he had been in his youth. He was one of the first people in this place to point out the dangers of overseas investment; he was one of the first people to print a booklet about it. I have just been looking at one of his later speeches, of 1968, in which he referred to the matter. I pay tribute to him for the work that he did. </para>
        <para>Len Reynolds was another person for whose parliamentary work, perhaps, there was not enough recognition. I was secretary to the parliamentary party&#39;s education committee at its inception in 1957 or 1958. When Len came here he became an active member of it and for a long period was its deputy chairman and its acting chairman. He was one of the more creative members of that committee during the period in which the Labor Party created the policies which it brought into action in 1972. I think it ought to be placed on record that the community as a whole and this Parliament in particular owe a great debt to him for that. </para>
        <para>Ron Davies was an assiduous, hard-working member of this Parliament and a particularly effective electoral member. He won the seat of Braddon in 1958 when nobody gave him a chance to do so. He held it against the odds even in 1966. He was taken, of course, by the flood in 1975. Len Reynolds and Ron Davies were younger than a good number of present members of the House. In their communities, in the Services and in Parliament they both served the country well. I deeply regret their passing. </para>
        <para>I knew Bill Morrow. He stood his ground against everybody and everything that came or went in the Party or out of it. Arthur Greenup I knew only as an acquaintance in Parliament. I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> and the Government for the opportunity to speak about our former members on an occasion such as this. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I support the condolence motion moved by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and pay tribute to Ron Davies for the dedicated service he gave to my electorate of Braddon in that long period between 1958 and 1975. He gave 17 years of service to this Parliament and to the electorate. Ron was my opponent in two elections - in 1974 and 1975. I came to know his qualities well. I admired him. In fact, we became very good friends. He was respected throughout the electorate as a hardworking and decent person whose main concern was not his own self-interest but the interest of those people he represented. I know that he will be sadly missed by his former colleagues in this House and by his many friends throughout Tasmania. I extend my sympathy to his son Glen, who is now the  Speaker  of the House of Assembly in Tasmania, to his daughter Anne and to other members of his family. </para>

          <para>- I join other members in speaking to the motion of condolence on the deaths of members of my party. I had a soft spot for all of them, but I want to say a few words about Bill Morrow. He lived a long life. He was nearly 90 years of age when he died and was very active up to a year or two before his death. He served in this Parliament for only six years- from 1947 to 1953. He was a controversial character. In the early 1950s he felt the strength of conservatism not only within government ranks but also within the ranks of his party. Bill Morrow was too advanced in his thinking for those days and suffered a great deal for the views he expressed. He was one who really thought that it was in the interests of the Australian people to build friendship with the people and Government of the People&#39;s Republic of China. He was one of their early friends and he made lifelong friendships there. I have no doubt that the present people and Government of China know a lot more about Bill Morrow than the people of Australia. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>He was one of the people who involved themselves in the peace movement and, of course, incurred the odium of the establishment of the day for that. As I said earlier, Bill Morrow was a controversial person but he was a good Australian. I knew him well for over a quarter of a century and I respected him greatly. I know that the years he spent in the Australian Parliament were in Australia&#39;s interest. He continued to serve this country even after he was defeated as a senator. </para>

          <para>- I also take this opportunity to support this condolence motion. I rise as a relatively new member of the House who did not have personal contact with many of the former members who unfortunately passed away during the winter recess. I wish to speak particularly of the loss of the former honourable member for Barton, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Len</inline> Reynolds. Even though Len and I came from different political parties, there was always a firm bond of friendship between us, a bond which I highly respected and which I am sure he also respected. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> has stated, in 1958 Len Reynolds followed the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> in the seat of Barton. I think that the most outstanding thing about Len was his humbleness. He was humble in his style of living and promoted humbleness amongst the people to whom he spoke. Out of that humbleness came a great dedication to the ordinary people of the electorate of Barton. He was also a man who based his actions on firm Christian principles. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In 1975, through ill health; he decided to retire from parliament and lead a humble life with his wife, Sylvia. Sylvia unexpectedly passed away before Len and that made the last two years of Len&#39;s life very sad for him. I know that he missed his wife deeply. As has been said, Len&#39;s contribution to the Parliament was particularly great in the education field. He was a former teacher and I know that his contribution to his party in that field was greatly appreciated. His contribution was greater in the manner in which he served the people of Barton. I know that the people of that electorate will miss Len very much. He is survived by three sons. My deep sympathy goes out to those three sons whom I know personally. They are fine examples of Len. They have certainly benefited from the fine upbringing which they received from Len and his wife. On behalf of the people of Barton I feel that I should express this sympathy. I support the motion. </para>

          <para>- Each of the deceased has made a significant contribution to parliamentary and public affairs. The late Ron Davies of course was very well known for his championing of the timber industry of Tasmania. The late Arthur Greenup was a colourful character and a cheerful man whom I last talked to at the June conference of the Australian Labor Party which was held in Sydney. One matter that distinguished Arthur Greenup was that he was redistributed out of a State seat and came to the Federal Parliament as the honourable member for Dalley, and he then suffered the same fate in that a redistribution eliminated his electorate. Then of course we recall very fondly Ted Peters who will be remembered as a pioneer of the widespread concern that is evident today about excessive overseas investment in Australia. He made many speeches about that very important matter. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Morrow</inline> was in the vanguard of many great freedom fighting efforts, especially in respect of banning atomic bombs. He was a leader of the peace movement and was always seen at the head of the procession in the homburg hat and striped suit which he wore in his days of great fame as a distinguished senator of this country. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Len Reynolds is the man about whom I mainly rose to speak today. He represented a neighbouring electorate of mine. The electorate of Barton was well served by Len Reynolds for 14 years from 1958. He won six elections. I know that our departed friend and colleague, the late Leslie Haylen, affectionately referred to Len Reynolds as &#39;Lennie the bell ringer&#39;. That was indicative of the fact that he was a great educationalist. He went to Sydney University and gained a Diploma of Education and a Bachelor of Arts degree. He went on to work at the Sydney Teachers College as a lecturer. He came here and participated in the great education debates of the late 1950s and 1960s with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies. This was the time when education was being put on the Federal parliamentary map. It was the time when we moved that the Estimates be reduced by &#163;. 1 because of the failure of the Government to do anything significant about education. Len Reynolds was the founder of the Parliamentary Labor Party&#39;s education committee. He distinguished himself in that respect. </para>
        <para>I suppose, as the honourable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bradfield)</inline> has mentioned today, the thing that was most outstanding about Len Reynolds was his humility. Great men have passed through the corridors of power here; but none has earned the warm respect, love and affection of the Parliament and constituents more than Len Reynolds, because he exhibited that quality in such an impressive and outstanding way. He was a very humble man. He devoted much of his effort to making speeches on behalf of and in respect of the welfare of ex-servicemen and pensioners. He actually stood out on the streets Saturday after Saturday with a white apron on, selling the lucky number tickets to raise money for the senior citizen centres in Barton. He did that as the Federal member for Barton. I think all honourable members will agree that that was indeed a very great demonstration in humility. I take this opportunity of saying that at the funeral in St Finbar&#39;s Church at San Souci an enormous crowd paid tribute to him. I believe that this must be of very great solace to his surviving sons, Gary, Brian and Neal, to whom we all convey our sympathy and condolences today. </para>

          <para>- I wish to say a few words about Arthur Greenup, a man whom I never knew as a parliamentarian but whom I knew as a trade union official. I think it is very important that when one talks about Arthur Greenup one remembers that he always began any biography of himself by saying that he was a shop assistant. At the age of 14 Arthur began his working life as a shop assistant and at the age of 78 - at the beginning of this month - he finished his life as an official of the shop assistants union. Arthur had seen many facets of the Labor movement and many facets of public life. He had been an alderman and mayor of Newtown, the member for Newtown-Annandale between 1950 and 1952 in the State Parliament of New South Wales and the Federal member for Dalley between 1953 and 1955. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson)</inline> has just pointed out to the Parliament, Arthur did not retire from politics when he retired from the Parliament in 1955. Indeed, as late as 1980 he was representing his union, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, at the Australian Labor Party conference in June this year. I have seen him over many years, as has the honourable member for Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les McMahon),</inline> at the Labor Party conferences and Labor Council meetings in New South Wales. Arthur never missed a Thursday night meeting of the New South Wales Labor Council and he represented his union at those meetings for about SO years. That is a record that not many people would have in both the industrial and political movements. </para>
        <para>I suppose if there was a way to sum up Arthur Greenup it would be to say that he was a gentleman. In the years that I have been in the Labor movement I have not met a man who was more of a gentleman. He took his enemies and his friends at face value. He served his country, his union and his party particularly well. I am very pleased today to say a few words about Arthur Greenup. He was a man who most of us might aspire to be like. He never said ill about anyone. He took adversity in his stride and he never gave up. To die at 78 years of age while still being very active in politics and in a union, and to give one&#39;s life to the things in which one has believed, is a very fine thing. I am very pleased to say that I knew Arthur Greenup in the years after he had served in Parliament and held public office. Even then, people held him in great respect. It could always be said that he stood up for the things in which he believed. As I said earlier, he could only be classified as a gentleman. </para>

        <para>Such adverse affects include drastic personality changes, alienation and severance from persons&#39; families and normal society, dispossession under undue influence of persons&#39; worldly assets, abandonment of socially useful occupations or career education, mental disorientation, and a common requirement to surrender their labour with little or no pay, working unduly long hours fund-raising for the exclusive benefit of the organisations&#39; leaderships. </para>

Does the Minister recall saying in this House on 20 May that an answer to these questions was being prepared and nothing will be held back&#39;? Having given this House an assurance that nothing would be held back, why did the Minister in his subsequent series of written answers on 22 May omit all reference to a departmental minute dated 13 December 1979 which advised him that News Ltd&#39;s takeover of Ansett Transport Industries &#39;was in clear breach of the ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act&#39;? </para>

            <para>- The simple situation is that nothing that should have been revealed was in any way concealed. I tabled in the House a letter to my Department from the Secretary of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal which made it quite clear that the company concerned had acknowledged the contravention of the Act to the Broadcasting Tribunal. That is in the letter which I tabled in this House at that stage. It is also the case that it was a matter of public note in newspapers at the time that the trading in shares had led to contraventions of the Act which meant, of course, that certain broadcasters had to divest themselves of interests which were in excess of those allowed under the Act. For instance, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 14 December, referring to market activity by both the Murdoch and Fairfax groups, stated: </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>the Leader of the Opposition simply does not know what he is talking about because the same section of the Act applied through all those years. As I said, I referred the matter to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for advice and it advised that between 1967 and 1980 there were 41 cases where apparent contraventions of the Act were remedied by voluntary agreement of the broadcasters concerned. Included among those cases were a number of cases which arose during Labor&#39;s years in power. Moreover, the fact is that in 1973 a Minister of the Labor Government actually renewed a licence while a breach of the Act existed, on condition that the breach be remedied. I feel I need say little more, but for the information of honourable members I table a summary of apparent contraventions of the ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act provided by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </para>

Can the Minister assure the House that details of the Regularisation of Status Program are now being fully explained by officers of his Department to all such residents who are coming forward for interview? Can he advise the House how many illegal immigrants have come forward as a result of the ROSP policy, how many six-monthly temporary entry permits have been issued and, finally, how many applications for permanent residence have been approved and granted since the Minister&#39;s policy statement about the Regularisation of Status Program? </para>

            <para>- The Regularisation of Status Program has been well and truly explained through all ethnic media. Every few weeks I make a recording which is broadcast throughout Australia on all ethnic radio programs. It is translated into 42 or 43 languages. Not only are we getting coverage in the ethnic Press but also we are advertising to explain the program far and wide. The response has been excellent so far. As at 1 5 August, there were 1 3,244 inquiries. Pursuant to those inquiries, 9,324 applications have been given out and over 7,000 of those are currently being processed. In respect of the advice given to persons when they go for interview, they are assured that they will be allowed to stay beyond the period of that temporary permit. It is unfortunate that some people - I am not accusing anyone associated with the Opposition - have still sought to create some mischief and to sow some misapprehension in the minds of persons who can benefit from the program. I expressly not only exempt members of the Opposition from that statement but also I wish to thank members of the Opposition, in particular the Shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, for their cooperation and support in promoting this program. I hope that all members of this House and of this Parliament will encourage anyone who can benefit from the program to come forward and undergo interviews with departmental officers. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, follows upon the answer he has just given. The Minister will recall that in his answer he referred to the renewal of a licence in 1973-74 while a breach existed. Is is a fact that he was referring to the renewal of the licence of MTN Mumimbidgee? If so, are the facts associated with that matter that the two companies involved in that review were the National Mutual insurance company and Henry Jones Ltd? Is it a fact that National Mutual had its limit of prescribed interest and was coincidentally a shareholder in Henry Jones, which bought into MTN? Is it a fact, therefore, that National Mutual indirectly achieved excess prescribed interest? Is it a fact that, under section 92K of the Act, it was recognised that National Mutual was brought into this situation by circumstances beyond its control, that at that time the then existing Australian </para>

          <para class="block">Broadcasting Control Board operated as an advisory body, that the Minister had a discretionary power in this matter, and that in all the circumstances proper procedures and legal obligations were followed? Is it a fact that since 1977 the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has replaced the Board, the distinction between the Board and the Tribunal being that the Tribunal is quasi-judicial, with no discretionary authority available to the Minister? Finally, is it a fact that the circumstances related to the endeavour of News Ltd to acquire more than a prescribed interest were the product of a predetermined course of action, which was undertaken with determination and persistence and was designed to circumvent the effect of the Act? </para>

            <para>- The fact is that in a number of the 41 cases contained in the list - is is not a complete list - from the Broadcasting Tribunal the matter was accidental and in other cases the matter was deliberate. There is no question but that in many cases it was the result of quite deliberate ownership changes by broadcasters. I could seek some more information from the Broadcasting Tribunal in response to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. However, let me again make it clear that, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, in those days the Minister had the power to propose and dispose in the licence area, and in those terms. Today, I as Minister do not have that power. </para>

              <para>- I did not ignore my responsibilities. I sent the matter to the Broadcasting Tribunal, which, according to the Opposition&#39;s <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan,</inline> is the proper body to initiate these things. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 16 August as saying that Labor&#39;s view is that the Tribunal has the responsibility to initiate its own investigations over alleged breaches. She said she was confident that that would happen under the new <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Mr Jones.</inline> The fact is that the examination of those matters is for the Tribunal. In the long run, of course, as I pointed out quite clearly in the information I gave in the last session, if the Tribunal feels it necessary, if a breach is not remedied by agreement, then it can contact me and I can raise the matter with the Attorney-General, who ultimately has the responsibility for any prosecutions. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister for Transport and draw his attention to an article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 16 August 1980 entitled &#39;Government gets tough on air fares&#39;. Can the Minister confirm whether summonses have been issued against Sydney travel agents for alleged breaches of the air navigation regulations? Can he inform the House whether his Department intends to take any further action against travel agents, individuals or airlines involved in the air fare malpractice? </para>

            <para>- I am aware of the article referred to by the honourable member. On 14 August summonses were issued against two travel agencies and three individuals involved in the marketing or selling of overseas travel. I do not wish to comment any further on these cases because undoubtedly the prosecutions will be proceeded with in the normal manner. I made it clear in a statement in this place on 23 April that, in the interests of equity for air travellers and in order to avoid discrimination against those law abiding airlines and travel agencies, illegal discounting of air travel would not be tolerated by this Government. I issue a further warning: My Department is actively investigating other possible breaches of the air navigation regulations. If any further cases come to the notice of those undertaking the investigations, further proceedings will be taken. I make it very clear to this House that those who are engaging in illegal discounting of overseas fares should cease doing so because they are putting themselves and their agencies at risk. </para>

            <para>- I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question and for his very deep interest and concern in this matter. Other members, on the Opposition side, have also expressed an interest. The allegations of safety breaches and health problems at St Marys were brought to my notice, I think first, when a reporter from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> contacted my office. More specific allegations were made on 6 August in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald.</inline> After seeing those specific allegations and noting that they had been backed up with the honourable member&#39;s concern, it became apparent that the matter should be investigated speedily. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On 7 August I appointed a committee of inquiry to look into these matters. The committee of inquiry is a good one. It is comprehensive. It consists of a senior officer of my Department - who is also chairman of the Department&#39;s operational safety committee - two eminent members of the medical profession, the National President of the Federated Ironworkers Association and a representative from the factory. The committee met on 12 August and has already interviewed some present employees and former employees. It has also looked at areas of work in the factory. </para>
          <para>The two doctors - I read in the news reports that they had in one way begun this inquiry by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> - have in fact been interviewed by the committee and have given evidence. I am glad that they have. The committee will probably finish its inquiry in three to four weeks, but I have not set a date for completion. I think it is important that it has complete freedom, under the terms of reference which are very comprehensive, to do everything that has to be done in this matter to ensure that no stone is unturned and that the allegations are proven one way or the other. Once again, I thank the honourable member for his interest in the matter. </para>

            <para>-The honourable gentleman seems to fail to be able to grasp that over a large number of years this particular section, whether under the present Act or under the earlier Act with the old arrangements, has applied. He seems to fail to understand, as the Leader of the Opposition patently fails to understand, that it has been normal practice for the authorities under the older circumstances and under the present ones to give a company in breach time to get back within the law. The Minister has indicated this has happened in forty or more cases. The Minister has drawn attention to the fact that during the Labor years one particular licence was re-issued while a company was in breach. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One might have throught, if one wanted to be pedantic about it - the Opposition is now showing great concern about this provision- that at least the re-issuing of the licence would have been held up on a temporary basis pending the company getting back within the law. But the licence was re-issued. It was re-issued because it was normal practice for a licence to be issued and for companies to be given time to get back within the provisions of the Act. </para>

              <para>-The only misleading of the House has come from the Opposition which has tried to pretend, for patently political purposes, that this one case in which the company concerned made it plain that it would get back within the law is different from the other dozens of cases of breach that have occurred. I would like to read part of a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connolly</inline> of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I think it explains the present philosophy and the previous philosophy in relation to how these affairs have been conducted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connolly</inline> says: </para>

            <para>However, it has been the practice over the years for such contraventions to be corrected either through negotiation with the parties concerned or voluntarily by such parties as soon as they realised the situation in which they were placed. There is no record of any prosecutions having been launched in connection with contraventions which have occurred from time to time. </para>
            <para>It is the opinion of the Tribunal that continuation of the previous attitude to contraventions is desirable where it is clear, as is the case in regard to the News Group purchase of the Ansett shares, that every attempt is being made to remedy the contravention as soon as possible. On the general question of the institution of court proceedings regarding contraventions, the Tribunal believes that the powers and functions conferred upon it by the Act do not impose any responsibility for it to initiate prosecutions in relation to contravention of the ownership and control provisions. However, the Tribunal accepts that where a contravention exists and the offending party refuses to take corrective action, the Tribunal should hold a public inquiry and, if appropriate, direct the divestment of the excess interests. If such a direction were to be ignored, the Tribunal would report the matter to the Minister with a view to the Commonwealth instituting legal proceedings. </para>

          <para class="block">That shows clearly the Tribunal&#39;s understanding of the precedents that have been set over the years. It represents a fair and reasonable way of conducting the business in relation to contraventions of this Act. The Minister has applied those provisions and the Tribunal is seeking to apply those provisions. The only people trying to do something new, something out of order, in relation to this matter are members of the Australian Labor Party. They are doing so for the basic political reasons which have been indicated. They are still pursuing the old vendetta of 1975. </para>

A commercial accounting organisation has been engaged to review the Board&#39;s accounting system and procedures, taking account of the reports of the Auditor-General and the Senate Committee. The work of that organisation is being oversighted by a steering committee under the chairmanship of the  Chairman  of the Australian Wheat Board and comprising representatives of the Departments of Finance and Primary Industry, with observers from the Auditor-General&#39;s Office and the Public Service Board. The consultant&#39;s engagement is scheduled for completion on 8 September. When the report of the consultant has been made to the Australian Wheat Board, the Board will consider it and advise me of the action intended to be taken to deal with the matters raised by the Auditor-General and the Senate Committee. After I have considered the Australian Wheat Board&#39;s advice, I will be in a position to make a full statement to the Parliament on the Board. </para>

Is it a fact that Australia has entered into a contract to supply uranium to Finland and that that uranium will be enriched in the Soviet Union? Is it also a fact that the Soviet installations at which the Australian uranium would be enriched are used for the production of highly enriched uranium for military purposes? What guarantee can the Minister or the Government give that Australia&#39;s uranium will in no way be used to contribute to the production of Soviet nuclear weapons? How does the Government reconcile allowing Australia&#39;s uranium to pass to the Soviet Union with the Prime Minister&#39;s view that the Soviet Union&#39;s actions in Afghanistan represent the greatest threat to world peace since the Second World War? </para>

            <para>- It is true that a contract has been entered into with Finland for the supply of uranium. I believe that it is possible that it will be enriched in the Soviet Union. The concern of the Australian Government is to see that our uranium contracts conform with our international safeguard arrangements and that non-proliferation arrangements are entered into to ensure that the uranium is not used for other than peaceful purposes. If the uranium goes to the Soviet Union it will do so on an all-in all-out basis. I think that it has to be understood that the Soviet Union is a member of the non-proliferation treaty and is a depository state under the treaty. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics also accepts the guidelines of the nuclear supplier groups on the export of nuclear material, equipment or technology. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think it would be of interest to members of this House to know that information provided to me shows that approximately 50 per cent of the enriched uranium used in western Europe in 1980 will have been treated in the Soviet Union  -  50 per cent for West Germany, 50 per cent for Spain, 40 per cent for Italy, 1 00 per cent for Finland and approximately 20 per cent for Belgium and the United Kingdom. It is also of interest to note that nuclear material of Canadian origin which has been contracted for sale to Finland over the past three or four years has also been enriched in the Soviet Union. We believe that, provided it conforms with the international safeguard arrangements and the non-proliferation features are honoured, it is in conformity with our international safeguard obligations. </para>

Does the Government propose to reimburse Trans-Australia Airlines for the massive losses it will incur as a result of the Government&#39;s withholding of approval to obtain the three Airbus aircraft for which TAA has contracted? Why has similar action not been taken in respect of the two F28 jetliners being purchased by East West Airlines from the European Economic Community and the five Boeing 747 aircraft of Qantas Airways Ltd being equipped with EEC engines?

Needless to say, the EEC agricultural protective arrangements, including the sheep meat regime, are so serious that the Government has been forced to consider a range of retaliatory measures. A considerable number of items is under review by the Government. The matter is still under active consideration.

            <para>- There are many remote parts of Australia. The honourable gentleman will know that we have established an air fares committee of inquiry. It will look, in particular, at air fares between Western Australia and the eastern States. It will also look at air fares between Tasmania and the mainland and give us a general report on the structure of air fares, the way the charging mechanisms have operated and the equity of that matter. But it does seem rather strange to offer a particular subsidy to a particular State and at the same time to ignore other areas. I understand that the proponent of that sort of policy was not particularly well received in north Queensland, where the people regard themselves as having to travel long distances, as do the people of the Northern Territory, of the Kimberleys in Western Australia and of Western Australia itself, which is somewhat remote from the eastern States. This leads to a degree of difficulty. </para>

              <para>- Of course, we know a little about Tasmania and we have done a great deal to assist Tasmania. I think this shows the ad hoc manner in which the Australian Labor Party is now going about policy-making. We have not only its $2,000m worth of expenditure over about five areas of government but also more than 100 other promises which would cost money. We have commitments which could not be met in any reasonable way without sending the taxpayers broke. Members of the Labor Party are now going around different parts of the country saying: What would they like here?. What would they like somewhere else?&#39; Various promises are being made, no matter what the cost might be. I think one could judge the Labor Party&#39;s concern for Tasmania and indeed its knowledge of Tasmania by a recent report in one of the more notable Tasmanian journals, the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury.</inline></para>

            <para>-I direct my question to the Prime Minister. I refer the right honourable gentleman to his request to the Governor-General for an early dissolution in 1977 when he used the words that an early dissolution was necessary to end election speculation and the resulting uncertainty. In view of the uncertainty and the speculation surrounding the date for the 1980 election, will the Prime Minister confirm that he has already chosen 25 October as the date for the election for the House of Representatives? Will he confirm or deny that this date was chosen at the request of the Queensland Premier? Finally, is he satisfied that the advice offered to the Governor of Queensland by the Queensland Government in relation to section 12 of the Constitution will be for an election of senators in Queensland on the same date as the election for the House of Representatives and will not be on the same date as the election for the Legislative Assembly of Queensland? </para>

            <para>- The proposal for a plant variety rights scheme first came forward as a result of representations from the seed and plant breeders associations around Australia some years ago, and has been considered over the years by the Australian Agricultural Council. It was decided that legislation ought to be enacted. As a result of the differences of views between the seed industries I told them that they would have to come to a consensus on what form the legislation ought to take before I was prepared to move forward with the proposed legislation. In the event, they have since agreed but the time had passed for the introduction of legislation into the Parliament this session. I informed them then that I would be prepared to introduce the legislation in the autumn session of Parliament next year. </para>

              <para>- I have every confidence that I will be able to. In addition to that, at the Agricultural Council meeting in Brisbane a couple of weeks ago, I gave the State Ministers an opportunity to reconsider their previous advice to the former Minister for Primary Industry that they wanted such legislation. But I also told them that the proposed legislation which would be in the House could lie over the winter recess next year and would be debated during the following Budget session. This means that the legislation will be available for public comment and consideration for some months. I think that is a pretty fair way of dealing with a piece of prospectively contentious legislation about which a lot of wrong things have been said. </para>

I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that these allegations include claims that heroin, which was worth as much as a billion dollars at street value, was smuggled into the country despite the foreknowledge of the Bureau of Customs? Is it also a fact that another claim is that senior Customs officials have instructed their juniors to turn a blind eye to other breaches of Customs regulations, for instance those relating to pornography ? When did the Minister first learn of these allegations? What action has the Minister taken or what action does he propose to take as a result of these allegations? </para>

            <para>- Some representatives of the Customs Officers Association made a number of general allegations of the kind referred to by the honourable member. These allegations were first made about 18 months ago, so I am informed, and certainly were made earlier this year as well, about the administration of that part of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs known as the Bureau of Customs. Some of the allegations occurred during the industrial disputes in January and February of this year. In August last year, following very similar claims about corruption in the Bureau of Customs, the then New South Wales branch secretary of the COA reported in writing to the Department that he had been misrepresented. The COA representatives had the opportunity of giving evidence about these matters to two royal commissions of which the honourable member will be aware. But from the reports of the commissions there is nothing to suggest that there is any substance in the allegations or claims, as far as I can see. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>No details of the alleged corruption have been furnished to the Department in spite of a number of written requests being made to the COA and officials to give particulars in support. I am advised that the present secretary of the COA has declined to respond to requests from the senior officer in New South Wales, the New South Wales Collector of Customs. There has been a lot of contact between those officials and the Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I seek permission to table some correspondence between officials and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Spanswick</inline> of the COA.

In conclusion, I say that the Government is determined to have the Customs section of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs effective. No government, I believe, has done more to endeavour to prevent illicit imports, including drugs. All the information before me indicates that Customs works well and towards longstanding objectives of successive governments. If anyone really has any information he or she should come forward and advise either Customs or the Federal Police of precise details. </para>

Why is it taking such an unconscionably long period for the Tertiary Education Commission to resolve what is basically a simple matter about this course? Why is it taking so long to recognise the course?

In view of the way the honourable member has presented his question this afternoon, let me say to him and to the House that the matter has not been before me for an inordinate period. The matter was raised with me only recently. I immediately took it up with the Tertiary Education Commission. This chiropractic course was started some years ago and has not been funded by the Commonwealth. The application for Commonwealth funding has been lodged only recently. The matter is being dealt with today by the Advanced Education Council, which is part of the Tertiary Education Commission. I understand that the matter will go to a meeting of the Tertiary Education Commission within the next few weeks. I hope then to be in a position to announce a decision. </para>

            <para>- by leave- In relation to allegations of security breaches in the Office of National Assessments, the Director-General of ONA, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Furlonger,</inline> asked the Director-General of Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, to review security practices in ONA and to report. Subsequently there were further allegations of deliberate security breaches and the Director-General of Security was asked to investigate these also. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Woodward has now reported on these matters and I have examined his findings. The report, as would be expected, deals with a number of matters of high security content and, in accordance with normal practice in the Parliament and elsewhere, I do not propose to make the report public. I shall make it available to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> if he so wishes. However, in view of the public and parliamentary interest the matter has attracted, I think I should indicate now in general terms what have been <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward&#39;s findings. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline>Woodward&#39;s report finds that there is no credible evidence of any ONA document having got into the wrong hands, nor of the improper use of classified information by any ONA officer, nor of any serious breach of security by any ONA officer. And therefore no reason, arising from the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation inquiry, to conclude that ONA is not a basically secure organisation. On the particular question, which attracted much public attention, of a missing security document, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward has reported that his investigation has established beyond reasonable doubt that the missing document was destroyed in ONA by an officer whose duty it was to dispose of unwanted papers and who in this instance had no reason to doubt that he was doing so legitimately. Before that happened, however, there was mishandling of the paper, about which the ASIO report is properly critical. The report nevertheless makes a number of recommendations for improvements in security procedures in ONA, and confirms other security measures already taken by the Director-General of ONA. It observes that its recommendations should not be regarded as implying any culpable weakness in ONA&#39;s former practices. As I have said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward&#39;s report is available to the Leader of the Opposition if he so wishes. </para>
          <para>The Director-General of ONA, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Furlonger,</inline> has reported to me that he has taken, and is taking, action to implement the recommendations made in the ASIO report. It is of course essential that this be done. The Government attaches the highest significance to the work of ONA, and obviously its security is an essential part of its continuing overall effectiveness in contributing to the bases on which Australia&#39;s external policies in the political, strategic and economic fields are formulated. The ASIO report also provides the occasion to express and underline the Government&#39;s concern that there should be strict application of security procedures and practices in all Commonwealth organistions. Steps are being taken, as it is deemed appropriate, to improve such procedures and practices and to ensure that the requirements are strictly observed. </para>
          <para>More recently there have been assertions in the media that in some way the Director-General of Security was pressed to change some of the ASIO findings about ONA practices, and in some way to water down the strength of his conclusions. I am informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, in respect of this report, that it is false in every specific point made and in its implications. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward has written to me stating that he took all the significant decisions about the two parts of the report himself; that at no time did he decide that any of the contents were too damning to be given to me, as alleged - or even consider such a question.  His  only concern was that the report should be absolutely accurate and as fair as his judgment could make it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward rejects utterly the implication that in some way his report was watered down deliberately to meet some accommodation of ONA. May I say that I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward&#39;s assurance absolutely - as I am sure the House does also. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward&#39;s letter to me on this issue also is available to the Leader of the Opposition to peruse. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>not everything has been right in ONA&#39;s procedures. Actions of some officers gave ground for criticism. But things are being put right- have largely been put right - and there is no ground for any public apprehension about the basic security and continued value of ONA. Genuine debate and responsible and balanced criticism in respect of ONA or ASIO, or indeed any areas of Government administration, are to be expected and not shied away from. The criticisms of ONA and ASIO have tended to have the effect of undermining public faith in these two organisations. The Government for its part will continue to support and encourage ONA and ASIO in the proper discharge of their important responsibilities. I urge all others to do likewise. </para>

          <para class="block">So there are no grounds for the development of a conspiracy theory about subversion within the Office of National Assessments. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, a trained judicial analyst, analysed all the evidence before him. He had the resources of trained investigators backing him and he came to that conclusion. That, too, is reassuring. He is candid in acknowledging that there have been defects internally, and they are being remedied. With <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Furlonger</inline> in charge of the organisation one would anticipate that the defects, to the extent that they exist, will be quickly repaired. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Furlonger</inline> has an impressive record as an administrator and as a fair and impartial servant of the public and the Parliament. </para>
          <para>In view of the rather sensational, if not extravagant, statements that have been made in some quarters, I want to put on record the reasons why I feel relieved to discover that ONA has been given what is effectively a clean bill of health in this matter. I have had the benefit of drawing on ONA on several occasions for briefing on important and often sensitive matters relating to international affairs. I have been impressed enormously by the common sense of the officers of ONA and the way in which they have analysed the issues and arrived at what appeared to me to be quite sound, thoroughly sensible conclusions. I have been reassured to find a coincidence of views in the conclusions and understandings reached by ONA and myself. It has been a matter of some unease to find on so many important issues such a great gulf between the Government&#39;s understandings and the conclusions and those of the accredited objective body charged with the duty of making sensible assessments on matters of international affairs. </para>

It must be pleasing to all members of the House to hear the almost universal acclaim that that design has received throughout the Australian community. It is an imaginative design. It fits into the general landscaping of Capital Hill and the Parliamentary Triangle. When completed, it will serve the needs of Australia for as long as Australia survives. The Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House is expected to report shortly to the Parliament on the Construction Authority report. At the appropriate time, when the Joint Standing Committee&#39;s report has been received and examined, the Government will move substantive motions, as foreshadowed by this motion. Honourable members obviously will have an opportunity to debate the matter at that time. In the meantime, they are encouraged to study the report of the Construction Authority, and the report of the Joint Standing Committee when it is available, and to make use of the display that has been mounted and is available, which I am sure most honourable members will have examined. It think it is appropriate to note that the matters are going forward in a way which must give encouragement to all members of the House, and I thank those who are directly responsible for that. </para>

            <para>- by leave - Honourable members will recall that on 17 April 1980 1 undertook to make a statement once all investigations into the operations of Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Limited had been completed. Regrettably, all investigations into this matter have not yet been completed, but I believe it is appropriate for me to advise the House as to the latest position. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As a result of a request by my predecessor in March last year, the accounts and records of ADI, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Australian Dairy Corporation have been examined by the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The purpose of seeking the audit inspection was to assist the Government in its consideration of the future role and operations of ADI. The reports of the Auditor-General revealed certain deficiencies in the financial and managerial control of the company, and questioned the appropriateness of certain past expenditure. I have previously stated that the deficiencies in the financial and managerial control were examined by a committee established by the Australian Dairy Corporation. Action has been taken, or is being taken, to rectify the deficiencies and ensure that the company operates in a normal commercial fashion. </para>
          <para>The only matter now outstanding in respect of the audit of ADI relates to the appropriateness of certain past expenditure by the former chairman of the company. This matter has been the subject of detailed examination by officials. I have received legal advice from the Commonwealth </para>
          <para class="block">Crown Solicitor and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> to the effect that certain matters arising out of this detailed examination should be reported to the police for further investigation. Upon receipt of that advice, and at my request, my Department has reported the matters in question to the Australian Federal Police for detailed investigation. In light of this, it would be improper to consider either tabling the Auditor-General&#39;s reports, or comment further on the matter. As I have said in the past, I will make a statement on all aspects of the audit inspection when all investigations are completed. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I must say, in speaking on behalf of the Opposition on this matter, that the Opposition is disappointed. The Government has now given a statement which indicates that the matter is quite serious, but we are concerned that it has taken so long to do so. In terms of the length of this inquiry, we must say that it is a feeble response, if not a pathetic one, to a serious matter. This should not be a partisan matter. One has only to look at the work of a Senate committee regarding statutory authorities to realise that there is a widespread concern for the proper administration and accounting of statutory authorities. The honourable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fisher)</inline> today asked a question about some complaints from that Senate committee and the Auditor-General regarding the Australian Wheat Board. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This matter has been transformed into a partisan issue because the Government seems very reluctant to expose fully all the facts of a serious but seemingly straightforward misdemeanour. It has become partisan because of the length of time this matter has taken. Really, how much longer do we have to wait for a full and public explanation? Australia&#39;s international reputation is involved, yet this matter has dragged on literally for years. The Opposition and its spokesman on rural matters, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Peter</inline> Walsh, have never regarded this as a witch hunt. Recognition by the Auditor-General of the whole matter shows how legitimate the Opposition has been in pursuing it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Peter</inline> Walsh has been attacked by his political opponents and by the rural media because basically one of the principals in this long-running inquiry is a very popular person. The Opposition regrets the actions of some rural leaders in trying to transform this matter into an attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Peter</inline> Walsh. It is not a matter for sentiment just because personalities are involved. </para>
          <para>I draw the attention of the House to the statement today by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> in which there is reference to the police. Leaked copies of the Auditor-General&#39;s report have been widely published and most of us know what is in it - this is a very leaky Government. The Minister has had the report since May 1980. How much longer does the Minister need before he tables that report from the Auditor-General? We know that Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd was operating what has been described elsewhere as a private slush fund for some directors and their families. These are serious charges. We need these sorts of statements laid to rest. The Opposition believes that the Minister has known basically the facts of this question for over a year. In fact two Ministers have had the information before them. Quite plainly and simply, the Opposition finds it hard to believe that this matter could not have been resolved by now. </para>

              <para>- The Government&#39;s policies and initiatives concerning the Great Barrier Reef are based on the need to conserve this outstanding natural asset for all people, while allowing reasonable multiple uses to continue in a manner which is compatible with reef conservation. Finalisation of the Capricornia zoning plan is significant. It reflects a most intensive research and consultation program and demonstrates the Government&#39;s commitment to the careful planning of environmental protection to ensure that whatever is done is done effectively and efficiently. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Premier of Queensland agreed to establish the Ministerial Council, which comprises two Ministers from each Government. It is a focal point for co-operative effort between the Commonwealth and Queensland in the proper management and protection of the reef. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act specifically states that the Authority can perform any of its functions in cooperation with Queensland. It also provides that the Commonwealth Government may make arrangements with the Queensland Government for the performance of functions by Queensland officers. The establishment of the Ministerial Council to enable both governments to coordinate policy in relation to the reef has reinforced these provisions. The result is that the Commonwealth Government has been able to move rapidly towards the establishment of the marine park. The tabling of the Capricornia zoning plan and our moves towards declaration of a section of the marine park off Cairns provide solid evidence of the soundness of the Government&#39;s approach to the administration of the Act and the progressive establishment of the marine park as provided for by the Act. </para>
          <para>The Authority is required by the Act to invite interested persons to make representations in connection with the development of zoning plans for declared sections of the park. Representations made in relation to the Capricornia zoning plan were submitted to me together with comments from the Authority. The Act also provides for individuals or groups to channel their views to either myself or the Authority through the Great Barrier Reef Consultative Committee. By taking this co-operative approach and deliberately involving the public in the management process, the reef will be protected and conflicts between various activities will be minimised. </para>
          <para>The Capricornia section was chosen as the first section of the marine park as it is the most accessible part of the reef for tourists. Tourist and local use has increased significantly and management is necessary to provide for the protection of the area. Under the plan, the section is divided into six zones which provide a range of uses consistent with the conservation of the reef. There are two general use zones with very few restrictions, one providing for movement of shipping and trawl fishing and the other excluding these activities; two marine national park zones providing unrestricted public access for recreational activities, with certain conditions relating to recreational fishing and collecting; a scientific research zone; and a preservation zone providing areas protected in their natural state undisturbed by man except for approved scientific research purposes. Within certain zones, areas of periodic restricted activity are proposed for management and conservation purposes as described in the zoning plan. </para>
          <para>To ensure the most effective and efficient implementation of the zoning plan, the Commonwealth and Queensland governments are developing a set of management principles and guidelines. The relevant Queensland agencies will have the responsibility for undertaking day-to-day management of the marine park. The aim is to rely as much as possible on education and the cooperation of the public in order to achieve the  objects of the marine park. However, as with any land park, regulations are required to confer functions and powers, and impose duties upon inspectors. Similarly, regulations proposed will provide for the imposition of penalties for infringements. When the regulations come into effect, probably later this year, an explanatory booklet will be made available to promote understanding of both the zoning plan and regulations. </para>
          <para>Considerable progress has also been made on a proposed section of the marine park off Cairns. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has assembled biological, physical and economic information and has evaluated public comment on this section. The Ministerial Council has invited the Marine Park Authority to examine and bring forward to the November meeting of the Council proposals for boundaries for the proposed Cairns section, and the full implication of these boundaries. It is anticipated that this section will be declared before the end of this year. Honourable members may have seen a recent statement claiming that the Marine Park Authority had completed the zoning work on the Cairns section in January. This is simply not true. No zoning plan for the Cairns section, in draft or any other form, has ever been prepared by or for the Authority. The Authority has insufficient information at this time to enable it to prepare a zoning plan. Before a plan can be prepared, the boundaries of the section must be defined, the section declared and public comment obtained on a proposal to prepare a zoning plan. These are the steps required by the Act. They were followed precisely in establishing the Capricornia section and its zoning plan. Experience in the preparation of the zoning plan for the Capricornia section has confirmed the wisdom of the Parliament in making provision for an effective public participation process under the Marine Park Act. </para>
          <para>I have previously expressed concern at statements claiming that the reef was not adequately protected. Some people still continue to call on the Government to proclaim without delay the entire remaining reef region a marine park. The procedure now being followed is precisely what was proposed by the then Labor Government and adopted by Parliament in terms of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. </para>
          <para>The Act specifically states that the Governor-General shall not proclaim an area to be part of the marine park except after consideration by the Executive Council of a Teport by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. To undertake a thorough investigation and to prepare a comprehensive report covering the entire region would take the Authority a considerable period of time  even if its resources were unlimited. A policy of progressive declaration allows each section of the reef to be thoroughly investigated prior to recommending declaration and for the views of persons interested in the Reef to be taken into account. Whilst such consultation takes time, the Government believes it to be an essential part of the preparation for declarations of sections of the marine park and to the development of zoning plans for those sections. </para>
          <para>Zoning of the reef in accordance with the Government&#39;s objectives is not simply a matter of drawing lines on a map and promulgating a few rules. The zoning plan identifies many of the issues which require careful and detailed consideration. The plan comprises six separate zones and two areas of periodic restricted use. These were determined after a comprehensive program of research and investigation. From those studies, boundaries, objectives and use and entry provisions were prepared. The zoning plan deals in detail with recreation, commercial and other fishing, the navigation and operation of vessels, the operation of aircraft, collecting, research, construction of facilities and visitor aids. Proposals for the regulation of various activities will obviously extend to matters such as the discharge of waste, dumping of materials, littering and the like. In developing the plan, the basic aim has been to minimise regulations but, where regulation is necessary, to make it as simple as possible. </para>
          <para>Nevertheless, the zoning plan and regulations will provide a comprehensive basis for effective reef management and conservation in the area. While this process of progressive declaration is proceeding the entire Great Barrier Reef region is safeguarded from damage as a result of the package of policies and measures agreed between the Premier of Queensland and the Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>I have emphasised on several occasions and I repeat that these policies are designed specifically to ensure the protection of the reef from drilling and mining and . to formalise arrangements to ensure that the provisions of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act are fully and efficiently implemented through co-operation between the two governments. The Government has been accused of avoiding questions relating to the reef. The opposite is true. The Government has issued frequent bulletins on its policies and initiatives. The most recent example are publications entitled The Reef, the Commonwealth Government and You&#39; and &#39;The Great Barrier Reef- The Commonwealth Government Role&#39; which I have just released. I commend the pamphlet and booklet for the information of honourable members. </para>
          <para>Implementation of the Government&#39;s policies and initiatives will ensure that the Great Barrier Reef and surrounding region remains a spectacular natural phenomenon to be used by people from Australia and the rest of the world. The reef is an essential feature of the world heritage, an area of wilderness which must be protected at all costs. The zoning plan now before Parliament is evidence of that concern and of the Government&#39;s commitment to the conservation of our environment. </para>

            <para>- by leave- The ministerial statement read by the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Thomson)</inline> is more interesting for what it does not say than for what it says. For the last two years or more I have been trying to get some answers from the Government to the key questions. These are the questions that the people of Australia are asking. They want to know the answers before they make a judgment on the Government&#39;s policy with regard to the Great Barrier Reef. I gave the Minister a number of questions when I challenged him to debate this matter publicly. The first question is: Does the Government intend to permit drilling in the Great Barrier Reef region? I think that is a fairly clear, fairly concise and easily understood question. It is not obscure. I will repeat it: Does the Government intend to permit drilling in the Great Barrier Reef region? It is a question that the Government refuses to answer. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The second question is: If so - that is, if it intends to permit drilling- what new scientific method has it discovered which will ensure that there will never be a blowout in the reef region? The third question is: If it is not aware of any new fail-safe methods of preventing blowouts, how can it give an assurance that &#39;it will permit only drilling that will not damage the reef? The fourth question is: Is the Government aware of the recent blowout at Ixtoc 1 in the Gulf of Mexico which spewed 140 million gallons of light crude oil, of the most toxic type, into the ocean and which affected the fishing, prawning and tourist industries 800 kilometres away on the Texas coast not to mention the damage to the area around Ixtoc 1? </para>
          <para>The fifth question is: What is there to prevent a similar blowout on the Great Barrier Reef or in the Great Barrier Reef region? One has to be very careful with the use of words when one is dealing with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Minister. When one asks one question one is given an answer to another question. They never answer the question that is asked. What is there to prevent a similar blowout on the Great Barrier Reef or in the region which would result in damage being caused to the fishing and tourist industries on the Queensland coast? The sixth question is: What guarantees can the Government give that a blowout will not permanently damage the world&#39;s greatest coral ecosystem? The seventh question is: If the Government does not intend to permit drilling, why does it not say so and why does it not declare the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park? The eighth question is: Why does the Government continue to assert that it does not have the staff to do the zoning of the various sections of the reef when it is common knowledge that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority had completed the preparatory work on the Cairns section in January? It is only the recalcitrance of the Queensland Government that has prevented a declaration of the Cairns section. The ninth question is: Why does the Government not proceed to declare the whole of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park thus preventing oil drilling or mining on the reef, ensure the protection of the reef and proceed with zoning over the next four or five years? Those are the questions that have to be answered. </para>
          <para>It is always very interesting to hear the Minister use words such as &#39;zoning&#39;. But such words are irrelevant to the prime question. I have asked the Minister to answer these questions. I have asked the Prime Minister to answer them. I invited the honourable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dean)</inline> and the Minister, who represents the electorate of Leichhardt which is a key area along the Queensland coast - your electorate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> is also a Barrier Reef seat - to debate this matter with me. I received the following reply to the letter I wrote to the Minister: </para>
		  <quote>
		    <para>Dear Barry,</para>
            <para>Thank you for your letter of 3 July concerning the debate on the Great Barrier Reef. I regret that I am unable to accept your invitation. </para>

        <para class="block">That is a very nice letter from the Minister. It is a very courteous letter as the Minister&#39;s letters always are. But it really does not explain why the Minister is not prepared to meet me out in the public arena. The Minister has said before that he is prepared to debate this matter with me in this place. Unfortunately there is no way of resolving an issue in this place. I can say something and the Minister can say something which is quite wrong or quite different from what I said. However, there is no way in which the people of Queensland or the people of Australia can cross examine either of us. This is not the case when a matter is debated on television or in a public forum. The only question is: Will the Government assure the people of Australia that no oil drilling will be permitted in the Great Barrier Reef region. Any other answer, any other qualification or any equivocation can only be interpreted as meaning that the Government will permit drilling on the reef. That is the only interpretation that can be placed on this - I have used the word &#39;slick&#39;; perhaps I should not use the words &#39;slick and oily&#39; - obscure, glib answer by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Science and the Environment when questioned on drilling in the reef region. </para>
        <para>Let me distinguish between the Great Barrier Reef and the Great Barrier Reef region. The headlines in the newspapers say &#39; &#34;No drilling on the Great Barrier Reef, says the Prime Minister&#39;. That is terrific; everyone relaxes. But, that does not deal with the key question of the region. The reef constitutes only a small fragment of that whole area from the Torres Strait right down to near Fraser Island and the Capricornia section of the coast. It extends about 200 miles from the coast. It takes in all those waters and all that coastline. That is the Great Barrier Reef region. It does not matter very much whether one drills on the reef or near it. In fact, if there were a choice I would rather drill on the reef because at least on some of the islands there is solidity and stability. It is in the waters off the reef that the real damage can be done. If a blow-out occurs at an oil well on the mainland, the oil can be contained. However, these oil blow-outs cannot be contained in water, unless one happens to be King Canute. I do not believe that the Minister is King Canute. That is the difficulty, and that is where the obfuscation arises. The Government talks about the reef, but not about the reef region. </para>
        <para>The Government claims it has control of the region under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act. That is not true. The Government will have the power only when the Act is declared. Queensland has the power, and who would trust Queensland with anything to do with mining? In Queensland they would drill the gold out of their grandmothers&#39; teeth if there were a quid in it. The Government does not have the power. It has the power if it wished to use it, but it has shown no signs of willingness to use it to protect the whole of the region. The Government now has power over the Capricornia section, for which the Minister has just provided the zoning details. We may assume that soon the Government will have power over the Cairns section. Power over these regions is irrelevant in terms of the total protection of the reef. If oil drilling is permitted in any other part of the reef, the same amount of damage can occur. It could be the case that 99 per cent of the reef is declared as a national park and one per cent is undeclared, but if there is drilling in that small area and a blow-out occurs, the whole area will be ruined. The Minister says that that would not happen and that the Government would not draw little circles around the oil rigs and drill only in those areas. </para>
        <para>Why would it not do that? It did it in Kakadu National Park. That was the most cynical exercise of all time. The Government declared one of the great eco-systems in Australia, and the world as a national park and then put little squares around Jabiru, Jabiluka, Nabarlek and Koongarra. It said that those places were not in the park. The Government was able to tell the conservationists that it did not permit mining in national parks. It is unbelievable. That is what can happen in the Great Barrier Reef region. The Government can draw little circles around all the oil wells and say, We are drilling in only a fraction of one per cent of the Great Barrier Reef region&#39;. That is enough. It is like me saying I will cut out one per cent of the Minister, but unfortunately for him it will be his heart. </para>
        <para>It has been said that this Government is following an Act introduced by a Labor government. With all due respect, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> it is a quite different situation. It really is amusing to hear the Government say that the Labor Government did this and that it must follow suit. Since when has anything done by the Labor Party become holy writ for the Liberal-National Country Party Coalition? Usually if it is something we have done members of the Government run around and change it. That used to be the golden rule - &#39;The Labor Government did it so we will do the opposite&#39;. Suddenly, the Government is quoting what we did. There was one difference. When we were in government there was not even a skerrick of a suggestion that we would permit drilling on the reef. There is nothing to stop the Government from changing the Act. The Opposition would support that; the procedures can be changed so that the Park can be declared and the zoning can be done afterwards. In fact, I believe that that can be done now. The Government can make the declaration to protect the reef and then it can go ahead with the procedures afterwards. </para>
        <para>I want to know why the Minister for Science and the Environment is so scared to debate this matter publicly. Is it because he knows that what I have said is correct? He knows that he has a brief that is impossible to defend in public. The stock answer is that there will be no harm to the reef. I know that the Minister is not a bad bloke but he does not have supernatural powers. If drilling is permitted there is a risk, and if there is a risk, this country, to its everlasting shame, will place the greatest coral eco-system in the world at risk and future generations will spit on our graves for having done that. Once it is ruined it cannot be brought back. The Minister&#39;s statement is interesting. It is an academic exercise. I think the people of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority have done a good job, but the real job will be done when this Government declares the whole of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. If this Government does not do it, I promise that one of the first acts of a Labor government, in about 10 weeks time, will be to do just that. </para>

            <para>- It is ironic that Noonkanbah, the Aboriginal-owned pastoral lease which has been the site of so much confrontation this year, should have begun as a Federal Government project to restore a dignified lifestyle to the Yungngora community. Yet, when the lifestyle of these people was directly and savagely threatened, the Federal Government turned a blind eye to its responsibilities. In 1971 this community, then made up of pastoral workers on the white-managed pastoral lease, went on strike because of maltreatment. They were reduced to living in appalling and degrading conditions around Fitzroy Crossing, some 60 miles away. But, in 1976 the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission acquired the pastoral lease for the Yungngora community. The station, which is one million acres in size, was in ruin. The people have successfully restored Noonkanbah station to pastoral viability and have re-established their traditional way of life within a white community. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Sacred sites have a special and particular significance to Aborigines. They believe that sacred sites are those places where the heroic ancestors travelled, forming the world, the people and the whole blueprint for life. These sites are the subject of religious celebrations by which Aboriginal people protect the sites and renew their religion and associations with the land. Wherever Aboriginal people have been able to continue their culture, these sites have been an integral part of it. They form the nuclei of particular Aboriginal people&#39;s association with their land, passed on to them by their ancestors, and are thus central to the Aborigines&#39; very existence. In Western Australia sacred sites should be protected under the State Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 which empowers the Western Australian Museum to investigate, recommend and declare sacred sites. However, the Minister for Cultural Affairs, at present <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grayden,</inline> has the power to override the Museum recommendations. </para>
          <para>In June 1979, after an extensive survey of Noonkanbah, the Museum compiled a report on the sacred sites. It recommended that, amongst others, the areas bounded by No. 1 and No. 2 drill sites chosen by Amax Exploration (Australia) Inc. should be protected. But, Western Australia&#39;s unsavoury and arrogant Minister for Cultural </para>
          <para class="block">Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grayden,</inline> very swiftly used his veto powers and overrode the Museum. Amax gained authority to drill for oil at Noonkanbah in early 1979. In addition, 30 different mining companies and prospectors have pegged out 600 separate exploration tenements on Noonkanbah. It is little wonder that the people are worried for their future on that station. </para>
          <para>Let me briefly run through the appalling events of the last five months. On 2 April the Noonkanbah community forced off the site the water drilling company contracted by Amax. In July the State Government foreshadowed amendments to restrict even further the Aboriginal Heritage Act, although the Minister still has power to override the recommendations of the Museum. On 24 July the Western Australian Government declared the road through the station a public road and excised the drilling site from the pastoral lease. The community had proposed a compromise to the State Government, including a re-mapping of the area by the Museum and the State Government&#39;s acceptance of any recommendations. The Government rejected the community&#39;s proposal and then launched the infamous &#39;operation convoy&#39;. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a letter from the Noonkanbah community, signed by Joe Wunmah, Mick Michael, George Bell and Bob Mululby, to the Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court, which adequately sets out the terms of the proposed compromise agreement. </para>

            <para>- This secretly contrived 53-vehicle convoy was resisted by Aboriginal communities, clergymen and unionists on the way to Noonkanbah. More than 50 people were arrested. Some 32 trucks were used in the convoy, more than 30 police were present, and 20 police wagons were used. The cost to the Western Australian Government for the police and the officers of the State Emergency Service, and for organising the use of Main Roads Department bulldozers, graders and two trucks to clear the road of vehicles in the convoy&#39;s path was $500,000. It should be pointed out that the Commonwealth shares part of that cost through its tax-sharing arrangements with the States. </para>

		  <para>I visited the area on Sunday, 10 August, and I was revolted by the scene at the drilling site. The entire area was surrounded by a fence of cyclone wire topped with razor wire 10 feet high. The perimeter was guarded by large numbers of State police. Here, in Western Australia, was a scene straight from racist South Africa set up by the Western Australian Government and condoned by this Federal Government through its inertia and inadequacy. The most disgraceful expedition any Australian government has ever launched, was the description used by Professor Charles Rowley, the former  Chairman  of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission, which bought Noonkanbah for the Yungngora community in 1976. This disgusting power nexus between the State and </para>
          <para class="block">Federal governments was broken by the announcement of the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions on 12 August that no union labour would be used on the site until an appropriate agreement was reached between the community and the company. The members of the Australian Workers Union, to their everlasting credit, have refused to work this scab rig, and Richter Drilling, the contractor to Amax, has stated that it is not prepared to use non-union labour. </para>
          <para>The Court Government in Western Australia - I say this advisedly - is determined to crush the Noonkanbah community. It is deliberately sacrificing Aboriginal people to its gung ho mining and development policy. Premier Court&#39;s attitude towards Aboriginal people has been clear throughout this whole miserable exercise. He has threatened, insulted and savagely attacked them with the full power of the State police, and has made outrageous media statements. He has said that it will be impossible to approve a pastoral station for another Aboriginal group. He has said that taxpayers will be bitter because public funds have been given to the Aborigines. He has further stated that the Aborigines, Professor Berndt, and other leading anthropologists were lying about the religious nature of Aboriginal relationship to land. He said: &#39;We now find that the true objectives of the people attacking the Government are land rights and royalties&#39;. The Noonkanbah people have denied repeatedly that they want royalties. They want their land. The issue is one of land rights because of the religious nature of land and the implications of sacred sites. </para>
          <para>The Premier has attacked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Chaney).</inline> On 8 August in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> he ridiculed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney&#39;s</inline> pathetic plea for compensation for the Yungngora community.

          <para class="block">He is denying Aborigines their religious feelings. No white Australian would tolerate such callous disregard for their religion or their culture. Even more racist and disgusting have been the responses of Court&#39;s Minister for Cultural Affairs, the abysmal <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grayden.</inline> He has said that cultural freedom and land rights for Aborigines in Western Australia should be kept out of his State like a noxious weed, and that the Noonkanbah sacred sites are not genuine. In one sentence he dismissed completely the whole body of anthropological knowledge and the Museum&#39;s work. Grayden said in the Western Australian Parliament on S August that Aborigines sit around drinking alcohol and playing cards and two-up. He called Aboriginal communities junk-yards. He has hidden in a cowardly way behind his parliamentary privilege to slander Aboriginal people. When the Western Australian Aboriginal Legal Service had the audacity to announce that it would take action on his racist attacks he called for the abolition of the Aboriginal Legal Service across the nation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> has been written off by Aboriginal Australia. He has engaged in hypocrisy, double-speak and duplicity by pathetically attacking Court on the one hand and by complying with the Prime Minister on the other. On 1 1 March - this is the best comment honourable members will have ever heard - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said: </para>

          <para class="block">Yet in July <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> was at Noonkanbah standing over the Aboriginal people. He told them that it was inevitable that drilling would take place and that they should try to make the best of the situation. On 4 August he and his predecessor, the present Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner),</inline> who is sitting opposite, said in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> that a mediating structure should be provided to work out the best solution and to provide for compensation. They showed that they understood the Aboriginal association with the land in that <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> article. They made an emotional but pathetic plea for a reasonable approach to Noonkanbah. They said: Quite simply, the Aborigines believe that if their land is destroyed, then they too are destroyed.&#39; They criticised Court&#39;s insensitivity and lauded the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act which I remind honourable members was introduced in this Parliament by a Labor Government in 1975. They stated that justice for Aborigines, as provided by that Act, could be given only by politicians, not by police, courts or trade unionists, and they called for an accommodation of interests at Noonkanbah. But what attempt was made to create an accommodation of interests? Their own Prime Minister had already rebutted their remarks. On 2 July the Prime Minister told the Aboriginal people at Broome in the Kimberleys that &#39;Australia needed to build up its oil reserves and this could not happen if drilling was stopped or delayed&#39;. The Prime Minister said that oil drilling must proceed at Noonkanbah. </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister said that oil drilling must proceed at Noonkanbah. How much longer will the national government tamely accept, in this servile way, being stood over by this arrogant, dictatorial and awful old man, the Premier of Western Australia? How much more ahuse of Aboriginals will it tolerate from this bigoted State Government? The truth is that, despite all the rhetoric about Aboriginal self determination, this Government has been shown clearly to be repressive and anti-Aboriginal by simple virtue of its refusal to act and to use its Federal powers. Why is Court so insistent on drilling? Does he really expect Amax to find oil? The answer is no. I contacted the General Manager of the Amax operation and was told that the chances of striking hydrocarbons at Noonkanbah are no better than 50 to one. The Western Australian Government knows that popular opinion on land rights is moving the Aborigines way. But, that Government&#39;s view is quite simple: It wants no land rights; no recognition of sacred sites; no recognition of Aboriginal culture; no right to negotiate the right to mine on Aboriginal land. In short, it seeks to crush the Aboriginal&#39;s morale at Noonkanbah, once and for all. </para>

          <para>Quite clearly, unless the Prime Minister withdraws support for Charles Court&#39;s actions and policies, the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> ought clearly to resign. He supports land rights in the States; he understands the Aborigines unique relationship with their land; he knows the significance of the sites; he espouses self-determination for all Aboriginal organisations. With all these fundamental Aboriginal causes, I agree. Labor agrees; the trade unions agree; the majority of the Australian people agree; but the Prime Minister does not agree with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The Prime Minister supports black rights in Africa, but says that drilling must proceed at Noonkanbah. That is another example of his duplicity. </para>

          <para>I have lived through a number of situations where the Commonwealth has had to come into conflict with the States in Aboriginal affairs. Members such as the former member for Fremantle, the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> and the former member for MacKellar, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth-</inline> a very highly respected Minister for Aboriginal Affairs - have had to fight for Aboriginal interests right throughout Australia. It seems to be the lot of any Commonwealth Minister that he must do so. I have admired the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> has fought for Aboriginal interests at Noonkanbah and other places around Australia. </para>
          <para>Let me state clearly the Commonwealth&#39;s position: The Commonwealth has consistently expressed its view to all parties that conflict should be settled by negotiation, not by confrontation. Yet, the call of the Opposition in this matter of public importance is for confrontation. If there is one lesson that has been learned over many years of Aboriginal affairs, it is that confrontation does not succeed. It is easy to advocate development projects proceeding regardless of all other consequences. I know there are people in this community who hold that view. It is also easy to argue for the protection of Aboriginal interests at all costs. I know there are people in this community who argue that point of view. But the real challenge is to allow development of Australia&#39;s natural resources - so essential for the benefit of all Australians - to proceed and, at the same time, to provide properly for accommodation of Aboriginal interests. </para>
          <para>The essence of the article which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and I wrote and which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> was that there needed to be an accommodation of interests. That was precisely the task which the Federal Government set itself with regard to the development of the great uranium deposits in Arnhem Land; an accommodation of interests which beforehand people considered were irreconcilable. These included accommodation of mining interests, accommodation of conservation interests and accommodation of Aboriginal interests. The resolution of those interests in the Northern Territory, I think, will stand the test of time. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has consistently recognised the responsibility of the States for land tenure and granting of mining rights and has accepted that mining cannot be prevented on pastoral leases. As I have said, the Noonkanbah dispute cannot be settled by confrontation; it can be settled only by compromise on both sides. Unless there is a willingness to come to terms with the reality of the need for accommodation there will be nothing but bitter resentment and a deeper widening of the gulf that separates the black and white people of Western Australia. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has a clear direct interest in this matter on three bases: Firstly, on the basis of the 1967 referendum which gave to the Commonwealth power to make laws with  Tegard  to the Aboriginal people; secondly, in the national interest to bring about a reconciliation and a harmony between all the races which populate Australia; and thirdly, a clear international interest to have regard to the way in which the rest of the world looks upon what we do within our own continent. At the heart of this dispute is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and I said, the question of land. Our article states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>At the heart of the Act-- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is, the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act- is the special relationship that Aborigines have with their land. This is at the heart of Noonkanbah. It is what sacred sites are all about. </para>
          <para class="block">Unless and until that is recognised there cannot be a reconciliation of interests. Therefore, I regret that so many people in Western Australia speak of the Noonkanbah people, the Yungngora community of Aboriginal people, as detribalised; in other words, devoid of any traditional interest with respect to the land which makes up the Noonkanbah pastoral lease. That proposition is wrong, and unless that is recognised, as I say the necessary reconciliation, the necessary accommodation, cannot be achieved. </para>
          <para>The dispute centres upon the question of what protection should be accorded not to specific sacred sites but to what have been described as areas of influence surrounding such sites and in particular, whether such areas lying between major sites should be closed to mineral exploration and development. As we know, the Noonkanbah dispute derives from the desire of Amax Exploration (Australia) Inc. to drill in an area of influence rather than on any specific sacred sites, the closest of which is 1.25 kilometres from the drilling rig. The Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act provides for the protection of places including any sacred ritual and or ceremonial site which is of importance or of special significance to persons of Aboriginal descent. </para>

          <para>Again, I would like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> about - in Western Australia as you know, and everyone else knows, and just cross the border, which has been introduced by the Federal Government in Northern Territory we have land rights and haven&#39;t got any ownership we are missing some of these and haven&#39;t got any ownership we are leasing some of these places and our own name and our Aboriginal name or whatever the organisation, so we can really say, this is where we belong to and this is what we want to own. Your policies are quite simple and have recognised the land rights in the Northern Territory and the only difficult land rights situation in Western Australia and the States where Aboriginal people would have, or buy land, or to have business enterprise of any sort of development then is set up rather than just in communities and you know, all sitting together- 300, 400 people sitting in one place just getting social security service, but we want to spread out and set up our own thing and this is the kind of thing, one or two families, three families, wanted to get at, and are looking at on the issue regarding to, in relation to, land rights. So, I think that in some cases we want, we would urge to ask and taken you aside and ask some ways of assistance. </para>
          <para class="block">Prime Minister </para>
          <para class="block">The Commonwealth policy in the Northern Territory has been operating for some time and I think it has worked quite well. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and Ian Viner before him have expressed the policy of the Commonwealth in relation to these matters. We believe in the principle behind the policy, the principle in relation to land rights. But at the same time, it is a matter in which we believe that the States themselves should make a decision in relation to the States, and that of course, is important in relation to Western Australia. There are leases here which are the same as the kind of possession that can be available to other people but part of what your question was about as I understand it, was not just sitting down in a community and receiving social service payments but being able to get up and do things and being responsible for themselves. I think that is an admirable and a proper objective. There are two things I would say about that. </para>
          <para>The Development Commission itself would have a role in assisting aboriginals to do things to establish enterprises on their account, and so, we as a Government, look to it as a significant one of the initiatives, and I hope it is looked at in the same way by the aboriginal people. I think that that is the important thing. I do not know at this point that there is much more that I can say about it because there are some things which do need to be determined within a State and by a State. The policies in relation to those matters need to be determined. If they are not, I think that no matter what the Commonwealth might do, the policy will not work harmoniously and well &#39;to the advantage of aboriginals themselves. So, I would hope over time the policies that have worked in the Northern Territory can become an example . . . (inaud) . . . to the wider sphere in Australia. </para>
          <para class="block">Jimmy Bieundurry  (reading a letter from the Noonkanbah Community handed up by George Bell) &#39;Canberra Government has the power from the 1968 Referendum to make laws and help Aboriginal people. We want them to use this power to stop Charlie Court making the road public and taking the drilling area away from the Noonkanbah lease and also to stop any drilling on sacred land&#39;. The problems I would like to stress on that one is about the Federal Government. In the 1967 Referendum when the Government refused to take to . . . (inaud) overrun it and whatever the development is. That is the State Government has more power and also the Federal Government has more power to overrun us on this because of the 1967 Federal Referendum. I would like to hand that over to you to think about it and take it up in your Parliament time on behalf of the Noonkanbah Community. </para>
          <para class="block">Prime Minister </para>
          <para>Thank you very much. There are just one or two things I would like to say about this problem which I know is a matter which has concerned a number of people. It is not a matter which can be resolved today. But I would like to say one or two things which are I think important - to state the principles which I think guide this particular matter. On the question of sacred sites, as I understand it, I do not know of any difference between the Aboriginal people, the people of Noonkanbah, the Western Australian Government or the Commonwealth Government. There has been an absolute commitment on the part of the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court, that sacred sites will be protected and that of course is the view of the Commonwealth end the view, I am quite certain, that you would want us to adopt. There is also agreement, as I understand it, on the need for proper rules for access so that the community would not be disturbed by other activities, so that the community would be properly protected by it. But I do want to put it to you that Australia is short of oil, that the drilling that is intended to take place at Noonkanbah is drilling for oil, and this is an important national objective, an important objective for all Australians, including of course, the Aboriginal people. Many of you drove long distances to come here today, and a good deal of the oil we have to use comes from overseas. It is important that we try and build up our own reserve and make Australia as a nation more independent, more self sufficient from suppliers overseas. </para>
          <para>That cannot happen if drilling for oil all around Australia is to be stopped or is to be held up. Having in mind that sacred sites are to be protected and must be protected, it is my firm belief that drilling for oil must not be impeded. This is a pastoral lease and it is in conformity with pastoral leases in Western Australia to enable mining or drilling for oil to take place. And therefore I think it ought to be allowed to do so. Having in mind again what I said, sacred sites must also be protected, and there must also be rules that protect a particular community- in this case, the Noonkanbah community rule for access and I know that there is no disagreement between governments on that particular point. </para>
          <para>There has been a good deal of publicity about matters at Noonkanbah and at this point there is only one other thing that I would urge on all the people at Noonkanbah, indeed on any community - whether it is an Aboriginal community or any other. But, especially perhaps in matters of this kind. I think in matters of this kind where there are strong views, and sometimes, sharply held views, it is very important for a community to look to its elders; to look to those in the community with great experience and with wisdom in guarding that community&#39;s affairs. </para>
          <para>I think if that happens in the Noonkanbah community, it will assist in making the resolution of this matter more easy. I know there are matters in which members of the Noonkanbah community feel strongly. But, where there is a need for consultation, discussion and negotiation, I believe that that is something that should occur with the traditional elders and seniors of the Noonkanbah people. I do not think there is very much else that I can add to this problem at the moment, except to remind you that there are national objectives and there are important Aboriginal objectives which are not in dispute. Perhaps the only other thing which I feel I should say is that the problems to which we all seek to address ourselves, one of the reasons why I am here today to listen to you to hear your views, one of the reasons why we have the National Aboriginal Conference, why we have the Development Commission and (it is going to be run by Aboriginals for and on behalf of the Aboriginal people) is because we believe that these matters need to be determined sensibly, having in mind all the interests that must be taken into account in Australia, and that there needs to be consultation, as there has been, there needs to be understanding, as I believe there has been, but there is a need for national objectives also to be pursued. </para>
          <para>Everything that I have said is against the background that it is a firm commitment of the West Australian Government which has obviously the strong support of the Federal Government to see that sacred sites of Aboriginal people are properly defined and properly protected. That is a firm, and total commitment of the Premiers and of the Western Australian Government. Against that commitment, I would have thought it should be possible for the matters which stirred some people in relation to Noonkanbah to be solved and settled without difficulty. But I again would urge that the people of Noonkanbah should listen to their elders in relation to these particular matters, and turn aside from any path of confrontation or something that might lead to difficulty in that way. (general clapping of approval). </para>
          <para class="block">Peter Yu</para>
          <para>I don&#39;t really think your answer on Noonkanbah is satisfactory. If the State Government had kept its word about protecting sacred sites, there would have been a resolution by now. They have completely ignored the views of the Noonkanbah people which are that the elders are the ones who are making the decisions. You are implying that it is somebody else giving advice to the community. You are not recognising the intelligence of the people and the level of intelligence of the elders at Noonkanbah to be able to make their own decisions. What has also happened in another incident at Argyle was that the Western Australian Museum, an official body recognised by the State, carried out a site survey on the C.R.A. mining tenement who were not supposed to work within one kilometre of a particular site. We go there and at that site, find there was a big hole in it. </para>
          <para class="block">Prime Minister</para>
          <para>I am glad to hear you say that the problem is one that involves sacred sites only, because on some of the reports, there had been other issues put as being matters that had been raised in relation to Noonkanbah and to have you confirm that it is a question of the sacred sites, and only a question of the sacred sites, is, I think, a very useful thing. I am also glad to hear you say that it is indeed the elders who are governing this matter for the people of Noonkanbah because, against the commitment that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court has made, that sacred sites will be protected and I do not believe that there is anyone in the whole of Western Australia who would ever say that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles,</inline> if he gives his word on a matter, then that&#39;s it, and that it is kept, and kept absolutely. </para>
          <para>The State Government is totally committed to the preservation of the sites. The Commonwealth Government has total commitment and support of the State Government in that, and Noonkanbah people want the sacred sites protected. Now, against that background, I would believe that it ought to be possible to resolve this particular matter, and I am glad to have you say that there are not other issues which, could or had in fact, been raised in the past in relation to it. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline>had made sure that I was accompanied by various State Ministers for different parts of the visit and I appreciate that. The Acting Premier was with me at Derby. I would just like to mention there that there was, as I believe, a constructive, useful and friendly meeting with a number of people from the aboriginal community who had come from many different places- some of them 700 or 800 kilometres from Derby. Noonkanbah, obviously was raised and I made it plain at that particular meeting that on the Commonwealth&#39;s part, we stood as one with the State, in firmly believing and supporting the State in a State commitment to preserve sacred sites. Also I indicated that the support of the State and its determination in the national interest, that drilling must, at the appropriate time proceed; but went on to say that those at Noonkanbah should listen to their elders and that &#39;it was my firm belief, and it remains my firm belief, that it is a matter that can be resolved by negotiation and consultation. As a result of discussions that I have had with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and which the Acting Premier has also had with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> - those consultations with the elders at Noonkanbah are likely to take place. It is important that matters of principle be preserved; and for the aborigines- the important matter of principle of their sacred sites and the protections of their own community. For Australia and Australia&#39;s national interests the important principle is being able to drill for oil where that is necessary and it is important that that be preserved. But it is important for all of us- aboriginal and for all other Australians that we have a capacity to resolve these matters by consultation and negotiation. I was encouraged and I think the Acting Premier was also encouraged by the tenour and the tone of the meeting and the discussion at Derby that it was capable of being achieved and concluded in that way. And the Commonwealth will certainly co-operate with all its resources in helping to achieve that objective. </para>

            <para>- That principle which the Prime Minister enunciated was precisely the principle which the Commonwealth and the Aboriginals of Arnhem Land had to face with regard to the Ranger project. It was resolved there by long, patient negotiation and consultation, but that consultation and negotiation required one thing to succeed. It required the participation of all parties, and I emphasise that. I shall nominate the parties which must be involved. Firstly, the company concerned must be involved. Here, of course, it is Amax. It must be directly involved in the negotiations. It cannot be involved through an intermediary. It cannot be vicariously involved; it must be directly involved. </para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue>
		  <para>Secondly, the Aboriginal people themselves must be involved on a basis of integrity and trust so that they are met on common ground, not denying to them the intelligence to be concerned about and to look after their own interests, nor denying to them the capacity to make their own judgments, quite apart from those who are described as outsiders, stirrers and the like. I met those kind of people over Ranger, Aurukun and Mornington Island. Thirdly, the state Government must be involved. Fourthly, the Commonwealth must be involved. Only when those four parties get around a table together is there any hope of resolution on the basis that I have suggested. </para>
          <para>Above all, it must be acknowledged by both sides of the House that solutions imposed upon Aboriginal communities are not acceptable to them and can rarely be acceptable to the community as a whole. The Commonwealth does not believe that in situations such as Noonkanbah solutions imposed on the State Government would be lasting. Clearly the most effective solution is one in which, as I have said, all parties are involved and which all parties accept and are prepared to work together towards achieving and one in which the interests of all parties are respected. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> has sought to achieve. He has worked diligently and very hard. In many places he has received a good deal of criticism for his efforts. Much of that criticism was made not to his face but behind his back. </para>
          <para>Again, if there is one thing that we learnt from Aurukun, Mornington Island and Ranger and from introducing land rights into the Northern Territory, it was that where Aboriginal affairs are concerned no side wins from an act of political warfare. Within the Australian Federal political structure we do have States and we do have a Commonwealth. Each has its own responsibilities and its own jurisdiction. Whatever the solution at Noonkanbah, the people of Noonkanbah must live with it because they live in Western Australia and within the social, economic and political life of Western Australia. Therefore a solution must be found which gives them an equal place in the social, political and economic life of that State, one which as I have said and as the Prime Minister has said, protects the Aboriginal interests. </para>

              <para>- I will withdraw it, if you insist. The treachery is in the form not of the action which the Government has taken on this occasion but the fact that it has taken no action when it can take action. There is absolutely no excuse remaining for its not acting in relation to Noonkanbah. The Government knows that the authority exists under the Constitution for it to act. Indeed, it took action under that constitutional authority when it purported to provide self-management for the people at Aurukun and Mornington Island. Even though the law which it passed through this Parliament was in the end ineffective, it was based fairly and squarely on that power. The Senate committee which investigated that Act endorsed the Commonwealth&#39;s authority to move in to acquire land for the interests of the Aboriginal people. Indeed, the treachery is extended because we find in an article of 4 August 1980, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs eloquently-- </para>

              <para>- I am referring to the treachery of the Government. The treachery of the Government has been extended because of the way in which the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs co-authored an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper on 4 August. In that article they eloquently made out a case for a new legal framework to protect the interests of Aborigines in Western Australia. In their article they made a plea for a negotiated settlement which recognised the prior Aboriginal ownership of the land and the central importance of land to Aboriginal spirituality. That is the case which they have made out; that is the case which they say they support. But they will take no action. </para>

          <para class="block">Minister has been for the last two weeks. Confrontation has arrived. The Western Australian Government organised a paramilitary operation involving 57 trucks, supported by 40 policemen. It involved the arrest of 20 people at Noonkanbah. What on earth is that if it is not confrontation? Is that confrontation? That is the confrontation which we said months ago that the Government could avoid. The shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and I awaited the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and told him what was necessary and what action he could take in order to avoid the confrontation that has now taken place at Noonkanbah and every mile from Eneabba to Noonkanbah up the length of Western Australia. That is the confrontation we were trying to avoid. That is the confrontation which this Government, through its inaction, in fact precipitated. What could be confrontationist about this Government simply with the stroke of a pen acquiring the land at Noonkanbah and acquiring the minerals that are in that land? That is not confrontationist. That is simply a responsible exercise of its constitutional power. </para>
          <para>If some dispute develops as a result of this action with the Western Australian Government there are plenty of processes to which it can appeal. The High Court of Australia exists to sort out any dispute which might arise between the State Government and the Federal Government as a result of that action. That is not confrontationist. What it would do overnight with a stroke of pen would be to take this whole issue out of the area of police activities and out of the area of something akin to warfare. That is what it would do. It would remove it from the confrontation which the Western Australian Government has been absolutely determined to pursue over the last few weeks. It is the fact that this Government, this Minister and his colleague in the Senate, have refused to do it which is the crime. That is their guilt. Their failure to act leaves them just as culpable as the Western Australian Government in its horrendous, brutal and authoritarian activities over the last couple of weeks. That was the action of a megalomaniac determined to get his way. Yet this Government, through its inaction, has simply &#39; condoned it. If the Government of Western Australia does get its way it will be this Minister, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> who will have blood on their hands.

The fact is that it is the grinning Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, who was the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the grinning Minister who has put his name to an article which has supported the spirituality of the Aboriginal people who is the one who will have blood on his hands as a result of the activities of the Premier of Western Australia. He has the Premier of Western Australia acting for him. He does not have to take responsibility directly, he thinks. But I say that if the Western Australian Government does get its way this Minister and the Minister in the other place will be just as much participants in a further destruction of one fragile part of Aboriginal society. If he has an ounce of decency in his soul the consequences of that participation will haunt him, will haunt Chaney and will haunt Fraser for the rest of their days. What they are participating in is the further destruction-- </para>

I ask honourable members to imagine what would have happened if, when the convoy arrived, the rig had been assembled. I ask them to imagine what, would have happened if the workers had decided to work that rig. If that had occurred then this very week would be the week when a sacred site - an area essential to the spirituality of the people at Noonkanbah - would have been totally and irrevocably destroyed. Any form of compensation would not have meant anything to those people. That essential sacred area would have been destroyed for all times. What has been delivered to this Minister and what is being delivered to this Government because of the action of the Australian Workers Union in deciding to withdraw their labour, is an opportunity for the Western Australian Government to arrive at a negotiated settlement. </para>

          <para>The Minister says that he has great faith in the possibility of arriving at a negotiated settlement. He draws upon the experience of what happened in the Northern Territory. What he fails to explain is that in the Northern Territory, the Aboriginal people have statutory rights, as small as they may be. Their consent is required before certain things can happen on their land. The Minister knows that that is not the case in Western Australia. Under no circumstances is Aboriginal consent required for anything. A minister in </para>

Their consent is not required before mining leases are given out over their land or areas of interest to them. They have absolutely no rights. What we have been saying is that under those circumstances there can be no sensible negotiations when one of the essential parties to those negotiations is totally powerless. What we simply say to the Minister and what he has failed to answer today as he and his colleague have failed to answer time and time again is: Why will they not act to give the Aboriginal people at Noonkanbah some real negotiating position in any discussions aimed at settling this dispute? That is all that we are asking for. The Aborigines have not opposed mining everywhere on Noonkanbah. They are prepared to approve of it if they are given an opportunity to properly discuss the matter. </para>

              <para>- It is quite clear, as today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will disclose, that the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr West)</inline> in fact quite clearly advocated acquisition of land in Western Australia as a means of solving this conflict. Now he is trying to deny that he said that. The truth of the matter will be shown in the copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> tomorrow. The honourable member for Cunningham and the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dawkins)</inline> have been mounting passions on this matter. They have been advocating acquisition. They have been advocating confrontation in order to solve the problem. I believe that this will not solve the problem at all. A few things have to be made quite clear on this matter. There was talk by the honourable member for Cunningham and by the honourable member for Fremantle that a sacred site is about to be drilled or is being destroyed in Western Australia. It is clear from all the anthropological evidence, from other expert evidence and from evidence from the Aborigines themselves that the sacred sites are not about to be drilled or destroyed. The drilling and other activities in that area are taking place about 1 .25 kilometres from the nearest sacred site. They are approximately 3.5 kilometres from Pea Hill which a lot of people have been saying is the site about to be destroyed. There is no question that a lot of mythology surrounds these sacred sites. It is very interesting to note that the honourable member for Cunningham and the -honourable member for Fremantle are talking clearly of land rights. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In all the negotiations between the Aboriginals of Noonkanbah and the State and Federal governments, the Aboriginal people have been talking of sacred sites. To expand this talk to embrace land rights is completely wrong and is a complete myth. The honourable member for Cunningham has moved his position from the destruction of a sacred site to a land rights claim embracing a much greater area. It is that very point which was made clear by the Prime Minister when he spoke to the Aboriginals in Derby. For the information of the honourable member for Cunningham, I inform him that it was not at Broome! would like to correct that myth held by him. The Aboriginal people of Noonkanbah said in the clearest terms that their concern was for their sacred sites and for the deep effect that those sacred sites would have upon their lives. Only one man who was not a Kimberley Aboriginal - a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Yu</inline> - expanded that concern immediately to embrace a land rights claim. The Prime Minister took him up on it and made that difference very clear at the meeting with the Aboriginals. </para>
          <para>Let us be quite firm on what we are talking about. Are we talking about the protection of sacred sites? Are we talking about drilling in an area which might have some deep religious significance to these people or are we talking about the much broader land rights claim of Aboriginals in Western Australia? There are two distinct areas and both areas must be negotiated. We cannot turn our backs on those areas or walk away from them. We must negotiate with the Aboriginals on them and talk about them. But let us not confuse the separate issues; let us not confuse the drilling of a hole at Noonkanbah with a much broader land rights claim. There are reasons why we should be talking about land rights and sacred sites. In this case, when one mentions Noonkanbah, the Noonkanbah people are concerned that their sacred sites will be destroyed or drilled. </para>
          <para>From time to time the Federal Government has made its position quite clear. Very recently it has reaffirmed its position. The Commonwealth Government has put to the State the view that procedures must be developed to resolve conflicts between mining interests and Aboriginals and has proposed discussions to this end. A conflict situation cannot solve these conflicts. It will only make matters a lot worse. The people who will suffer in a conflict situation are the Aboriginal people of Australia. Members of the Opposition are losing sight of the fact that it is the Aboriginal people who will suffer. The honourable member for Cunningham and the honourable member for Fremantle will not suffer this great damage or personal hurt. They will not suffer from this tremendous traumatic situation confronting the Aboriginals. It will be the Aboriginal people who will suffer. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member for Cunningham says: &#39;Of course they will. Let us have this conflict.&#39; Those are his sentiments. He says: &#39;Let us have a conflict and damage the Aboriginal people&#39;. A conflict will not solve this problem in any way. It is interesting to note that the Australian Labor Party - if it is talking of land rights - had its chance to grant land rights, to acquire land and to carry out all of these actions that it says we should be carrying out at present, when it was in power between 1972 and 1975. The Australian Labor Party failed to do anything. When it had power to acquire the land and to carry out these actions about which it is talking, it failed the Aboriginal people miserably. It will fail the Aboriginal people again and again. </para>

          <para>The Australian Labor Party is talking of conflict. It is promoting a conflict. It has talked about mounting a union picket on the road to Noonkanbah. In the heart land of unionism in Western Australia, the Australian Labor Party was able to get 1 5 miserly union conveners on the road. That was the sort of picket and support that the Australian Labor Party was prepared to give to the Aboriginal people. It disregarded them. It has no deep feelings for the Aboriginals of Australia. It has done nothing for the Aboriginal people and will continue to do nothing. The conflict and the confrontation that have been promoted by the Australian Labor Party will not solve this problem. They will only hurt the Aboriginal people of Australia. I sincerely believe that we must set guidelines and find a place for negotiation so that we will not have this horrible conflict that will destroy the people we are trying to help. </para>
          <para>We have been talking about people&#39;s emotions. The emotions that have been aroused by the honourable member for Fremantle and the honourable member for Cunningham are beyond description. Mention has been made of another confrontation that took place at Noonkanbah. I want to make it quite clear that that confrontation also was arranged and orchestrated to a large extent by outside forces. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Don</inline> McLeod, who is a well known activist and confrontationist, claims that he speaks for every Aboriginal in Western Australia. He claims that in 1941 he was given power to disown any government in Australia and to speak for every Aboriginal. Today there is hardly an Aboriginal alive in Western Australia who recognises the authority of Donald McLeod. The Aboriginal elders of Noonkanbah have expressed very serious and sensible approaches to this problem. They have told me and the Prime Minister-- </para>

              <para>- I have been there. It is a lot more than the honourable member for Batman has done. I have been there and have spoken to the Aboriginal elders on several occasions. They have said to me quite clearly: &#39;We recognise that drilling should take place. We are concerned that our sacred sites must be protected. We think we can find a way to do both these things&#39;. I believe that is the answer. Drilling should proceed. The sacred sites must be protected. The Commonwealth and State governments have given very clear undertakings that the sacred sites will be protected. If we are talking of land rights, then we are talking of another subject and should sit down and talk very seriously of land rights as a separate issue. </para>

            <para>- The National Health Amendment Bill 1980 and the Nursing Homes Assistance Amendment Bill 1980 are two small Bills in the health field. Although they are minor Bills Opposition members are rather thankful that we get any health Bills to debate at all. It is interesting to note that these are the first two Bills introduced by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> in the nine months during which he has been Minister for Health. One could accuse the previous Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> of being hyperactive. He produced a new national health scheme every year. One year he produced three national health schemes. He was often charged with being too active. That is certainly a charge one cannot bring against the present Minister for Health.  His  inactivity suggests, of course, that he is in charge of a functioning and efficient health care system, when instead he presides over one of the most inefficient, one of the least equitable and certainly one of the most confusingly complicated health care systems in the Western world. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Running the foreign affairs of this country no doubt minimises the attention that the Minister for Health can give to health issues. I suppose we should be grateful to the Minister for the little segments of attention that he gives to health, given his visits to France, to West Germany, to Britain, to the United States of America, to Fiji, to Botswana and to Zimbabwe, all in his brief nine month tenure as Minister for Health in this country. It was the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> of this country who promised us in 1975 that he would not give us tourist Ministers. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacKellar</inline> he has given us a part-time locum as Minister for Health. </para>
          <para>The two Bills now under discussion are the National Health Amendment Bill and the Nursing Homes Assistance Amendment Bill. The first objective of these Bills is to broaden the range of information that can be required from proprietors of approved non-government nursing homes. The </para>
          <para class="block">Department of Health can now require the furnishing of audited accounts from approved non-government nursing homes and the keeping of further records over and above those at present required under the National Health Act. The second objective is to introduce penalties for failure to provide the required information. The Bill increases the penalties relating to the provision of other information. Furthermore, penalties for nursing home proprietors deliberately providing false or misleading information have been increased from $200 or imprisonment for six months, to $10,000 or imprisonment for five years. Thirdly, the Bills introduce an alternative power - the power to suspend a nursing home approval as an alternative to the power of revocation. Revocation was a rather drastic and therefore rarely used sanction; and it seems to the Opposition that the power of suspension is a much more realistic option to be used for breaches of the National Health Act in relation to nursing homes. In introducing the power to suspend the approval of a nursing home the Government has rightly protected- the patients concerned. The Commonwealth benefit or the nursing home fund benefit will not be payable during the period of suspension, but the proprietor will be required to deduct those amounts from the fee to be charged. Thus the proprietor, not the patient, will bear the financial penalties of suspension. </para>
          <para>The Nursing Homes Assistance Amendment Bill simply applies the penalties for deliberately providing false or misleading information to the deficit-funded nursing homes, mainly nursing homes run by non-profit, religious and charitable organisations. These organisations are already required to provide an annual budget and other detailed information. Unfortunately, there have been no previous penalty provisions for false and misleading information, and these have now been included in the amending Bill. </para>
          <para>The Australian Labor Party does not oppose these two minor Bills. Indeed, we are gladdened by the sight of Liberals extending control and regulations over what they call private enterprise. We in the Labor Party believe that there is an inherent conflict between the provision of humane services in nursing homes and private profit from nursing homes. Because of this inherent conflict there is a need for tight public monitoring of profit-based nursing homes in this country. Again, the taxpayers subsidise nursing home benefits to the tune of something like $200m a year, and the Government, as guardian of the taxpayers&#39; interests, needs to have effective public controls. Therefore we welcome the legislation that has been introduced. </para>
          <para>However, there are two general comments we would make. Firstly, these measures fiddle at the edge of what is becoming a set of accumulating problems in the nursing home sector. Secondly, there is no sign in the Minister&#39;s speech of any vision of appropriate health care structures for the aged, no overall view of how private nursing homes should be fitted into a total and appropriate infrastructure for the elderly. I want to give four instances of the kinds of problems that are appearing in the nursing home sectors and which I think require immediate attention. </para>
          <para>The first arises from a comment by the Minister for Health in his second reading speech, when he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Benefit levels are reviewed annually and are set at levels in each State which, with the minimum statutory patient contribution, wholly cover the fees being charged for 70 per cent of beds in non-government nursing homes - excluding deficit financed homes- at the time of the review. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course, that 70 per cent cover occurs at only one brief point in the year and is very quickly eroded. I have a recent survey from the National Standing Committee of Nursing Homes. I realise that some qualifications have to be entered about it. It is a partial survey and is not totally comparable. Nevertheless, the figures reveal that, as at mid-1980, in Queensland only 37.7 per cent of beds are now covered, in New South Wales 38.8 per cent, in Victoria 42.3 per cent, in Tasmania 21 per cent, in South Australia 58 per cent, and in Western Australia 53 per cent. That is, the 70 per cent cover of beds is eroded rapidly as a result of increases in costs, which are then approved in the nursing homes. It is misleading of the Minister to proclaim that benefit levels wholly cover the fees being charged for 70 per cent of beds in non-government nursing homes without acknowledging at the same time the significant drift that occurs through the year. </para>
          <para>I recognise that it is not an easy problem to solve. Certainly the Labor Party has no desire to swell the profits of private nursing homes on the ostensible grounds that it is benefiting the patients. If honourable members look at the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> they will regularly find advertisements listing nursing homes as worth while&#39; or &#39;valuable&#39; form of investment. In New South Wales recently a private nursing home of 845 beds was up for sale for $ 11.5m, or some $13,600 per bed. Those bed costs are ultimately to be met through Commonwealth nursing home benefits, Commonwealth funded pensions, Commonwealth subsidies, from health fund contributions, and from the patient moiety. Clearly, many of these nursing homes are highly profitable organisations. Nevertheless, while being aware of the profit issue, the significant annual drift from the 70 per cent of beds fully covered does need governmental attention. Yet the Minister&#39;s speech suggests that he is unaware of this drift. We ask him tonight: What is he going to do about this growing problem of drift in the cover in non-government private profit-making nursing homes in this country? </para>
          <para>The second instance we present is the problem of the very different daily rates of benefit between the States. They vary amazingly, and seem to have been the result simply of accidental and fortuitous events. I look forward to seeing justification of the very big difference in the nursing home benefits paid in the various States. It is certainly one aspect of the problem that needs to be looked at today. The third instance is a need for more governmental action in exercising control over the level of training of staff provided in nursing homes. In Queensland the private hospital and nursing home associations are attempting to introduce a third tier of nursing in nursing homes, beneath the trained nurses and the nursing aides. The aim of this proposal undoubtedly is to reduce labour costs and therefore to increase pro- fitablility. Given this Government&#39;s track record on nurses&#39; education, it will probably welcome this attack on nurses&#39; professionalism and the diminution of nurses&#39; status. </para>
          <para>The fourth instance relates very much to the Labor Party&#39;s philosophy in the matter of nursing homes. We believe that there is a fundamental difference between public and non-profit-making nursing homes and private profit-making nursing homes. One aspect of this difference is that public and non-profit-making nursing homes are likely to give much greater emphasis to rehabilitation. On the other hand, if honourable members look at private profit-making nursing homes they will see that there is a clear financial incentive for them to secure as many extensive care patients as possible because they attract the greater benefit. We as a party favour the development of the public and non-profit-making home wherever that is practicable. I do not believe the same to be true of the present Government, and I want to exemplify the difference and raise the issue in relation to the difference of emphasis on nursing home applications in the mid-Gippsland region, where it is a matter of some controversy. </para>
          <para>In mid-1979 a Commonwealth public servant from the Melbourne office of the Department of Housing and Construction received approval from the Victorian Health Commission and the Commonwealth Department of Social Security to build a nursing home at Wonthaggi. It is not clear how this Melbourne-based civil servant knew of the appropriateness of applying to build in the Wonthaggi area. Certainly, information about distribution of nursing home beds was not publicly available. However, his information was certainly sound because central Gippsland had a general shortage of nursing home beds. This proposal was opposed by the Wonthaggi hospital, which also sought to develop a nursing home. The hospital favoured a community-based nursing home linked to the hospital for paramedical services and day hospital care with an emphasis on rehabilitation and the return home of the patients. That seemed much more appropriate than a profit-making home which would have to charge higher fees to regain its return on capital investment. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth public servant, having lost that battle and acting on information not publicly available, next turned his attention to Traralgon, which was again below the accepted bedpopulation ratio. He received approval for a 30-bed nursing home at Traralgon. At the same time as this decision was made approval was given for a 20-bed hospital-based nursing home in Traralgon and a 50-bed hospital-based nursing home in Moe. But the Victorian Health Commission and the Department refused a nursing home application by the Morwell community hospital. The reason apparently was that there was a sufficient number of beds in the central Gippsland region. But one should note about this decision that none of these beds was in Morwell. The Morwell application was based on the same sound community rehabilitation principles as the one at Wonthaggi. The Morwell people argue that if the application of the particularly well-informed public servant for a private nursing home is rejected, Morwell would be able to have a nursing home provision attached to its hospital. Thus, Traralgon would still have its beds because they are provided for at the hospital there, Moe would have its beds and Morwell would also secure some beds. All of these would be communitybased with patients near to their relatives and all would have a clear rehabilitation emphasis. This is the solution that the Commonwealth Government should be supporting in the towns of central Gippsland. I urge the Minister to follow up this issue which, I believe, is still a matter of considerable controversy in the region. </para>
          <para>Now I turn to the other weakness which we see in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech; that is, there is no sign anywhere in it of the long run goals, the long run vision and the ultimate aim of the Liberal Government in health care for the elderly. In the remainder of my speech I wish to suggest what would be the major long run objectives of the Labor Party in the provision of appropriate health care services for the aged. We see three major goals. Firstly, we would reverse the priorities of the past and increase the public commitment to health care provision for the elderly. Secondly, we would endeavour to create in every community an infrastructure of services and institutions for the elderly so that they might choose the one most appropriate to them socially and medically. Thirdly, and at the same time, we would wish to reduce the emphasis on institutional solutions to the problems of the elderly. </para>
          <para>Let me try to explain each of those proposals. First of all, public provision for the health care needs of the elderly has been much neglected in Australian society. There has been a tendency to leave it to the private sector and to the charitable sector. It is an issue which over the years has tended to be much more neglected than other health care concerns as a problem that could be left to the private sector. That tendency will have to be reversed in the remaining decades of this century. Greater public responsibilities will have to be accepted, not least because of the growth of the numbers of the old in our society for the rest of this century. Indeed, at present great opportunities are being provided because some of the aspects of hospital rationalisation - at another time I will devote more energy and effort to the hospital rationalisation proposals - and of public hospital provision permit and encourage opportunities to adapt and redevelop those facilities in order to serve the health needs of the elderly. So we have an immediate opportunity to move in the direction which I see in the long term as desirable. </para>
          <para>Secondly, we need to create as far as possible - it will take time and effort - a total health care infrastructure for the elderly in every community. Too often the only choice for the old is between living at home, often with inadequate support services, and going into a nursing home. This limited choice is often both socially and medically inappropriate. As a humane society we need to provide a total range of choice for the old. I suggest that some of the main elements- I do not pretend that I can be completely comprehensive- of that range of choice are, firstly, the choice of remaining in the private home but with adequate domiciliary care and backup services; and the backup services are as important as the domiciliary care. I was most impressed with some of the developments in Western Australia where, particularly in the city of Perth, there are very good backup services, for example, help around the house to do odd jobs such as the changing of light globes for old people. </para>
          <para class="block">That is something we might not think about but. of course, old people living at home find it a very risky operation in many cases to change those light globes. We need these home help backup services as well as the immediate domiciliary care provision much more closely tied to health needs. So the first choice is the private home with adequate domiciliary care and backup services. The second choice is independent dwelling units; that is, people remaining in an independent situationbut with some medical support readily available. That can be organised in many different ways. </para>

              <para>- In part. In the next 20 years there will have to be a bigger public commitment in these fields because public resources will have to help to build this infrastructure. The third choice is hostel accommodation, the fourth is daycare centres and the final choice, of course, is nursing homes. I may not have included all the possibilities but we need to create this kind of infrastructure. I am not pretending that there has not been a start to such provision or that particularly some of the church and charitable organisations, with governmental support, have not already begun to make major contributions in this field. We need to begin looking at every community to begin to see whether that kind of range of choice for the old can be provided rather than, as in far too many communities in this country, the choice being often between living in a private home without adequate support services or in a nursing home. Sometimes, of course, there is not even that choice. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Thirdly, while concerning ourselves with making adequate provision in the ways I have suggested, we need at the same time to deinstitutionalise health care provision for the old and, indeed, for most other segments of this society. There is, in fact, a considerable misdirection of public resources by government into health care structures which are often inappropriate emotionally, socially and medically and which at the same time are often more expensive than more appropriate structures. For instance, two years ago there was a very interesting report, published under the aegis of this Government, on relative costs of home care and nursing home and hospital care. I compared the costs of home care provision with the costs of nursing home and hospital care. The costs of home care health services are always much less than the costs of hospital care, as that report quite clearly shows. The costs of home care health services are less than the costs of nursing home care except for patients requiring intensive levels of service. Of course, that does not mean that it is appropriate that all our hospital care should be home care. We must then look at the medical appropriateness of each case. </para>
          <para>The report estimates that something like 25 per cent of patients in nursing homes would in many ways be much better suited by adequate home care and that between 10 per cent and 30 per cent of hospital patients would be much more satisfactorily treated through a home care system. Indeed, if the appropriate home care services were available, a possible saving in the health bill would be of the order of $1 00m. This concerns not just a saving in the health care bill but also the fact that those home care services are probably in many cases more medically, socially and emotionally appropriate, particularly to old people. </para>
          <para>But what we have seen, particularly in the last two years, is in many ways a decline in the home care services provided. If one looks, for instance, at the overall funding of home care services, at least in real terms there have been significant cuts. There has, for instance, been a no-growth policy - I quote a bureaucrat - applied to the home nursing service. This has meant that the number of nurses eligible for the subsidy has effectively been limited. The Meals on Wheels service, which again is a part of the whole home care service operation, is struggling partly, of course, because of this Government&#39;s policies on petrol. All are aware of the importance of the petrol bill to the whole Meals on Wheels operation. </para>
          <para>Personal care subsidies for the frail aged have been cut. The destruction of the Australian Assistance Plan has meant that many worthwhile community projects - and the Minister can find out the details of the AAP projects that were under way - which were aimed at helping the elderly to keep out of institutions have collapsed. </para>
          <para>We need to reverse these policies because they are basically false economies. All of these miniscule cuts - in many cases they were not so much cuts but rather increases were not made to match the inflation rate - are false economies. On the grounds of both health and expenditure savings we need to develop home care services, not cut them back. Of course, the results of these false economies and the health insurance mess are that many of the most vulnerable patients in our society are left confused. One only need talk to the old about the confusions of health insurance and about some of the blatant and appalling publicity that has been directed at them in relation to health insurance. We know that they are left confused, are often out of pocket and often find themselves in institutions which, if they had their choice, they would rather not be in. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, I repeat the long run objects of my party when returned to power at the end of this year in relation to the provision of health care for the aged. Firstly, we will increase the public commitment in this field. We accept the expenses that will be involved in the long run in pursuit of this commitment. Secondly, there will be a comprehensive provision of health care services for the old in the community. Thirdly, we will try to de-institutionalise the health care segment for the old which, of course, will involve not only providing more appropriate health care but also, in the long run, will reduce the cost of that health care. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In doing so, I present the Budget for 1980-81. </para>
          <para>This is the fifth Budget of the Fraser Government. </para>
          <para>It is the first Budget of a new decade - a decade in which all Australians can expect to share the benefits of exceptional growth and national development. </para>
          <para>However, this will only be so if there is continued application of the right economic policies. </para>
          <para>It will only be so if we continue those policies which in five years have brought Australia from a country clearly living beyond its means to where, this year- for the first time for seven years- we can achieve a domestic Budget surplus. </para>
          <para>The dominant feature of those policies has been our relentless effort to control inflation. </para>
          <para>There must be no relaxation of that effort. </para>
          <para>Unless we persist in our fight against inflation, our full economic potential will not be realised. </para>
          <para>Any other course would condemn the Australian economy to second-best status in the years ahead. </para>
          <para>We owe our present strength, international standing and optimism to the persistent application of disciplined anti-inflationary policies. </para>
          <para>Without them, we could not have hoped for the greater economic growth and development which are now in prospect. </para>
          <para>As foreshadowed in last year&#39;s Budget, 1979-80 proved difficult for the world economy. </para>
          <para>That Budget was designed to equip Australia to succeed in a world environment of rising inflation and intensifying competition. </para>
          <para>That objective was achieved. </para>
          <para>Over the year to June 1980, Australia&#39;s inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 10.7 per cent - about three percentage points below the average of OECD countries. </para>
          <para>Last year, exports grew by almost 1 5 per cent in real terms. . </para>
          <para>For the first time since 1972-73 private external transactions produced a substantial surplus. </para>
          <para>Overall, growth was 2.2 per cent reflecting stronger non-farm growth of 3.1 per cent partly offset by some fall in farm product from the very high level of the previous year. </para>
          <para>Whilst business fixed investment declined with the phasing down of the investment allowance, it rose in the second half of the year. </para>
          <para>Business profits increased strongly last year, but there is a need for further improvement to support increased investment and employment. </para>
          <para>Private dwelling investment was strong throughout the year and recorded a real increase of over 10 per cent. </para>
          <para>Although personal consumption expenditure was relatively subdued there was an encouraging lift in the second half of the year. </para>
          <para>Greater non-farm growth was reflected in a strong rise in total employment of 2.4 per cent in 1979-80- the largest since 1973-74. </para>
          <para>Unfortunately this was not enough to reduce unemployment, which in June 1980 was roughly the same as a year earlier. </para>
          <para>Unless there is a moderation in wage demands and fewer industrial disputes it will be difficult to achieve a sustained reduction in unemployment. </para>
          <para>The spread of work value claims and settlements - many on quite spurious grounds - together with other excuses for higher wages, such as the campaign for a 35 hour week, are utterly inconsistent with achieving a lasting reduction in unemployment. </para>
          <para>The resultant growth in average weekly earnings over the course of 1979-80, of almost 12 per cent, is a clear indication that the task of restoring wage and price stability is far from over. </para>
          <para>OIL PRICING AND THE CRUDE OIL LEVY</para>
          <para>One of the most important economic decisions taken by this Government has been the move in 1978 to import parity pricing for our crude oil. </para>
		  <para>The objectives of that decision are being achieved. </para>
		  <para>Reflecting the need to pay market prices for a scarce resource, this policy has greatly strengthened Australia&#39;s capacity to withstand world energy problems. </para>
      <para>Consumption of major petroleum products fell by 1 i per cent last year. </para>
      <para>Energy exploration has accelerated. </para>
      <para>Alternative energy sources have become more economic. </para>
      <para>Projects like Rundle Shale Oil, which might involve the largest resource investment in Australia&#39;s history, could not have been realistically contemplated without our crude oil pricing policy. </para>
      <para>The crude oil levy enables the Government to distribute to the community generally a share of the proceeds of crude oil price rises. </para>
      <para>The levy revenue has been used sensibly and to the benefit of the whole community. </para>
      <para>Without it the deficit would not have been reduced so quickly nor, for example, would the personal income tax cuts which took effect on 1 July last have been possible. </para>
      <para>It is also assisting us to provide additional funds for defence. </para>
	  <para>
        <inline font-style="bold">THE BUDGET OUTCOME</inline>
		</para>
      <para>The Budget outcome for 1979-80 was very close to projections. </para>
      <para>Outlays were virtually the same as budgeted and reflected a slight reduction in real terms. </para>
      <para>Overall receipts were largely as predicted except for the additional crude oil levy revenue which amounted to $204m. </para>
      <para>The additional revenue was used to reduce the Budget deficit further. </para>
      <para>Thus the deficit was ultimately $106m lower than originally estimated and $ 1,444m less than in the previous year - the largest ever reduction in a single year. </para>
      <para>This greatly eased pressures which would otherwise have been reflected in higher interest rates. </para>
	  <para>
        <inline font-style="bold">THE SHAPE OF THE BUDGET</inline>
		</para>
      <para>This year&#39;s Budget again places prime importance on the fight against inflation. </para>
      <para>Lower inflation remains fundamental to greater private sector growth and to international competitiveness. - </para>
      <para>Therefore, there will be a further sizable reduction in the Budget deficit. </para>
      <para>This will be achieved despite the need for a faster rate of increase in outlays this year. </para>
	  <para>
        <inline font-style="bold">OUTLAYS</inline>
		</para>
      <para>In 1980-81 outlays are projected to be $36,037m, an increase of 13.7 per cent on 1979-80. This represents a growth of just under three per cent in real terms in 1980-81 , and an average annual growth of about one per cent in real terms over the five years to 1980-81. </para>
      <para>As a proportion of Gross Domestic Product outlays this year are expected to be 27.9 per cent compared to 30.1 per cent in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>In summary, the Government&#39;s decisions on outlays provide for much greater spending on defence, higher levels of support to areas of particular social need, increased payments to local government, and growing expenditures in areas of assistance to industry. </para>
      <para>At the same time we have observed the continuing need to contain spending within a responsible overall economic package. </para>
      <para>I now turn to the main expenditure provisions of the Budget. </para>
      <para>More details are provided in accompanying Budget documents, particularly Statement No. 3. </para>
        <para>DEFENCE</para>
      <para>This Budget gives a high priority to the strengthening of our national security. </para>
      <para>The $3,541m which we are providing for defence is $533m more than last year. This is an increase of 17.7 per cent in current prices, no less than 7 per cent in real terms. </para>
      <para>The changed strategic circumstances in which Australia now finds herself require a much greater commitment to defence spending. </para>
      <para>This is a priority which the Government believes commands the support of the vast majority of Australians. </para>
      <para>Further large increases in later Budgets will be necessary, up to an expected 3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product for defence spending by 1984-85, to accomplish the improvements to defence capabilities announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year. </para>
        <para>SOCIAL WELFARE</para>
      <para>Total spending on social security and welfare in 1980-81 is estimated to be S9,890m, a rise of 12.4 per cent over 1979-80. </para>
      <para>It will account for over 27 per cent of all Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1980-81. </para>
      <para>The size of present social welfare programs, their momentum and the need to achieve a responsible overall Budget outcome mean that little room exists for new initiatives or increases in those benefits which are not the subject of automatic adjustment. </para>
      <para>The Government has decided that such additional funds as can be made available for social welfare without prejudicing the overall Budget outcome should be directed to those who need assistance most. </para>
	  <para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Indexation of Pensions and Benefits</inline>
		  </para>
        <para>The rates of relevant pensions and benefits will continue to be adjusted each November and May in accordance with the relevant movements in the Consumer Price Index. </para>
        <para>In November, for example, the standard or single rate of social service pensions will rise by $3.05 to $64. 10 a week, and the combined married rate will increase by $5.10 to $106.80 a week. </para>
        <para class="italic">
          <inline font-style="italic">Children with Special Needs</inline>
        </para>
        <para>The Budget increases rates of assistance for children in situations of special need from the first relevant payday in November. </para>
        <para>The handicapped child&#39;s allowance will be increased by $8 to $73 a month, providing improved assistance in respect of an average of 26,000 handicapped children in 1980-81. The double orphan&#39;s pension will also be increased by $8, bringing it to $55.70 a month. This will provide additional assistance to families caring for orphans. </para>
        <para>Additional pension or benefit payable to eligible persons with dependent children will be increased by $2.50 to $10 a week for each child; on average 560,000 children are involved. Single pensioners with children and supporting parent beneficiaries will receive further increases in rates of assistance- the mother&#39;s/guardian&#39;s allowance will be increased by $2 a week. The new rate will be $8 a week where one child is aged under 6 or invalid and $6 a week in other cases. On average, 190,000 single parent families will benefit. </para>
        <para>The cost of these measures is estimated at about $63m in the current year and $97m in a full year. </para>
		<para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Sickness Beneficiaries</inline>
		  </para>
        <para>We have decided that fringe benefits will be extended to sickness beneficiaries in appropriate cases. Details will be announced by the Minister for Social Security. </para>
        <para>This is in recognition of the additional costs faced by many people who are temporarily unable to work because of sickness. </para>
		<para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Assistance to Supporting Parents</inline>
		  </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to remove the six-month waiting period for supporting parent&#39;s benefit. This means that Commonwealth assistance will be available at uniform rates to all sole parents who meet the income test and other eligibility conditions. The States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act will be repealed. </para>
		<para>
		<inline font-style="italic">Unemployment and Sickness Benefits</inline>
		</para>
        <para>The Government has decided to relax the income test on eligibility for unemployment and sickness benefits. </para>
        <para>This has been done to give greater encouragement to those out of work to undertake temporary part-time or casual work. </para>
        <para>At present, people who receive more than small amounts of private income have their unemployment or sickness benefits reduced dollar for dollar. </para>
        <para>Such a situation provides no real incentive for those receiving these benefits to seek temporary part-time or casual work. </para>
        <para>In its concern to remove this disincentive, the Government considered a number of options, including a simple increase in the allowable income threshold. </para>
        <para>It rejected this course in favour of one permitting recipients to undertake a more substantial amount of temporary part-time or casual work without losing the whole of each dollar earned. </para>
        <para>We have accordingly decided that from the first benefit payday in November 1980 the benefits will be withdrawn only on a 50 per cent basis for private income within the following ranges. $3 to $40 a week for single persons aged 16 and 17 years with a parent living in Australia; and $6 to $50 a week in all other cases. </para>
        <para>An unemployment benefit recipient over 21 years of age who earns $50 a week from casual work would currently have the benefit reduced by $44 a week. </para>
        <para>Under the new proposal the benefit would be reduced by only half this amount providing an extra $22 a week. . </para>
        <para>Benefits will continue to be withdrawn on a dollar for dollar basis for all private income in excess of the upper limits of $40 and $50 a week respectively. </para>
        <para>It has also been decided to increase by $2 a week from the first benefit payday in November the non-indexed rate of unemployment benefit payable to beneficiaries who are 18 years and over and who have no dependants. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Assistance to the Handicapped</inline>
        </para>
        <para>Over the past five years, this Government has provided generous support for programs to assist the mentally and physically handicapped. </para>
        <para>Again, in 1980-81, in addition to increasing the Handicapped Child&#39;s Allowance we have - provided Slim in the first year of a three year program for the establishment of new services for handicapped children and adults; provided $300,000 to upgrade the quality and effectiveness of existing services for the handicapped; and decided to establish additional facilities within the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service network. </para>
        <para>Funds will be provided for administration and planning for the International Year of Disabled Persons and for a number of other new programs for the handicapped and disabled. </para>

		</para>
        <para>The Budget provides for two measures of particular importance to veterans as well as increases in a range of supplementary repatriation benefits, and for certain extensions of eligibility for free repatriation medical treatment, with effect from November. </para>
        <para>The Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs will be announcing details in a separate statement. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided that, from 1 January 1981, only half of any disability pension will be taken into account in determining eligibility for a Pensioner Health Benefits Card. </para>
        <para>The Government has also decided that the maximum loan available through the Defence Service Homes Scheme will be increased from the present $15,000 to $25,000. </para>
        <para>The additional $10,000 will carry a concessional interest rate of 10 per cent. </para>
        <para>The estimated cost of this measure is $25m in 1980-81 rising to $59m in 1981-82. </para>
        <para>The waiting period for a loan under the scheme will be reduced to 10 months, at an additional estimated cost of $19m in 1980-81. </para>
        <para>The cost of all the other measures is estimated to be $3.9m in 1980-81 and $6.3m in a full year. </para>

      <para>As announced previously, the Commonwealth will provide $285m to the States and the Northern Territory for welfare housing in 1 980-8 1 . </para>
      <para>The Commonwealth has also offered to guarantee to provide a base level of $ 1 ,000m over the five years from July 1981 to assist the States and the Northern Territory in the provision of welfare housing. </para>
      <para>Under this proposed arrangement, additional funds would be allocated each year as part of the normal budgetary process. </para>
      <para>The value limits for the Homes Savings Grants Scheme will be increased substantially. At present, a full grant is paid on house and land valued at up to $35,000 with pro-rata grants then paid on house and land valued to $40,000.

		</para>
        <para>The importance attached by the Government to encouraging exports, particularly manufactured exports, is demonstrated by the provision in this Budget of $260m for export expansion and market development grants - a rise of $45m or 21 per cent over 1979-80. </para>
        <para>This will substantially reduce the carry-over of claims. </para>

		</para>
        <para>Rural industry and country consumers generally will continue to benefit from the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme on which there will be a total expenditure of approximately $123m in 1980-81. </para>
        <para>This is some $52m greater than last year; the increase results largely from the extension of the scheme last April which had the effect of halving the maximum freight differential between metropolitan and country areas. </para>

		</para>
        <para>The Commonwealth has undertaken to provide the States and the Northern Territory with $3,650m in grants for roads over the next five years; $628m will be provided in 1980-81 which maintains the real level of our spending in this area. </para>
		<para>
          <inline font-style="italic">Air Transport</inline>
		</para>
        <para>The Budget provides $64m in 1980-81 for buildings, works and equipment at airports, $41m more than expenditure last year. </para>
        <para>This includes work in line with our commitment to redevelop Brisbane airport by 1986 at a total cost of over S200m and to upgrade facilities at a number of other airports. </para>
        <para>High on the list of priorities are a new international terminal at Perth, planning for new civil aviation facilities at Darwin, the development of Norfolk Island airport to medium jet standard, airport facilities for the operation of wide-bodied domestic jets, upgrading of Townsville airport for international services, and new terminal buildings at Canberra and Coolangatta. </para>
        <para>The expected cost of all these additional facilities is some $ 145m. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided that international sector air navigation charges will remain unchanged in 1980-81. </para>
        <para>The Government has also decided that the target of full cost recovery in the domestic trunk airline sector should be achieved in 1980-81, a year earlier than previously announced. </para>
        <para>Despite this, it will now be necessary to seek an increase of only 15 per cent in air navigation charges for that sector in 1980-81 compared with the 25 per cent increase previously announced. </para>
        <para>The increase proposed will yield an additional S3m in 1980-81. </para>
        <para>ENERGY</para>
      <para>Budget- funding for energy research is to rise by almost 50 per cent to SI 3.5m in 1980-8 1 . </para>
      <para>A further $2.5m will be provided for energy information and energy conservation programs. </para>
      <para>These expenditures supplement the very significant taxation incentives which have already been provided to encourage greater energy exploration and development and the use of energy sources other than oil. </para>
      <para>The total cost to revenue of those incentives in 1979-80 was at least $50m and this figure is expected to rise as industry takes increasing advantage of them. </para>
      <para>This year the Pipeline Authority will be starting construction of natural gas pipelines from Young to Wagga Wagga and from Dalton to Canberra. </para>
      <para>Studies will be undertaken on extending the natural gas pipeline from Wagga Wagga to Albury and on possible lines to Lithgow, Bathurst, Orange and Oberon. </para>
      <para>The expected cost of construction and studies in 1980-81 is $26m. </para>
      <para>The Pipeline Authority will fund such activities by borrowing from the private sector; interest on borrowings will be met from the Authority&#39;s revenue and from the Budget. </para>
        <para>MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH</para>
      <para>This Budget provides a total of $1 8m for medical research which will be made available through the National Health and Medical Research Council. </para>
      <para>This represents an increase of approximately 30 per cent and demonstrates the desire of the Government to provide substantial and ongoing support for medical research. </para>
      <para>The Government recognises the high quality of medical research in Australia and wishes to build upon the past contributions of our researchers. </para>
      <para>Significantly more support will be given to marine science this year. Specific funding for this research will rise from $650,000 to $3.5m and further resources will be provided for research activities in the Great Barrier Reef area. </para>
      <para>In the next few years, up to $80m will be spent on the rebuilding and upgrading of Australia&#39;s Antarctic bases, the transfer of the CSIRO Division of Fisheries and Oceanography to Tasmania, and the acquisition of a $9m oceanographic ship for CSIRO and other national uses. </para>
      <para>In the field of conservation, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is to receive $6.6m and funding for the Biological Resources Survey will more than double. - </para>

        <para>PERSONAL INCOME TAX</para>
      <para class="block">The Government has already announced major changes in personal income tax which took effect from 1 July. </para>
      <para>The standard rate for 1980-81 is reduced to 32 per cent and the income ranges in the scale have been indexed by 3.8 per cent so that the tax-free threshold is now $4,041. </para>
      <para>Dependant rebates have been increased by 34 per cent, with the rebate for a dependent spouse rising to $800 and that for a sole parent to $559. </para>
      <para>These changes have an estimated revenue cost of $636 million in 1980-81. </para>
      <para>In recent years a loading has been added to normal rates in calculating the provisional tax payment of taxpayers who do not self-assess, in order to achieve reasonable comparability in the treatment of PA YE and all provisional taxpayers. </para>
      <para>In 1980-81 this objective is to be achieved by applying the 1980-81 rate scale to 1979-80 incomes increase by a factor of 71 per cent and allowing dependant rebates at 1980-81 values. </para>
      <para>Provisional taxpayers will of course continue to have the option to self-assess and provide an estimate of their 1980-81 incomes. </para>

        <inline font-style="italic">Superannuation Arrangements for Self-employed Persons and Unsupported Employees</inline>
      </para>
      <para>The Government has decided to provide a significant new incentive through the taxation system to encourage self-employed persons and employees not covered by employer-sponsored arrangements to make greater provision for their retirement. </para>
      <para>At present contributions by an individual for superannuation purposes are included in rebatable expenditure, within a limit of $1,200 for the sum of life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions. </para>
      <para>This limit applies whether the contribution is by an employee contributing to an employersupported fund, an employee who is not supported by an employer-sponsored scheme but makes his own arrangements to contribute to a public superannuation fund, or a self-employed person. </para>
      <para>However, whereas employee members of an employer-supported fund also have the advantage of employer contributions on their behalf, and are not taxed on those amounts, there is no corresponding benefit for self-employed persons or employees who are not supported by an employersponsored scheme. </para>
      <para>The Government has therefore decided to extend to such people, where no other contributions are made on their behalf, a taxation benefit broadly comparable to the &#39;matching employer&#39; contribution of supported employees. </para>
      <para>We have decided that contributions - up to a limit of $1,200 per annum - made by self employed persons and employees after today to a qualifying fund to provide retirement benefits for themselves and their dependants will be deductible from their assessable income if the person is not covered by employer-sponsored arrangements. </para>
      <para>Contributions in excess of $1,200 will remain rebatable expenditure, up to the present limit of $1,200 for life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions applicable to all taxpayers. </para>
      <para>At the same time, 5 per cent of lump sums received by self-employed persons and unsupported employees after today from qualifying superannuation funds will count as assessable income, to the extent that those sums are derived from contributions made after today and from earnings of the fund from the investment of those contributions. </para>
      <para>This will result in that part of the lump sums being taxed to the same extent as lump sums received on retirement by supported employees. </para>
      <para>That part of the lump sums derived from earlier contributions, and the earnings on their investment, will remain tax free. </para>
      <para>On the basis of assumptions about the likely response rate to such a measure, the full year cost is estimated at about $100m. </para>

        <para>This measure is intended to enhance the ability of Australian consultants to obtain a greater share of the growing overseas consultancy services market.

        <para>In addition to the substantial outlays made direct from the Budget for overseas aid purposes, the Government permitted tax deductions in respect of donations made in 1979-80 to the Kampuchea and East Timor appeals. </para>

        <para>In the meanwhile, of course, circumstances have changed. </para>
        <para>Against this background we have decided to establish a public inquiry to examine in detail the cost and other disabilities of living in remote areas and to make recommendations on possible changes to the present system of zone allowances. </para>

      <para>In particular, for cattle properties certified as subject to those diseases and where herd control is difficult, expenditure by 30 June 1984 on internal fences and stockyards contracted for while a certificate is in force will be deductible in full in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. </para>
        <para>ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF PLANT AND EQUIPMENT</para>
      <para>There have been many suggestions in recent years that the present depreciation provisions do not provide a sufficiently fast rate of write-off for new plant during periods of rapid technological change. </para>
      <para>We have therefore decided to apply a 20 per cent loading to existing depreciation rates; for example, an existing rate of 15 per cent will become 1 8 per cent and so on. </para>
      <para>These new arrangements will apply to new and second-hand plant ordered after today, with the exceptions of motor vehicles of the type now excluded from the investment allowance and plant for which statutory concessional rates are already available. </para>
      <para>There is, by definition, no objective way of adjusting depreciation rates for obsolescence occasioned by unpredictable technological change. </para>
      <para>The proposed loading does, however, represent a significant aid to businesses confronted with that problem and will encourage updating of plant and equipment. </para>
      <para>The cost of this measure will rise over a transitional period, from an estimated $60m in 1981-82 to more than $250m per annum in the mid-1980s. </para>

	  </para>
      <para>This year taxation receipts will rise by 16.4 per cent. </para>
      <para>In particular, company tax receipts and crude oil levy collections will rise at a relatively high rate. </para>
      <para>The increase in company tax receipts reflects greater company profitability, the phasing down of the investment allowance in 1979 and last year&#39;s decision to withdraw the trading stock valuation adjustment. </para>
      <para>Crude oil levy collections will be higher mainly on account of the full year effects of the rises in the price of oil which occurred last year. </para>
      <para>Personal taxation reductions for the year have been in place since 1 July. The Budget provides some tax relief for businesses. There are also some particular areas where taxation incentives have been provided. </para>
      <para>Given the expenditure priorities I described earlier, further general taxation concessions could only have been given at the cost of forgoing the major reduction in the Budget deficit. </para>
      <para>In our view the anti-inflationary objectives of this Budget, and therefore the long term economic interests of Australia, will best be served by the reduction we have achieved in the Budget deficit. </para>

        <inline font-style="bold">BUDGET OVERVIEW</inline>
	  </para>
      <para>Total outlays in 1980-81 are estimated to increase by 1 3.7 per cent to $36,037m. </para>
      <para>Total receipts, allowing for the cost of the measures I have outlined and of those previously announced, are estimated to increase by 16.2 per cent to $34,47 lm. </para>
      <para>The overall Budget deficit is therefore estimated at $ 1,566m, a reduction of $468 million on the outcome for 1979-80. </para>
      <para>When allowance is made for transactions abroad, there will be an estimated Budget domestic surplus of $39m- the first such surplus since 1973-74. </para>
      <para>Such an outcome will represent further substantial progress along the road to fiscal responsibility and monetary stability. </para>
	  <para>
        <inline font-style="bold">ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</inline>
	  </para>
      <para>The aim of this Budget is to maintain and develop a climate in which Australia&#39;s high potential for growth in the 1 980s can be realised. </para>
      <para>We also wish to see that development proceeds at a pace which is sustainable and that it provides benefits for all Australians. </para>
      <para>Inflation and other economic difficulties which developed some years ago, though now reduced, threaten our growth potential. </para>
      <para>For example, if the recent pattern of wage determinations continues in 1980-81, average weekly earnings would be likely to rise by around 12 per cent compared with 9* per cent in 1979-80. </para>
      <para>Particularly at a time when overseas rates of inflation are showing signs of moderating, there is a real danger in this acceleration. </para>
      <para>On the basis of the fiscal and monetary policies set forth in the Budget the rate of increase in the CPI over the year to June 1981 is likely to be around 10 per cent. </para>
      <para>For 1980-81 the present outlook for the nonfarm sector of the Australian economy is for a somewhat faster rate of expansion than last year - 3i per cent or more compared with a little over 3 per cent last year. </para>
      <para>After allowance for the likely small reduction in farm product, overall growth could be 3 per cent or more, compared with the estimated 2.2 per cent last year. </para>
      <para>This compares with the most recent <inline font-style="italic">OECD Outlook</inline> forecast of no real growth in aggregate in member countries. </para>
      <para>Although the Australian economy and in particular our exports will be affected by slower economic growth overseas, the impact will be lessened by our better inflation performance and the nature and destination of our exports. </para>
      <para>For example, over 50 per cent of our exports go to Asian and Middle Eastern countries which are among those less affected by the slowdown in world economic growth. </para>
      <para>The current account deficit will nevertheless be considerably higher in 1980-81, perhaps about double last year&#39;s abnormally low outcome of about $ 1,200m. </para>
      <para>Against this, a much larger inflow of private capital is likely, leaving the overall balance of payments satisfactory, and a surplus on private external transactions of up to S 1 ,500m. </para>
      <para>Internally generated demand is expected to more than offset adverse international developments. </para>
      <para>In particular, business fixed investment is set to show a real increase in 1980-81 of over 10 per cent. </para>
      <para>The extent of the increase will be critically influenced by the availability of adequate supplies of labour and materials. </para>
      <para>Dwelling investment should remain high in 1980-81, although growth is likely to be slower than last year. </para>
      <para>The strengthening in private consumption expenditure during the course of last year should continue in 1980-81, reflecting further steady growth in employment of about H per cent and stronger growth in real disposable income. </para>
      <para>Overall, the outlook for 1980-81 is for strong expansion in activity led by private sector demand. </para>
      <para>The Government believes this stronger outlook for activity can be achieved with slower growth in the monetary aggregates than last year. </para>
      <para>The further reduction in the Budget deficit is seen as essential to achieving the Government&#39;s monetary goals. </para>
      <para>It will help to make room for financing the significant increase in corporate borrowing likely in 1980-81 as private investment expenditure rises. </para>
      <para>The Government will again seek to have the large wheat harvest in prospect financed in a manner which will minimise its impact on the monetary aggregates. </para>
      <para>Predicting the monetary outcome is always difficult because of the number and nature of the variables which underlie particular monetary aggregates, such as M3. </para>
      <para>Despite ^e much reduced Budget deficit in 1979-80, the growth in the money supply (M3) was 12.9 per cent against the projection of about 10 per cent. </para>
      <para>That outcome again illustrates the wide margins of error inherent in such projections. </para>
      <para>In any case, M3 is not a totally definitive measure of monetary growth. </para>
      <para>For example, building society deposits, which have experienced greater growth than bank deposits in recent years, are not included in the M3 measurement. </para>
      <para>For its part, the Government will continue to monitor a whole range of monetary aggregates. </para>
      <para>We nevertheless see merit in continuing the practice of recent years of specifying a range for M3. </para>
      <para>We shall be aiming for a lower growth in M3 this year than the outcome last year. </para>
      <para>On present economic assessments, an outcome for M3 of about 9-1 1 per cent over the year to June 1981 would be consistent with the requirements of the Government&#39;s economic policy and would in particular exert appropriate downward pressure on inflation. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget provides for an increase of 13.7 per cent in total <inline font-style="italic">outlays</inline> in 1980-81 compared with an increase of 9.1 per cent last year. The 1980-81 increase is estimated to represent real growth in outlays of about 3 per cent. As a proportion of GDP, Budget outlays are estimated to be about the same as in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Total <inline font-style="italic">receipts</inline> are estimated to increase by 16.2 per cent in 1980-81, which compares with an increase of 16.0 per cent in 1979-80. Total receipts increased by 8.9 per cent in 1978-79 and 9.7 per cent in 1977-78. The continued strong growth estimated for total receipts in 1980-81, notwithstanding the slower estimated growth in personal income tax receipts, reflects mainly the further substantial increase in estimated receipts from the excise on crude oil and LPG and strong growth in company tax receipts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget <inline font-style="italic">deficit</inline> for 1980-81 is estimated at $1566 million, a reduction of $468 million on the deficit recorded in 1979-80. The deficit on overseas transactions is estimated to increase by $138 million to $1605 million mainly because of increased outlays for defence equipment. Domestic budget transactions are thus estimated to move from a deficit of $567 million in 1979-80 to a surplus of $39 million in 1980-81. A domestic budget surplus was last recorded in 1973-74. </para>

In addition to the measures announced in the Budget Speech, decisions affecting taxation revenue in 1980-81 were announced in the Treasurer&#39;s statement to the Parliament on 6 March 1980 and in the statement by the Minister for National Development and Energy on 8 April 1980.

        <para pgwide="yes">Some 41 per cent of the estimated increase in receipts in 1980-81 derives from strong increases in receipts from the excise on crude oil and LPG and from company income tax. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The further substantial increase in receipts from the excise on crude oil mainly reflects past increases in the import parity price. (It is assumed that the import parity price applicable since 1 July 1980 will not change in 1980-81). Revenue from the excise on LPG is also expected to increase sharply as a result of the full year effects of the new pricing and levy arrangements announced on 8 April 1980. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The strong growth in company tax reflects estimated faster growth during  1979-80 in company incomes subject to tax as well as the abolition of the trading stock valuation adjustment with effect from 1 July 1979 and the phasing down of the investment allowance to 20 per cent for eligible plant first used or installed ready for use after 30 June 1979. </para>

		  <inline font-style="bold">Introduction</inline>
		  </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Any broad assessment of economic developments needs to pay attention to  a  wide range of information. While the national accounts estimates are based on a large amount of source data and are presented within a coherent framework, the estimates have exhibited considerable variability due to revisions and, on occasions, movements in individual items have appeared inconsistent with each other or with other sources of information. This places limits on their usefulness and means that judgment and other available information must be used when arriving at an overall view on how economic developments are unfolding. Last year&#39;s Statement No. 2 highlighted some of these difficulties and the latest national accounts estimates suggest that the estimates continue to be surrounded by uncertainty. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">One indicator of the internal consistency of the national accounts estimates is the behaviour of the &#39;statistical discrepancy&#39;. Product can be estimated either from expenditure data or income data; the difference between the two estimates is the statistical discrepancy. In Australia, the income-based estimate of GDP has traditionally been used as the basic measure of product growth, with the statistical discrepancy being assigned to the expenditure side of the accounts. A large statistical discrepancy indicates that the measurement of either the expenditure or income estimates is inadequate. Similarly, a significant trend in the discrepancy suggests that the estimates of the growth of individual items are out of line with actual developments; this could of course be associated with improved accuracy in the measurement of the level of individual aggregates. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 1 sets out the recent history of the statistical discrepancy and the two measures of product growth. Since 1973-74 the statistical discrepancy has been on a general downward trend and in 1978-79 it became negative for the first time since 1970-71. In 1979-80 it became even more negative. In short, product as measured by the expenditure estimates has been increasing at a faster rate than the published income-based estimates. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes"> A variety of possible reasons can be brought forward to explain this difference in growth. For example, income estimates in the early to mid 1970s could have been inflated because of rising capital gains, fed by accelerating inflation, being classified as income. More recently, a growing cash economy might be better reflected in the expenditure estimates than in the income estimates. On the other hand, the Statistician has referred to the illegal economy as a source of understatement of expenditure. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The divergence between the civilian employees series and the labour force employment estimates (which have grown the faster over the past year - see page 18) and the subsequent withdrawal from publication of the civilian employees series has introduced a new element of uncertainty into the accounts. The Statistician has revised upwards his estimates of wages, salaries and supplements. These estimates have traditionally been based on the civilian employees series. The Statistician is reviewing the employment statistics and the outcome may have implications for the product estimates and for the pattern in the statistical discrepancy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">While further revisions to employment may bring the movements in the expenditure and income side of the accounts closer together for 1979-80, they would not remove the general pattern in the statistical discrepancy over the longer run of years and they would introduce a sharper movement in the discrepancy between 1977-78 and 1978-79. Notwithstanding the difficulties in compiling national accounts, which are not unique to Australia, these estimates continue to be a useful tool and are given due regard in what follows. </para>

		   <inline font-style="bold">Demand and Output</inline>
		   </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Domestic economic activity and employment strengthened significantly over the course of 1979-80. The main contributions in the first half of the year came from very strong export growth and a sizeable build-up in non-farm stocks; private final domestic demand was subdued in this period, with strong growth in private dwelling investment and moderate growth in private consumption being largely offset by a decline in business fixed investment. The second half of the year brought an acceleration in private consumption expenditure and a recovery in business fixed investment, accompanied by a run-down in stocks and some easing  in export growth. Growth in non-farm domestic product for the year as a whole was more than 3 per cent - about what was expected at Budget-time last year. As had also been expected, farm product declined from the peak recorded in 1978-79 but was still high. Employment expanded more rapidly than in any year since 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">All in all, 1979-80 saw significant gains in the recovery process. Despite these gains, the factors that have been constricting the economy&#39;s growth potential in recent years still remain. Some new problems also are emerging; these problems are addressed in Part II. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The following paragraphs describe major developments in the past year or so. National accounts estimates provide the framework for the discussion but where appropriate they are supplemented by other information. The commentary, including the accompanying charts, refers to annual and half-yearly movements. Unless otherwise noted, all figures mentioned are in constant price (&#39;real&#39;) terms and (apart from full-year changes) are seasonally adjusted. Since the &#39;rear and money&#39; economies are part and parcel of each other, the use of developments in &#39;real&#39; expenditures as the starting-point for discussion is, though conventional, to some extent arbitrary. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private final consumption expenditure</inline>(Chart 1, panel a) increased by 2.3 per cent in 1979-80, much as expected at this time last year and not significantly different from the average growth rate over the previous three years. Growth increased in the second half of the year to an annual rate of 2.9 per cent. The removal of the income tax surcharge from 1 December 1979 doubtless contributed to this increase; so too did the significant lift in employment growth that occurred towards the end of 1979. </para>

The improved level of activity in the dwelling sector was assisted by a return to more normal levels of stocks of unsold new dwellings and the improved price competitiveness of new dwellings relative to established ones. An upsurge in building in Sydney and in Queensland resort areas appears to have reflected some speculative elements. Although the rate of increase of housing finance approvals for owner occupation eased considerably in the first half of 1979-80, activity continued to respond to the rapid increase in loan approvals in 1978-79 and the growing interest of developers and investors in providing townhouses and flats in some areas. For example, while commencements of houses were 9.2 per  cent higher in the first three quarters of 1979-80 than for the same period a year earlier, commencements of dwellings other than houses (home units, etc) rose by no less than 32.1 per cent between the same two periods. </para>

The completion of the phasing down of the investment allowance from 40 per cent to 20 per cent at the end of 1978-79 was no doubt the major influence on the decline in the first six months and in the year as a whole. The strong second half increase for nonresidential building and construction - at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 23 per cent - is compatible with earlier information from the Statistician&#39;s investment expectations survey. The small fall for plant and equipment investment, however, implies that the strong growth in that area expected for the June quarter did not materialise. Unexpected delays, possibly associated with industrial disputation, skilled labour shortages, or the temporary deferment of some investment pending greater clarification of the overseas outlook, may have been responsible for that lower than expected outcome. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">While there are reasons to be cautious, the strong growth in non-residential building and construction in the second half of 1979-80, together with the very strong growth in 1980-81 for private business fixed investment foreshadowed by the Statistician&#39;s investment expectations survey (see page 56), point to the basic strength of the investment recovery now under way. As Table 3 shows, however, investment as a proportion of GDP still remains below past averages. </para>

As was the case in  1978-79,  this growth was more than accounted for by an increase in current expenditure  (2.5  per cent); capital expenditure fell by  2.9  per cent. The direct contribution of government final expenditure to product growth in  1979-80,  at  0.2  percentage points, was one of the smallest in the post-war period. There was a further small fall in the ratio of public sector spending on goods and services to GDP although it remained considerably above pre  1974-75  levels (see Chart  2).  As was indicated in last year&#39;s Statement, that higher level of the ratio is wholly attributable to expenditure by the State and local government sectors. The figures illustrated in Chart  2  do not, of course, tell the whole budgetary story; in particular, transfer payments - which loom very large in Commonwealth outlays - are not included.

In the first half of 1979-80 a run-down in farm stocks associated with the shipment of 1978-79&#39;s record rural output was more than offset by an accumulation of nonfarm stocks. Part of the build-up in non-farm stocks (in particular the build-up of motor vehicle stocks) would have been unintended, but there also appears to have been a precautionary accumulation of petroleum-related stocks. In the second half of the year non-farm stocks were run down as the unintended stock rises of the previous half-year were worked off. The effect of industrial disputes on output, particularly in the coal industry, also contributed to stock decumulation. Farm stocks continued to fall in the second half of the year. For the year as a whole, non-farm stocks increased but, because of the fall in farm stocks, overall stock movements detracted importantly from product growth (Table 4). </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The labour force survey indicates that the increase in employment in 1979-80 was fairly evenly spread between the &#39;employers and self-employed&#39; category, which rose by 2.6 per cent, and wage and salary earner employment, which rose by 2.4 per cent. Employment derived from the payroll tax based civilian employees series recorded a rise of only 1.0 per cent over the course of the year to April 1980 (after which publication of this series was withheld). This stands in marked contrast to the estimated growth in wage and salary earner employment according to the survey. While there are reasons to question the reliability of both series - the survey because of inherent problems of sampling variability and the civilian employees statistics because the payroll tax data on which the private sector estimates are based provide only a partial coverage of civilian employment - the survey based employment series appears to provide a better guide to recent employment trends than the payroll tax based estimates. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In making such a judgment, it is important to note that the labour force survey estimates suggest growth over the previous twelve-month period of 2.0 per cent or more for each of the last ten months of the year - which reduces the chance that this faster rate of increase was due solely to sampling errors. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Because of the widening divergence in the growth rates of the two employment series, the Statistician is investigating the payroll tax based series and has withheld publication of the series until revised figures are available. He is also investigating the methods and procedures of the monthly labour force survey. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The labour force <inline font-style="italic">participation rate,</inline> which had been falling persistently for some years, recorded a small increase in 1979-80 (Table  5).  The rise was more pronounced over the course of the year, from 60.7 per cent in the June quarter of 1979 to 61.3 per cent in the recent June quarter. The fact that the strong growth in employment over 1979-80 was accomplished by attracting more people into the workforce rather than by reducing the number unemployed is further evidence of the basic adaptability and flexibility of the workforce as a whole, and perhaps also of the rigidities among some of those remaining unemployed. In 1979, of the people employed at some stage during the year, 23 per cent left a job. This dynamic aspect of the employed labour force is also evident in monthly flows. It would appear that each month around 4 per cent of those employed in the previous month leave employment while around 41 per cent of those who were previously not in the labour force enter employment; of those previously unemployed, around 20 per cent find employment each month. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">According to the labour force survey, <inline font-style="italic">unemployment</inline> for both the full-time and total labour forces was below the levels of a year earlier for much of 1979-80 (Chart 3).

With strong growth in the labour force over the year, the unemployment <inline font-style="italic">rate</inline> in the June quarter 1980 - 6.1 per cent of the labour force - remained slightly below the rate of a year earlier.

        <para pgwide="yes">The recent rise in the absolute contribution of national wage case decisions to the rate of increase in awards is the result of applying a high degree of indexation to an accelerating CPI. The most recent decision (14 July) has continued this trend; the latest two national wage increases compound to 8.9 per cent, the largest increase for any twelve-month period since 1977. 1979-80 also saw the most significant movement for some years in awards outside national wage cases. In particular, a substantial proportion of wage and salary earners received work value&#39; and other non-national wage case increases during the year. As a result of both these influences, the rate of increase in average awards rose in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As in 1978-79, <inline font-style="italic">average weekly earnings</inline> increased significantly faster than <inline font-style="italic">average minimum male awards.</inline> This would suggest that earnings drift and/or increased overtime have been of some significance, although conclusions can be no more than tentative at this stage because of the timing problems and limitations of the data. In particular, the award wage rate indexes do not cover a significant proportion of employees covered by the earnings series. Also those award rates of pay which are included in the indexes are, at present, weighted according to the pattern of employment prevailing in 1954. Moreover, the indexes are sometimes slow to reflect changes in award wages and latest observations are therefore subject to substantial revision. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Nevertheless, it is clear that there has been substantial drift of wages and earnings outside national wage cases since 1978. This has coincided with a steep increase in industrial disputes over wages and hours of work. In 1979, 2.2 million working days were lost directly through such disputes, compared with 1.1 million in 1978 and 0.9 million in 1977. The timing of this development in relation to labour market trends suggests that the increased demand for labour has played some causal role. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Table 9 sets out information on real award wages and earnings. The acceleration in inflation in 1979-80, as measured by the private consumption deflator, was enough to offset the acceleration in award wages and average weekly earnings (male unit basis). As a result, male award wages deflated by the private consumption deflator declined by 1.2 per cent in 1979-80 after decreasing by 2.4 per cent in the previous year. The corresponding figures for average weekly earnings were declines of 0.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent. To an extent this fall in real award wages and real average weekly earnings in 1979-80 was a reflection of the initial lags in the adjustment of wages to prices in a period of accelerating inflation. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1979-80 the private consumption deflator rose somewhat more quickly (by 9.7 per cent) than the non-farm product deflator (9.2 per cent), largely because of the effect of a faster rise in rural prices and a decline in the terms of trade. Adjusted by the non-farm product deflator, the fall in real awards in 1979-80 reduces to 0.8 per cent and real earnings show a slight rise. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Public sector final expenditure contributed around 0.2 percentage points to product growth in 1979-80, the smallest such figure for many years. This, together with the significant reduction in the Commonwealth sector borrowing requirement, contributed importantly to the improved performance of the economy in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The continued policy of Commonwealth expenditure restraint was reflected in the slight reduction, in real terms, in Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1979-80. Over the previous three years, outlays grew in real terms at an average rate of about one per cent per annum. While this has resulted in a gradual reduction in the size of the Commonwealth Budget sector relative to GDP, much of the reduction in the Budget deficit has reflected increased receipts which, over the four years to 1979-80, rose slightly relative to GDP. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The 16.0 per cent increase in Commonwealth Budget receipts in 1979-80 was somewhat faster than in recent years, mainly reflecting the strong growth in personal income tax and a further large increase in revenue from the crude oil levy. The latter included the additional revenue resulting from the Government&#39;s decision to retain the crude oil levy proceeds associated with the increased import parity price following the December 1979 OPEC oil price rises. Mainly as a result of this decision, the Budget deficit of $2034 million was some ^ $160 million lower than the Budget estimate. The very large reduction in the&#39; deficit in 1979-80 ($1444 million) was important in containing additions, to the money supply and pressures on interest rates and in enhancing investor confidence. </para>

This did, however, represent some deceleration: State and local government outlays rose at an average annual rate of 3.0 per cent over the three years to 1978-79. Growth in the outlays of the State and local government sector has not resulted from expanded <inline font-style="italic">direct</inline> assistance from the Commonwealth Budget, which declined in real terms over the four years ending in 1979-80.

The broadly defined volume of money (M3) grew by 12.9 per cent during 1979-80, compared with the 11.8 per cent increase recorded during 1978-79.

        <para pgwide="yes">The major factors in the formation of movements in the volume of money (M3) are set out in Table 13 and illustrated in Chart 7. There were important differences between 1979-80 and earlier years. In the first place, there was a sizeable surplus (for the first time since 1972-73) on private sector foreign exchange transactions of $974 million, compared with deficits of $1202 million in 1977-78 and $254 million in 1978-79. Secondly, there was the much lower contribution from the domestic Budget deficit ($567 million) than in 1978-79 ($2258 million). (Details on how the Budget deficit was financed are given in Table 14.) Thirdly, Rural Credits advances made a negative contribution to monetary growth instead of the small positive contribution in 1978-79. Rural Credits advances from the Reserve Bank to the Australian Wheat Board in respect of the 1979-80 crop were limited to $800 million and, principally because of an exceptionally high rate of wheat shipments, the Australian Wheat Board was able to repay within the year a large part of those advances together with the amounts outstanding in respect of advances on previous years&#39; crops. Largely as a result, Rural Credits advances outstanding in June 1980 were $285 million lower than a year earlier. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The net result of these three factors was an increase in private sector holdings &#34; of liquid assets and government securities (LGS) in 1979-80 of $1200 million, the smallest increase for any year since 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main factor in the monetary overrun in 1979-80 was the much faster expansion in trading bank advances than had been expected. This very largely reflected the fact that, following the rapid rise in interest rates in some overseas countries early in the year and increases in interest rates on loans by other domestic financial institutions, demand for lower cost trading bank loans increased sharply. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">In fact, advances outstanding of the major trading banks rose strongly in 1979-80 and, over the course of the year, increased by 16.7 per cent. Although for the year as a whole the increase in net new overdraft limits was within the Reserve Bank lending guidance of not more than $30 million per week, during the first five months such limits increased, on average, by more than $40 million per week (on a seasonally adjusted basis). This not only contributed to the growth in advances outstanding but, by adding to the stock of unused overdraft limits, supplemented the potential for further growth in advances through increases in the usage ratio later in the year. Following the US monetary measures of 6 October 1979, the rate of overdraft usage rose quickly to a level some 2 to 3 percentage points higher than a year earlier. The overdraft usage ratio remained at this level for some months before jumping again - to some 4 to 5 percentage points higher than a year earlier - late in the financial year. The interest rate charged to prime borrowers on bank loans in excess of $100 000 increased by around 1.5 percentage points to about 12.5 per cent during the year. The interest rates charged on smaller overdrafts generally rose by 0.5 percentage points to the maximum permitted rate of 10.5 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As part of the policy to restrain bank lending, the Statutory Reserve Deposit (SRD) ratio of the major trading banks was raised from 5.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent on 6 December 1979. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Non-bank take-up of Commonwealth Government securities during the year may be usefully considered in four distinct stages: the pre-Budget period; from the Budget to 6 October; from 6 October to 30 April when the tap system for marketing Commonwealth bonds was introduced; and the period after 30 April. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Prior to the Budget, securities markets were unsettled. This probably reflected, in the main, concern about the implications for inflation of the high rate of monetary growth during 1978-79. The large sales of Australian Savings Bonds (ASBs) during this period were mainly due to a temporary lack of confidence in some financial intermediaries. Investors&#39; confidence in the bond market appeared to be restored by the announcement of a substantial reduction in the estimated Budget deficit and, hence, in the Commonwealth sector borrowing requirement for 1979-80. The pace of bond sales picked up and there was some, albeit tentative, demand for longer bonds. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Following the US monetary measures on 6 October, the bond market weakened. There were steady sales of ASBs and non-bank holdings of Treasury Notes increased quite rapidly, but non-bank holdings of bonds fell progressively. Notwithstanding this deterioration in the bond market and its implications for short-run monetary control, policy was concerned with the need not to overreact to what appeared likely to be a temporary rise in overseas interest rates. As was pointed out in this Statement last year, large and erratic variations in policy settings are likely in themselves to impair economic performance. Overseas rates, notably in the United States, did fall back sharply later in 1979-80; however, the intervening period proved a difficult one in which to restore more favourable conditions for selling government bonds. During January the Reserve Bank increased the yields on its &#39;de facto&#39; tap stocks by 0.4 percentage points. In February two bond tenders were conducted and in view of the results the Reserve Bank again increased the yields on its &#39;de facto&#39; tap stocks. However, on each occasion market yields moved away as overseas interest rates continued to rise, and non-bank holdings of bonds continued to fall. ASB Series 16 was introduced on 3 March, at an interest rate of 9.75 per cent, 0.5 percentage points higher than on the previous series, but net subscriptions were negative from early April. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As noted, the tap system was introduced on 30 April. In line with market yields, the initial yield on the two-year tap stock was about 0.5 percentage points, and that on the five-year tap stock 0.6 percentage points, above the &#39;de facto&#39; tap stock yields established in February. This ensured a successful debut, particularly as interest rates in the United States were beginning to fall by this time and a number of institutional buyers appeared to have been awaiting the commencement of the tap system before purchasing bonds. From the new system&#39;s introduction to 30 June, sales of the tap stocks aggregated S874 million; over the same period net non-bank take-up was $437 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Non-bank take-up of all forms of government securities totalled S777 million in 1979-80. While this was slightly higher than the take-up in 1978-79, it was insufficient to prevent the overrun in monetary growth resulting mainly from the rapid growth in bank advances. In particular, insufficient sales of securities were recorded in the December and March quarters, when the strong seasonal addition to liquidity through the Budget deficit and Rural Credits advances as well as surplus private sector foreign exchange transactions resulted in a rapid increase in the banking sector&#39;s liquidity base and thus facilitated the rapid growth in advances. Although non-bank take-up was higher in the June quarter following the successful introduction of the tap system, it was by then too late to affect significantly the growth in the money supply over 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The tendency, referred to in last year&#39;s Statement, for outstanding public sector debt to be concentrated at the shorter end of the maturity spectrum continued into 1979-80. For most of the year sales of Commonwealth securities were largely restricted to ASBs and Treasury Notes, while local and semi government borrowing was primarily by way of sales of four-year securities. Following the implementation of the tap system, however, some lengthening in the maturity structure of outstanding debt began to be achieved. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As indicated in Table 15, private sector interest rates increased during the second half of 1979-80 and, by the end of April, most administered bank rates were at the prescribed maxima. Most significant among these interest rate maxima were the limit of 10.5 per cent on loans of less than $100 000 and, within this, the operational limit of 10.0 per cent on housing loans. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Trading bank overdraft rates for much of the year were considerably below both those prevailing overseas and those charged by competing domestic financial intermediaries. The trading banks met the resultant increased demand by bidding for funds through the issue of negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs) at yields which averaged 13.2 per cent during June. In June 1980 these CDs represented about 13.1 per cent of total trading bank deposits compared with 2.8 per cent a year earlier. This resulted in the banking sector drawing in funds from the nonbank and external sectors, thus adding to the growth in the money supply- as measured by M3. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The interest rate differential between CDs and other trading bank deposits also led State governments to switch some of their funds with banks into CDs. As CDs issued to State governments are included in the money supply while State government holdings of other bank deposits are not, this switching added to the statistically measured growth in the money supply during 1979-80, accounting for about 0.6 percentage points of the growth in M3. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As usual, there was a large seasonal reflux of funds to the Commonwealth in the June quarter. The banks had been advised that the liquidity run-down was expected to be steeper than in preceding years (see Chart 8), reflecting increased provisional tax payments as a result of the lift in rural incomes in 1978-79 and higher company tax payments due to increased corporate profitability in 1978-79. </para>
        <para class="block">Chart 8 - Budget Contributions to Private Sector LGS Assets by Quarter S million  3 000i </para>
        <para class="block">-3 000 </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Although conditions were in fact appreciably tighter than in recent years, the run-down was handled without ameliorating SRD action, the Reserve Bank providing assistance to the market on particularly tight days so as to avoid undue disruption. In June 1980 the LGS ratio of the major trading banks was 18.9 per cent, compared with 21.4 per cent in June 1979. Firmer liquidity conditions resulted in a smaller spread between the individual banks&#39; LGS ratios in June 1980 than in June 1979. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In contrast to the trading banks, savings banks experienced a more than seasonal outflow of funds, excluding interest credited, during the the latter months of the year as their deposit rates became uncompetitive and, over the year as a whole, savings bank deposits rose by only 7.2 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Housing loans outstanding of savings banks grew by 13.2 per cent during 1979-80, despite the much slower growth in their deposits. As a result, savings banks&#39; holdings of LGS assets fell to 17.5 per cent of deposits in June 1980, 2.5 percentage points lower than a year earlier. There was a marked decline in the growth of trading bank housing loans as trading banks understandably concentrated lending in other, presumably more profitable, areas. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Finance approvals by major mortgage lenders grew in value by 8.3 per cent in 1979-80, following the rapid growth of 20.6 per cent in the previous year. The number of finance approvals increased by 2.0 per cent, implying an increase in average loan size of 6.1 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The upsurge in investment, particularly in townhouses and flats in some areas, meant that sources of finance outside the major mortgage lenders became more significant in the financing of dwelling activity in 1979-80. This factor, along with the lagged effects of the earlier sharp lift in finance from the major lenders, underwrote the rapid growth in dwelling activity in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As in other recent years, wider measures of the volume of money showed faster growth than M3. The declining relative importance of savings bank deposits referred to above is in part responsible for this development. Over the twelve months to May 1980, M3 rose by 11.9 per cent. Over the same period M4 (M3 plus permanent building society deposits) rose by 12.9 per cent, a broader measure including finance company deposits rose by 12.4 per cent, while a still broader measure including finance company and money market corporation deposits rose by 12.9 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although net lending by the household sector (which includes unincorporated enterprises) appears to have fallen in 1979-80, that sector continued to have a large financial surplus. Despite this, net sales of ASBs (the government debt instrument especially directed to the household sector) made a relatively minor contribution of $174 million to net sales of government securities to the non-bank private sector. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The corporate sector&#39;s borrowing requirement probably remained unchanged in 1979-80. A strong increase in gross operating surplus was offset in part by an increase in tax payments and increased financing of stocks. </para>

		</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The balance on Australia&#39;s private sector external transactions strengthened considerably in 1979-80. A large fall in the current account deficit more than offset a reduction in net apparent private capital inflow; the resulting surplus of $974 million on private sector external transactions compares with a deficit of $254 million in 1978-79. As a consequence of these developments, the expanded official overseas borrowing program that had been embarked upon in 1977 to support Australia&#39;s international reserves was substantially reduced. The recovery in private external transactions was accompanied by a small net upward movement in the trade-weighted value of the Australian dollar; at the end of June 1980 the trade-weighted index stood at 85.0 compared with 83.1 a year earlier. The surplus on private external transactions was not sufficient to offset fully the deficit on government external transactions so that, overall, the balance of payments was in deficit by $296 million compared with $124 million in 1978-79 (see Table 16). </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Table  16  - Balance of Payments: Main Aggregates  ($ million, seasonally unadjusted) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A strengthening in the balance of payments was expected at the time of last year&#39;s Budget. The basic pre-conditions for an improvement had been established by the sustained application of domestic and external policies designed to restore the competitiveness and profitability of Australian industry. Moreover, it was clear that special factors (including, in particular, the excellent rural seasonal conditions in 1978-79) would assist the external account in 1979-80. Nevertheless export growth exceeded even these expectations, with wheat shipments running well ahead of previous levels and with a commodity price boom, albeit short-lived, developing in late 1979. The private capital account, however, weakened substantially during the first half of the year in the face of action by overseas monetary authorities (particularly in the United States) to tighten their monetary policies. Overall, private external transactions moved into deficit in the September quarter and a surplus did not reappear until the March quarter when the relative attractiveness of Australia&#39;s natural resources, in an increasingly uncertain world climate, contributed to the resumption of net private capital inflow, particularly in the form of portfolio investment. Private external transactions remained in surplus in the June quarter, strengthening markedly in May and June as private capital inflow reacted to a seasonal tightening in domestic liquidity and an easing of interest rates overseas. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">After the deficit on private external transactions appeared in August, measures were taken to supplement reserves. These included official loan raisings in Japan yielding $264 million in the December quarter and the arrangement in December of a $US100 million placement with the Reserve Bank by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Reserves were also bolstered by a Special Drawing Rights allocation from the International Monetary Fund amounting to $98 million in January. A further official loan raising of $208 million was made in the Federal Republic of Germany in February. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">For the year as a whole, gross overseas borrowings by the Government amounted to $471 million compared to $1557 million in 1978-79. Late in the year, the Reserve Bank repaid the $US100 million BIS placement which fell due at the end of June. The Government made two scheduled partial repurchases ($143 million) of the 1976 drawing from the IMF Compensatory Financing Facility during the year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At the end of June 1980 Australia&#39;s international reserves were $5681 million, $1796 million higher than a year earlier. This rise was entirely attributable to increases in the market value of Australia&#39;s official gold holdings and to other valuation effects, which more than offset the reduction in reserves due to balance of payments transactions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The current account strengthening was concentrated in the first half of the year when a sharp rise in net export volume more than offset a deterioration in the terms of trade. The current account deficit widened somewhat in the second half of the year as the volume of net exports diminished. For the year as a whole there was a fourfold increase in net exports and the terms of trade fell by about 3 per cent (Chart 9). </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The value of rural exports rose by over 40 per cent in 1979-80. The increase was concentrated in the first half of the year as shipments of the record 1978-79 wheat crop gained momentum. For the year as a whole, wheat shipments more than doubled to a record IS. 2 million tonnes while shipments of sugar, mutton and lamb also grew strongly. The volume of wool and beef exports fell in the second half of the year. Rural export prices began the year at relatively high levels and rose somewhat further during the commodity boom in the middle of the year. Prices of wheat, meat and wool eased towards the end of the year but sugar prices rose strongly. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Non-rural export proceeds also grew strongly in 1979-80, by 25 per cent. The pick-up in non-rural export volume that began in 1978-79 continued during the first three quarters of 1979-80 despite the impact on iron ore shipments in the September quarter of industrial disputes in the Pilbara. Domestic capacity constraints and industrial disputes led to reduced iron and steel exports but other manufactured exports increased substantially (see Table 17). Non-rural export prices rose steadily until the June quarter when non-ferrous metal and some other prices fell. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The 17 per cent growth in Australia&#39;s import bill in 1979-80 resulted entirely from import price increases (particularly for oil), which accelerated strongly in the first half of the year before slowing in the later months. The volume of imports fell in the September quarter as capital goods imports reacted to the bunching which had taken place in the latter part of 1978-79 prior to the phasing down of the investment allowance. Import volume rebounded strongly in the December quarter but then levelled off in the second half of the year, apparently in response to large stock-building in the pre-Christmas period. For the year as a whole the volume of imports was lower than in 1978-79. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The trade surplus of $2820 million was distributed fairly evenly between the two halves of the year. However, after allowance for the usual pick-up over the course of the year in the net invisibles deficit (with freight and property income payments overseas again showing the most rapid increases), the current account deficit rose to $749 million in the second half of the year from the very low level of $440 million in the first half. The current account deficit for the year as a whole ($1188 million) represented only one per cent of GDP, the lowest such ratio since the surplus on current account recorded in 1972-73. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Net apparent private capital inflow amounted to $956 million in 1979-80 compared with $1734 million in the previous year. This outcome appears to have reflected a particular conjunction of shorter-term influences rather than any weakening of the upward trend in longer-term overseas investment in Australian enterprises. Indeed identified foreign investment in Australian enterprises (which excludes certain large short-term trade credit flows) increased by 29 per cent in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Shorter-term factors affecting the capital account included large net credit sales of wheat, which contributed to a turnaround in marketing authority transactions from an inflow of $34 million in 1978-79 to an outflow of $556 million in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The net apparent outflow of private capital &#39;across the exchanges&#39; (i.e. excluding undistributed income and marketing authorities) of $508 million in the first six months was associated with the emergence of a sizeable interest rate differential between domestic and overseas capital markets, and the ready availability of domestic credit, both favouring financing in Australia. The outflow was reversed in the second half of the year. The initial turnaround occurred in January with a surge in portfolio investment in Australian resource stocks in a period of booming commodity prices. The subsequent strengthening in net private capital inflow across the exchanges in the latter months of the year largely reflected a combination of falling overseas interest rates, particularly in the United States, the seasonal tightening in domestic liquidity conditions and the lift in certain domestic interest rates. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Private capital inflow across the exchanges in 1979-80 amounted to $612 million and included $200 million borrowed by State semi-government authorities for infrastructure financing purposes, all received in the last four months of the year. </para>
        <para class="block">WoirM Economic Bevdopraents </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The world economic situation deteriorated markedly over the course of 1979-80. Price pressures resulting from overly accommodating (in some cases stimulatory) policies in 1978 and from rapidly rising non-oil commodity prices (themselves in part a product of those policies) were already evident before the series of crude oil price rises in 1979. The increases in oil prices also resulted in the re-emergence of large OPEC current account surpluses. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The acceleration of inflation in the OECD area was quite rapid. In the twelve months to May 1980, OECD consumer prices increased by 13.8 per cent compared with 9.1 per cent in the twelve months to May 1979; the OECD estimates that the energy components of member nations&#39; consumer price indexes have directly contributed about half of that observed acceleration. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">More broadly-based private consumption deflators (which apart from covering a wider range of goods and services also reflect reductions in the amount of energy consumed as a result of the substantial oil price rises) have been less volatile than consumer price indexes. But these deflators have also accelerated quite strongly during the past year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The world-wide acceleration of inflation resulted in the major industrial nations adopting progressively tighter economic policies. At recent international meetings, including the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting in June and the Economic Summit in Venice later that month, the major industrial nations have reaffirmed that their first economic priority is the reduction of inflation and inflationary expectations through the application of determined fiscal and monetary restraint. Governments recognised, belatedly in some important cases, that firm anti-inflationary action was essential if the conditions which are fundamental to the re-establishment of sustained economic growth were to be met. Monetary policy has borne the major burden of this move towards more restrictive policies but there has also been movement to more restrained fiscal policies in some major industrial countries. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The acceleration of inflation and the subsequent policy response were reflected in sharp increases in world interest rates. These increases occurred first in the United States, where the deterioration in inflation was particularly marked; but they quickly spread world-wide as other countries raised interest rates to produce monetary growth rates less accommodative to inflationary pressures and, in some cases, to minimise downward pressure on exchange rates resulting from heavy capital outflows induced by the increased interest rates elsewhere. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In terms of economic growth, 1979-80 presented one unexpected result. Although the somewhat slower growth outside the United States was as anticipated, the continued strength of activity in the United States during the first half of the year was not generally forecast. In the June quarter of 1979, real GNP fell in the United States and, at the time, many commentators believed that this marked the commencement of a much-needed &#39;cooling off&#39; period for an economy which had clearly been operating at an unsustainable level of activity and where a reduction in inflation was highly desirable. However, the June quarter movement proved to be something of an aberration, apparently largely reflecting the temporary effects of rises in petrol prices and some shortages of petrol supplies. Expenditure continued to expand strongly in the second half of 1979 despite some tightening in economic policies, particularly monetary policy. Much of this growth was attributable to private consumption expenditure. In the face of continued declines in real disposable income, consumers borrowed heavily and the saving ratio fell to record low levels. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This situation of excess demand exacerbated the inflationary situation in the United States and in October 1979, and again in March 1980, further measures were taken to tighten economic policy. At about the latter time, and not solely as a result of the then measures, economic activity began to fall away. Preliminary estimates suggest that in the June quarter 1980 real GNP may have declined at an annual rate of around 9 per cent, primarily because of very weak private consumption expenditure. Not surprisingly, given the increases in interest rates and petroleum prices, the home building and automobile industries were hit particularly hard. The rate of unemployment rose rapidly from 6.0 per cent (seasonally adjusted) in February to 7.7 per cent in June. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">While some recent data have been a little stronger than those for the June quarter, the likely length and depth of the US recession remain highly uncertain. Some recovery in activity might be hoped for by the first half of 1981. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In Japan and West Germany, where the deterioration in price performance has been least despite their relatively heavy dependence on imported crude oil, economic activity continued to expand steadily throughout 1979-80; private business investment and exports were important elements of strength. Particularly given the subdued US economic situation expected in 1980-81, slower (but continued) growth in these two economies seems probable. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At this stage it seems unlikely that there will be much, if any, real growth in the major industrial countries taken as a whole in 1980-81, although continuing growth is expected in the developing and oil-exporting countries, many of which provide important markets for Australia. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The rate of increase in consumer price indexes is likely to ease somewhat during the course of the year (assuming there are no further large oil price increases) but deceleration in the more broadly based national accounts deflators is expected to be fairly modest. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As noted earlier, the oil price increases of the last year have resulted in a significant increase in the OPEC current account surplus (which could total around SUS110 billion in 1980) and in the counterpart current account deficits of the oil-importing nations. In the final analysis, all oil-importing countries (both developed and developing) must pay for the increased cost of oil imports by increasing their net exports of goods and services. In the short term, however, it is inevitable that oil-importing nations in general will face greatly increased current account deficits that will have to be financed by re-cycling of funds from OPEC. That process of re-cycling is expected to be carried out very largely by private financial institutions as was the case in the period following the oil crisis of 1973-74. As in that earlier period international financial institutions such as the IMF are also expected to play a role - on this occasion probably a larger one in view of the more extended external debt positions of many countries and the more pressing need for internal adjustment to the deterioration in their external circumstances. The task of financing current account deficits should be manageable, particularly for the industrial and stronger developing countries, but some of the poorer developing nations are likely to face increased difficulties. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Australia has not, of course, been insulated from the developments in the international economy over the past year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">An acceleration in world inflation inevitably affects the cost of Australian imports (and the prices of some exports), albeit with a lag. The increase in international oil prices has also been reflected in higher prices for both imported and domestically produced oil under the Government&#39;s oil pricing policy. However, in contrast to a number of other industrial countries, Australia has maintained firm anti-inflationary policies for some years now; the deterioration in Australia&#39;s rate of inflation has consequently been markedly less than in most other countries. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Australia&#39;s recent favourable trade performance is in no small measure attributable to improved international competitiveness, achieved by persistent anti-inflationary policies and supportive external policies. However, particularly given the very moderate wage settlements now evident in the United States, Japan and West Germany, these hard-won gains in competitiveness could be quickly eroded unless the recent acceleration in wages in Australia can be contained. Australia&#39;s ability to &#39;ride out&#39; the expected global slowdown will depend importantly on the success of policies in maintaining international competitiveness. </para>

          <para>Background</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As is now well documented, Australia suffered a series of major shocks in the earlier years of the 1970s which fundamentally distorted the workings of the economy. While much has happened since, the developments of that period continue to affect the performance of the economy and therefore have relevance both for an understanding of the present situation and for the design of appropriate policies for the future. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The shocks of the 1970s can be traced to a number of factors. Important among them were an inadequate domestic response to the boom in the world economy and consequent developments in the balance of payments and the money supply and, later on, a rapid expansion of the public sector following a downturn in the economy, together with an inflationary wages policy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The expansion in overseas demand in the early 1970s in conjunction with these domestic developments created intense pressure on resources, particularly labour supplies. This followed an earlier cut-back in immigration which reduced traditional supplies of skilled and unskilled labour and heightened wage pressures, particularly in a number of lower-skilled occupations dependent on migrant labour. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the consequent scramble for available labour, wage rates were bid up in an explosive manner and, for a time, large numbers of people were enticed into the workforce. Abnormally pronounced shortages of less skilled workers contributed to a squeeze on wage relativities which further aggravated overall wage pressures. Although prices also soared, profits dropped sharply. The consequence was a general collapse in business confidence, leading to a major fall in private investment and a precipitous rise in unemployment as product growth fell away and as the jump in real wages caused labour to be priced out of jobs. High real wages also encouraged marginal members of the workforce to go on searching for employment and this, combined with high welfare benefits, further swelled the unemployment statistics. Australia&#39;s international competitiveness foundered and the balance of payments deteriorated. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The attempt to revive the economy by boosting public expenditure in 1974-75 did nothing to restore the private sector and left a gaping Commonwealth deficit, higher interest rates and pressures on financial markets. To the extent that it offset lower private sector economic activity it diminished the forces which, normally in such circumstances, would have helped reduce the distortions that had been created. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As a result the economy was left saddled with excessive real wages, dangerously low profitability, high inflation and poor international competitiveness, a large public sector deficit, excessive growth in the money supply and a financial market unreceptive to the raising of capital. It was thus ill-placed to generate the growth necessary even to absorb an increasing labour force, let alone to reduce unemployment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Thereafter there commenced a slow haul back which has involved a policy of fiscal and monetary restraint directed at reducing the rate of inflation and correcting the fundamental distortions inhibiting private sector performance. As a result, there has been a gradual strengthening in private sector activity over recent years, demonstrating (if that needed to be demonstrated) that the economy can expand without significant stimulus from public sector expenditure. The strengthening in non-farm product growth in 1978-79 and particularly 1979-80 was associated with very low contributions from the public sector (see Table 4). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The basis of this economic strategy was set out in some detail in last year&#39;s Statement. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Though progress in the strengthening of economic activity has been fairly slow in the years since 1975-76, the Government&#39;s strategy has achieved considerable success in reducing distortions, and thus in restoring the <inline font-style="italic">pre-conditions</inline> needed to allow stronger growth in private sector activity on a sustained basis. Foremost has been the progress against inflation. However, as a result initially of external influences, including particularly higher oil and meat prices, price inflation in Australia has again crept upwards over the past two years. Now, with the high degree of wage indexation and the overly rapid growth in monetary aggregates, higher prices are being reflected in higher wages. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As the lift in the rate of price inflation in Australia has been well below that occurring in many overseas countries there has, nevertheless, been a continued improvement in Australia&#39;s international competitive position. This has been reflected in the strong growth in Australia&#39;s exports, particularly manufactured exports, but it has also resulted in strengthened output and investment in many traditional import-competing industries. The potentially massive growth in natural resource based investment, which is already under way and which, given appropriate economic policies, can be expected to continue throughout the 1980s, is also related to Australia&#39;s new-found competitive position. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At one level Australia&#39;s attractiveness to foreign investors and our ability to compete strongly on export markets can be explained in terms of the leap in the international price of energy (a resource which, oil apart, Australia possesses in abundance). However, while this is undoubtedly an important consideration, such an explanation fails to give due weight to the fact that Australia has been one of the few countries that have been able to sustain over an extended period an improvement in their overall competitive position through an exchange rate adjustment made effective by firm domestic fiscal and monetary policies. In short, while the existence of abundant natural resources is an important element in the strengthening recovery, the improvement in underlying economic conditions has been even more important. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Additionally, the extended period of comparative stability in public policy has reduced the uncertainty attached to private decision-making. Whereas Australia has had in place for a number of years a policy strategy which holds out the prospect of a return to a lower rate of inflation, the same can be said of few overseas countries, including those which may enjoy a similar endowment of energy resources. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Important progress has also been made in reducing, though still not rectifying, the factor price imbalance - that is, the imbalance between the return to labour and the return to capital - resulting from the sharp jump in real wages in 1974. The past year saw a further reduction in real unit labour costs; as in previous years the reduction was effected through productivity growth rather than through real labour cost adjustment. The strengthening in the demand for labour and employment growth in 1979-80 suggests that, <inline font-style="italic">in aggregate,</inline> real wages are now less of a constraint on employment growth than they were some years ago. However, the <inline font-style="italic">structure</inline> of wage rates remains a major hindrance to a more complete utilisation of available labour resources and, hence, to the capacity of the economy to grow without inducing inflationary pressures. The high wage rates required to be paid (by law) to the young and the unskilled continue to make it difficult for the unemployed among these groups to find work - although it is of interest to note that, indicative of the general strength of labour demand, the 1979 school-leavers appear to have fared better in finding work than the school-leavers of other recent years. At the other end of the labour market, margins for skill appear to be insufficient to call forth enough skilled labour to meet demand, resulting in mounting shortages of such labour in a time of expanding activity. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Corporate profitability also appears to have made some progress back towards earlier levels, although the uncertain nature of relevant national accounts estimates for recent years makes it difficult to draw precise conclusions in this area. Following the surprisingly modest increase in 1978-79 the gross operating surplus of companies rose strongly last year. The very strong growth expected in private business investment in 1980-81 - which, though centred on resource projects, is broadly based - is consistent with a private sector that expects reasonable profitability in the future. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">While the factor price imbalance has been slowly reduced, any renewed upward movement in real wages now could only increase the difficulty of employing the large numbers of people who seek jobs, including those who are not registered as unemployed. In addition, while the growth in product in recent years appears largely to reflect the growth in labour inputs rather than a growth in productivity, and while the expected strengthening in product growth in 1980- 81 is likely to be associated with continued growth in employment, businesses are still undertaking &#39;labour saving&#39; investments whenever possible. Anything more than very modest growth in real wages could thus undo a large part of the progress made to date and put at risk the prospects of further expansion in employment. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There has been some, though as yet clearly insufficient, progress in reducing the public sector&#39;s call on both real and financial resources. Both the direct call of the public sector on real resources (expenditure on goods and services) and the total of public sector outlays (which include transfer payments) have fallen moderately as proportions of GDP since the peak in 1977-78. There was in 1979-80 the first reduction in the public sector&#39;s borrowing requirement since 1976-77, due entirely to the marked decline in the Commonwealth Budget deficit. During the intervening years the public sector&#39;s continued heavy borrowing, together with the need to roll over the increasing level of past borrowings, has been an important underlying influence on the continued high level of interest rates. </para>
          <para>The Task Ahead</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Given the progress of the strategy in gradually reducing various imbalances, it might be argued that there would now be scope to pursue a somewhat more relaxed&#39; approach. However, it is clear not only that there is a need to make further progress in reducing imbalances but also that new problems are emerging which suggest that the capacity of the economy to grow without inducing inflationary pressures may still be more limited than it was in earlier years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Foremost among these is the danger that the prospective surge in private business investment and the (in some cases associated) increase in public sector infrastructure investment could result in straining the existing capacity of the economy, leading to an upsurge of wage increases and an acceleration in cost and price inflation. Skilled labour is already in short supply in many areas; and while immigration and increased training will add to available supplies, there will be pressures for higher wages to attract additional labour to expanding areas. Under Australia&#39;s centralised wage determination processes, there is a very real danger that such wage increases, however desirable they may be in themselves, could flow on into a general lift in wages. The current so-called &#39;work value&#39; round - which, notwithstanding what it purports to be, is in the process of spreading a wage increase of a fairly uniform magnitude through most of the workforce - is an indication not only of the momentum that this flow-on process can gather but also of its basic economic irrationality. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">That wage pressures have continued to mount is not open to doubt. These pressures stem both from indexation decisions which have built into the ongoing rate of wage increase the effect of the lift in prices since 1978, and from movements outside indexation, particularly in the form of &#39;work value&#39; increases which are, for the most part, nothing of the kind. These influences alone make it inevitable that the increase in wages in 1980-81 will be higher than last year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A wage system which continued to award a high degree of indexation, and to allow additional across-the-board increases on top of that, would pose significant problems during the period ahead. In several major overseas countries the acceleration in the rate of inflation has been accompanied by a more subdued rate of increase in wages, and the prospect of a downturn in the rate of inflation overseas could threaten Australia&#39;s international competitive position unless inflationary pressures in the domestic economy can be contained. This is of particular concern given that non-national wage case settlements appear to be an increasing force in the determination of overall wage levels. Some such development is not surprising; with the somewhat improved outlook for profitability, firms would naturally tend to be rather more amenable to granting wage increases. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In these circumstances, macro-economic policies - and particularly monetary policy - will need to play an even more important role in maintaining an economic environment which asserts an adequate degree of discipline upon the parties involved. As the Commonwealth pointed out in its submission in the latest national wage case, the higher the increase in wages that is awarded by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the firmer the settings of other policy instruments have to be for the consequential inflationary pressures to be contained. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The prospective surge in private business investment will also add to calls on capital markets as firms seek finance for new projects. This will be occurring at a time when the public sector will continue to have a large demand for finance, with the 1980-81 public sector borrowing requirement expected to be broadly similar to that of last year. The net result is likely to be continued pressure on domestic interest rates and increased resort to overseas sources of finance by the private sector. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The slowdown in the world economy and expected large imports of capital equipment mean that the current account deficit is likely to widen appreciably in 1980-81; such a result is, indeed, necessary if the prospective excess of domestic investment over domestic savings is to be validated. But the prospect of a significant increase in private capital inflow (including infrastructure borrowings overseas by State authorities) means that, overall, the balance of payments is likely to contribute appreciably more to domestic liquidity than it did last year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Economic prospects for the year ahead are discussed in some detail in Part III of this Statement. Without going into detail here, it is clear that we are facing potential growth prospects which, in the next few years at least, are different in kind and in magnitude from the experience of much of the 1970s. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The mainspring of that potential growth is, of course, resource-based investment. But both private consumption expenditure and government expenditure also seem set to increase more strongly in 1980-81 than in recent years, indicating that total domestic final demand should also increase more strongly. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These improved growth prospects come at a time when, notwithstanding that the grosser distortions besetting the economy throughout the 1970s have been ameliorated, important imbalances remain. In these circumstances, policy must continue to be directed towards the correction of those imbalances as well as to containing and beginning to turn back the increased inflationary pressures which have emerged during the last two years. In this regard, monetary policy will need to play an enhanced role. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The present Budget has been framed against the background of these developments and prospects. The further reduction in the Budget deficit (including for this purpose the domestic deficit) will, of itself, make an important contribution to moderating the growth in monetary aggregates. Even so, monetary policy will be operating in a more difficult environment, given that likely faster real growth in public sector outlays will be occurring at a time of faster real growth in private sector outlays; and that, in these circumstances, pressures for wage increases will be the more difficult to contain. The expected larger surplus on private sector foreign exchange transactions will place upward pressure on money supply growth, but will also provide a further opportunity for external policy to assist in containing inflationary pressures. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">With its abundant natural resources Australia has frequently been characterised as &#39;the lucky country*. But the realisation of our good fortune in those natural resource endowments will be dependent not on luck but on the intelligence with which policy is conducted. In particular, it will depend on ensuring that the settings of policy instruments are conducive to an economic environment in which downward pressure on inflation is restored and maintained and the continuing distortions which are still retarding growth are progressively removed. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">A further reduction in the Budget deficit has been a central objective in the framing of this year&#39;s Budget. Although outlays are budgeted to increase by  13.7  per cent compared with  9.1  per cent last year, it has been possible to reduce the deficit because of the estimated large growth in Budget revenue of  16.2  per cent, about the same as in  1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The reduction of  $606  million in the domestic balance - from the deficit of  $567  million in  1979-80  to a small domestic surplus - is slightly larger than the reduction of  $468  million in the overall deficit. </para>

However, calls on resources implied by the prospective rapid growth in private sector investment activity may influence to some degree the achievement of that result. </para>

This reflects the benefits, as from  1  July  1980,  of half tax indexation and increased dependant rebates, the full year effects of the removal of the tax surcharge from  1  December last, and the delayed response in tax payments of the rural sector to the levelling out in farm incomes in  1979-80. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The following assumptions and expectations, in addition to those embodied in the Budget estimates, are involved in the assessment of the outlook for the economy: o For 1980-81 as a whole, the OECD area is assumed to experience little, if any, growth in real gross domestic product, with a small fall in real product in the second half of 1980 and some sluggish recovery in the first half of 1981. (Growth in real gross domestic product for the total OECD area is estimated to have been about <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent in 1979-80, but with a significant slowing to an annual rate of about <inline font-style="italic">H</inline> per cent in the first half of 1980.) Growth is expected to continue in Japan, albeit at a somewhat slower rate than in 1979-80, while growth rates are expected to be broadly maintained in those developing and oil-exporting countries which also provide important markets for Australian exports. o It is assumed that anti-inflationary policies are maintained by the major overseas governments, leading to a gradual deceleration in the rate of price inflation in the OECD area during 1980-81. The inflation rate appears to have peaked in the middle of 1980 at close to 14 per cent per annum; and with little or no growth expected in OECD countries in 1980-81 there is likely to be downward pressure on prices (including oil prices) for much of the year. o Monetary policy in 1980-81 will be directed to reducing the growth in monetary aggregates while ensuring a supply of funds adequate for sustaining growth in activity and employment. Consistent with that objective and having in mind the Budget deficit and other formation factors, the following forecasts assume that policy instruments will be set accordingly. o In the light of statements by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and recent wage case experience, the forecasts assume that wages will continue to be adjusted in half-yearly wage indexation decisions after discounting for the direct CPI effects of policy-induced oil price rises. Increases on &#39;work value&#39; grounds have now spread through a large proportion of the workforce and further spreading is assumed to occur in 1980-81. However, it is assumed that the claim foreshadowed by the ACTU for later in 1980 on &#39;productivity&#39; grounds will not lead to any further increase in wage rates in 1980-81; clearly, the economy possesses no capacity to pay any such increase at this time. For similar reasons it is assumed that any other extra-indexation wage increases will be minimal in 1980-81 and that, in particular, the metal industries campaign for a 35-hour week will not result in any significant reduction of average working hours. o While at this stage of the year forecasts of farm production must be hazardous, the overall volume of farm production seems likely to be down a little on its level in 1979-80. Average prices may show some gains on their 1979-80 levels but, with rising production costs and a lower volume of production, it is likely that farm incomes this year will be lower than in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Listing the assumptions underlying the forecasts underscores the uncertainties in the following assessment. Any attempt to assess the future trend in the economy must recognise a fairly wide range of alternative possibilities. Assessing the likely response of the economy to changing circumstances necessarily involves a considerable measure of broad judgment. Moreover, it is as well to keep in mind that currently available statistical information is susceptible to considerable revision and in due course may prove to have provided a doubtful basis for the forecasts. Less attention should be paid to particular figures than to the broad thrust of the assessment. </para>
          <para>Expenditures</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private consumption expenditure</inline>is expected to record stronger growth in 1980-81 than in 1979-80. Data on retail sales and motor vehicle registrations suggest that consumption weakened in the June quarter following the significant gains in the preceding December and March quarters. However, there has so far in 1980 been a definite strengthening in demand from the relatively flat position that pertained over most of 1979. The general strengthening in consumption expenditure during 1979-80 occurred in the face of only a modest rise in real household disposable income of &#163; per cent following a rise of 3i per cent in the previous year. As a result, the saving ratio fell quite sharply following the rise in 1978-79. This difference between the two years reflected, in part at least, the different movements in each year in farm income, which take longer to be reflected in expenditure. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In making judgments about the propensity for consumption expenditure to be bolstered by a declining saving ratio it is useful to abstract from movements in farm income. Over the past two years, real &#39;non-farm&#39; household disposable income has risen on average by around <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> per cent per annum while private consumption expenditure has risen by around <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent per annum. As real &#39;nonfarm&#39; income is expected to show more marked growth in  1980-81  there is a prima facie basis for also expecting a faster growth in private consumption expenditure, if not commensurately faster. Continued firm growth in employment could also be expected to underpin faster growth in expenditure, as should the effects of personal income tax concessions, including the full-year effects of the removal of the tax surcharge from last December and the half indexation of the tax schedule (and increases in spouse and other rebates) from the beginning of the current financial year. Overall, growth in private consumption expenditure approaching  3  per cent would seem likely to be broadly consistent with little or no change in the &#39;non-farm&#39; saving ratio. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Private dwelling investment</inline>rose rapidly over the course of  1979-80,  lifting activity for the year as a whole by  10i  per cent above that in  1978-79.  Further, the  14  per cent increase in private dwelling approvals in  1979-80  will flow through into activity in  1980-81.  Thus, even after allowance for a slower increase in mortgage finance approvals for new dwellings in  1980-81,  activity should at least be maintained for the year as a whole. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The available expectations data point to a buoyant outlook for <inline font-style="italic">business fixed investment</inline> in  1980-81.  Chart  10  shows details of medium-term investment expectations by private enterprises derived from the survey conducted by the Statistician in April-May of each year, together with actual outcomes. If, in  1980-81,  expectations were to be realised to the same extent as in  1979-80,  real growth would be of the order of  20  per cent after allowance for the difference in scope between the business survey expectations data and the national accounts estimates (the survey data do not cover investment expenditures by the rural sector, which a ;e not expected to rise much in  1980-81).  The expectations data point to equally strong growth in plant and equipment expenditures, on the one hand, and other building and construction activity on the other, and also suggest that while strongest in basic metal products (which includes aluminium smelting), the expected growth is also substantial in other industries (see Table  19). </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">In interpreting the strength in the expected growth in investment expenditure in 1980-81 care needs to be taken to allow for the effects of the completion of the phasing down of the investment allowance from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. This contributed to the <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> per cent fall in real business fixed investment in 1979-80 following a <inline font-style="italic">9i</inline> per cent rise in 1978-79. This means that real growth in fixed investment in 1980-81 of the order indicated by the Statistician&#39;s survey would represent an average growth over the two years 1979-80 and 1980-81 of only around 6i per cent per annum - strong growth, but much less so than the 1980-81 figure taken in isolation would suggest. Even that rate of growth would still leave business fixed investment lower, as a proportion of GDP, than in the late 1960s and early 1970s (see Table 3). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There is undoubtedly reason to be cautious in projecting the likely level of investment spending in 1980-81. The apparent weakness of plant and equipment investment in the June quarter may indicate the influence of strike activity and associated cash flow constraints and, to that extent, there could be some catch-up over the course of 1980-81. On the other hand, some of the expected spending for 1980-81 relates to major new export-oriented projects where the timing of commencement and other stages of progress can be uncertain, particularly in the present world environment. Sharply increased investment demand is also likely to lead to increased difficulties in obtaining skilled labour and materials, as well as finance. In these circumstances it is unlikely that real growth will reach the 20 per cent figure referred to earlier. The forecasts assume real growth in business fixed investment of something over 10 per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As already indicated, the 1980-81 Budget and public borrowing programs imply faster real growth in <inline font-style="italic">expenditure on goods and services by the Commonwealth Government and its enterprises</inline> in 1980-81. The Government&#39;s decision to increase real defence budget outlays by 7 per cent this year will take several years to reflect fully in the national accounts estimates of expenditures, which are recorded (as public consumption) on a deliveries basis. However, deliveries of defence material and equipment already on order will boost the rate of growth in recorded public consumption expenditures in 1980-81. The concurrence of a rise in investment spending by the Budget sector and by several government enterprises is also expected to lead to significant real growth in the capital expenditures of the Commonwealth sector following a real decline of more than 20 per cent over the past two years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The level of payments to the States and local governments, together with their approved Loan Council programs and the loan programs approved for the State authorities, should support continued real growth in <inline font-style="italic">expenditure by the State and local government sector</inline> in 1980-81. The disposition of the total funds available to the States and local governments is substantially at their discretion and the mix of their expenditures between current and capital can vary appreciably from year to year. Real current expenditure in 1980-81 may rise a little more slowly than in 1979-80 when it is estimated to have risen by around 4i per cent following real growth of less than 3 per cent in 1978-79 (abstracting in both years from expenditure by the Northern Territory). Slower growth in current expenditure could permit modest real growth in capital expenditures following their <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent fall in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Overall, <inline font-style="italic">public current expenditure</inline> is expected to rise a little faster than in 1979-80 while <inline font-style="italic">public capital expenditure</inline> may show some real growth following a real fall of <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent in 1979-80. On the basis of these forecasts, total public sector expenditure would rise by about 3 per cent which would be somewhat slower than the projected rise in real non-farm product and would compare with growth of 0.8 per cent in public expenditure in 1979-80. However, because of the more rapid increase in public sector wage costs (see incomes and prices section below) the ratio of total public sector expenditure on goods and services to GDP at current prices is projected to rise slightly on its 1979-80 level of 24i per cent which compares with 24f per cent in 1978-79. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It is assumed that <inline font-style="italic">non-farm stocks</inline> are still somewhat above their desired levels, notwithstanding the slight decumulation in the second half of 1979-80, and that there will therefore be some further modest decumulation early in 1980-81 before stocks then rise broadly in line with sales. On this basis, non-farm stock movements are expected to make a small negative contribution to growth in product in 1980-81. <inline font-style="italic">Farm stocks</inline> were run down over the course of 1 979-80 as exports of farm origin ran ahead of farm product after the record season in 1978-79; that pattern is expected to be broadly repeated in 1980-81. </para>
          <para>Balance of Payments</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Little growth in real <inline font-style="italic">exports of goods and services</inline> is projected this year after the near-record <inline font-style="italic">I4i</inline> per cent increase in 1979-80. While the recession in the US economy will result in lower demand for the products of some export industries, continued growth in other major markets combined with normal lags should help reduce the overall impact on demand for our exports in 1980-81. It might be noted, for example, that over 50 per cent of our exports go to Asian and Middle Eastern countries which are among those less affected by the slowdown in world economic growth. In any event, a major constraint to export growth now appears to lie on the supply side. Many export industries operated at close to capacity in 1979-80 and further increases in export shipments may be difficult in the short run, especially as domestic demand picks up. Supply constraints are evident in rural exports where wheat shipments have been running at record levels, cattle and sheep herds have been depleted, and wool stocks are now relatively low. Supply difficulties similarly affect some non-rural exports (e.g. alumina and iron and steel) but there seems scope for growth in iron ore and coal exports if further major industrial disputes can be avoided. While manufactured exports should continue to benefit from the gains in international competitiveness that have been achieved over recent years, it seems unlikely that the strong increases of the last two years could be maintained, particularly in view of slower growth in overseas markets. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Imports of goods and services</inline>are expected to grow quite strongly in real terms in 1980-81 after a fall of 1 per cent in 1979-80. Domestic demand for importintensive plant and equipment was subdued for much of last year. Demand should grow more strongly in 1980-81 given the expected pick-up in expenditure on major resource development projects and plant and equipment investment in particular. Large deliveries in defence equipment ordered in earlier years will add to the growth in imports. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The combination of slowing overseas demand and a strengthening domestic economy suggests that <inline font-style="italic">net exports</inline> will detract from GDP growth in 1980-81 in contrast to the large contribution which they provided last year. Meanwhile, the terms of trade are expected to move adversely again in 1980-81 as export prices decelerate more rapidly than import prices. These expected developments suggest a lower trade surplus and, after allowance for continued growth in the net invisibles deficit, a larger - though still relatively moderate - current account deficit. This larger deficit will not, as in earlier years, reflect a loss of competitiveness but rather will provide a needed supplement to the supplies available to a strengthening domestic economy. As noted earlier this is essential if the prospective excess of domestic investment over domestic savings is to be validated. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The fall in <inline font-style="italic">net apparent private capital inflow</inline> in 1979-80 reflected the effects of interest differentials favouring, for much of the year, borrowing in Australia. There were also large net trade credit outflows associated with the record trade surplus. These factors tended to disguise a gathering strengthening in longer-run overseas investment in Australia, particularly in resource projects and related manufacturing industries. This trend is expected to accelerate in 1980-81 as the plans for several major projects begin to come to fruition. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The overall corporate sector borrowing requirement is also expected to rise substantially.  A  sizeable proportion of the required funds is likely to be sought overseas - the precise amount depending <inline font-style="italic">inter alia</inline> on the relative attractiveness of overseas interest rates. Overseas borrowings by State semi-government authorities, which in line with their domestic money formation effects are regarded for balance of payments purposes as private capital inflows, are also expected to be greater than in  1979-80.  While as always there are considerable uncertainties, the forecast increase in the current account deficit seems likely to be largely offset by higher private capital inflow this year. </para>
          <para>Monetary Conditions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government&#39;s aim in 1980-81 will be to secure a smaller increase in the growth of monetary aggregates than in 1979-80 and it has indicated that an outcome for growth in M3 of about 9 to 11 per cent over the course of 1980-81 would be consistent with that. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">M3 is not, of course, the only available measure of the money supply and cannot alone provide a comprehensive indication of monetary developments. As noted in Part I of this Statement, more broadly defined measures of the volume of money have shown faster growth than M3 in recent years. For policy purposes it will remain necessary to monitor the whole range of monetary aggregates and indicators. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The further reduction in the <inline font-style="italic">Budget domestic deficit</inline> from $567 million in 1979-80 to an estimated <inline font-style="italic">surplus</inline> of $39 million this year, together with a minimal liquidity impact from Rural Credits advances for wheat during 1980-81, will assist in achieving the monetary objective. At the same time, however, the balance of payments outlook implies a surplus on <inline font-style="italic">private external account</inline> that would add appreciably more to domestic liquidity in 1980-81 than last year. While the outcome there will depend importantly on conditions in overseas and domestic financial markets and on inflation trends, prospective developments in net borrowing and lending by the major sectors in the economy give weight to assessments that overseas borrowings by the private sector will be considerably higher in  1980-81. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The approved Loan Council programs for Commonwealth and State authorities, including the approved infrastructure borrowing program, together with the estimated borrowings by &#39;smaller&#39; authorities are expected to total around $2800 million this year compared with actual borrowings of $2481 million in 1979-80. </para>
        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Having in mind the Government&#39;s own reduced Budget deficit and other relevant considerations, a <inline font-style="italic">public sector borrowing requirement</inline> broadly similar to that in 1979-80 seems likely. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At the same time, the <inline font-style="italic">corporate sector borrowing requirement</inline> is expected to rise significantly in 1980-81; the need for increased funds will come primarily from the expected strong rise in investment spending at a time when the large increase in company tax payments is holding down corporate sector cash flow. Households provide the major source of domestic net lending and, with the growth in disposable incomes rising, 1980-81 could see an increase in the net supply of funds from that sector. So far as can be seen, however, that would be unlikely to match the net increase in the combined borrowing requirements of the public and corporate sectors, thus implying a requirement for increased capital inflow from abroad. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under these circumstances, there will be less scope for growth in other elements of the money supply if the overall growth in M3 is to be appropriate. This, in turn, will require that settings of policy instruments are related to such an outcome. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Depending on the outcome of other elements in monetary growth, there could again be a requirement for a sizeable net non-bank take-up of government securities in 1980-81. In addition there will also be a need to roll over the large volume of Commonwealth debt maturing this year; the $2554 million of Treasury bonds maturing in 1980-81 compares with $1073 million in 1979-80. </para>
          <para>Product</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1980-81 the main source of growth is expected to be from final domestic demand; indeed, as noted above, it is likely that net exports and changes in nonfarm stocks will detract from growth in product this year. This contrasts with last year&#39;s experience, when the external sector, along with net non-farm stock accumulation, provided the major stimulus to domestic economic activity during the first half of the year and, to a lesser degree, for the year as a whole. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Overall, the outlook for the expenditure components implies growth in <inline font-style="italic">non- farm product</inline> of <inline font-style="italic">3i</inline> per cent or more in 1980-81 following the recorded growth of 3 per cent in 1979-80. Because of the projected decline in <inline font-style="italic">farm product,</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">gross domestic product</inline> is forecast to rise by 3 per cent or more this financial year following recorded growth of 2i per cent last year. </para>
          <para>Labour Market</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The forecasts imply a rate of growth in non-farm product over the course of 1980-81 similar to that for last year. There thus seems no reason to expect employment growth to slacken in the year ahead. The Budget estimates for  PA YE  tax collections assume that wage and salary earner employment will rise at about the same rate as last year, that is by If per cent. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The evidence of the past year suggests that increasing demand for labour is, in current circumstances, most likely to be met from the on-going growth in the labour force, including some rise in the participation rate, with little if any decline in overall unemployment. The Budget estimates allow for an average number of unemployment benefit recipients in 1980-81 slightly smaller than in 1979-80. This would be consistent with the experience in 1979-80, when the strong rise in employment was associated with only a modest decline in the average level of unemployment for the year as a whole and an end-year level of unemployment little changed from that of a year earlier. As noted in Part I, the prospect of worthwhile early reductions from present levels of unemployment, particularly for the unskilled, remains inextricably bound up with the present inappropriate structure of wage rates which has been brought about by the workings of our machinery of wage determination. </para>
          <para>Incomes and Prices</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under the policy, including wage determination, assumptions already outlined, <inline font-style="italic">award wages</inline> are projected to rise by Hi per cent in 1980-81 following estimated increases of <inline font-style="italic">St</inline> per cent in 1979-80 and 64 per cent in 1978-79. This acceleration in wage rates is substantially a reflection of larger national wage increases and the assumed spread of &#39;work value&#39; increases. The corresponding forecasts for <inline font-style="italic">average weekly earnings</inline> on a male unit basis, which underlie the Budget estimates for PAYE tax collections, are for a rise of 12 per cent in 1980-81 following rises of 9i per cent in 1979-80 and 71 per cent in 1978-79. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">While this projected acceleration in wages must be viewed with concern, a lower forecast could only be derived from an assumption that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission will bring down more economically rational awards than it has in the past. Experience suggests that such an assumption would be unrealistic. This is not, of course, to overlook the important role that fiscal and monetary policy settings play in determining whether or not the economic environment is conducive to wage restraint. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The <inline font-style="italic">consumer price index</inline> is projected to rise in 1980-81 as a whole at about the same rate as or slightly faster than the increase of 10 per cent in 1979-80. The assumption that, in contrast to the experience of the past two years, pressures for further OPEC oil price rises are likely to be constrained by the slowdown in economic activity in OECD countries should, if fulfilled, help to moderate the rate of increase in the CPI. Similarly, food prices, which contributed 2.6 percentage points to the rise in the CPI in 1979-80, are assumed to rise more in line with other consumer prices in 1980-81. However, pressures for sharper increases in prices during 1980 will arise from the acceleration in wage costs in 1979-80 and the direct and indirect effects of oil price rises already implemented by OPEC. The containment of such pressures will depend importantly on the thrust of monetary policy. Even with lower monetary growth, in the absence of an early moderation in wage awards, it will take time to return the rate of inflation to a firm downward path. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">With the acceleration in wage costs that is projected for 1980-81, it is likely that the <inline font-style="italic">implicit deflator for public consumption expenditures,</inline> which has a high wage content and which makes little allowance for productivity growth, will accelerate in 1980-81. On the other hand, the <inline font-style="italic">public</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">private business fixed investment</inline> deflators are expected to rise at much the same rate as in 1979-80. Higher materials and transport costs, and an apparent move towards restoration of profit margins, led to a noticeable acceleration in building and construction costs over the past year. The rise in costs of materials, particularly oil, is expected to moderate a little but an acceleration in wage costs and rising activity levels will continue to exert upward price pressures in the coming year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Overall, the acceleration in the public and private consumption deflators and the projected shift in the composition of domestic demand (with stronger growth in private consumption and business fixed investment) are expected to lead to a somewhat faster rise in the <inline font-style="italic">non-farm product deflator</inline> in 1980-81 of around 10&#177; per cent compared with 9i per cent in 1979-80. Because of the expected deceleration in the rate of increase in farm prices, the <inline font-style="italic">gross domestic product deflator</inline> could rise at much the same rate as in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The forecasts imply a faster rise in wages than in prices. Containment of the rate of increase in prices will thus depend importantly on the extent to which the growth in monetary aggregates is lowered and on the scope available to businesses to absorb higher wage costs. The overall forecasts for wages, prices, activity and employment imply little change in the share of (before-tax) profits in non-farm product at factor cost from their present still inappropriate levels. However, given the expected faster increase in company tax payments in 1980-81, there could be a fall in the after-tax profit share. </para>
          <para>Overview</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The year ahead holds considerable promise for the Australian economy, notwithstanding the uncertain world outlook. That promise is importantly based on the improved medium-term demand for many of our exports arising from the improvement in our international competitive position, including that stemming from the increase in the relative price of energy. Improved competitiveness is also benefiting import-competing industries. A deeper, more generalised and more prolonged world recession than presently seems in prospect would, of course, have a greater impact on our economy beyond 1980-81 and uncertainties in that regard may postpone or slow down the rate of implementation of some of the major resource development projects already in prospect. Some degree of delay, which is implicit in the discounting of the investment expectations noted above, may not be altogether a bad thing; too rapid a rise in domestic economic activity could quite quickly run up against sectoral capacity constraints and thus generate increased inflationary pressures. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The greatest danger for 1980-81 is, indeed, that the acceleration in wages now in progress will generate a new momentum in domestic wage and price inflation that would undermine the prospective strong growth in activity. Any acceleration in inflation coming at a time when overseas inflation is decelerating would weaken our international competitive position and, in due course, depress the rate of growth of domestic economic activity. Wage increases below those being projected would, of course, enable a more rapid deceleration in the rate of inflation to the benefit of the whole community. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">What is required is a continued policy thrust designed to restore a downward trend to the rate of inflation and, by so doing, consolidate and build upon the hard won progress made over the past several years in restoring the productive capacity of the economy. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Earlier this year the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence announced decisions taken by the Government on measures to significantly increase Australia&#39;s defence preparedness in the light of changing strategic prospects. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In keeping with the Government&#39;s policy, the outlays on Defence of $3541.4 million provided for in this Budget represent a real increase of at least 7 per cent over defence outlays in 1979-80 compared with last year&#39;s actual real increase of about 3 per cent. The financial guidance for Defence planning purposes provides for an average annual increase in defence outlays of about 7 per cent in real terms during the current five-year program, 1980-81 to 1984-85, estimated to bring them to around 3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product compared with a figure of around 2.6 per cent for 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimate of $3541.4 million for Defence outlays is generally in April 1980 prices but it does allow for the effects of the July National Wage Decision and also includes a bulk provision of $110 million for prospective increases in wages and salaries of service and civilian defence personnel during 1980-81; provision for other price increases in 1980-81 will, as appropriate, be made in Additional Estimates later in the year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The current estimate of Defence outlays represents 9.8 per cent of estimated total Budget outlays in 1980-81. Outstanding commitments on orders placed, mainly capital items, to be carried over to 1981-82 and later years are estimated to be $2288.2 million compared with $1731.1 million carried into 1980-81. </para>
          <para>Manpower Costs</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This category provides for the bulk of service and civilian manpower costs of the Department of Defence. The costs of the remaining elements of defence manpower are recorded under the categories Defence Science and Technology, Natural Disasters Organisation, Defence Co-operation and Naval Construction. Net manpower costs associated with the defence-related activities of the Department of Productivity are recorded in the category &#39;Maintenance of Production Capacity&#39;. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The net increase of $141.8 million in 1980-81 mainly reflects the effects of the December 1979 and July 1980 National Wage Case decisions ($74.0 million), increases in manpower ($14.1 million) and increased provision for defence force retirement and death benefits ($27.5 million). Increases in allowances, particularly overseas allowances, which occurred in 1979-80 have also had an effect. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimates provide for service manpower increases of 1580 over the 30 June 1980 target, which will raise the permanent force strength at 30 June 1981 to 72 591. These increases are primarily intended to enable new equipment coming into service to be adequately manned, to support increased activities such as base porting at HMAS Stirling and an increased P3C aircraft surveillance effort, and to bring the Army Operational Deployment Force at Townsville close to full strength. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Provision has also been made for the estimated $8.4 million cost of bringing the effective strength of the Army Reserve from about 22 500 at 1 July 1980 to 30 000 by 30 June 1981. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A target of an additional 1000 regular servicemen per year over the period 1981-82 to 1984-85 has been set to meet the need to man additional equipment and to intensify training. Increased civilian manpower is also proposed, both to support the Services directly and in munitions factories and dockyards. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The total civilian staff ceiling for the Department of Defence has been set at 30 990 at 30 June 1981, an increase of 450 on the 30 June 1980 ceiling. The increase is, in the main, related to tasks arising from the Government&#39;s initiatives to enhance defence preparedness, e.g. project activities, technical services, repairs and maintenance and support for the Reserves. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main factors in the increase of $27.5 million in the provision for defence force retirement and death benefits are the annual update in pension rates in July 1980 (estimated to cost $13.7 million) in line with the increase in the Consumer Price Index of 10.5 per cent over the year to the March Quarter 1980 and a projected net increase of 1427 in the pensioner population. </para>
          <para>Defence Equipment and Stores</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on defence equipment and stores are intended to ensure that operational equipment (ships, aircraft, armour, artillery, etc.) is adequate to support the selective increase in operational activity and enhance the capacity for expansion. Outlays on &#39;capital&#39; type equipment in 1980-81 are estimated at $611.3 million or $120.8 million more than in 1979-80; outstanding commitments on capital items to be carried over to 1981-82 and later years are estimated to be $1324.0 million compared with $985.9 million carried into 1980-81. Outlays on capital equipment are planned to rise to over 25 per cent of total Defence outlays in 1984-85. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Government&#39;s decision to accelerate its program to upgrade and enhance Australia&#39;s defence capability will not significantly change the course of development of the force structure which had been planned for later in the decade. Rather it will bring forward items previously scheduled for later acquisition and result, in some cases, in increasing the numbers of items proposed for acquisition within a given time. Action is already under way to acquire two additional Sea King Helicopters to replace recent losses, to order further Mark 48 submarinelaunched torpedoes and to fit a close-in weapon system to the third patrol frigate. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Other decisions on capabilities and equipments for procurement which are provided for in this Budget include a second fleet underway replenishment ship, additional patrol craft, medium general service trucks for the Army, medium range artillery, and the design and construction in Australia of prototype minehunter catamarans. The existing vessels are planned for retirement in 1983. A decision is expected to be made this year on what capability might replace the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne and on the design and development in Australia of a new basic training aircraft. Early consideration will also be given to the replacement for the River Class destroyer escorts which it is assessed will be approaching the end of their cost-effective life by the end of the decade. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Amongst the further capabilities and equipments which are now included in the program for decision in the five year period are a new tactical fighter on which a decision will be made shortly and which will involve the purchase of 75 aircraft, an aerial refuelling capability for the tactical fighter aircraft, enhanced capabilities of air defence systems, and an additional hydrographic ship. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Significant components of the estimated outlays in 1980-81 for previously approved equipments are $165 million in progress payments for the four FFG-7 patrol frigates, two of which are scheduled for delivery by the end of 1981; $27 million for fast patrol craft; $18 million for the first fleet underway replenishment ship (AOR1); and $23 million for torpedoes. In addition, $25 million is provided for refurbishment of Mirage and Macchi aircraft. The reduction in expenditure on armoured and combat vehicles and artillery mainly reflects substantial completion of the Leopard tank project. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on supporting equipment and stores such as fuel, ammunition, rations, clothing, etc. for the maintenance of the. Defence Force is estimated to increase by $47.4 million. This mainly reflects changed prices and exchange rates (costing $11 million for fuel alone), increased patrol activity by the Navy and Air Force in the Indian Ocean, manpower growth, and a continuing build-up in stockholdings, including $11 million for increased fuel stockholdings. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on repairs and maintenance of ships, aircraft, vehicles, weapons and equipment are estimated to increase by $17.1 million in 1980-81. This increase is due to higher costs and increased repair activities generally, including the cost of maintaining the sophisticated equipments that have come into service in recent years. </para>
          <para>Defence Facilities</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure under this heading is to provide and maintain facilities, including living and working accommodation, for the Defence Force and Department of Defence (other than for Industrial Capacity and Defence Science and Technology). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">No provision is made for advances to the States for the construction of houses for servicemen pending the final determination of future arrangements for Service housing. The 1980-81 allocation of $1.8 million is for upgrading of older dwellings to contemporary standards. Provision is made, however, in &#39;Other Buildings, Works, Furniture and Fittings&#39; for the construction of some 250 houses at Service establishments and in areas where rental accommodation is not readily obtainable, and in &#39;Acquisition of Sites and Buildings&#39; for the acquisition of some 200 houses from private sources. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on &#39;Other Buildings, Works, Furniture and Fittings&#39; are estimated to increase by about 50 per cent in 1980-81. The major part ($91.0 million) of the provision is to meet progress payments on projects committed in earlier years. These include provision for modernisation of facilities at Garden Island Dockyard (NSW), construction of naval patrol boat bases at Cairns (Queensland) and Darwin (NT), the Army schools complex at Bonegilla (Victoria), further work on development of Enoggera Army base (Queensland) and the Pearce Air Force base (WA), and further progress towards the completion of the redevelopment of facilities at Edinburgh (SA) for operation of long range maritime patrol aircraft. Expenditure on new defence works projects in 1980-81 is estimated at $17.7 million or 15.4 per cent of the provision; significant new commencements include provision of additional fuel storage capacity at Navy and Air Force bases, the first stage of the modernisation of Garden Island Dockyard (NSW), further stages in the development of Williamstown Naval Dockyard (Victoria), Army establishments at Randwick (NSW) and Holsworthy (NSW) and RAAF Operational Command Headquarters at Glenbrook (NSW), and the construction of the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated 13.7 per cent increase in 1980-81 expenditure on repairs and maintenance of facilities reflects increased costs and an additional provision to further reduce a backlog of essential repairs and maintenance tasks. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Among the major proposals for development of defence facilities over the period to 1984-85 are continued development of HMAS Stirling (WA) and other defence bases, further stages in the modernisation of Garden Island Dockyard (NSW), provision of facilities for the new tactical fighter force, development of Learmonth and Derby airfields (WA), and the redevelopment of the Armoured Centre at Puckapunyal (Victoria) for the Army. Outstanding commitments to be carried over to 1981-82 and later years are estimated to be 1258.6 million compared with $154.4 million carried into 1980-81. </para>
          <para>Industrial Capacity</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure under this heading primarily concerns the retention and continuing use, in Government aircraft and munitions factories and related private sector industries, of production capabilities and skills which are regarded as essential for the manufacture or support of defence materiel and equipment but which cannot be fully used in peace-time, the subsidisation of continuing production of Nomad aircraft (of which 109 aircraft of the approved production run of 145 aircraft had been completed at 30 June 1980), the procurement of plant and machinery to maintain or upgrade industry capabilities, and the construction, modernisation and repair of buildings and works. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This item also provides for the purchase or manufacture of items of essential defence materiel for reserve stock holding, the development of production techniques and new production items in Government factories and in industry, and special projects such as rationalisation of the defence aircraft industry at Fishermens Bend (Victoria) and Bankstown (NSW) and upgrading facilities to allow Australian participation in manufacture of parts for the Boeing 757 aircraft. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The provision of additional capacity and modernisation of existing defence production facilities in the Government Munitions and Aircraft Factories and in industry will require generally higher expenditure over the period to 1984-85. </para>
          <para>Defence Science and Technology</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on defence science and technology has as its objective assisting the Services to keep abreast of advances in defence technology and developing weapons and weapon systems suited to Australia&#39;s defence needs. The estimated expenditure of $110.3 million in 1980-81 covers salaries, other administrative and operating expenses, machinery, plant, stores and works services of the defence science establishments and laboratories. Considerable effort is being devoted to activities such as the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar, underwater detection techniques, electronic warfare techniques, and modernisation of the Ikara antisubmarine guidance weapons system. A considerable increase is proposed in the number of research and development projects to be contracted to Australian industry and universities. The net increase of $11.5 million reflects effects of price and wage increases and increased activity- on a wide range of projects. </para>
        <para class="block">Defence Co-operation </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Through defence co-operation the Government seeks to help friendly countries in the region to strengthen their own and therefore the region&#39;s defence capacity. Estimated expenditure of $38.7 million in 1980-81 includes an increase to $15.4 million in the provision for defence co-operation activities with Papua New Guinea in 1980-81, which provides for new equipment and increased training and study visits. At the same time the provision for manpower and support costs of Australian servicemen in Papua New Guinea has been reduced in line with the continuing localisation of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. Current equipment projects include provision of Nomad aircraft, communications equipment and other miscellaneous equipments. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Provision is made for Indonesia to receive $11.9 million in assistance. This will be used for such purposes as survey and mapping work in Maluku Province (the Moluccas), provision of Nomad aircraft, maintenance of C130 aircraft, and training in support, maintenance and communication skills. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Continuing assistance is provided for Malaysia ($4.7 million) and Singapore ($1.0 million). Bilateral programs with these two countries place emphasis on training assistance and combined exercises rather than materiel assistance. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A large part of the allocation for &#39;Other&#39; is devoted to the development of a co-operative relationship in defence matters with countries of the South West Pacific. Increased provision is also made for military assistance, primarily visits, training and occasional exercises to the Philippines and Thailand.. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A gradual increase in expenditure on defence co-operation is planned to continue over the program period, and will mainly take the form of increasing the amount of specialised training of servicemen from other countries in Australia. </para>
          <para>Storage and Transport Services</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The item provides for general storage and shipping services for defence and for removals and storage of furniture for servicemen and civilians, and their families, on reposting or transfer. The increase of $1.0 million reflects price and wage increases, and an increase in the estimated number of removals. </para>
          <para>General Administrative Expenditure</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This category covers a range of items relating to service and general defence civilian functions, and includes rent, travel, office requisites, postage and telephones, fuel, light, power and water, freight, compensation payments and medical and dental services. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Also included here is the Adult Migrant and Refugee Education Program, under which $28.0 million will be available in 1980-81 for initial settlement orientation and for &#39;on-arrival&#39; and on-going English language training needs of adult migrants and refugees. This provision covers the salaries of English language instructors as well as living allowances for adults attending full-time courses. The increase of $4.7 million (20 per cent) reflects the higher provision for enrolments (120 000 in 1980-81 compared with 115 000 in 1979-80) as the three-year program of upgrading and expanding English language instruction courses for migrants, recommended by the Review of Post-Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants (Galbally Report), progresses into its third year. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Under this scheme assistance is provided by way of living allowances and other benefits for the schooling, tertiary education and training of children of veterans who died as a result of war service or who are either blind or totally and permanently incapacitated. Benefits are generally free of nieans test although a student&#39;s own earnings may be taken into account. The cost of the scheme in 1980-81 is estimated at $2.5 million, compared to $2.6 million in 1979-80; the number of beneficiaries is projected to decline slightly (to 2045). The Government has decided to increase allowances for secondary students from the beginning of 1981. Living allowances for tertiary students are generally increased in line with movements in allowances under TEAS. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">This scheme assists families whose homes are remote from normal daily access to government schools by providing basic boarding or correspondence school allowances free of means test, together with additional means-tested benefits that include allowances to cover establishment of a second home near to school and to cover cases of special financial hardship. From the beginning of 1981, most allowances will increase by 20 per cent; the new basic, special supplementary and additional boarding allowances will be $600, $660 and $600 respectively; the new single basic correspondence allowance will be $500 with the existing reimburseable component being absorbed in that increased amount; the second home allowance will be from $600 to $1530. From the beginning of 1981, the scheme will also be extended to cover children regarded as isolated for reasons of medical and social disability. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It is estimated that the scheme will cost $14.3 million in 1980-81 ($12.2 million in 1979-80) and that assistance will be provided in respect of 20 500 children (19 000 at present). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">General administrative and other expenditure of the Department of Education and the Commonwealth Teaching Service is estimated at $25.0 million in 1980-81, of which $19.1 million is for wages and salaries.

Tuberculosis allowees are also eligible for PHB Cards. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Currently, a disability pension paid to a veteran is regarded as income for the purposes of the PHB income test. The Government has decided that, from 1 January 1981, 50 per cent of any disability pension- received by a service pensioner will be excluded from the PHB income test. This extension of eligibility is estimated to add $0.4 million to outlays by the Department of Health in 1980-81 and $1.0 million in a full year and $2.5 million to outlays by the Department of Veterans&#39; Affairs in 1980-81 and $3.8 million in a full year. </para>

In respect of the rest of the population (including the balance of eligible pensioners and dependants), registered medical benefits organisations act as agents for the Commonwealth and pay Commonwealth medical benefits. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on Commonwealth medical benefits are estimated to increase by $60.0 million in 1980-81 to $681.0 million. The increase comprises:  a part year increase of $43 million ($85 million for a full year) resulting from an average increase in Schedule fees of 9.7 per cent from 1 November 1980;  $9 million reflecting the net effect of changes in the level of medical benefits from 1 September 1979, the increase in Commonwealth medical benefits arising from the Schedule fee increases applying from 1 November 1979 and 1 January 1980 for medical and optometrical services respectively and the 1 November 1979 extension of eligibility for Pensioner Health Benefit entitlements;  $7 million ($11 million for a full year) resulting from decisions, as announced in the Budget Speech, to extend eligibility for PHB Cards from November 1980 to eligible sickness beneficiaries and to eligible supporting parents during the first six months of sole parenthood, and from 1 January 1981 to veterans in receipt of disability pensions who qualify under a liberalised income test; and  $1 million ($3 million for a full year) for the estimated cost of extending the Medical Benefits Schedule from 1 January 1981 to include items associated with orthodontic treatment required by children with cleft lip and cleft palate conditions. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth meets the costs for eligible persons of specialist, local medical officer, paramedical and dental services, the provision and maintenance of surgical aids and travelling expenses incurred in obtaining medical treatment. The increase of $9.1 million arises from increased fees for professional services, an increase in demand for treatment, and the Government&#39;s decision to extend eligibility for free treatment of disabilities not related to service to Australian mariners who were prisoners of war and to all veterans who have suffered servicerelated amputations or loss of vision. </para>

Payments in 1980-81 are estimated to increase by $152.8 million to $1291.9 million;  meets half the approved net operating costs of &#39;recognised&#39; hospitals in the Australian Capital Territory under arrangements similar to the Agreements with the States. Payments in 1980-81 are estimated to increase by $2.3 million to $24.2 million. (The other half of approved net operating costs is met from the provision under the appropriation for the Capital Territory Health Commission); and  makes payments to private hospitals of $16 a day for each occupied bed. Payments in 1980-81 are estimated to increase by $1.3 million to $71.0 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Hospital net operating costs represent the aggregate residual operating deficits of &#39;recognised&#39; hospitals after patient fees and other hospital revenues have been taken into account. Commonwealth payments in 1979-80 were on the basis of maintaining the overall level of hospital services at their 30 June 1979 level. Estimated payments in 1980-81 are again designed to maintain the same overall level of services as in 1979-80. Charges for insured inpatients are to remain at $50 a day for shared-room accommodation, and $75 a day for single-room accommodation. Eligible residents without hospital insurance will continue to be entitled to free hospital-provided treatment and services without means test in public hospitals. The Budget estimates provide for escalation due to price and wage increases, including prospective increases to 30 June 1981, except for the ACT for which the provision is based on current prices. The estimates also provide for some increase in the proportion of uninsured inpatients following the trend perceived by hospitals in 1979-80. The estimates include an amount of $7.5 million related to previous years&#39; hospital expenditures. After adjustment for this amount, Commonwealth expenditure for &#39;recognised&#39; hospitals will increase by an estimated 12.0 per cent in 1980-81. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Hospital Agreements with the States and the Northern Territory are to be varied to allow charges to be levied in respect of nursing-home type patients in &#39;recognised&#39; hospitals as provided in the <inline font-style="italic">Health Insurance Act</inline> 1973 - as follows :  where the patient is not a hospital insured person, the charge will be the patient contribution being paid by nursing-home patients in State Government homes in the relevant State; or  where the patient is a hospital insured person and/or private patient, the charge will be the total of the patient contribution and the Commonwealth nursing-home benefit payable in the relevant State. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Concurrent with the introduction of the above arrangements, insured nursinghome type patients in private hospitals will be required to pay, as part of their fees, an amount equal to the statutory nursing-home patient contribution, which will be uninsurable. Hospital benefits will be payable, but the benefit level could be reduced if the fee payable by the patient is less than the benefit plus the patient contribution. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Hospital Agreements with four States (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia) and the Northern Territory are presently on the basis of annual extension until the Commission of Inquiry into Hospital Efficiency and Administration has reported and decisions have been taken on its report. Agreements with South Australia and Tasmania run until 30 June 1985. The Commission of Inquiry has among its terms of reference the question of existing and possible Commonwealth-State arrangements for meeting hospital operating costs. The Inquiry, which brought down an interim report in early July 1980, is expected to submit its final report by 31 December 1980. </para>
          <para>Hospital Benefits Reinsurance Trust Fund</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">National Health Act</inline> 1973, the Commonwealth subsidises private health funds by sharing deficits that arise in reinsurance accounts required to be maintained by registered hospital insurance organisations. The deficits occur from paying benefits to high risk and chronically ill members. Reflecting the Government&#39;s earlier announced decision to increase its contribution to the Fund by $75 million a year from 1 August 1980, the Commonwealth&#39;s contribution to the Fund in 1980-81 will be $117 million, $67 million higher than in 1979-80. The amount for 1980-81 makes provision for advance payments of 50 per cent of the Commonwealth contribution each quarter. Unspent balances of $2.4 million at 30 June 1979 were applied during 1979-80. </para>
          <para>Other Hospital Benefits</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure on other hospital benefits is estimated at $0.6 million compared with $2.6 million in 1979-80 and $6.8 million in 1978-79. The decrease is mainly attributable to the abolition on 1 November 1978 of the subsidy payable to registered health insurance organisations in respect of the contribution rates for basic &#39;hospital only&#39; insurance. Almost the whole of the estimated expenditure in 1980-81 represents residual hospital insurance subsidy payments. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Hospitals and clinics are maintained in each State for the treatment of eligible veterans and their dependants; to a limited extent repatriation hospitals also treat non-repatriation patients, while some use is made of private and State public hospitals for repatriation patients where this is appropriate. The estimated increase of $6.5 million in 1980-81 reflects higher wages and salaries and operational costs associated with the running of repatriation institutions. </para>

These increases reflect a 10 per cent increase in bed days for which benefits are paid and a 20 per cent increase in bed days in those nursing homes whose deficits are met, the effects of higher benefits, and an allowance for cost increases. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There are indications that the supply of nursing home beds will further increase substantially in 1981-82, mainly as a result of the greater availability of funds provided under the <inline font-style="italic">Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act</inline> 1954, but that the rate of increase will slow in 1982-83. </para>

Such pensions are paid at rates varying with the assessed degree of the particular veteran&#39;s incapacity. When the death of a veteran has been accepted as related to his service, his widow qualifies for the war widow&#39;s rate of pension and for associated benefits, while his children each receive pensions at &#39;orphan&#39; rates and other benefits. If a veteran&#39;s death has not been accepted as related to service but at the time of death he was receiving, or is later adjudged to have been eligible to receive, a pension at the Special Rate or as a double amputee, his dependants qualify for pensions as if his death had been accepted as related to service.

Currently a veteran may only be considered temporarily totally incapacitated if he has been hospitalised or receiving treatment for three months or is likely to be incapacitated for three months.

The effect on expenditure of this estimated decline in numbers is more than offset by the full year effects of increased rates of benefits introduced in 1979-80 and the increase in benefit rates in November 1980 and the expected increase in May 1981 in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index. </para>

If the permanent incapacity or blindness occurred outside Australia, the residence qualification is the same as for an age pension. Invalid pensioners are eligible for the same additional payments as are age pensioners and the rates of payment are the same.

        <para pgwide="yes">The current Wheat Marketing Plan covers the five crop seasons 1979-80 to 1983-84 and involves a number of revisions to the successive Wheat Industry Stabilization Schemes that have operated since 1948. Under the new Plan, the Commonwealth guarantees a minimum pool return equal to 95 per cent of the average of estimated returns from the subject pool and the two previous pools. Growers receive a first advance payment on delivery of their wheat to the Australian Wheat Board equal to the new guaranteed minimum price. Those first advance payments are financed by funds provided by the Reserve Bank, under Commonwealth guarantee, and/or by borrowings from commercial sources. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The $80 million standing to the credit of the Wheat Stabilization Fund established under the previous Stabilization Scheme has been paid into a new Industry Finance Fund, which receives also the proceeds of a special $2.50 per tonne levy on wheat deliveries to the Board. When this new Fund reaches the prescribed maximum balance of $100 million, further levy receipts and interest earnings lead to returns to growers on a first-in-first-out basis. Total fund receipts in 1980-81 are estimated at $76.7 million, comprising $38.5 million from the financing levy on the 1979-80 pool, $30 million from the stabilization levy on the 1978-79 pool, and $8.2 million in interest earnings. This would top the Fund up to the $100 . million maximum, and leave $56.7 million available for distribution to growers. Moneys in the Fund are available, together with commerical borrowings as necessary, to refinance Reserve Bank borrowings at the time such borrowings are due for repayment. </para>

Following the sharp increase in world sugar market prices in early 1980, Australian holdings of special ISA stocks were released for sale, and the IMF required repurchase on 21 May 1980 of the Commonwealth drawing. Due to changes in the exchange rate for the $A, the repurchase obligation is $27.4 million. Since it will take some months for the local industry to finalise receipts from the sale of its special stocks, the Commonwealth has agreed to defer for six months the reimbursement due from Queensland. </para>

This is a reduction of $13.7 million on 1979-80 expenditures and mainly reflects improved returns, especially on the domestic market, and some reduction in exports to lower price markets. As in the 1979-80 season, underwriting in the 1980-81 season will apply to total production of the relevant products.

This rebate, which is tax-exempt, is conditional upon the employer not reducing the number of later year apprentices in his employment except through the normal completion of their indentures. Payments under this scheme can be expected to be made in 1980-81. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The $13.8 million increase in the 1980-81 provision for CRAFT reflects an expected increase in the number of apprentice days funded under the Technical Education Rebate and payments in 1980-81 of the CRAFT $1000 rebate together with the full year effect of 1979-80 increases in rebates and allowances. In 1980-81 technical education rebate claims, the major component of expenditure under the scheme, are expected to be paid for about 80 000 apprentices - the same number as in 1979-80.

Schemes have also been developed to overcome chronic shortages in particular skills where these have aiisen, such as shortages for welders, boiler makers, electrical tradesmen and fitters. The costs associated with adult trade training encompassed within these schemes, estimated at $1.5 million in 1980-81, are met from the NEAT allocation. </para>

The net population gain from overseas migration was about 60 000 in 1978-79 and 77 000 in 1979- 80; the expected gross intake of migrants in 1980-81 is 95 000, and is estimated to lead to a net population gain of over 80 000 and to bring the total net population gain over the triennium 1978-1979 to 1980-81 to about 220 000 persons. Pending a review during 1980-81 of migration requirements, the target for the triennium 1980-81 to 1982-83 has been set at a net population gain of 250 000. A significant element of the 1980-81 gross intake is the expected acceptance during the year of 21 500 persons under the refugee and special humanitarian programs, a small increase on last year, to meet commitments to programs within South East Asia and elsewhere. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Eligibility for migration to Australia (other than under the refugee and special humanitarian programs) is based on the Numerical Multi-factor Assessment System (NUMAS) which gives weight to such factors as family ties, occupational skills in demand, literacy in the mother tongue and knowledge of English.

Estimated expenditure on assisted passages in 1980-81, which provides for substantial increases in the cost of air fares, is $13.2 million compared with $7.5 million in 1979-80. Contributions made to the operating expenses of migrant centres met by Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services Ltd are being increased by an amount of $0.9 million to $11.1 million to allow for the operating costs of new migrant centres established to meet the projected increased migrant intake.

        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $547.0 million is provided for expenditure on overseas aid in 1980-81, an increase of $48.6 million or 9.8 per cent over expenditure in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Taking into account &#39;Assistance Additional to Aid Payments&#39; (see below) assistance to developing countries in 1980-81 is estimated to amount to about $595.1 million. This figure excludes the significant amounts spent by the Commonwealth and State Governments on the education and training of several thousand students from developing countries who are attending various tertiary and other training institutions in Australia. The cost to the Australian taxpayer of providing assistance of this kind, which is not brought to account directly under the overseas aid program, is estimated at about $39 million in 1980; this is about the same amount as in 1979 even after allowance for the effects of the introduction of tertiary education fees for overseas students. Australia also provides other indirect forms of economic aid through its contributions to the regular budgets of a number of international organisations (eg the United Nations Organisation, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation) that assist in the financing of aid projects in developing countries. The aid component of Australia&#39;s contributions to these organisations in 1980-81 is estimated at about $3 million. Other indirect economic assistance is provided by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation through the financing, in certain circumstances, of exports of capital goods on concessional terms. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">An amount of $245.8 million is provided for expenditure on aid to or on behalf of the Papua New Guinea Government in 1980-81. This is $8.1 million more than in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under the terms of an aid agreement negotiated in 1976, Australia undertook to provide Papua New Guinea with annual payments of $180 million (plus annual supplements to take account of inflation and other factors) for general budgetary assistance over a five-year period commencing 1976-77. The supplement for 1980-81, set in December 1978, is $52 million, an increase of $9 million over the 1979-80 supplement. When the five-year agreement expires at the end of 1980-81, Australia will have provided a total of $1060 million in budget support grants to Papua New Guinea. The question of subsequent arrangements is expected to be considered by the Government shortly. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on the provision of education and technical assistance under the Australia-Papua New Guinea Education and Technical Assistance Scheme are estimated at $2.0 million in 1980-81, an increase of 52 per cent over 1979-80. Payments in respect of termination and retirement benefits and other pensions to expatriate officers of former Papua New Guinea Administrations and the Australian Staffing Assistance Group are estimated at $11.7 million in 1980-81, $1.4 million less than in 1979-80. These payments are made under the <inline font-style="italic">Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Act</inline> 1973. Although the Government has recently agreed to make minor amendments to the regulations under this Act to provide higher rates and wider eligibility for certain pensions, payments under the Act are expected to continue to decline over the next few years as the Commonwealth discharges its responsibilities under the Act. </para>
          <para>Projects and Disaster Relief</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure under this heading is estimated to increase by $19.0 million in 1980-81 to $123.2 million. This aid is directed towards a range of activities including projects, equipment and expert advice aimed at increasing agricultural productivity, providing general infrastructure and improving transport and communication facilities; contributions to developing countries for disaster relief are also included here. Project assistance has expanded rapidly in recent years; this mainly reflects a substantial increase in aid commitments to South Pacific countries and to members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). In 1979 the Government renewed its 1977 forward aid commitment of $250 million for ASEAN country programs. The Government has also recently increased to $34.5 million the total commitment for assistance of a regional nature under the ASEAN-Australia Economic Co-operation Program. These commitments for ASEAN countries do not set specific year-by-year allocations, but permit increased forward planning of aid activities. The Government has also announced a forward aid commitment for South Pacific countries of $120 million for the three years commencing 1980-81, which represents an increase of 47 per cent over the level of assistance in the previous three years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A recent initiative under the bilateral aid program is the commitment to provide $10 million in aid for reconstruction and rehabilitation purposes to the newly independent Zimbabwe over a period of about two years. Of this amount, over $4 million is expected to be provided in 1980-81. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure in 1980-81 on training programs (excluding training provided under the Australia-Papua New Guinea Education and Technical Assistance Scheme) is estimated at $16.9 million, an increase of $2.8 million on 1979-80. This expenditure covers the direct costs (including student fees) of officially sponsored students from developing countries who undertake studies in Australia, together with support for training institutions in some  AJSEAN  and Pacific countries. </para>
          <para>Food Aid</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on bilateral food aid are estimated to increase by $10.9 million to $56.6 million in 1980-81. This increase partly reflects higher average prices expected to be paid for wheat and flour purchases in 1980-81, but is mainly accounted for by the Government&#39;s decision in February of this year to increase Australia&#39;s commitment under the new Food Aid Convention of the International Wheat Agreement so as to provide a minimum of 400 000 tonnes of food grain annually, 81 300 tonnes more than the 1979-80 provision. It is envisaged that 320 000 tonnes of the new commitment will be provided under the bilateral food aid program (an increase of 56 700 tonnes over 1979-80) and 80 000 tonnes under the World Food Program (see heading &#39;United Nations Programs&#39;). The bilateral food allocation also covers freight costs on food aid provided for emergency purposes ($3.2 million), gifts of some non-grain foods to developing countries ($2.5 million) and the provision of $0.8 million in respect of a concessionary wheat sale to Bangladesh in 1979-80. </para>
          <para>Other Bilateral Aid</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Included under this heading is emergency humanitarian assistance; assistance in 1979-80 included emergency humanitarian relief of $8.3 million for Kampuchea, $3.0 million for East Timor, and $2.0 million for refugee assistance in respect of Zimbabwe and Afghanistan. These amounts are indicative of the strong support Australia has given to various emergency relief programs undertaken in different parts of the world. Provision has been made in 1980-81 for $3.0 million for emergency humanitarian assistance for Kampuchea. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Also included is $1.6 million for two new aid initiatives for ASEAN countries: a Development Import Finance Facility involving the use of aid funds in conjunction with finance from the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to increase the concessional element in credit terms that Australian firms can offer when tendering for the supply of certain goods and services to those countries, and a Joint Venture Scheme to assist ASEAN Governments to purchase equity in joint ventures with Australian firms and for partial funding of feasibility studies and training costs for joint ventures. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Support for voluntary aid organisations is estimated at $3.0 million in 1980-81, $0.7 million more than in 1979-80. This expenditure includes grants for the Overseas Service Bureau and the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, as well as  direct financial support for small-scale development assistance <inline font-style="italic">projects</inline> carried out by voluntary aid organisations in developing countries. Australia&#39;s contributions to a number of international voluntary aid organisations, also recorded under this heading, include contributions of $0.25 million to the International Planned Parenthood Federation and $0.15 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross. </para>

          <para>International Development Finance Institutions</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">This heading covers payments by Australia to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank Group, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the International Monetary Fund&#39;s Oil Facility Interest Subsidy Account. Expenditure in 1980-81 is estimated at $49.7 million, compared with $38.5 million in 1979-80. The increase mainly reflects an estimated higher rate of cash disbursement in respect of Australia&#39;s contributions to the International Development Association (IDA), the concessional lending agency of the World Bank Group. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Financial support for these institutions is provided under specific legislation, and mainly takes the form of promissory notes which are drawn down by the institutions either as required to meet their commitments or on the basis of previously agreed schedules. After allowing for payment of the 1980-81 provisions, total outstanding commitments to these organisations will amount to some $450.5 million. The amounts included will be drawn down over a number of years and comprise $138.8 million for the ADB (including $120.6 million for its concessional lending facility, the Asian Development Fund), $302.5 million for the IDA, $2.8 million for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD, part of the World Bank Group) and $6.4 million for the IFAD. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The $49.7 million provided in 1980-81 comprises capital subscriptions to the IBRD ($1.8 million) and the ADB ($6.1 million) and contributions to the IDA ($31.0 million), the Asian Development Fund ($7.2 million), and the IFAD ($0.8 million), together with $2.8 million payable to the IDA in respect of the multilateral component of Australia&#39;s contribution of $US18 million to the Conference on International Economic Co-operation&#39;s Special Action Program. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Australia&#39;s contributions to various United Nations aid organisations are estimated at $14.2 million in 1980-81. This is only slightly above 1979-80 expenditure ($14.1 million) due to revised payment arrangements for 1981 contributions to these organisations (and the South Pacific Commission) ; the net effect of these arrangements on 1980-81 outlays is to reduce them by about $0.8 million. The major recipient organisations are the United Nations Development Program ($3.6 million, being effectively one half-yearly payment), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ($5.0 million, being effectively three half-yearly payments) and the United Nations Children&#39;s Fund ($3.4 million, being effectively three half-yearly payments). Further details of these payments and the revised payment arrangements are contained in Budget Paper No. 8. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Assistance to regional and other international programs is estimated at $11.1 million in 1980-81. <inline font-weight="bold">Major regional</inline> organisations receiving support include the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the South Pacific Commission, and the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation; support is also given to a number of international and regional research and training centres.

        <para pgwide="yes">Expenditure under the World Food Program is estimated to increase by 42 per cent to $21.9 million in 1980-81. The increase mainly reflects an increased allocation of 80 000 tonnes for the World Food Program from Australia&#39;s increased annual commitment of a minimum 400 000 tonnes under the Food Aid Convention, but also partly reflects higher average prices expected to be paid for wheat and flour purchases in 1980-81. Provision is also made for Australia&#39;s minimum biennial pledge of cash and commodities (other than wheat) of $10.5 million for the calendar years 1981 and 1982, and for freight costs on the food aid to be disbursed through the World Food Program. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Although Australia&#39;s Defence Co-operation Program (estimated to cost $38.7 million in 1980-81) represents an extension of our own defence effort, it also supplements the overseas economic aid program to the extent that it releases for development purposes resources that recipient governments might otherwise have set aside for defence purposes. Australia&#39;s assistance in this respect is described in the section on Defence Co-operation under the Defence function. In addition, the Administrative expenses of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau estimated at $9.4 million in 1980-81 and recorded under General Administrative Expenditure, represent an integral part of total expenditure on Australia&#39;s aid effort. </para>

The net outlay in respect of each of the three territories is shown below. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Net expenditure on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in 1980-81 is estimated to increase by $2.0 million, reflecting the Government&#39;s policy of progressively upgrading the social infrastructure on the Islands. The gross costs of administering Christmas Island in 1980-81 are estimated at $3.6 million. These costs are recovered from Island revenue and from the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission, except for an estimated amount of $0.2 million associated with the cost of the Administrator and his immediate staff, which cost the Government has accepted as a Commonwealth responsibility from 1980-81. Estimated net expenditure on Norfolk Island includes an amount of $0.3 million for the restoration and maintenance of historic structures. </para>

The $28 million provision in the Budget ($1.8 million higher than outlays in 1979-80, mainly because of cost increases, including salary and wage rises) is intended to enable the Commission to maintain generally the same level of activity as in 1979-80. That amount includes an additional $140 000 for the first year of a program (estimated to cost $4.7 million over five years) for the refurbishing of the HIFAR reactor. The Budget provision will allow commencement of installation of a new computer-based site surveillance monitoring system, a building to centralise safety management, a new incinerator, and conversion of the Commission&#39;s oil-fired boiler to electricity. (These projects are expected to be completed during either 1981-82 or 1982-83.) Additional requirements in 1980-81 have been partially offset by the reduced need to import radioisotopes for sale (the HIFAR reactor which produces such radio-isotopes having recommenced operating in June 1980 after a nine month shutdown for inspection and maintenance). </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">An additional $17.9 million is provided in 1980-81.

        <para pgwide="yes">This heading includes outlays of the Departments of Finance and Treasury, the Auditor-General&#39;s Office and the Grants Commission. The decrease in estimated outlays in 1980-Sl is largely attributable to an estimated reduction of $3.3 million on amounts provided in 1979-80 for the acquisition of computer equipment and the provision of ancillary computer services for the Department of Finance. In addition, loan flotation expenses associated with the raising of loans overseas are estimated to be $3.1 million lower than in 1979-80 resulting from a smaller overseas loan program expected in 1980-81. On the other hand, salaries and allowances are estimated to increase by $4 million. Expenditure in respect of the Grants <inline font-style="italic">Commission</inline> ($1.1 million) includes provision for the completion of its review of State relativities under the <inline font-style="italic">States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act</inline> 1976. </para>

The Bureau&#39;s computer re-equipment program began in 1979-80 and is expected to be completed in 1983-84 at a total estimated cost of $20.5 million. The estimates incorporate $4.2 million, $2.7 million more than in 1979-80, for the 1981 Population Census. The commitment to the Census comprehends further expenditure by the Bureau of $22.9 million in 1981-82 and $0.2 million in 1982- 83 (estimated at present prices), making a total estimated cost of $28.8 million. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Tax sharing entitlements make up the bulk of general revenue assistance to the States. Arrangements based on a Commonwealth undertaking to provide the States with a fixed percentage of personal income tax collections commenced in 1976-77. These arrangements replaced financial assistance grants which were determined under a formula which took into account increases in States&#39; population and in average wages in the economy as a whole, and a further &#39;betterment&#39; factor. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under &#39;Stage 1&#39; of the tax sharing arrangements, the States became entitled to receive: in 1976-77, 33.6 per cent of Commonwealth net personal income tax collections (excluding the revenue effects of any special surcharges or rebates applied by the Commonwealth) in that year; in 1977-78, a fixed amount of $4336.1 million; and, in each subsequent year, 39.87 per cent of collections in the preceding year. The &#39;Stage 1&#39; arrangements included a &#39;guarantee&#39; provision to ensure that each State&#39;s entitlement in any year would not be less in absolute terms than in the previous year. In the four years 1976-77 to 1979-80, there was a supplementary undertaking (the &#39;formula guarantee&#39;) which ensured that the entitlements in those years would not be less than the amount which would have been yielded by the financial assistance grants formula which applied before 1976-77. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In anticipation of the expiry of the formula guarantee&#39; on 30 June 1980, the Premiers&#39; Conference of December 1979 adopted interim arrangements for the determination of entitlements pending the outcome of a comprehensive review of the tax sharing agreement. These arrangements provide for the States to receive in 1980-81 39.87 per cent of net personal income tax collected in 1979-80, distributed according to existing tax sharing relativities, with the guarantee that each State will receive no less in real terms than the amount it received in 1979-80. The comparison of these amounts in real terms is made using the ratio of the Consumer Price Index for the four quarters ending March 1981 to that for the four quarters ending March 1980, the index being that for the capital city of the State in question. The present estimates provide for the States&#39; entitlements in 1980-81 to be $6020.2 million or 11.2 per cent higher than in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In addition to the review of the tax sharing arrangements, a special division of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is currently reassessing the State relativities which are the basis for allocating entitlements among the States.

This includes an amount of $1225 million for the basic program of the States&#39; larger semi-government authorities, special non-infrastructure additions of $72.3 million, and $632.3 million for the semi-government infrastructure financing program. The infrastructure program was introduced in 1978-79 with the purpose of facilitating borrowings for economically viable projects that have a special significance for national development, and are for the provision of services of kinds normally provided by government or public utility enterprises which cannot be reasonably accommodated within the resources made available under &#39;normal&#39; Loan Council programs and which require outlays within a relatively short period of time. </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Recorded under this heading is interest paid on all Commonwealth securities including Commonwealth Bonds, Australian Savings Bonds, Treasury Notes, Treasury Bills and Income Equalisation Deposits. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth securities in question include those issued on behalf of the States and certain Commonwealth authorities. Reimbursement of interest paid on these Comonwealth securities by the States and the relevant authorities is recorded as receipts under the heading &#39;Interest Rent and Dividends&#39; <inline font-style="italic">(see</inline> Statement No. 4). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The estimated increase in interest payments in 1980-81 is $186.4 million or 8.4 per cent, compared with the $252.0 million or 12.8 per cent increase recorded in 1979-80. The effect on interest payments in a particular year of securities issued in that year depends on the type of security and, in the case of bonds, on the timing of the borrowing within the year. Large sales of Treasury Notes were recorded in 1979-80; Treasury Notes &#34;are short-term securities, with maturities of 13 and 26 weeks, and are issued at a discount and repayable at par so that the interest cost falls within the financial year of issue; as a result, there was a disproportionate increase in interest payments recorded in 1979-80. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">New arrangements for the marketing of Commonwealth Bonds and Treasury Notes came into effect in 1979-80. A Treasury Note tender system was introduced in December 1979 and a new &#39;tap&#39; arrangement for Commonwealth Bonds was introduced in April 1980. Under the new &#39;tap&#39; arrangements Commonwealth Bonds will be available in one or more maturities on a more or less continuous basis throughout the year at prices which may be varied during the period of issue. This contrasts with the past practice of issuing new Commonwealth Bonds in periodic cash/conversion loans with fixed issue prices and set closing dates for subscriptions. </para>

A separate allowance of $110 million is included in the Defence function. These bulk allowances are not appropriated at this stage.

        <para pgwide="yes">As also announced on 6 March, various dependant rebates for 1980-81 have been increased by 34 per cent. The rebate for a spouse, housekeeper or daughter-housekeeper has been increased from $597 to $800, the sole parent rebate from $417 to $559, the invalid relative rebate from $270 to $362 and the parent or parent-in-law rebate from $539 to $722. In addition, the notional rebates for dependent children that are taken into consideration in calculating zone allowance rebates have been increased from $270 and $203 to S362 and $272 respectively. </para>
        <para class="block">The rate scale for assessment of 1980-81 income tax is: </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On 1 July 1980 the PAYE instalment deductions were adjusted to reflect the increase in the spouse and associated rebates and the indexation adjustment of the rate scale. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Provisional tax arrangements seek to achieve reasonable consistency between the treatment of PAYE and provisional taxpayers. Since 1976 the provisional payment of those who do not self-assess has been derived by applying to their preceding year&#39;s income, rates which are somewhat higher than the current year&#39;s rates. For example, a loading of 3 percentage points was applied to the normal rates in calculating their 1979-80 provisional payments. This was done as a means of achieving a degree of consistency in times of rising incomes between them and PAYE taxpayers and provisional taxpayers who self-assess. In 1980-81 that objective will be met by adjusting the income, rather than the rates, in the calculation of the provisional payment of those who do not self-assess. Specifically, the 1980-81 rate scale will be applied to their 1979-80 income increased by 7.5 per cent and dependant rebates will be allowed at 1980-81 values. The 7.5 per cent is a conservative estimate of the average rise in provisional incomes for 1980-81, and the arrangements should result in provisional tax of taxpayers who do not self-assess being closer over the whole range of incomes to the provisional tax payable by taxpayers who do self-assess (and by PAYE taxpayers) than has been the case in the past. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Provisional taxpayers of course retain the option of self-assessing, i.e. providing an estimate of their income for the current year which is used in calculating their provisional payment. The provisional payment of those who self-assess will be derived by applying 1980-81 rates and rebates in conjunction with their estimate of 1980-81 income. </para>
          <para>Australians Working Overseas</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The present law contains provisions to prevent international double taxation on foreign-source income which Australian residents earn from personal services performed in another, country. Under those provisions, which are varied in some respects by double taxation agreement&#39;s, the income is exempt from Australian tax if the country of source taxes it, and is taxed by Australia if the country of source exempts it. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It is proposed to provide some relief from Australian tax on certain foreignsource income which Australian residents earn from personal services overseas where the country of source does not tax it, either because it does not levy income tax or because it forgoes its tax (e.g. where the work is done under contracts with international bodies such as the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank). The new treatment will not apply where the country of source exempts the income only because of the terms of a double tax agreement with Australia, the intention of which is to avoid double taxation of the income in question. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The new arrangements will apply where the personal services are performed overseas in connection with approved development, construction and other projects. A certificate of approval for the project should be sought from the Department of Trade and Resources.

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main features of the present law relating to superannuation arrangements are:  o  contributions by an individual to a fund to provide superannuation benefits for himself or his dependants are included in rebatable expenditure, within a limit of $1200 per annum for the sum of life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions, and entitle him to a rebate at the standard rate of tax on any excess of his total rebatable expenditure over  $1590.  That applies whether the contribution is  by  an employee contributing to an employer-supported fund, an employee who is not supported  by  an employer-sponsored scheme and who makes his own arrangements to contribute to a public superannuation fund, or a self-employed person;  o  employees who are members of an employer-supported fund also have the benefit of employer contributions on their behalf, and are not taxed on those amounts. There is no corresponding benefit for self-employed persons or for employees who are not supported  by  an employer-sponsored scheme; and  o  retirement benefits received as pensions are assessable income, except to the extent of any undeducted purchase price. Retirement benefits received as lump sums by self-employed persons and unsupported employees are tax-free, while 5 per cent of lump sums received on retirement by employees who are members of employer-sponsored schemes is assessable income. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It is proposed to amend the treatment of contributions and lump-sum benefits in respect of self-employed persons and employees not covered by employer-sponsored arrangements in the following main respects:  o  up to  $1200  per annum of contributions made  by  them after  19  August  1980  to a qualifying fund (i.e. a fund that qualifies under section  23  (ja) or section  79  of the Income Tax Assessment Act) to provide retirement benefits for themselves and their dependants will be deductible from their assessable income. This will provide something comparable to the benefit which supported employees obtain when their employer contributes to a fund for them; &#176; contributions in excess of  $1200  per annum will remain rebatable expenditure, up to the existing limit of  $1200  for life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions, as they are for all contributions by supported employees; and &#176; 5 per cent of lump sums received from qualifying funds after  19  August  1980  will be assessable income, to the extent that those lump sums are derived from contributions after that date and from earnings of the fund from the investment of those contributions. In other words, that part of the lump sums will be taxed to the same extent as lump sums received on retirement by supported employees. The part of their lump sum retirement benefit derived from contributions made up to  19  August  1980,  and earnings on the investment of these contributions, will remain tax-free. It will be a condition for eligibility that no other person contributes to a fund for the taxpayer&#39;s benefit or agrees to provide superannuation benefits for the taxpayer or his or her dependants. </para>

That extension will permit a primary producer to offset any relevant profit against the deductible cost of replacement stock acquired for up to five income years after the year of death or disposal for destruction (any unabsorbed balance being assessable income in the last of those five years), and so defer tax on the relevant profit until the replacement stock is sold. A primary producer who breeds replacement stock may elect to include an appropriate part of the profit in assessable income; and o for cattle properties certified as subject to brucellosis or tuberculosis and in relation to which herd control is difficult, expenditure incurred by 30 June 1984 on internal fences and stockyards under contracts entered into while a certificate is in force will be deductible in full in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.

Under these arrangements producers of naturally occurring  LPG  from fields in production prior to 17 August 1977 pay excise at a rate equivalent to 60 per cent of the margin by which the weighted average of wholesale prices on domestic and export sales exceeds $147 per tonne. The excise accordingly rose from $27.55 per tonne to $77.00 per tonne on 8 April 1980, and to $80.40 per tonne on 1 July 1980. </para>

The impact on clearances of the stronger growth  in the overall level of activity, and the estimated slower rate of price increase in 1980-81 than in 1979-80, are assumed to be more than offset by the ongoing substitution effects of the sharp increase in motor spirit prices since 1978-79. </para>

Those determinations were in accordance with the policy announced by the then Minister for National Development on  4  July  1978,  which is to base the import parity price for domestically produced crude oil on the official Saudi Arabian Light &#39;marker&#39; price, converted to Australian dollars, and adjusted to reflect allowances for quality differentials, freight, wharfage and credit terms.

      <para pgwide="yes">The excise rate varies according to the date of discovery and size of each field. In  1979-80  producers of oil discovered prior to  14  September  1975  received parity related returns (i.e. import parity prices less the appropriate levy) on  35  per cent of their production or  6  million barrels per annum, whichever was the greater, for each field or new development within a field.* In  1980-81  the proportion of such oil attracting parity related returns will be  50  per cent or  6  million barrels, whichever is the greater. For the balance of their production from such fields, producers receive a controlled return, i.e. the Government determined price which applied at the time of the  1977-78  Budget, adjusted for changes in the costs incurred by producers in extending credit to refiners. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Producers of oil from fields discovered on or after  18  August  1976  are not subject to any levy and receive the import parity price on the whole of their production. </para>

The nature of this phasing is to be considered during  1980-81.  For fields producing more than  15  million barrels per annum the proportion of production attracting parity related returns is to be held at  50  per cent. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Some significant changes in the pricing and excise arrangements for LPG were announced during the first half of 1980. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">On 24 January 1980, the Minister for National Development and Energy announced that a subsidy of $80 per tonne would be provided in respect of LPG used for household purposes for a period of three years. On 8 April the Minister announced that this subsidy would be extended to include LPG used by non-profit residential institutions and schools. The subsidy is being paid through State Governments to registered distributors of LPG, backdated to 28 March 1980. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">On 8 April the Minister also outlined further pricing measures and revised levy arrangements for LPG. The effect of the pricing arrangements is to control the price of LPG sold for domestic, automotive and traditional uses, while leaving prices for petrochemical and non-traditional usage to be determined by commercial negotiation between the parties concerned. As part of the pricing arrangements, a common maximum wholesale price of $205 per tonne (before allowance for the subsidy, where appropriate) was set for naturally occurring and refinery produced LPG. This price implied, at the time of its inception, a differential of approximately 50 per cent between the Melbourne retail price of automotive LPG and that of &#39;super&#39; grade petrol; the precise differential could vary from place to place, and time to time, because of differences in distribution costs and retail margins. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">For <inline font-style="italic">naturally occurring</inline> LPG, the new arrangements provide for the price to be increased by the same percentage movement as the import parity price for indigenous crude oil but, if world price movements result in the export parity price for LPG falling below the oil related domestic price, the export parity price is to be adopted for domestic purposes. The Prices Justification Tribunal has been directed to follow these arrangements in setting prices for refinery produced LPG. (Prior to the introduction of these new arrangements the domestic price for refinery produced LPG was set by the Prices Justification Tribunal having regard to the export parity price of butane and propane; naturally occurring LPG was not subject to price control but producers elected to make sales at the prices recommended for refinery produced LPG.) </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Under the new excise arrangements announced on 8 April, producers of naturally occurring LPG from fields in production prior to 17 August 1977 pay excise at a rate equivalent to 60 per cent of the excess of the weighted average of domestic and export prices over $147 a tonne; this resulted in an increase in the equivalent excise rates from $27.55 per tonne to $77.00 per tonne. Naturally occurring LPG from fields brought into production on or after 17 August 1977 remains free of levy. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">In 1975-76 rebates were allowed for the maintenance of dependent children in addition to the categories of dependants for which rebates are now allowed. In 1976-77 the system of direct outlays by way of family allowances was introduced; it took over the role previously performed by rebates for dependent children, and those rebates ceased to apply. (A component of the zone rebates, however, is still calculated as a percentage of a base which may include a notional rebate for dependent children.) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The inclusion of the cost of dependant rebates in this section does not indicate that they are considered a departure from an equitable tax distribution. Rather, it implies no more than that they confer a benefit on recipients and could conceivably be regarded as alternatives to direct expenditures in the same way that family allowances replaced dependent child rebates in 1976. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Zone rebates are allowed to taxpayers who live in remote areas. Residents in Zone A receive a rebate equal to $216 plus 25 per cent of rebates for dependants, sole parents and housekeepers (including notional rebates in respect of dependent children). Residents of Zone B receive a rebate of $36 plus 4 per cent of the rebates for dependants, etc. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A rebate, at the standard rate of tax, is allowed on the excess of a taxpayer&#39;s aggregate expenditure on certain concessional items above a prescribed figure, currently $1590.

Prior to 1 October 1976, contributions to a registered health insurance fund were also included in this category of rebatable expenditure.

          <para>Industry Assistance</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Industry also has received considerable assistance over the years through various taxation concessions. The main concessions available in recent years have been investment allowances, accelerated depreciation and trading stock valuation adjustment, all of which affect a wide spectrum of industry, while special arrangements have benefited primary production, tourism and mining industries. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The investment allowance applies to a wide range of plant and equipment, including leased plant. It provided for a deduction equal to 40 per cent of the cost of plant purchased under a contract made in the period 1 January 1976 to 30 June 1978 and first used by 30 June 1979; it now provides a deduction of 20 per cent of the cost of plant ordered in the period 1 July 1978 to 30 June 1985. The 40 per cent allowance also applied in the case of partly-completed plant to so much of the expenditure incurred on that plant as was attributable to its installation as at 3 June 1979. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Double depreciation applied to new plant and equipment first used or installed for use by taxpayers in the manufacturing and primary production industry sectors on or after 1 July 1974 and before 1 July 1975. The double depreciation scheme also applied in 1975-76 and was extended in coverage, but was discontinued after the 1975-76 income year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The trading stock valuation adjustment was a special deduction equal to a prescribed percentage of most classes of trading stock including livestock. The prescribed percentage was based on half the percentage increase in the goods component of the Consumer Price Index between the June quarter prior to the year of income and the June quarter of the year of income and was applied to the value of the trading stock at the commencement of the year. The adjustment was terminated with effect from the 1979-80 income year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Depreciation allowances are provided for certain new income-producing buildings commenced after 21 August 1979, where the buildings are used to provide short-term accommodation for travellers. The allowance is <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent per annum of the construction cost of the building. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Most of the relevant concessions in the income tax field may be grouped in three broad categories, namely: </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A - those allowing the deduction of amounts that are not authorised under the general provisions of the law; </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">B  -  those allowing certain taxpayers to deduct the cost of items of plant over shorter periods than is the case for the general run of taxpayers; and </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">C - those exempting certain classes of income (now confined to exemption of income from gold mining). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Details of estimated amounts of revenue forgone in 1979-80 under the main provisions in categories A and B, which exceed $840 million, are shown in the following table. A miscellany of other provisions is not included, in some cases because of lack of data on revenue forgone or questions about the extent to which they may properly be regarded as wholly &#39;Industry Assistance&#39;. These provisions include the rebates allowed to shareholders in respect of capital subscribed for petroleum exploration and mining (conditional on the company forgoing certain deductions); the concession whereby primary producers are allowed to adopt artificially low values for natural increase in their livestock accounts for taxation purposes; and the accelerated depreciation of expenditure on employees&#39; amenities. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The income equalisation deposits scheme and the averaging provisions applied to primary producers are also not included. The income equalisation deposits scheme permits deposits by a primary producer, within specified limits, to be deducted against assessable income in the year the deposits are made and withdrawals of deposits to be included in assessable income in the year they are withdrawn. (Deposits up to 31 August are deductible against assessable income of the preceding income year.) Interest is paid on the deposits. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under the averaging provisions, primary producers effectively have their income from primary production taxed at rates corresponding to their average income (for the current and preceding four years) in a year when average income is less than taxable income. Depending on the amount of their income not derived from primary production, some or all of that income may also be effectively taxed at the lower rates corresponding to average income. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The purpose of the averaging provisions is to ensure that fluctuations in income in conjunction with progression in rates of tax do not lead to those taxpayers bearing higher tax rates than other taxpayers having incomes which, over a period of years, are comparable but non-fluctuating. The effects go beyond that when there is an upward (e.g. inflationary) trend in money incomes over a number of years since, even if fluctuations in income are superimposed on that trend, the averaging provisions result in the taxpayers covered by them bearing lower tax rates than other taxpayers whose incomes over an equal period of years are comparable. Furthermore, even in the absence of an upward trend in income the provisions introduced in 1977-78 do more than remove the effect on tax of fluctuations in income, as averaging is applied only in years when to do so benefits the taxpayer, and tax is calculated at ordinary rates in other years. </para>

The absence of precise information on the amounts that would otherwise have been deductible by way of depreciation of the relevant plant makes it impossible to provide a reliable estimate of the effect of these deductions on revenue. The total amount allowable will in no case exceed the deduction allowable over the life of the mine or the plant by way of normal depreciation. However, where the deduction results in a deferment of tax or in the carrying forward of deductions which otherwise would be lost to the business where it remains non-taxable for more than 7 years, there is a cost to the Budget. Where there is a constant or increasing rate of investment in plant or equipment subject to accelerated depreciation the concession can provide for the taxpayers concerned a revolving or increasing credit in their account with the taxation revenue. </para>

        <para class="block">
          <inline font-style="italic">Defence</inline>- up $121 million </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Defence outlays exceeded the Budget estimate by $121 million, reflecting cost increases during the year and the effect of post-Budget decisions taken to increase defence preparedness in the light of international developments. In real terms actual defence outlays were around 3 per cent greater than last year (an increase of about 2.6 per cent was implied in the Budget estimates). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Outlays on defence equipment and stores exceeded the estimate by $93 million. The major components of that increase were the initial payment ($25 million) associated with the ordering of a fourth guided missile frigate (FFG), the rescheduling of payments for the three FFGs already on order ($25 million), and increased costs of fuels and lubricants together with increased purchases of these products ($38 million). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Manpower costs were $8 million greater than allowed for in the estimates. Outlays associated with the maintenance of industrial capacity were $7 million above estimates; these outlays included the provision of an additional $6 million working capital to the Government Aircraft Factories for the continuing production of Nomad aircraft and also to finance unsold stocks of the aircraft. Acquisition of sites and buildings cost $5 million more than estimated because of the purchase from the NSW Government of maritime docks at Woolloomooloo for the expansion of the naval dockyard at Garden Island. There was a shortfall of $8 million in outlays on buildings and works mainly because of slippages in projects such as the Cairns Patrol Boat Base, the Williamstown Naval Dockyard Development, and the construction of FFG facilities at Garden Island. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">A shortfall of $7 million on tertiary student assistance payments (reflecting lower than forecast numbers of recipients and lower average allowances) was more than offset by a number of smaller differences from the estimates. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The post-Budget decision to introduce a school-to-work transition program in conjunction with State Governments added $5 million to Education outlays. Recoveries through overseas student charges were $4 million less than estimated because of a lower than estimated number of students identified as liable for the charge (partly attributable to post-Budget refinements to the scheme) and a greater than assumed proportion paying the lowest scale of charge. Outlays on schools in the ACT were $3 million more than estimated, reflecting general cost increases related to higher than estimated enrolments. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-style="italic">Health</inline>- up $4 million </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">There was a number of largely offsetting but significant variations within this function. Overruns on estimates occurred on payments of medical benefits ($28 million), medical and hospital services for veterans and their dependants ($14 million) and nursing home benefits ($8 million). In large measure these overruns reflected higher usage and demand levels, particularly by pensioners, than those assumed at Budget time. In addition the number of approved nursing home beds increased more than allowed for in the Budget and attracted a higher than expected average rate of benefit. Of the $14 million increase in expenditure on medical and hospital services for veterans, $8 million related to medical services to veterans outside repatriation institutions and reflected, in part, increases during the year in doctors&#39; and dentists&#39; fees. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Payments to the Health Insurance Commission were $6 million more than estimated because redeployment of staff did not occur as quickly as expected following the wind-up of Medibank Standard. Additional costs for the construction of Calvary Hospital (ACT) and increases in operating costs of hospitals and other health facilities resulted in outlays on health services in the Territories exceeding the Budget estimates by $3 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Offsetting the major part of these increases were shortfalls of $38 million in hospital payments resulting mainly from hospital operating budgets being negotiated at lower levels, and $23 million in pharmaceutical benefits (down $17 million for the general population and $7 million for pensioners) reflecting usage rates lower than assumed. Grants to the States under the Community Health Program were $5 million less than estimated because of a change in the timing of payments to the States. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Social Security and Welfare</inline>- down $95 million </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Unemployment benefits were $73 million less than estimated. A lower than estimated number of beneficiaries, due in part to the improvement in the employment situation during the year, was the major factor in this shortfall. There were also significant shortfalls in payments of age pensions ($21 million), assistance to veterans and their dependants ($20 million), widows&#39; pensions ($11 million) and invalid pensions ($9 million). In each case the actual numbers eligible for such benefits were less than estimated at Budget time; increases in indexed pension and benefit rates were also lower than allowed for. Outlays on aged persons&#39; homes and hostels were $11 million less than estimated at Budget time mainly because approved projects did not proceed at the rate originally assumed. Grants to the States for deserted wives were $3 million less than estimated; the shortfall was largely attributable to the withdrawal of Victoria from the arrangements in 1979-80. This withdrawal also contributed to an overrun of $12 million on the estimate for special benefit payments, but the bulk of that increase reflected a greater than estimated number of other beneficiaries. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The major overrun in the social security and welfare function was $35 million for family allowances, where a higher than estimated number of children attracted the allowance and payments made to banks in respect of the 1 July 1980 family allowance pay-day were brought to account in 1979-80. Smaller overruns included $3 million for sickness benefits, $2 million for sheltered employment allowances and $2 million for supporting parents benefits. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-style="italic">Housing</inline>- down $16 million </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Net outlays for housing in the ACT were $11 million less than estimated. Greater than expected repayments by mortgagees accounted for $6 million of this difference, and the balance reflected lower demand than assumed for loans under current arrangements. Early repayment of loans by some banks contributed a further $5 million to the total shortfall in housing outlays. Home Savings Grant payments were $3 million less than estimated, reflecting an underestimation of the effect of rising home prices on application rates for grants which were available only in respect of homes not exceeding $40 000 in value. Net payments under Defence Services Homes arrangements were $5 million more than estimated largely because the sale of surplus land proceeded more slowly than assumed and the funds drawn under the provision for borrowers&#39; excess deposits to be available for specified purposes were underestimated. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Transport and Communication</inline>- down $20 million </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Qantas Airways Limited discharged aircraft loans of $25 million earlier than expected while exchange rate fluctuations on loans raised in foreign currency on behalf of the Australian National Airlines Commission (TAA) resulted in repayments being $3 million above the estimate. Receipts from light dues were $4 million more than estimated, reflecting greater than estimated shipping movements. In addition there was a shortfall of $6 million in payments to the States for mainline upgrading under the <inline font-style="italic">National Railways Network (Financial Assistance) Act</inline> 1979 because agreements were finalised with only two States (Queensland and Victoria). </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">These reductions were partly offset by an $11 million increase against the estimated costs of operation and administration of civil aviation services; $6 million of this reflected increased salary costs, while receipts from air navigation charges, which are offset against these outlays, were $4 million less than estimated. Payments to Australian National Railways to meet operating losses were $3 million more than estimated, reflecting costs of wage determinations and increased fuel prices; these increased costs were partially offset by additional revenues generated by stronger demand and by higher freight rates and fares effective from 1 March 1980. </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-style="italic">Industry Assistance and Development</inline>- down $12 million </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Net outlays associated with the wool industry were $14 million less than estimated, mainly reflecting late June wool tax collections not transferred to the Australian Wool Corporation (for promotion and market support purposes) until July 1980. Similar timing factors connected with the receipt and spending of the dairy industry stabilization levy, together with higher than forecast dairy industry returns (with consequent lower underwriting outlays for dairy products), led to a shortfall against estimates of $4 million in net outlays on the dairy industry. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Advances under the rural adjustment scheme were $4 million less than estimated. Outlays on energy research and conservation also fell short of the estimate by $4 million due mainly to delays in projects financed from the newly created Energy Research and Development Trust Account. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Phosphate fertilizer bounty payments were $11 million more than estimated, reflecting higher consumption following an improvement in seasonal conditions and, more importantly in this context, some building-up of stocks in anticipation of phosphate price increases. Outlays on the petroleum products subsidy were $9 million more than estimated, mainly due to the Government&#39;s decision to reduce the freight differential borne by country consumers from 1 April 1980 but reflecting also increased transport costs. </para>

        <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Training (CRAFT) scheme resulted from the cost of claims under the schemes being less than assumed in the Budget. For NEAT the effects of the 1978 changes to benefits and conditions were greater than estimated and for CRAFT the average days attendance at educational institutions claimed was less than assumed. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Post-Budget decisions to provide additional aid for Kampuchea, Tanzania, Uganda and East Timor and assistance for Afghanistan and Zimbabwe refugees accounted for $15 million of the increase in this function. General administrative expenditure, mainly for the overseas operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Property Bureau, was $4 million more than estimated at Budget time. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Administrative Services</inline>- down $16 million </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Customs and excise administration expenditure was $7 million less than estimated. Factors contributing to this shortfall included the transfer, at the end of November 1979, of the Narcotics Bureau to the Australian Federal Police (included under the function &#39;Law, Order and Public Safety&#39;), delays in the procurement and delivery of communications and ADP equipment, and delays in Nomad aircraft becoming operational for use in customs coastal surveillance. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Recoveries under the function were $4 million more than estimated and resulted from relatively small increases in a large number of items, including rents and survey fees collected by the Department of Administrative Services, and the miscellaneous revenues of the Departments of Finance and Business and Consumer Affairs and of the Taxation Office. </para>

In the event several disasters, including cyclones in Queensland and Western Australia and drought in Queensland, occurred after the Budget estimates were prepared and the drought in Western Australia continued. Payments made for relief and restoration expenses associated with these disasters were the main factor contributing to outlays under this function exceeding the Budget estimate. </para>

      <para class="block">
        <inline font-style="italic">Customs Duty - Imports</inline>- down $32 million </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The shortfall was the net result of a higher level of imports and a lower ratio of duty to imports than estimated at the time of the Budget. The post-Budget decisions to reduce the rate of duty on brandy and to provide additional exemptions from the 2 per cent revenue duty are estimated to have cost about $6.5 million in 1979-80. </para>
      <para class="block">
        <inline font-style="italic">Excise Duty</inline>- up $194 million </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Receipts from the excise on crude oil were about $204 million higher than the Budget estimate as a result of higher parity prices, partly offset by lower production. On the basis of the production forecasts underlying the Budget  estimate, the increase in the import parity price on 1 January 1980 would have increased receipts by $405 million. Actual production was significantly lower than the level estimated at the time of the Budget mainly because of the effects of industrial disputes on Bass Strait production during May and June. Receipts from the LPG levy were $9 million higher than estimated at Budget time, largely as a result of the increase in the rate of excise on naturally occurring LPG from 9 April 1980. As in the case of the crude oil levy, the gain to revenue from the excise increase was partly offset by lower than expected production of excisable LPG; </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Receipts from other excise duties were $19 million lower than the Budget estimate, largely due to a shortfall in receipts from motor spirit. At the time of the Budget some growth in clearances was assumed. Preliminary data indicate that clearances were slightly lower than in 1978-79. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The post-Budget decision to reduce the rate of duty on brandy from $18.75 to $16.00 per litre alcohol is estimated to have resulted in a loss of excise revenue in 1979-80 of about $2 million. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Clearances of tobacco products in 1979-80 recovered more rapidly from the excise rate increase announced in the 1978-79 Budget than had been expected. Preliminary data indicate an increase in clearances of cigarettes of 3.1 per cent in 1979-80 which compares with a fall of 4.3 per cent in 1978-79 and virtually unchanged clearances in 1977-78. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Sales of household goods in the <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent rate class were somewhat lower than estimated at Budget time. In the 15 per cent rate class the effect of lower than estimated volume of sales of motor vehicles was partly offset by slightly larger price increases than expected; sales of goods other than motor vehicles and spare parts were also lower than the Budget estimate. Post-Budget measures relating to goods for handicapped people and the increase in the exemption level for small businesses reduced the estimate by a further $3 million. </para>
      <para class="block" pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax on Individuals - Pay-As-You-Earn</inline>- up $210 million </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The net overrun in PAYE receipts reflects larger than estimated Gross PAYE collections (by $137 million) and lower than estimated refunds (by $73 million). At the time of the Budget it was estimated that average weekly earnings would increase by 9 to <inline font-style="italic">9i</inline> per cent and wage and salary earner employment by 1 per cent in 1979-80. There is some disparity between the available employment indicators but both suggest that employment increased at a higher rate than estimated. </para>
      <para class="block">
        <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax on Other Individuals</inline>- down $298 million </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The shortfall was a reflection of several factors. First, the growth in 1978-79 income of primary producers was over-estimated at the time of the Budget. Secondly, an expected increase in the rate of issue of assessments was not achieved, resulting in lower than expected tax collections. The necessarily protracted administrative process involved for the Taxation Office in handling tax avoidance cases was one factor contributing to the slower issue rate of individual income tax assessments than originally estimated at Budget time. The estimated shortfall in revenue due to identified tax avoidance schemes was $160 million compared with the allowance of $175 million included in the Budget estimate. Thirdly, the Budget estimate assumed that amendments to the law concerning the tax treatment of trusts and other arrangements involving dependent children would be reflected in collections of provisional tax for 1979-80; this was not the case as the amendments were not enacted until the Autumn sittings of Parliament. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The Budget estimate for company tax assumed an increase of about 74 per cent in income subject to tax in 1978-79 (the year to which most collections in 1979-80 relate); in the event, company income subject to tax grew at a significantly higher rate (about 11 per cent).

        <title>FINANCING TRANSACTIONS</title>
        <page.no>318</page.no>
      </subdebateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">The manner in which the Budget deficit in 1979-80 was financed is summarised in Tables 1 and 2. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Table 1 is the presentation of Budget financing transactions, as published monthly in the Statement of Commonwealth Government Financial Transactions, rearranged to indicate the concept of Domestic Borrowings and its composition (see beloW). While Table 1 shows aggregate financing transactions, and the securities or financing instruments involved in those transactions, it does not bring out the net changes in the holdings of government debt of the various sectors with which the Budget sector transacts. These changes, which are relevant to analysis of the monetary implications of the financing of the Budget, reflect both net proceeds of government securities&#39; sales (subscriptions to new issues less redemptions) and subsequent market transactions in those securities. They are shown in Table 2. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The concept &#39;Domestic Borrowings&#39; is designed to indicate the increase in the indebtedness of the Commonwealth to domestic non-Budget sectors arising from Budget financing either by the issue of Commonwealth securities to domestic non-Budget sectors or by the use (running-down) of Commonwealth cash balances with the Reserve Bank. However, in the presentation in Tables 1 and 2, not all intra-Budget sector transactions are netted out so that the figure shown for Domestic Borrowings reflects not only transactions between the Budget sector and domestic non-Budget sectors but also certain transactions within the Budget sector itself. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">During 1979-80, there were sizeable transactions which, in essence, involved a transfer from Loan Fund to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve (LCIR) - and so were infra-Budget sector transactions - which are reflected in Domestic Borrowings. In the absence of conversion offers in December and February, the LCIR (which usually converts its maturing debt) redeemed maturing securities in its portfolio to an amount of $291 million; the LCIR held $207 million of the December 1979 maturity and $84 million of the February 1980 maturity. The increase in LCIR cash is reflected in Table 1 as an increase of $291 million in Other Financing Transactions, while the reduction in the LCIR&#39;s bond portfolio is reflected in reductions of $291 million in net proceeds of other loans in Australia in Table 1 and Government Sector domestic borrowings (bond holdings) in Table 2. To make the figures coincide more closely with the concept of Domestic Borrowings in the sense of net Commonwealth borrowing from the domestic non-Budget sector, adjustments should be made to the tables to exclude these transactions, i.e., in 1979-80 Domestic Borrowings in the sense mentioned above were about $1728 million. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">Table 2 shows domestic borrowings from banks and non-banks and, within each category, provides information on the major institutional groups. Such a categorisation is useful as the economic effects of financing transactions depend importantly on which of the non-Budget sectors hold the stock of government debt and the changes in those holdings. Private sector holdings of Commonwealth debt constitute the bulk of the liquidity base of the economy. Private sector take-up of Commonwealth debt instruments reflects a large number of influences on domestic liquidity conditions, including the size of Domestic Borrowings, interest rates, private sector external transactions and Reserve Bank transactions with the private sector. Other things being equal, take-up of government securities by the non-bank private sector provides an offset to the direct increase in banking sector liquidity and the volume of money that would otherwise accompany an increase in the domestic liquidity base. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Changes in debt by the main forms of security are also shown. This, too, is relevant information for the analysis of the economic impact of Budget financing transactions, although a full exposition would go beyond the fairly direct effects of those transactions reflected in Table 2. Other relevant effects include those on the maturity structure of the stock of government debt in private portfolios, the level and structure of interest rates and associated expectations. </para>

        <para>Domestic Product, (p) Preliminary, (e) Budget estimate. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The projected increase of 13.7 per cent in Budget outlays for 1980-81 is the highest since 1975-76. Adjusting for price increases as measured by the implicit price deflator for non-farm Gross Domestic Product, the &#39;real&#39; increase in outlays of 2.9 per cent implied for 1980-81 follows a small &#39;real&#39; decrease in 1979-80 and a small &#39;real&#39; increase in 1978-79. Over the five-year period to 1980-81 the estimates imply average real growth of about one per cent per annum. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">As a proportion of GDP, total outlays remained steady at around 24 per cent until 1974-75 when the proportion jumped to 28.9 per cent. It rose to 30.1 per cent in 1975-76 but has tended downwards since then. On the basis of present estimates, the proportion is expected to be about the same in 1980-81 as in the previous year. </para>
        <para class="block">Budget Outlays by Function </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Budget transactions for the period 1970-71 to 1979-80, together with estimates for 1980-81, are shown for the major functions in Table 1 at the end of this Statement. Table 2 shows the proportions of total outlays represented by each function over the period and Table 3 shows percentage increases for each function from year to year. Table 4 presents outlays data from Table 1 in greater detail. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Between 1970-71 and 1979-80, total Budget outlays increased at an average annual compound rate of 16.4 per cent (compared with 14.5 per cent for GDP). Outlays on education, health, and social security and welfare all increased significantly faster than the total and accounted for more than half the total increase over the period. Together these categories represented 46 per cent of total outlays in 1979-80, compared with 28 per cent in 1970-71. While part of this increase reflects changes in arrangements such as the assumption by the Commonwealth of full financial responsibility for universities and colleges of advanced education in 1973-74 and the introduction of a scheme of family allowances in lieu of taxation rebates in 1976-77, the major part of the growth reflects increases in standards of services provided and in numbers of beneficiaries (whether because of liberalised eligibility criteria, demographic change or economic conditions) in a situation where the value of many benefits has been maintained at an approximately constant level in real terms. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Another function for which outlays increased at a high rate was &#39;Law, Order and Public Safety&#39;, but those outlays remain a relatively small proportion of the total and accounted for little of the overall increase. Conversely, 21.1 per cent of the increase was accounted for by payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and local government authorities which cannot be allocated to other functions, not so much because of their rate of growth as because they form a large part of total outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Over the period as a whole, there have been significant reductions in the proportions of total outlays devoted to defence, housing and certain economic services; some of these were, however, again increasing in relative importance at the end of the period. Defence expenditure over this period reflected, inter aiia, Australia&#39;s involvement in, and withdrawal from, the war in Vietnam; from 1978-79 defence outlays have accelerated. The reduction in the relative importance of Budget outlays on economic services since 1970-71 reflects many factors, including the completion of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric scheme  and repayments in recent years of earlier advances to the AIDC and the Australian Wool Corporation. (In the area of industry assistance and development, particularly to primary industry, outlays can fluctuate markedly according to economic conditions.) The main factor, however, has been reductions in advances to the Australian Telecommunications Commission, Qantas Airways Ltd and the Australian National Airlines Commission (TAA) consequent upon those authorities funding more of their capital expenditure through internally generated funds and by borrowings on their own account. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The following table shows the increases in the main categories of outlays over the period 1970-71 to 1979-80: </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">It is emphasised that comparisons of relative movements in different blocks of expenditure are affected by a number of important factors including, in addition to those mentioned above, the transfer of payroll tax to the States, changes in the operation of certain retirement benefits schemes, changes in health care funding arrangements, the transfer of the South Australian and Tasmanian railways to the Commonwealth, the granting of self-government to the Northern Territory, and off-budget funding of the capital programs of Commonwealth authorities such as the Australian Telecommunications Commission. These and other factors, such as differential rates of price increase, affect relative rates of growth and must be borne in mind when comparing movements in different categories of expenditure. </para>

Over the period 1970-71 to 1979-80 the component of these payments represented by general purpose funds which cannot be allocated to specific functions decreased as a proportion of total outlays. In the mid-1970s there was a significant shift in emphasis towards specific purpose payments, but this has since been partially reversed. There has also been a shift in economic type from net advances to the States to grants. </para>

The figures for personal income tax in the past four years reflect the net effects of, inter alia, the Government&#39;s decisions on personal income tax indexation and rate changes, the abolition of tax rebates for dependent children which accompanied the introduction of family allowances, and the imposition and subsequent removal of the Health Insurance Levy. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">There is no satisfactory single measure of the economic impact of Budget transactions. The Budget deficit (or surplus) is sometimes taken as a shorthand or summary measure of budgetary impact but its use for this purpose is subject to some important qualifications. The deficit simply indicates the difference in total between outlays and receipts; it cannot adequately reflect the differing economic impacts of the various components of total outlays and receipts, or of changes in those components. The &#39;mix&#39; of Budget outlays and receipts, as well as their total size, can also be very relevant to the assessment of the Budget&#39;s overall impact on the economy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It is also important, as is pointed out in the next section, that the Budget deficit is only part of the total deficit of the Commonwealth sector. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">For analytical purposes it is useful to distinguish between domestic and overseas transactions: government payments made overseas do not add directly to domestic incomes or to the demand for locally produced goods and services, while government receipts from overseas sources increase total receipts without withdrawing purchasing power from the domestic private sector. In the above table overseas transactions have been netted out to arrive at estimates of domestic and overseas deficits (or surpluses). There was a substantial reduction in the domestic deficit in 1979-80 after it had been at historically high levels for five years. The projected outcome for 1980-81 represents a domestic surplus for the first time since 1973-74. The size of the Budget deficit is of considerable significance for monetary conditions and economic developments generally as, also, are the transactions by which the overall Budget deficit is financed.

        <para pgwide="yes">As the table shows, the Budget covers the great bulk of total Commonwealth Sector outlays and receipts, but Non-Budget Sector transactions make important contributions in certain areas. In particular, some three-quarters of Commonwealth direct capital expenditure is attributable to Non-Budget authorities. Until the mid-1970s almost all capital expenditure by authorities operating outside the Budget was financed by advances from the Budget and by the internallygenerated funds of the authorities concerned. Since then, however, a number of these authorities have undertaken substantial borrowing on their own account to help finance their capital programs. One consequence of this has been that the deficit of the Non-Budget Sector in recent years has ceased to approximate the level of advances to the Non-Budget Sector from the Budget; in 1979-80, for example, the proportion of the Non-Budget deficit met by Budget advances was 20.4 per cent compared to 85.3 per cent in 1970-71. It follows also that the deficit of the total Commonwealth Sector has tended to take on greater significance in its own right. Figures for the past decade are shown in the following table: </para>

The following table and Chart 1 show outlays as proportions of GDP for the public sector as a whole and for its two major components.

The remainder represents direct public sector demands on goods and services. The next table and Chart 2 show trends in this category of outlays for the major components of the total public sector; they illustrate the relatively stronger growth in net expenditure on goods and services by the State and Local Government Sector since 1975-76. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The table shows that public sector receipts did not jump as sharply as outlays did in 1974-75. The fact that the State and Local Government Sector has maintained the higher ratio of outlays to GDP it achieved in 1974-75 reflects, inter alia, the transfer of an increased proportion of Commonwealth receipts to the State and Local Government Sector. </para>
          <para>Deficit</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The divergence between rates of growth in public sector outlays and receipts mentioned above is reflected in the relatively high public sector deficit figures recorded each year since 1974-75. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Public Sector Deficits as Proportions of GDP</inline>00  Preliminary. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The significant fall in the total public sector deficit as a proportion of GDP in 1979-80 was almost exclusively due to the absolute reduction in the Commonwealth&#39;s deficit. The State and Local Government Sector deficit continued to increase in absolute terms and declined only slightly as a proportion of GDP. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Part of the deficit of the State and Local Government Sector is financed by advances from the Commonwealth Sector, though the proportion has declined in recent years (from over 50! per cent in the early and mid-1970s to 27 per cent in 1979-80). One corollary of this decline is that borrowings other than from the Commonwealth, such as those through semi-government and local authorities&#39; borrowing programs, have become an increasingly important source of funds for the State and Local Government Sector. Another is that, for monetary policy purposes, it has become more important to consider the total public sector deficit and not just the Commonwealth Budget deficit. </para>
          <para>Public Sector Borrowing Requirement</para>
        <para pgwide="yes">When, as is invariably the case, public sector outlays are not covered by receipts, the necessary additional resources are obtained by increasing the public sector&#39;s indebtedness to the nation - ie the resultant public sector deficit is met largely by .borrowing (in the traditional sense of that term) through loan raising, or by &#39;borrowing&#39; from the Reserve Bank in the form of printing money. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The size of the public sector deficit has important implications for the public sector call upon financial markets, regardless of how it is financed. If a deficit is financed through domestic borrowings, as traditionally conceived, there will be pressure on interest rates; and if the borrowing is by means which add directly to the money supply there will be inflationary implications with, in due course, similar effects upon interest rates; ie any short-run tendency for an increase in the money supply to restrain increases in interest rates is likely to be reversed in the somewhat longer run. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">If reducing interest rates is a policy objective, then this is an additional reason for concern as to the size of the public sector deficit. Even for a public sector deficit of given size, however, the method of financing that deficit is important for monetary management. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">To the extent that the public sector deficit is financed by borrowing from the banking system (including the Reserve Bank) or from abroad, the deficit results in a net addition to the domestic money supply. Within this, to the extent that the deficit is financed by borrowing from the Reserve Bank or from abroad, there is also an addition to the liquidity base of the system and hence, since the banking system may use this additional liquidity to support additional credit creation, to the potential for further increases in the money supply. To the extent that the total public deficit is financed by borrowing from the domestic private sector, this adds to the domestic demand for funds and exerts upward pressure on domestic interest rates. The outcome may well be that the public sector deficit is financed at the expense of private sector borrowing. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Estimation of the total public sector deficit is a complex task. The diversity of the State and Local Government Sector makes it very difficult to put consistent or timely data together, and there are consequent difficulties for forecasting. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">However, the centralisation of public sector borrowing activities in the Australian Loan Council allows a reasonable approximation to be made in terms of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR). The following table shows one measure of the PSBR, broken-up into Commonwealth and State and local government components. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">During most of the 1970s, the Commonwealth Sector - including borrowings on behalf of the States under the terms of the Loan Council Agreement - accounted for most of the total public sector borrowing requirement. This was in contrast to the previous decade when Commonwealth Sector borrowings were about the same as those undertaken directly by the State and Local Government Sector. The prominence of Commonwealth Sector borrowings in the 1970s mainly reflected the greatly increased Commonwealth Budget deficits from the mid 1970s - although not insignificant growth occurred in the deficit of the other sectors. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1979-80, however, the reduction in the Commonwealth Budget deficit and continued strong growth in the deficit of State and local government authorities brought the borrowing requirement of the Commonwealth and the State and Local Government Sectors back to roughly the same size. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The forecast PSBR for 1980-81- $4386 million or 3.4 per cent of estimated gross domestic product - represents a further reduction on the 1979-80 figure, which itself was substantially below the previous year&#39;s level. For both 1979-80 and this year, the reduction in the Commonwealth Budget deficit has more than offset the expansion in direct borrowings by the State and Local Government Sector. </para>
        <para class="block">Notes on Tables </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">To the extent practical, historical data have been adjusted to eliminate major breaks in series; however, some important changes affecting comparability cannot readily be removed. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">At the Premiers&#39; Conference in June 1971 it was agreed that the Commonwealth Government would cease to levy payroll tax in the States as from 1 September 1971 and that the States would levy their own payroll taxes as from that date. This decision resulted in a reduction in Commonwealth payroll tax revenues estimated at $253 million in 1971-72. To offset most of this loss in revenue, the Commonwealth reduced its financial assistance grants to the States in 1971-72. The full-year effect of these transfer arrangements is reflected in the 1972-73 figures for outlays and receipts. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The transfer arrangements had the effect of reducing the growth of Commonwealth Budget outlays and receipts below the rates that would otherwise have been recorded by approximately 3 percentage points in 1971-72 and by about 1 percentage point in 1972-73. The figures shown in the tables reflect these lower growth rates. Comparisons between 1972-73 and subsequent years are not affected by the transfer since no significant effects of the changeover continued beyond 1972-73. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The assumption by the Commonwealth Government in 1973-74 of full financial responsibility for universities and colleges of advanced education contributed to an increase in outlays classified to &#39;Education&#39; but also involved a compensating decrease in general purpose funds provided to the States. As a consequence, the rate of increase in Commonwealth Government resources devoted to education, as shown for the function &#39;Education&#39; in 1973-74, is somewhat over-stated. A similar effect occurred in 1 974-75, which was the first full financial year of the new tertiary education arrangements. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Changes in the operation of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits, Ministerial Retiring Allowances and Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Schemes affect outlays for 1973-74 and subsequent years under the relevant functions and receipts under the heading &#39;Other Taxes, Fees and Fines - Unfunded Retirement Benefits Contributions&#39;. These changes involved a move from funded schemes to unfunded benefit schemes. The implementation of a new Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme on 1 July 1976 gave rise to similar effects. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The scheme of Family Allowances introduced in 1976-77 involved the abolition of taxes rebates for dependent children and students, offset by substantial increases in family allowances in place of child endowment. The effect of this measure was to increase significantly the level of outlays under the &#39;Social Security and Welfare&#39; function in 1976-77, and to increase receipts from personal income taxation above what they would otherwise have been. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On 1 July 1978 the Northern Territory became a self-governing territory. Responsibilities transferred to the Ministers of the Territory from that date were mainly of a State-type character, as were the responsibilities transferred on 1 January 1977. In terms of financial arrangements, 1977-78 and 1978-79 were transitional years. During those years the Commonwealth provided the bulk of its assistance to the Northern Territory through global (general purpose) allocations which were recorded under the heading &#39;Not Allocated to Function - Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec&#39;. Prior to 1977-78, outiays on the Northern Territory were undertaken as direct Commonwealth outlays, rather than payments to the Territory, and were classified under appropriate functional headings. From 1979-80 Commonwealth financial arrangements with the Northern Territory mirror those which exist between the Commonwealth and the States. In 1979-80, in place of a global allocation, the Territory received a combination of specific purpose and general purpose payments, the former classified to the relevant functions and the latter to &#39;Not Allocated to Function - Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities nec&#39;. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The 1956-66 Housing Agreement was not renewed on its expiry at the end of 1970-71. Instead, the Commonwealth and State Governments agreed on arrangements under which housing allocations were to be met by States out of their approved Loan Council borrowing programs. Amounts totalling $160 million in 1971-72 and $166.9 million in 1972-73 were subsequently allocated by the States for housing projects similar in nature to those covered by the 1973 Housing Agreement. Tables 1 to 4 show these amounts classified to &#39;Payments to or for the States, etc&#39; instead of &#39;Housing&#39;. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Grants to the States for pensioner accommodation in 1977-78 and previous years are recorded under &#39;Social Security and Welfare&#39;. In 1978-79 the scope of this scheme was extended to allow wider eligibility and give the States greater flexibility in the application of the grants. In the light of these changes, grants under this program in 1978-79 and later years are now classified to the &#39;Housing&#39; function. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The figures in Tables 1 to 4 are not comparable in all respects with those given in the Budget documents in previous years because of certain revisions in the classification of items to the various functional headings. Significant changes to the functional classification are noted each year in the Appendix to the Budget Statements. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth Budget sector comprehends those transactions which are recorded in the Minister for Finance&#39;s statements prepared pursuant to section 50 of the <inline font-style="italic">Audit Act</inline> 1901. It includes all transactions passing through the Commonwealth Public Account, whether recorded in the Consolidated Revenue Fund, Trust Fund or Loan Fund. All transactions of the National Capital Development Commission are also analysed within the Budget sector. </para>

(a) In addition, transactions of the Defence Service Homes Corporation, which pass through a Trust Account within the Public Account, are analysed in the Non-Budget sector to allow consistency in the analysis of transactions over the period since 1970-71 ; from June 1975 to December 1976 the Australian Housing Corporation, which operated outside the Public Account, administered the Defence Service Homes Scheme. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">All the transactions of departments are recorded in the Public Account and are accordingly part of the Budget sector. Furthermore, many Commonwealth authorities, such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the CSIRO and the Industries Assistance Commission operate largely or wholly through the Public Account; to the extent that they do, their transactions form part of the Budget sector. Those of their transactions which do not pass through the Public Account (e.g. independent income and expenditure financed from that income) are recorded in the Non-Budget sector. </para>

          <title>National Accounting Conventions</title>
          <page.no>360</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">Underlying the classifications of information in the Budget Statements are national accounting conventions used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in producing data for the Commonwealth sector and for the economy as a whole. While there are some differences between the treatment of data in the Budget Statements and the treatment in Australian Bureau of Statistics publications (see below), the basic principles are generally the same and are those set out in the 1968 United Nations publication <inline font-style="italic">A System of National Accounts,</inline> which provides a widely accepted international standard. The use of national accounting conventions allows a consistent treatment of Budget transactions, other public sector transactions, and the transactions of the private sector. Their use thus facilitates an assessment of the interrelationship between the Budget and rest of the economy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A basic distinction is made in the Budget Statements between &#39;above the line&#39; transactions - outlays and receipts, the difference between which is the deficit - and &#39;below the line&#39; transactions - transactions undertaken to finance the deficit. Budget financing transactions are transactions in, or giving rise to, financial assets or liabilities and consist of borrowings and changes in holdings of financial assets such as cash and investments recorded in the Public Account, but excluding advances to other sectors. Such advances are more akin to direct expenditures and transfer payments in their impact and are accordingly classified above the line as outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Budget outlays consist of expenditure on goods and services, transfer payments (such as cash benefits, grants and interest) , and advances. Budget receipts consist of taxes together with interest, dividends, gross operating surpluses of Budget sector business enterprises, and proceeds from sales of existing assets. These categories are used in the National Accounts presentation of information in the Budget Statements. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The adoption of national accounting conventions requires that the receipts and outlay figures in the Statements show the <inline font-style="italic">net</inline> transactions of the Budget sector with the rest of the economy. Some important implications of this treatment are as follows: </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>The transactions of the three Funds forming the Commonwealth Public Account (the Consolidated Revenue Fund, Trust Fund and Loan Fund) are consolidated and inter-fund transfers are eliminated. For example, an appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund paid to a Trust Account through which ordinary government expenditure is channelled (e.g. the Housing and Construction Services and Decentralisation Advisory Board Trust Accounts and various research funds) and the receipt of that transfer from Consolidated Revenue by the Trust Account are netted and not themselves shown as part of either aggregate receipts or outlays; rather the expenditure of the Trust Account is shown in outlays. Thus only transactions between the Budget sector and the rest of the economy are presented. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>Budget outlays are intended to show the net extent to which resources are directed through the Budget to other sectors of the economy. Therefore, recoveries and repayments (usually recorded as Consolidated Revenue Fund receipts) are normally offset against the relevant outlays to arrive at net figures. For example, air navigation charges paid by airlines are offset against outlays on the provision of civil aviation services. Similarly, repayments of principal on advances are offset against the corresponding advances. </para>

            <para>Budget tax receipts are shown net of refunds. Thus income tax receipts, for example, are shown net of refunds of PAYE deductions. Similarly, remissions and reimbursements of import duties and sales tax are offset against taxation collections. Budget receipts include gross operating surpluses from activities in the Budget sector which are carried out as business-type enterprises, i.e. operating revenues less operating expenses other than depreciation. Dividends, etc. from Commonwealth business enterprises outside the Budget sector (which are usually paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund) are also included in Budget receipts. </para>

Interest paid on these loans is included under the outlay heading &#39;Public Debt Interest&#39;, while interest received on advances made to the relevant authorities is included as a receipts item. This has the effect of making the coverage of interest in the Statements the same as the coverage of the debt to which it relates. </para>

First, outlays on primary industry assistance are shown in the Budget Statements net of the relevant primary industry levies and charges but are shown by the Statistician on a gross basis. Secondly, net proceeds from the sale of uranium from the Commonwealth stockpile under arrangements made with certain companies are shown in the Budget Statements as revenues from sales of existing assets; in the Statistician&#39;s publications these transactions are treated as reductions in stocks and are netted off outlays. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It should also be noted that in the Statistician&#39;s publications separate data are not provided on transactions of the Commonwealth Budget sector and transactions of the Commonwealth Non-Budget sector; the two sectors are aggregated to show the transactions of the Commonwealth sector as a whole. </para>

          <title>The Functional Classification</title>
          <page.no>1</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">The functional classification brings together outlays directed towards like objectives or purposes. It thus facilitates presentation of information on the functional nature of Government activities and on the total resources devoted by the Commonwealth to those objectives or purposes. The classification is based on that set out in <inline font-style="italic">A System of National Accounts</inline> referred to earlier, and is essentially the same as that used in Australian Bureau of Statistics publications. The contents of each function are described briefly in the final section of this Appendix. The major functions are, of course, relatively aggregative in nature, but Statement No. 3 also shows outlays under each functional heading further dissected into subfunctions and individual expenditure blocks which lend themselves to more detailed comment and analysis. Within each function a separate line shows any departmental administrative outlays which are classified to that function but which cannot, for practical reasons, be allocated to particular sub-functions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">One limitation on the extent to which data can be dissected into detailed purpose oriented sub-functions or programs arises from the need to monitor and report monthly on actual outlays and receipts on a basis consistent with the annual estimates. To meet this need it has been necessary in practice to work largely from existing central accounting records. These records are built around the Appropriation Acts, which are the legal authority for expenditure rather than being detailed costing documents. The figures in the functional classification, therefore, have been derived essentially by reclassifying appropriation data, supplemented by a limited amount of additional data on large appropriation items which cover more than one function or purpose. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Functional categories do not necessarily correspond with appropriation or departmental structures. For this reason, votes and revenue heads under the control of a particular department may be classified under more than one functional heading, and it is not always possible to identify individual appropriation items in the Budget Statements. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although the basic aim of a functional classification scheme is to reveal the allocation of Government outlays to the broad purposes for which they are undertaken, such a classification cannot always be applied unambiguously. Particular outlays will often serve two or more distinct functions: military colleges, for example, may be said to serve both a defence and an education purpose. The application of a functional classification scheme therefore requires that an outlay be classified to a particular function; in this classification, that which it is considered primarily to serve. In the example quoted, the primary function is considered to be defence; this treatment is in line with United Nations recommendations. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Any single classification system cannot, of course, focus at one and the same time on every outlay characteristic that may be of interest to all users. Statement No. 3 brings together all Budget outlays undertaken for similar purposes, whichever department is responsible for them. To provide information on Ministerial responsibilities in relation to each function, a separate document, to be provided this year for the first time, will show a detailed functional breakdown of the outlays within each Minister&#39;s portfolio. This document, <inline font-style="italic">Functional Classification of Outlays - Departmental Estimates,</inline> to be made available shortly after the Budget, will indicate how much is contributed by each department to functions in which more than one department is involved. Supplementary information on particular aspects of outlays is also provided in other documents. The document <inline font-style="italic">Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure</inline> has already been mentioned; it presents detailed information on receipts, special appropriations and Loan Fund expenditures, and also provides details of estimates for some statutory authorities which are largely financed from the Budget. A separate Budget Paper is provided on <inline font-style="italic">Payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and Local Government Authorities.</inline> Other Budget Papers issued with the Budget Speech deal with the <inline font-style="italic">Civil Works Program</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Australia&#39;s Overseas Development Assistance Program.</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Changes in the Functional Classification </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">From time to time it is necessary to amend the functional classification to reflect changes in the organisation and coverage of government activities. Furthermore, additional information sometimes becomes available that allows, appropriation items that had previously been classified to a single function to be split between functions. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The more significant changes that have been made to the structure of the functional classification this year relate to the &#39;Education&#39; function and to &#39;Water Supply, Electricity and Gas&#39;. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The blocks within Education outlays have been restructured to show more explicitly the dissection of tertiary education funding between the Tertiary Education Commission Program and other payments, and of schools funding between the Schools Commission Program and other payments. In addition, a new category has been created for the School to Work Transition Program. The block grant to the States and the Northern Territory under the Children&#39;s Services Program for pre-school education, which was &#39; previously classified with the rest of that program as &#39;Assistance to Families&#39; within the &#39;Social Security and Welfare&#39; function, has now been reclassified to &#39;Education&#39;. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Reflecting the introduction of a scheme to subsidise certain non-commercial uses of liquefied petroleum gas, the function previously titled &#39;Water Supply and Electricity&#39; has been expanded and renamed &#39;Water Supply, Electricity and Gas&#39;. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Historical data for the period 1970-71 to 1979-80 classified by function are presented in Statement No. 6. Because data classified by function are derived from the appropriation accounting system, adjustments to the historical series are constrained by the availability of data in that system. In particular, significant changes to departmental administrative arrangements have made it difficult to produce a strictly consistent series of outlays for the period covered in the Budget Statements. Wherever possible the more important discontinuities have been eliminated by sub-costing and regrouping appropriation data, but it has not been practicable to eliminate all inconsistencies. Information on the significant discontinuities that remain in historical data is given in the section &#39;Notes on Tables&#39; at the end of Statement No. 6. </para>

            <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this and two associated Bills I shall introduce shortly is to give effect to all but two of the income tax proposals announced in the Budget Speech by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> earlier this evening. One of the proposals for which legislation has yet to be drafted will provide some relief from Australian tax on income earned by Australian residents from a foreign source by providing services overseas, where the income is not taxed in the country of source. This matter is explained in Statement No. 4 attached to the Budget Speech and the necessary legislation will be brought forward at an early date. The other proposal not included in the Bill is the provision of deductions for gifts to voluntary overseas aid organisations. As announced in the Budget Speech, the organisations that are to qualify for this concession will be determined by the Treasurer after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock).</inline> When that has been done, a further announcement will be made about this proposal. </para>
          <para>Superannuation for certain self-employed and employed persons </para>
          <para>A very significant Budget proposal dealt with in the Bill concerns superannuation arrangement for people who are self-employed or employees and do not participate in superannuation benefits funded by an employer. As indicated in the Budget Speech, the new deduction of up to $1 ,200 per annum is a significant incentive to encourage people who do not have the support of an independently funded superannuation scheme to make better provision for their retirement. </para>
          <para>The measure will also provide such people with a taxation benefit that is broadly comparable with that enjoyed where an employer contributes to a superannuation scheme for employees. Such contributions are, of course, deductible in determining an employer&#39;s taxable income. </para>
          <para>The major feature of the new arrangements is a special deduction of up to $1,200 a year for amounts contributed to superannuation funds which qualify under section 23 (ja) or section 79 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. These are the types of funds to which self-employed people and employees not covered by an employer-sponsored scheme at present contribute. They are in fact designed for such people. A section 23 (ja) fund is one that has at least 20 members and provides benefits for self-employed persons. The income from such a fund is exempt from income tax where relevant terms and conditions of the fund have been approved by the Commissioner of Taxation. A section 79 fund is a superannuation fund that provides benefits for either self-employed people or employees. Such a fund is entitled to a special tax deduction equal to 5 per cent of the cost of specified assets, provided its terms and conditions are approved by the Commissioner on the basis of rules set out in the section. </para>
          <para>Contributions made after today to a fund in either category will qualify for the new deduction but, reflecting its concessional nature, the deduction will not be capable of giving rise to a loss that may be carried forward for deduction in a later year. Contributions in excess of the deduction of $1,200 per annum will continue to be treated as rebatable expenditure, up to the existing limit of $1,200 for life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions, in the same way that contributions by employees to an employersponsored fund are rebatable. </para>
          <para>As part of the new arrangements, it is also proposed that S per cent of lump sums received after today from a section 23 (ja) fund or a section 79 fund will be treated as assessable income, but only to the extent that the amounts are attributable to contributions made after today and earnings derived from such contributions. This will, of course, accord with the treatment under the present law of lump sums received on retirement by employees from employer-sponsored funds. The 5 per cent basis will apply only where a person receives a lump sum in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to the fund at the time of payment, and only where the recipient has been allowed a deduction under the new legislation. Associated with this, and as a safeguard against exploitation of the new rules to obtain unintended tax benefits, it is proposed by another provision that, where a person receives or obtains a benefit from a section 23 (ja) or section 79 fund after today, and the benefit is received otherwise than in accordance with the approved terms and conditions of the fund, the full amount of the benefit will be treated as assessable income. </para>
          <para>Accelerated Depreciation of Plant and Equipment </para>
          <para>Another Budget proposal implemented in the Bill is the 20 per cent loading to existing depreciation rates applying to plant and equipment used in the production of assessable income. As mentioned in the Budget Speech, the Government has in recent years received representations to the effect that the present depreciation provisions do not recognise the rapid technological changes that are occurring in many industries. Because these changes vary as between industries and because they may in many cases be unpredictable, the Government has decided that the most appropriate way to give recognition to the problem is to provide a general 20 per cent loading on existing plant depreciation rates. It believes that this will encourage businesses to keep their plant and equipment up to date. </para>
          <para>The 20 per cent loading will apply in respect of both new and second hand plant ordered after today, with the exception of motor vehicles of the type now excluded from the investment allowance and plant for which special statutory rates are already available. In the latter category are certain employees&#39; amenities and scientific research plant that qualify for a prime cost rate of 331 per cent. Another example is structural improvements for on-farm storage of grain, hay and fodder. These already qualify for a special statutory rate of 20 per cent per annum. </para>
          <para>Certain Stockyards and Subdivisional Fences </para>
          <para>The Bill provides that primary producers are to be allowed an immediate deduction for expenditure on stockyards and subdivisional fencing where the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry certifies that it is desirable for these facilities to be constructed so as to assist in the control or eradication of brucellosis or tuberculosis in cattle. It is hoped that this incentive will give further encouragement to steps designed to stamp out these diseases. Certificates by the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry are to be given in relation to particular properties and may be revoked once the Secretary is no longer satisfied that construction of stockyards and fences is necessary for the purpose. This deduction will apply until the end of the 1983-84 year. </para>
          <para>Proceeds from the Death or Compulsory Destruction of Livestock due to Disease </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides a further measure of benefit to primary producers confronted with problems of disease in livestock. Under the existing law, a primary producer may elect to have any profit derived on a forced sale of livestock due to fire, drought or flood excluded from assessable income of the year in which it is derived, and applied instead to reduce the cost for income tax purposes of replacement stock acquired during that year or any of the five succeeding years. The Bill proposes to extend these provisions so that they will cover cases in which stock die or have to be destroyed because of a disease, the existence of which makes the stock subject to compulsory destruction. This amendment will apply in respect of stock that die or are destroyed on or after 1 July 1980. </para>
          <para class="block">Gifts </para>
          <para>The Bill contains amendments to give effect to the statement in the Budget Speech that deductions are to be allowed for gifts made after tonight to institutions certified by the Minister for Education as technical and further education institutions within the meaning of the Tertiary Education Commission Act 1977, or to the Marcus Oldham Farm Management College. Deductions will be limited to gifts made for certified purposes of, or the provision of certified facilities for, the bodies concerned. Certified purposes and certified facilities are those that relate to education at the tertiary level. The Bill also authorises a deduction for gifts to a prescribed Commonwealth institution as defined in the Tertiary Education Commission Act 1977 and to a residential educational institution affiliated with such a prescribed institution. At present, the only prescribed Commonwealth institution is the Australian Maritime College. The opportunity is being taken to remove from the gift provisions the now unnecessary requirement that gifts to colleges of advanced education are deductible only if made for certified purposes or facilities- that is, in practice, for purposes of tertiary education. The position is that all facilities and purposes of these colleges are now related to tertiary education and it is thus convenient to delete the certification procedures. </para>
          <para class="block">Provisional Tax </para>
          <para>Provisional tax is the part of the pay as you earn system designed to collect tax on income other than salary or wages within the year in which it is derived. Provisional tax arrangements seek to achieve reasonable consistency between the treatment of salary and wage earners and people whose income is from a business or from property. In the absence of provisions to the contrary, 1980-81 provisional tax would be calculated by applying 1979-80 rates of tax to 1979-80 taxable income, and taking into account rebates at their 1979-80 levels. However, incomes for 1980-81 will generally be higher than those for 1979-80 and, on the other hand, 1980-81 rates of tax are lower than 1979-80 rates. Moreover, dependant rebates for 1980-81 are higher than those for 1979-80. </para>
          <para>In these circumstances, it is appropriate that a varied basis be applied for calculating provisional tax payments for 1980-81 where taxpayers do not exercise their right to have provisional tax for the year calculated on the basis of their estimate of taxable income for 1980-81. In essence, the Bill provides that provisional tax for 1980-81 will be calculated on the basis of taxable income for 1979- 80 as increased by 7.5 per cent and applying to that adjusted income the lower rate scale applicable for 1980-81. Dependant rebates will be allowed in provisional tax calculations at the higher values set for 1980-81. The notional increase of 7.5 per cent is a conservative estimate of the average rise between the two years in taxable incomes of people subject to provisional tax. Taxpayers who consider that their taxable income for 1980- 81 will not increase by that much will, of course, have the option of self-assessing and having their provisional tax for 1980-81 recalculated on the basis of their estimate of their income for that year. A memorandum has been prepared to explain the detailed provisions of the Bill, and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">This is an annual measure which formally imposes personal income tax for 1980-81 at the rates declared in the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1976. Honourable members will recall that, following the economic statement by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> of 6 March 1980, the Income Tax (Rates) Act 1976 was amended in the autumn sittings to declare rates of tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for 1980-81. These rates reflect the decision that there is to be half indexation of the personal tax rates scale for the 1980-81 income year. </para>
          <para>It is worth recalling the effects of that earlier legislation. Application of the 3.8 indexation factor has meant that for 1980-81 the standard rate of 32 per cent will not apply until taxable income exceeds $4,041. It was $3,893 last year. The other steps in the scale have been correspondingly increased so that the 46 per cent rate will apply after $17,239 and not $16,608 as previously. The maximum individual rate of 60 per cent will not apply until the taxable income exceeds $34,478. It was $33,216 for 1979-80. The resulting tax reductions benefit all taxpayers and, together with associated increases in rebates for dependants, have been reflected in lower pay-as-you-earn deductions from 1 July last. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill will formally impose income tax for 1980-81 on the income of companies for 1979-80 and the income of superannuation funds for the current year. The rates of tax are also declared by the Bill and are the same as for 1979-80, with one minor exception. The exception is a superannuation fund taxed in accordance with section 121DA of the assessment Act. Such funds, which are broadly in the nature of accumulation trusts, are taxed at a rate equal to the maximum rate of personal tax and, in consequence of the change in the standard personal rate, the rate of tax for these funds is to be reduced from 61.07 per cent to 60 per cent for the 1980-81 financial year. </para>

            <para>- by leave - In his Budget Speech, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard)</inline> mentioned the major improvements to the social security and welfare system that will result from the 1980-81 Budget. I would like to elaborate on his statement and provide the House with additional information. Despite the economic circumstances and the need for expenditure restraint, the Government has again accorded high priority to its welfare programs and, in these, has shown greatest concern for those most in need. Social security and welfare outlays are estimated to increase by almost $900m in 1980-81 to about $9.9 billion. Over 27 per cent of Budget outlays have been allocated to social security and welfare. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the 1980-81 Budget, special priority has been given to improving support for children of pensioners and beneficiaries, for sole parents, the unemployed and the sick and disabled. We will extend and increase Commonwealth assistance for sole parents; increase Meals on Wheels subsidies and meals and accommodation subsidies for homeless people; increase rates of additional pension and benefit for children and mothers&#39;/guardians&#39; allowances; increase rates of handicapped children&#39;s allowances and double orphans&#39; pensions; substantially relax the income test for unemployment and sickness benefits; increase the rate of unemployment benefit for those 18 years and over without dependants; extend eligibility for pensioner fringe benefits to sickness beneficiaries; extend eligibility for pensions and benefits to patients in mental hospitals; expand the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service; pro? vide substantial funds for the first year of the new three year programs for facilities for aged and handicapped people; provide funds to assist the national response to the International Year of Disabled Persons; and increase rates of compensation for Commonwealth employees. </para>
          <para>
		  <inline font-style="bold">New Support for Sole Parents</inline>
		  </para>
        <para>An important initiative of the Fraser Government has been the progressive rationalisation of assistance for sole parents. In 1977 the Government extended assistance to sole fathers on the same basis as assistance to supporting mothers by introducing supporting parents&#39; benefits. In 1979 the Government extended pensioner health benefits to supporting parent beneficiaries on the same basis as for Class A widow pensioners. As a result, rates of direct Commonwealth assistance for sole parents, including fringe benefits, were made uniform. </para>
        <para>During this session of Parliament, the Government will introduce legislation to remove the remaining major limitation on direct Commonwealth assistance for sole parents. The six months waiting period for supporting parent&#39;s benefit will be removed. As a result, those sole parents who currently must wait six months for Class A widow&#39;s pension or supporting parent&#39;s benefit will be able to receive Commonwealth supporting parent&#39;s benefit immediately. </para>
        <para>The existing provisions relating to Class A, B and C widows&#39; pensions will remain unchanged. The decision by several State governments to withdraw support for sole parents during the six months waiting period for Class A widow&#39;s pension or supporting parent&#39;s benefit has created considerable anxiety and uncertainty amongst recipients. The Commonwealth&#39;s action will remove that cause of concern. </para>
		<para>
          <inline font-style="bold">Increased Basic Rates of Payments</inline>
		</para>
        <para>Most basic rates of pensions and benefits are subject to automatic, twice-yearly indexation. As a result, the standard rate of pension and benefit will increase by $3.05 a week in November to $64.10 a week and the combined married rate by $5.10 a week to $106.80 a week. These rates will increase automatically again in May 1981 in line with the movement in the consumer price index between the June and December quarters of this year. </para>
        <para>The following basic rates of pensions and benefits are indexed: Income-tested age pensions; invalid pensions; wives&#39; pensions; widows&#39; pensions; supporting parents&#39; benefits; sheltered employment allowances; the unemployment benefit for all people aged 18 or over with dependants and for married people aged 16 or 17 years; and sickness benefits for all people aged 1 8 or over and for married people aged 16 or 17 years. In addition, the unemployment benefit for those aged 18 or over without dependants will be increased from November by $2 a week to $53.45 a week. Rates of unemployment and sickness benefits for single people aged 16 or 17 without dependants will remain at $36 a week. </para>
        <para>A fixed rate pension is payable to those aged 70 years and over free of income test. This provides additional pension income to people when they turn 70 if their entitlement had previously been less because of the income test.

        <para>In addition to the increases in basic pensions and benefits, payments for the children of pensioners and beneficiaries are to be substantially increased. Additional pension or benefit for each child will be increased from November by $2.50 to $10 a week. Mothers&#39;/guardians&#39; allowances paid to single pensioners with children will be increased by $2 to $8 a week where there is at least one child under six years or an invalid child, and to $6 a week in other cases. </para>

Commonwealth expenditure on home care services for the aged will increase by 1 7 per cent to $ 1 2. 1 m in 1 980-8 1 . Subsidies are provided for housekeeping, home maintenance, gardening and other domiciliary services. The latest allocation represents a 1 13 per cent increase on the funding levels in 1975-76. In addition, $4m has been provided in 1980-81 for the first year of a new $12m three-year program for construction of senior citizens centres. An amount of $52.5m has been provided for the first year of a new $225m three-year program for aged or disabled persons&#39; accommodation. To date over 400 priority projects have been approved for funding in the years 1980-81 and 1981-82. </para>
        <para class="block">Support for the Sick and Disabled </para>
        <para>Assistance for the sick and disabled will be improved as a result of the 1980-81 Budget. The Government will extend eligibility for Commonwealth pensioner fringe benefits to sickness beneficiaries, subject to the normal fringe benefit income test. The discrimination that currently exists against certain mental hospital patients will be removed. From November 1980, pensions and benefits will be available to these patients on the same basis as to other members of the community. Wives of mental hospital patients may then qualify for wives&#39; pensions or continue to receive their current entitlement to widows&#39; pensions. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service will be expanded. A new rehabilitation facility will be planned jointly with the New South Wales authorities for the Newcastle and Hunter Valley area and new services planned for the western suburbs of Melbourne, in co-operation with the Victorian authorities. Two new work preparation centres for mildly intellectually handicapped people will be established; one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. Some $51m has been allocated for 1980-81 for the first year of a new three-year program of assistance under the handicapped persons welfare program. Some $155m will be provided in total for this program over the next three years. </para>
        <para>Already about 200 new proposals have been approved for funding under this program. As a result, new sheltered workshops, activity therapy and training centres and residential accommodation will be provided for over 2,000 disabled children and adults. Continuing strong support will also be provided for the maintenance of existing services. The Government&#39;s commitment to the disabled is demonstrated by the allocations in this year&#39;s Budget. Total spending on the disabled will be about $ 1,060m in 1980-81, 17.7 per cent more than in 1979-80 and 126 per cent more than in 1975-76. </para>

Emphasis will also be given to the prevention of disability. The disabled are, and must continue to be, closely involved in all planning associated with the Year. An amount of $900,000 has been provided in 1980-81 for national publicity and community information and for costs associated with the establishment and servicing of a National Committee of Non-Government Organisations and other major national events and reports. Funds have also been provided in the Budget for new proposals of other Ministers that will substantially benefit disabled people. I will report at a later date on the overall Commonwealth Government&#39;s response to the International Year of Disabled Persons. </para>
		<para>
          <inline font-style="bold">Children&#39;s Services</inline>
		</para>
        <para>In addition to the various cash payments for children, the Government provides, through its children&#39;s services program, financial assistance to community organisations, local government bodies and the States for a range of services for children under 18 years and services to support their families. A block grant is also made to the States and the Northern Territory for pre-schools. An amount of $33. 09m will be provided this year in the form of grants to the States and the Northern Territory for pre-schools. To assist with forward planning, these grants will, in the future, be made on a calendar year basis. A further $36. 13m has been allocated in 1980-81 for assistance for child care and other related services. </para>
        <para>Over recent years there have been significant changes in the overall pattern of grants made under the children&#39;s services program and in the services assisted by the grants. Many of the projects approved early in the program were large capital-intensive child care centres which have now been completed. Emphasis in new approvals has now moved away from large centres to smaller neighbourhood centres and other projects which require only minor modifications to existing buildings. </para>
        <para>There has also been a considerable widening in the types of services available to disadvantaged children and their families. There are now clearly identified program components directed towards young handicapped children, Aboriginal children, isolated children, children of migrants and of working parents, and also for homeless young people. Support is also provided for the families of these children. This is evidenced by the fact that in 1 975-76 $ 1 7m was devoted to funding such services whereas, in 1980-81, over $36m will be allocated for them. </para>
        <para>Assistance for Research and Welfare Co-ordination </para>
        <para>During the past year, the independent Social Welfare Research Centre at the University of New South Wales came into operation. Some $410,000 has been provided in 1980-81 for the Centre&#39;s operation. An amount of $583,000 has been provided for the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat. Grants for social welfare co-ordinating organisations have been maintained. The Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled and the Australian Council on the Ageing will receive grants of $160,000 in 1980-81 for activities associated with the co-ordination of services and the provision of advice to the Government. </para>
        <para>The Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled will also receive $469,500, the balance of the $500,000 grant towards the establishment of its national headquarters. In addition, it will also receive substantial assistance for its activities in connection with the International Year of Disabled Persons. The Australian Pre-School Association will receive $50,000, together with an additional sum for co-ordinating the activities of Lady Gowrie Centres. </para>

            <para>- by leaveDespite all the leaks associated with the Budget, the Opposition received the final Budget documents only two hours ago, and it is therefore impossible for us to comment in detail on all the aspects of the proposed changes to social security payments. Obviously the Opposition welcomes the increased payments, but I think it is important that the Australian people see these increases in the perspective of what is actually happening. This Government came to power in 1975 on the basis of its claim that it would be a low tax government. Let us examine what it has actually done. Between 1979-80 and 1980-81 the Government&#39;s income will increase by $4,8 10m. Income tax paid by individuals will increase by $2,030m in one year. Page 298 of Budget Paper No. 1 , presented today by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howard),</inline> shows that in 1975-76, in the last Labor Budget prepared by the then Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> the total tax revenue was $1 6,843m, and everybody was screaming about it. What is the proposed total tax revenue in the current Budget? It is $3 1,796m, or an increase of 88.8 per cent. Excise on oil in 1975-76 was $264m. In the next year - I am sure the Government has underestimated this amount - the estimated revenue from excise on oil and liquefied petroleum gas is $3,1 57m, or an increase of 1,096 per cent. </para>

              <para>- Thank you very much. If one examines page 298 of the Budget statement one finds that the income tax to be collected from individuals in the last Labor Budget in 1975-76 amounted to $9,2 19m. In the current year it will be $1 7,070m, or an increase of 85.2 per cent. That is the increase which has occurred during the last five years, under a government which claims that it is a low tax government. Total revenue has increased by 88.8 per cent. </para>

              <para>- The table compares, on a weekly basis, the income of tax paying families under the family allowance scheme with what it would have been with tax rebates and child endowment. In 1980-81 the tax rebate will be available only in conjunction with a zone allowance. It has been indexed to $360 per annum. Under the old system the tax rebate for all tax paying families would have amounted to $7 a week for each child. The child endowment for the first child under the system preceding the family allowance was 50c a week. The total amount received for the first child would therefore have been $7.50 per week. The family allowance, which replaced the previous arrangements, provides $3.50 a week. There is therefore a loss to every tax paying family with one child of $4 per week. For two children the tax rebate loss is $14. Child endowment would have been $1 plus 50 cents - a total of $15.50. The total family allowance paid to a two-child family is $8.50. The loss to that tax paying family with two dependent children is $7 a week. Age pensioners receive no increase whatsoever. </para>

          <para>I refer now to some of the other benefits about which the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> has spoken. The weekly unemployment benefit for those under 18 years of age is $36. The date of the last increase was May 1 975. The consumer price index has increased since then by 62.6 per cent. The benefit would now need an increase of $23.60 a week to maintain its value. The increase allowed for in this Budget is nil. The present payment for those over 18 years without dependants is $51.45 per week. The date of the last increase was May 1978. The consumer price index has increased since then by 20.5 per cent. The amount required to bring the benefit up to the original amount in real terms is $10.50 a week. The increase given in the Budget is $2. </para>
          <para>The present guardians allowance for people with children under six years is $6 a week. This was last changed in October 1969. The increase in the CPI since then has been 182 per cent. An increase of $10.92 is needed; the increase is $2. The childrens allowance for pensioners for each child 5 Off. each week is $7.50. It was last increased in November 1975 by the Labor Government. The CPI has increased since then by 55.7 per cent. There has been an erosion of the benefit. In other words, an increase of $4. 1 8 a week is required to bring it back to its original value. The amount by which it has been increased is $2.50 per week, approximately half the amount necessary. </para>
          <para>The accommodation subsidy for homeless persons has been eroded by 58c; the actual increase is 45c. The subsidy required to keep the Meals on Wheels in line with the CPI increase is 21c; the increase is 15c. The education allowances, which have been vastly decreased and not dealt with adequately, require an increase of $182 per annum; the increase is $110. An increase of $14.19 per week is required in the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme; the increase is $4.30 per week. The away-from-home allowance increase necessary is $10.38 per week but the increase given in the Budget is $4.52. </para>
          <para>Under the family allowance scheme increases of $ 1 .66 for the first child, $4 for two children and $6.87 for three children are required. No increase has been given. The original double orphans pension of $47.70 a month was granted in November 1975. There has been an increase in the CPI of 55.7 per cent. An increase of $26.56 is needed a month to keep the benefit at its real value; the increase is $8. 1 am trying to put the increased payments into perspective.

              <para>- During the last five years, since November 1975 when this Government came to power, the consumer price index has increased by 55.7 per cent. I make this statement for the benefit of the honourable member for Hotham. In the same period income tax for individuals increased by 85.2 per cent. Total tax revenue of this so-called low tax government has increased by 88.8 per cent. This can be compared with the increase in the consumer price index of 55.7 per cent. </para>

While the Government may be very proud of handing out folders which look impressive from the Department of Social Security on information for the 19 August 1980 Budget so that its members can go out to the electorate and pretend to the electors that they are doing well, I remind those who are more honest in the Government that the Government has not kept its benefits in line with consumer price index increases and has certainly not paid the increased benefits which ought to be available from a government which has increased its taxation revenue in the period by nearly 90 per cent. </para>

          <para>- Firstly, I congratulate the Government for its responsible Budget, with all its help to those in real need. The details of the National Health Amendment Bill and the Nursing Homes Assistance Amendment Bill were well described by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> in his second reading speeches. These Bills are being introduced for the benefit of all Australians. They are aimed at ensuring that taxes paid by Australians are not misused - a responsibility undertaken by this Liberal-National Country Party Government with an effect which has been seen in many ways. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Two points are covered by this legislation and they are straightforward. It is a pity that the Opposition has seen fit to make a lengthy speech complaining about everything. It is surprising that it sees fit to oppose the measures when all we are doing is knocking some crooks, saving the taxpayers money and helping pensioners. Honourable members on this side of the House care about pensioners. It is unfortunate that so much of this Parliament&#39;s time is taken up in combating the actions of a fraudulent few. We see it time and again. But this Government is determined to ensure that the taxpayers and, in the case of these Bills, the patients and registered health funds are protected against the cheats, the crooks and, let us face it, the real criminals. </para>
        <para>I will give some examples of the false information supplied in support of applications for nursing home fee increases. Details about the employment of a handyman at $141 a week and two clerks at $172 a week were included in an application for a fee increase. Later inspection showed that these people had not been employed and that the overpayments involved some $25,000. In another example the expenditure incurred showed leasing cost of $ 1 ,944 in respect of kitchen and laundry equipment owned by the proprietor. The actual charge was to cover the leasing costs of the motor vehicle of the proprietor&#39;s wife. On another occasion a cheque for $1,522 was drawn and then cancelled but not adjusted in the books, therefore overstating expenditure by this amount. </para>
        <para>In a third example a proprietor claimed for a clerk who was not employed and also padded wage costs to the extent of $48,000 per annum. In a fourth example a registered nurse and a nursing assistant were claimed on the standard staff roster when no such nurse was registered with the relevant board and the assistant was not known at the given address. A further example is the case of the proprietor who admitted to padding staff rosters and having falsified a complete wages book and a set of cheque butts. The falsification would have resulted in a fee increase of $ 1 .80 a patient a day of undetected expenditure. The last example is that of the inclusion in the expenditure for a year of $31,000 on an item which was not related to the nursing home. Wages claimed in another year included dummy staff and staff not related to the nursing home, thus increasing wage costs by $61,000. The benefits overpaid amounted to $54,000. </para>
        <para>Basically, these Bills are about the supply of false or misleading information which will return the proprietors of nursing homes money to which they are not entitled. Whilst the words of the original Bills may not have been perfect, the aim was there. Nevertheless we have seen a few unscrupulous proprietors taking unfair advantage of the system to the disadvantage of patients and health funds and thus the public and taxpayers in general. Many people suggest to me that we put too many Bills through Parliament. At first thought I would tend to agree. However, each one has a definite purpose. I would welcome any suggestions about other ways to overcome the few crooks who rip off the system. These Bills are important and necessary. </para>
        <para>Premises can be approved as non-government nursing homes subject to a number of conditions. The meeting of these conditions allows payment of Commonwealth nursing home benefits. One of the conditions is that the Government controls the fees. In practice, the Health Department approves a fee increase when the nursing home shows that its operating costs have increased. Commonwealth and registered health insurance nursing home benefits are reviewed annually. They are set to cover the fees being charged for 70 per cent of the beds in non-government nursing homes. This, of course, makes allowance for the minimum statutory patient contribution and the variation among States, but excludes the deficitfinanced homes. Whilst deficit-financed nursing homes have been required to submit audited accounts, proprietors of private non-government nursing homes have not. I believe that that is a very serious deficiency of the original Act. Honourable members can easily see how this could lead unscrupulous proprietors to furnish false information. On top of this, there are no penalties for submitting such false information. The patients, generally pensioners, would pay too much out of their own pockets, the Government and the registered funds would pay out more in benefits and thus all taxpayers would pay more. The patients are usually unable to protect themselves against such fraud, because generally they are of limited means, elderly or in frail health. The Government is, however, able to protect them and taxpayers by amending the Act. That is the reason for these Bills. </para>
        <para>In a similar field, this Government has been firm and fair in dealing with the provision of medical services. It provides tough penalties for people who act fraudulently in this area. These Bills provide penalties of the same magnitude for fraud in the nursing home fee situation. The penalties for offences under the National Health Act for the frauds discussed range to a fine of $10,000 or imprisonment for five years - quite a deterrent, I suggest. Also provided in the Bill is a change of penalty for the non-furnishing of records by a nursing home. The previous provision allowed the permanent head of the Department to revoke the nursing home approval. This is a tough step and is especially hard on the patients. The change now calls for a suspension or a revocation. This might not seem much of a change but under the Bill benefits will not be paid during suspension, the fees charged will be reduced by the amount of this benefit and the home must be run normally. Thus for the patient nothing will change, whilst the proprietor will be penalised according to the benefit payable to each patient. This will ensure the furnishing of records very quickly, I am sure. </para>
        <para>Of course, there is an appeal provision, in this case via the Minister. The Minister has indicated the support of industry in general. I am sure that he would have had no need to seek approval of the health insurance organisations, the patients or the taxpayers. After all, these Bills are directed only against the few crooks amongst the nursing home proprietors and are for the benefit of the patients and the taxpayers. I commend the Bills to the House. </para>

          <para>- The Opposition supports these pieces of legislation. They are designed to strengthen the capacity of the Commonwealth to intervene in situations where nursing homes are deficient with respect to their financial records. The measures can be seen within the context in which successive governments have sought to ensure that the substantial Government support provided to nursing homes results in the maximum benefit to the patient and not in excessive profits for those homes which are run on a profit-making basis. My own view is that health care should not be operated on the basis of profit. I think further that this area of nursing home care where such a high proportion of the patients are on pensions should ultimately be excluded from institutions which are run on the basis of profit. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is unfortunate in this country that the medical profession is so orientated to the principles of free enterprise capitalism and therefore so strongly opposed to reforms in the health care system which would seek to reduce profits or to transfer services to not-for-profit institutions. For example, the Australian Medical Association fought a bitter campaign in 1973 to oppose reforms which were introduced by the McMahon Government and administered by the Whitlam Government which would have had the effect of restricting Commonwealth subsidies with respect to nursing homes to those patients who were pensioners with pensioner medical service entitlements. This reform of course meant little in terms of financial savings as it was subsequently established that the additional pensioner benefit was paid in respect of 87 per cent of all nursing home bed days, a fact which also highlights the dependent economic status of the inmates of nursing homes. </para>
        <para>The AMA also opposed the Government&#39;s attempt to restrict entry of people into nursing homes by making it a condition of entry that intending patients be examined by a Commonwealth medical officer. With the introduction of emergency procedures this reform was to become generally accepted within the community as worthwhile. As Scotton has pointed out, nursing homes must be looked at in the context of a much broader range of policies concerning the care of the aged and it has to be recognised that government policies have placed too much emphasis on institutional care and too little on domiciliary and other services. </para>
        <para>Despite the fact that since 1969 successive governments have sought to redress the balance by subsidies to alternative services and types of accommodation, legislation has covered for example paramedical services, home help, delivered meals, personal care in hostels, cash benefits for caring relatives, senior citizens centres and subsidies for hostels and self-contained units, it would seem that we have advanced very little with respect to the fundamental problems which were being identified a decade ago. Indeed, the trends towards a greater proportion of the population being in the aged category and the tendency for people either to retire earlier by choice or be forced out of the workforce at an earlier age is likely to exacerbate the problems we will have to face in the 1980s. In part these problems flow from the fact that successive conservative government, with respect to welfare, have been, in the words of Hugh Stretton, amongst the meanest in the Western world. </para>
        <para>One wonders what the situation of aged people in this country would have been if it had not been for the Whitlam Government substantially raising the level of aged benefits. Professor Henderson found that 36 per cent of single aged males and 31 per cent of single aged females were poor. But then the less politically powerful groups dependent on welfare such as the unemployed have a sense of what that would have meant. Again, the only reason that unemployment benefits for dependent adults are at reasonable levels is because of the changes introduced by the Whitlam Government. The young unemployed and the people without dependants have remained in poverty for most of the period in which this Government has been in power. The attitude of the Fraser Government towards people dependent on welfare services can be summed up in its five years as harassment of the unemployed which marks it with a shame which will endure for years beyond its impending defeat. </para>

            <para>- I was seeking to put the subject matter of this legislation within admittedly a rather broader context in terms of government social policy as it affected people dependent on social security benefits of one sort or another, of which the nursing home benefits which are covered by this legislation are an example. I think in this context that is not unreasonable. I take up here a point that was made by the honourable member for Bonython <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Blewett)</inline> before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, which is to say that these particular piecemeal reforms in relation to nursing home administration and nursing home benefits represent reforms which do not necessarily go the heart of the issues which concern the aged and particularly the question of accommodation for the aged. I was going to suggest that this Government had certainly been extremely punitive in certain respects, particularly in relation to the unemployed. But I make the point that this Government- and I think, this legislation illustrates the point I want to make - has been singularly unimaginative in its whole approach to the question of social policy. Quite clearly, over a long period it has been recognised that a policy which is directed towards institutionalised care for the aged is a policy which has built into it certain fundamental deficiencies and that the emphasis needs to shift - I think successive governments have at least given lip service to this - from institutionalised accommodation as the prime emphasis in relation to the care of the aged towards a more comprehensive program of community based treatment. </para>

        <para>I think the honourable member for Bonython was suggesting earlier in this debate that a Labor Government would certainly seek over the longer term to work towards a situation whereby a comprehensive approach was developed for the care of the aged, whereby there was a real choice for aged persons between one system which is currently dominated by institutionalised care of one sort or another and different types or different patterns of care so that we were able in a sense to make reductions in the overall costs associated with health care, but at the same time were able to create a situation whereby as people moved towards a later stage in life, they felt they had a real choice. It is widely recognised that institutionalisation is not the best solution for many of the aged. Whilst it appears to families that they have met their responsibilities for aged relatives, for the aged themselves shifting into an institution is the greatest crisis they have ever had to face. But it becomes an acceptable alternative when families cannot care for them and their diminishing physical strength and health makes them fearful of the future. The 1975 Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, in referring to the aged remarked: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Experience has shown that such a change of environment is associated with anxiety and disorientation. The effect can be to reduce the expected remaining years of life. For those who do adapt to change they exist rather than live. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That point made by the public inquiry is extremely important and ought to be underlined. There are thousands of people currently in nursing homes and hostel accommodation for whom that type of accommodation is singularly inappropriate. But once they are placed within that total institutional context, in a sense their capacity to move out of it is progressively diminished over time. That means that people who have a capacity to be independent within this type of accommodation very often are made rapidly dependent. Indeed, the kind of subsidies that are provided to institutions that have very often as their object the making of profit are specifically designed to encourage people to remain within institutional care rather than for people to achieve the maximum degree of independence for which they are capable at a particular stage of life. That is the major point I want to stress in this speech. </para>
        <para>In 1977 the Holmes Committee reported on the care of the aged and infirm and pointed out that the aged were taking a larger and larger share of the Federal Budget while, and I quote from the report:  their standards of accommodation and services had shown little real improvement. </para>
        <para class="block">The Committee suggested that despite large sums of money spent by the Commonwealth on income and service support there were still large numbers of people lonely and destitute. Many areas lack even rudimentary domiciliary care programs and long lists remain of people wishing to enter nursing homes. The Committee pointed out the causes of these problems as being largely the ad hoc way in which this program was developed. That point does not refer simply to the legislation that we have before us tonight but to the whole package of legislation that has been developed to take care of a range of services provided for aged persons. </para>
        <para>Secondly, there is a lack of co-ordination between various levels of government. I believe this to be a critical problem in this area. I have been very surprised that a government which made so much of that issue in 1975, and more recently received a major report, the Bailey Commission report, on the subject has not acted at all on that point and has not moved towards increasing the co-ordination that exists between the three levels of government which are necessarily involved in delivering services to aged persons. Thirdly, in the past, concentration on institutional accommodation has been the pattern, rather than a concentration on the development of comprehensive domiciliary services. </para>
        <para>Finally, there is an absence of effective assessment and rehabilitation procedures which could more efficiently match services to needs. Despite improvements that have been made in the legislation in the past, to which I referred earlier in my speech, the reality is that we do not have very often at the local community level the capacity to make an assessment of just what type of care people may need at a particular stage in their lives. The result is that we have people located in a type of accommodation which is not only more expensive than perhaps they may need, but also very often is the type of accommodation which results in people having a deteriorated capacity, rather than an increased capacity, to look after themselves and to live a relatively independent life within a local community. </para>
        <para>Quite clearly, if one is to resolve these problems, a comprehensive community care program is required which will enable existing nursing homes and accommodation services to be coordinated into a wide-ranging, far-reaching community based program. It should be recognised how important the nursing home is within the context of psychiatric treatment, particularly in care following a period in a mental institution. The Commission of Inquiry into Poverty which reported on the social and medical aspects of poverty cited studies undertaken in Sydney which show that a very high proportion of people leaving psychiatric care go to nursing homes. It referred also to statistics which show that a very high proportion of older psychiatric patients returned to hospital for further inpatient treatment. Health workers in my electorate are extremely critical of the quality of care being provided in many nursing homes and hostels in which they are forced to place people who are discharged from psychiatric hospitals. There would appear to be many deficiencies within these institutions not only with respect to the quality of diet but also, even more seriously, with respect to the type of program, or the lack of any kind of therapeutic program, which might assist people to remain active and to keep open the possibility that they will return to live within the normal community. </para>
        <para>While this legislation, which is currently before the House, may do something to tighten up the standards it, of course, is a negative measure which does nothing to move towards the situation of comprehensive community based care which should be provided. The problem with this Government is illustrated by its obsession with saving money which is illustrated in the current club, a paraplegic campaign being organised by the Department of Social Security. It lacks any real sense of vision or any sense of where it is going in terms of long term programs and long term care for important groups in the community such as the dependent aged. The Government in supporting without significant alternatives the total institution mentality is, in fact, providing a formula for greater expense in the long term. However, the reality is that the alternatives which might provide long term savings are not cheap either. I believe the establishment of community health centres both of the general and psychiatric type represent a major step towards providing a basis at a local community level of comprehensive community care systems. However, this Government has resisted the expansion in this system and has most recently announced that it was cutting back funds for community health centres this year by 1 0 per cent in real terms. </para>

            <para>- The reality is that there can be no solution to problems posed by nursing homes without radically different approaches which, at least, need to be initiated by the Commonwealth in terms of the development of national policy and provision of some incentives to work towards that policy. If the Commonwealth fails to move, the result will be that more resources will be absorbed in new capital funds for expensive institutional care and fewer resources will be available for the community based care that everyone agrees ought to be the greatest priority. More seriously, there is a need for a fundamental rethink about the aged, particularly in the light of the increasing proportion of the aged in the population which we can expect over the next several decades. Some services for the aged could be provided cheaply and easily. For example, I recently held a meeting of representatives of various institutions and groups serving the aged in my electorate. It was quite clear that the major priority that people at that meeting had was the need for simple local transport systems which would enable aged people to move from their homes or from institutional accommodation, such as nursing homes, to participate in normal community activities such as shopping, attending clubs or local concerts or activities just where people could feel part of the community. At the same meeting a number of people who were living in their own houses suggested that assistance with simple repairs around the house was also a major priority. In fact, at the same time as people are talking about these kinds of needs, we find the Government funding expensive capital requirements. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>-  This evening I wish to raise a matter that comes within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr John McLeay).</inline> It relates to an area in my electorate called the Addison Road Community Centre. Members of the House may not be aware that in 1973, 1 think it was, the Addison Road land which used to be the Leave and Transit Depot of the Department of the Army was transferred from the Department of Defence to the Department of Administrative Services, which subsequently conducted an inquiry into the community use of that land. It handed over the land, on a yearly lease, to the Marrickville Council for use as a community centre. For some years both my predecessor, the Honourable Frank Stewart, and I pursued with the Department of Administrative Services the question of the final outcome of the use of this land. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Addison Road Community Centre, which is a very active and useful group in my electorate, also has been pressing both the State Government and the Commonwealth Government about the outcome of the use of the land. A number of migrant groups in that area are using the property, and a number of local community groups are using it as a community centre. They have not been able to get a long term lease. They have arranged with a bank in the Marrickville area for a loan of $50,000 to upgrade a community hall on the site but they cannot obtain the loan until they can get some form of tenure of the site or of the premises on the site. I have written to the Minister for Administrative Services about this matter on a number of occasions. My predecessor, Frank Stewart, also wrote to the Minister about this matter. </para>
          <para>The absolute lack of information from the Department about this matter concerns me. I have what one might call a chronology of unanswered telegrams and letters to the Minister asking the simple question: Who owns the land? Is the Commonwealth attempting to transfer the land to the New South Wales Government? If it is, where does the land stand and who will get the lease? I have sent the Minister a number of telegrams but have received no reply. A few weeks ago I spoke to people in the Minister&#39;s office, who assured me that they would ring me back and tell me what the situation was. No phone call came, and I have continued to send telegrams to the Minister on the matter. </para>
          <para>When people go to the trouble of arranging a loan from a bank, when they put up over a number of years with the lack of assistance and information from the Commonwealth about the use of a large parcel of land which has been used for years for community activities, it is rather appalling. The Government and the Minister should make a decision as soon as possible either to transfer or sell the land to the New South Wales Government, or to give it to the Council or to the community group. A decision needs to be made so that the people there who are trying to do a job for the area in which they live can get some indication of the future use of the buildings on the site and of the land. A number of old huts and Army buildings on the site are fire traps. Some of them have been burned down already. No one can insure the buildings because no one knows who owns them. The people find that the asset they thought they were being given is being taken away from them by the attrition of time. </para>
          <para>I hope that the Minister will take note of the matter I have raised tonight in Parliament. I was rather loth to mention it as I had hoped that it could be dealt with by telephone, telegram or letter. Obviously that sort of thing does not get through to the Minister. I hope that he will make a decision so that the people who are using the land and doing something for the community in Marrickville can get proper tenure, thus enabling them to obtain the loan from the bank. I implore the Minister to make an urgent decision on this matter, and to show some common courtesy to the people of this community and their representatives on the Council and in the State Parliament and this Parliament by providing a reply to correspondence and telegrams. </para>

            <para>- The matter I wish to raise is one of concern to me and indeed to other members of the Parliament including some members of the Opposition- and I have spoken to a couple of them - who are experiencing some of the problems I have experienced in the area of the migration of people from the Philippines to Australia. I must stress that I certainly have no personal objection to Australians going to the Philippines and marrying Filipino women but I do express some concern at the spate of introduction services which are being advertised in a number of newspapers and magazines. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It would seem that in excess of 30 agencies are now operating in most States, all arranging introductions for a fee, which in some cases is quite substantial. The same problem has been raised in the Queensland Press by the Queensland Sales Manager of Qantas Airways Ltd, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brian</inline> Kirkham, who has expressed concern that package tours of the Philippines are being sold by some introduction services with profits of about $1,000 a head to the agency. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kirkham</inline> has said that an investigation is being carried out by Qantas as to whether the airline is wrongly being associated with what can only be described as a blatant ripoff inasmuch as the excursion airfare and accommodation package to the Philippines could normally be bought from that airline for about $800. If one adds the cost of female company, which he estimates to be $200, it means a profit of about $ 1 ,000 to the agencies concerned. </para>
          <para>He also said that many of these relationships developed into a form of marriage with a desire for the girls concerned to return to Australia. The other introduction services may be quite legitimate, but people entering into this form of marriage should be made aware of the fact that normal immigration procedures must take place before entry to Australia can be made. Although a form of marriage is often conducted in the Philippines, an additional marriage ceremony must be undertaken and the marriage registered in Australia. Normal security and health checks have to be made and these procedures can take several months. </para>
          <para>I am concerned about the number of people who have come into my office in recent weeks asking for assistance to bring in their wives a matter of days after they have returned from Manila. As an example of the magnitude of the problem, in my electorate alone there have been 1 7 such cases in the last three weeks, and I should imagine that a similar spate of inquiries would have been experienced by other honourable members. Nobody has taken the time to explain to these people the Australian immigration requirements and that in fact there can be absolutely no guarantee that their applications will be accepted. </para>
          <para>I have also experienced one or two cases in which a great deal of heartbreak and hardship has arisen from some of these arranged marriages because of the raiding of joint cheque accounts and indeed pressure from the people concerned to bring in other members of their families from the Philippines once they arrive. One lady in my electorate left her husband never to be seen again but her family was established here. Once again I do stress that it is not my right or the right of any of us to interfere in the happiness of any citizen but we do, I am sure, have this responsibility to point out the pitfalls which can arise from these arranged marriages. Obviously, some of them result in meaningful relationships, but I am sure that a number of us have seen the other side of the coin when the marriage has ended in absolute disaster. </para>
          <para>I would just like to stress again that my purpose in raising this matter tonight is, firstly, to warn people of the sharp practices of some of the tour operators charging up to $2,000 for these introduction tours to the Philippines and, secondly, to warn prospective travellers to the Philippines for arranged marriages that they must comply with the normal regulations and delays required by the Australian immigration authorities. </para>

		    <para>The defendants in the proceedings to which the honourable member refers were discharged on 16 Februray 1979. On that day counsel for each defendant applied for an order for costs against the informant. That application was heard in stages and on 17 December 1979 the Magistrate, Mr Leo, S.M., delivered a judgment to the effect that the informant should pay the costs of Mr Whitlam, Dr Cairns and Mr Justice Murphy (but not of the late Mr Connor) in respect of certain a parts of the proceedings before the Magistrate. The Magistrate did not then fix an amount of costs but adjourned the proceedings to provide the parties with an opportunity to agree on quantum. No agreement on quantum had been reached at 14 July 1980. The proceedings stand adjourned to 29 August 1980.</para>

		  <quote>
		    <para> Is it a fact that during the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's inquiry into the transfer of shares to WIN4 Wollon- s gong last year from the News group of companies to interests a associated with Mr Bruce Gordon, the chairman of the Tri- a bunal announced that he was in a conflict of interests situation. Is it a fact that the conflict of interests arose because of his close personal and business relationship with Mr Edwin u Maxwell Cowley, who is one of the trustees of shares in WIN4 for Mr Gordon, and with Mr Gordon himself. Is it a fact that the chairman said that he would take no part in the deliberations of the Tribunal because of his conflict of interests. Is it a fact that, whilst Mr Gyngell abstained from voting at the meeting of the Tribunal on 28 July 1979 at which the WIN4 transaction was considered, he was present at that meeting while the other Tribunal members deliberated on the matter</para>

          <para>Hospitals - lt is likely that Federal Members and Senators also attended official openings of hospital projects within State programs which received Commonwealth financial assistance under the now-terminated Hospitals Development Program. However, Commonwealth financial assistance under this program related to the respective States&#39; total programs and was not allocated to individual projects. Accordingly, the honourable member&#39;s question is not construed as being relevant to these types of projects. </para>

          <para>These lengths are based on the worst season, October to March using a reference temperature of 25.6&#176;C. </para>
          <para>Qantas has eleven B747 aircraft fitted with JT9D-7F engines. The first six B747 aircraft purchased by Qantas are fitted with Pratt and <inline font-style="italic">Whitney</inline> JT9D-7A engines which require approximately 200 metres more runway. </para>
          <para>My Department noted that the reference temperature of 25.6&#176;C used in the Qantas calculations is exceeded for about 1 9 per cent of the year. During such periods a longer runway would be needed to permit the same pay load to be carried. Further, my Department noted that the DC 10 aircraft required a 3,200 metre runway to achieve full pay load capacity to Singapore. </para>
          <para>This information confirmed my Department&#39;s proposal to provide a 3,500 metre runway to cater for future requirements. </para>
          <para>The Qantas evidence to the PWC stating that a 200 metre extension to the existing runway with 200 metres of clearway (giving a total length of 2,745 metres) would give full passenger and cargo pay load on routes to Singapore, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Honolulu and Tokyo, referred to aircraft powered with Rolls Royce RB 21 1-524D4 engines. Delivery of these aircraft is expected to commence in 1981-82. A number of the twenty-one aircraft previously purchased by Qantas could be expected to be in service after 1 986, thus requiring the greater runway lengths. </para>

These conclusions were reached after a study of the Report of the Administrative Review Council and after consultation by my officers with other Departments in accordance with the usual practice that all Departments directly affected by a particular subject are consulted before the Minister concerned puts his proposals on that matter before the Government. </para>

              <para>1 ) to (3) The conditions for release of Cabinet archives were set out in 1972 by the then Prime Minister in a statement dated 26 January 1972. A general 30-year access rule was determined in place of the then existing 50-year access rule, and the statement explained that before the papers were made available they would be examined in accordance with normal archival practice and policy to identify any papers which should not be released according to categories which were set down in that statement. The then Government authorized an interdepartmental committee to examine war time Cabinet records for public release. The Committee completed the task of examining Cabinet war time records in 1973 and has not met since. The bulk of war time Cabinet records became available for public access in 1 973. </para>

          <para>Cabinet documents through the period 1945 to 19 December 1 949, the period of the Chifley Government, have been made available for public access annually under the 30-year access rule and in accordance with archives practice. For example, of over 2,000 Cabinet documents of the Chifley Government, 10 only are subject to restriction and three of these have only certain portions restricted. Documents for the period 19 December 1949 to I January 1950 were made available for public access early in 1 980. </para>
          <para>It is the convention that until released for public access, the Cabinet documents of the governments of one political party are not made available to governments of another political party. Accordingly, under the authority of successive Prime Ministers, the Cabinet Office has been given the task of clearing Cabinet records for access in accordance with the established criteria. The vast bulk of Cabinet records have been made available publicly in accordance with the 30-year rule and very few documents have been withheld. In the event of any dispute about a particular Cabinet document, the facts of the matter would be brought to the attention of the Prime Minister for decision. </para>

Where remoteness or other site difficulties are encountered, the time taken to complete an installation can exceed one month. </para>

          <para>So far as European countries (members of the OECD) are concerned, it is understood that the tariff for telegrams covers all forms of delivery, i.e. regardless of whether the message is for delivery by messenger, to a telex or telephone number, code address, etc. In Australia, differing charges apply in such circumstances.

          <para>It is, of course , extremely difficult to draw meaningful comparisons between the cost of a partiuclar product or service in different countries.

              <para>Of the complaints and inquiries made to the Trade Practices Commission over the last five years 206 complaints and 37 inquiries concerned the food industry.

              <para>Each complaint received by the Commission was examined and an assessment made as to the likelihood of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act being made out. Sometimes the matters raised by complainants bore no relation to the provisions of the Act. The facts will sometimes provide a defence against the relevant provisions e.g. in relation to complaints of price discrimination, quantity discounts are given which do not appear to be out of line with likely economies of fewer deliveries and larger drops per delivery. In other cases the particular market will appear to be such that competition is unlikely to be substantially lessened, which is a requirement before most sections of the Act are breached. </para>

          <para>While this thorough screening narrowed the field, many cases remained where it seemed that the Act may have been contravened. In these cases involving milk and dairy products, liquor, tobacco, smallgoods, meat, fruit juice, margarine, oysters and pastrygoods, detailed investigations were conducted. Some complaints were taken up in the course of adjudication inquiries. In some cases further information was obtained which indicated that any attempt to prosecute would be unsuccessful. Court cases have been instituted involving bananas, beer (2 occasions), bread (2 occasions), fruit and vegetables and glucose. </para>
          <para>The case involving price fixing by five Adelaide hotels resulted in the following orders: an injunction restraining the Morphett Arms Hotel and the Royal Oak Hotel from fixing the allowance for bottled beer the Royal Oak to pay a penalty of $8,000 the Morphett Arms to pay a penalty of $5,000 the Royal Oak and the Morphett Arms to pay three quarters of the Commission&#39;s costs the Commission to pay the Norwood Hotel&#39;s costs the Commission to pay one half of the Rex Hotel&#39;s costs the Commission to pay one third of the Old Lion Hotel&#39;s costs. </para>

              <para>Information on the number of persons classified by doctors as disadvantaged in terms of health care as at 31 December 1979, is not available. However, some information is available on the number of persons who received services on which a medical benefit was paid at the disadvantaged rate in the latter part of 1979. From this information, it is estimated that the monthly average number of persons classified as disadvantaged by medical and optometrical practitioners was about 1 70,000 at the end of 1 979. It is emphasised that this estimate relates to the monthly average number of persons who received services and not the number of persons who might have been classified as &#39;disadvantaged&#39;, had they sought a medical service.

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>When announcing the establishment of the United States&#39; first comprehensive radioactive waste management program, President Carter said &#34;... Past Governmental efforts to manage radioactive waste have not been technically adequate. Moreover, they have failed to involve successfully the States, local governments, and the public in policy or program decisions. My actions today lay the foundation for both a technically superior program and a full co-operative Federal-State partnership to ensure public confidence in a waste management program&#39;. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>President Carter&#39;s statement also explained that the site for the first full scale repository in the United States will be selected by about 1985 and will be operational by the mid-1 990s. The development of such a repository will proceed in a careful step by step manner while ensuring full public participation and maintaining the full co-operation of all levels of Government, so that technical or scientific standards will not be compromised out of haste. </para>
          <para>The establishment of the President&#39;s Waste Management Program is predicated on the existence of technology which will enable the assessment of suitable geological sites for nuclear waste repositories. The Inter-Agency Review Group on Radioactive Waste Management which reported to the  President  in March 1979 found that &#39;. . . Present scientific and technological knowledge is adequate to identify potential repository sites for further investigation. No scientific or technical reason is known that would prevent identifying a site that is suitable for a repository provided that the systems view is utilised rigorously to evaluate the suitability of sites and designs, and in minimising the influence of future human activities&#39;. </para>
          <para>The  President  went on to say that &#39;Based on the technical conclusions reached by the IRG, I am persuaded that the capability now exists to characterise and evaluate a number of geologic environments for use as repositories built with conventional mining technology&#39;. </para>
          <para>These statements reinforce the Australian Government&#39;s view that the technology exists for the safe management and ultimate disposal of highly radioactive waste. </para>
          <para>I also noted in my statement to the House on 25 August 1977 that the technology for solidification of high level radioactive liquids was being developed to a commercial scale and that this technology had not hitherto been put into full scale use as the commercial quantity of waste had not warranted a fully commercial process. The vitrification process for solidification of high level waste is now operating on a commercial scale in France and the technology has been adopted by the Federal Republic of Germany. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The concept of medical rehabilitation permeates the whole range of medical activities. Rehabilitation commences as soon as treatment for an injury or illness commences and continues for the whole course of a patient&#39;s progress through the health care system. It is therefore impossible to distinguish in a health service the whole rehabilitation process as distinct from the treatment process. Even in those hospitals which provide specialised rehabilitation units, management reporting systems usually do not allow costs of individual units to be singled out. Therefore as far as hospital services are concerned, the information sought by the honourable member is unobtainable. </para>
            <para>The funding of rehabilitation services has been an important and significant component of the Community Health Program since its inception in 1973-74. There are 80 projects currently funded under the Community Health Program which can be categorised as providing rehabilitation services as their primary function. Details of Commonwealth and State expenditure on these projects for the financial years 1973-74-1978-79, and 1 July to 31 March 1980 (the latest period for which expenditure figures are currently available), are shown in Table I below. It should be noted that many other projects approved for funding under the Community Health Program also provide rehabilitation services, but not as the primary function of the projects. Financial details in relation to the rehabilitation component of the activities of such other projects are not available. </para>

            <para>Telecom Australia has advised that it arranges for the cleaning of public telephone cabinets and instruments (using an approved disinfectant) on a contract basis. Where public telephones are located on Post Office premises they are cleaned and inspected on a daily basis by Australia Post staff. Public telephones in other locations are cleaned and inspected by private contractors to Telecom Australia who are required to visit each installation at least once every seven days. Where conditions make it necessary, e.g. heavy usage or location in a dusty area, installations are to be inspected, cleaned and disinfected more frequently. Contractors are also required to promptly undertake special additional cleanings of cabinets which are reported seriously fouled. Coin clearance officers visit public telephones on a regular basis and their duties include the inspection of the telephones and cabinet to ensure that the cleaning contractors are performing their work satisfactorily. </para>
            <para>The combination of the visits for cleaning and coin clearance functions means that public telephones in locations other than Post Offices are visited a minimum of twice weekly. Those which have a high usage rate and/or are situated where conditions dictate more frequent cleaning are visited three or more times weekly. </para>
            <para>Telecom considers the arrangements outlined are adequate to ensure a satisfactory standard of cleanliness for public telephone installations. </para>

              <para>Section 39a (1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 protects the enrolment and voting rights of members of the Defence Force serving overseas.

Wives and dependants are in the same category as other civilians overseas at the time of an election, i.e. if they were already enrolled before they left Australia and have a fixed intention of returning to live within the Subdivision for which they are enrolled, they would be entitled to a postal vote; if not, they would not be either qualified or entitled to vote. </para>

          <para>I can, however, enlarge on my answer of 27 March when I said that many foreign governments do not permit Australian migration advertising. </para>
          <para>The levels of control vary greatly. </para>
          <para>Some countries have enacted legislation specifically forbidding immigration advertising. Denmark, Finland and Norway are examples. In other countries, while no legislation exists specifically forbidding such advertising, it is clearly understood that it would not be allowed. </para>
          <para>Different again are countries such as Italy where newspapers cannot accept migration advertising copy from overseas countries unless it has been first cleared with the Italian Ministry of Labour. Many other countries insist on first sighting and approving the content of advertising copy. Others would not allow advertisements that aimed to attract specific skilled workers. Advertisements would be restricted to general, coupon-type immigration advertising campaigns. If such campaigns attracted high numbers of skilled migrant applicants we would expect restrictions on the number of such applicants that we could accept. </para>
          <para>A small number of countries allows unrestricted advertising. They include Britain, Ireland, Mauritius, the Seychelles, Kenya, Egypt and Malta. </para>

            <para>In examining the figures shown in column (2) of the table it should be noted that income payable abroad on foreign investment in enterprises in Australia for any period (column (1 )) is a measure, in money terms, of the return to foreigners on their total stock of investment in enterprises in Australia in that period, whereas the net inflow of foreign investment in enterprises in Australia for any period (column (2)) is basically a measure of the change in the stock of foreign investment in enterprises in Australia in the period in question. This means that figures in column (3) represent, for each period, a comparison of the return on the total stock of foreign investment in enterprises in Australia with the change in&#39; that stock. Accordingly, I do not consider that any meaning can be ascribed to these figures. </para>

              <para>The apparent earning rates shown above are derived from data published in the Reserve Bank&#39;s Statistical Bulletin, Company Supplement. These data cover non-finance public companies operating mainly in Australia, other than those engaged in mining or primary industry, and include the foreign operations of Australian-owned companies and the Australian operations of foreign-owned companies. Data that would enable estimates to be made of the apparent earning rates of Australian-owned companies only are not available. </para>
            </item>

          <para>The figures in the table represent the ratio of net profit to shareholders&#39; funds, debentures, mortgages, other secured borrowings, unsecured notes, deposits and other unsecured borrowings of this group of companies. These data are an aggregation of the companies&#39; published financial statements and are therefore subject to the limitations inherent in accounting reports. In particular, conventional financial statements draw on a mixture of historic costs and valuation data- individual transactions being recorded at prices prevailing at the time of the transaction which may be later revalued. The statements generally do not record transactions, in a consistent manner, in terms of current prices. </para>
          <para>Insofar as the financial statements are based on historic costs, they may not adequately reflect the effects of movements in the general level of prices. Thus, the apparent earning rates shown above may not be an accurate indication of the actual earning rates of the companies. </para>
          <para>The usefulness of the earning rates calculated from these data would be further limited by the degree to which the companies included in the survey are representative of all companies operating in Australia. In this regard it should be particularly noted that the survey includes only public companies operating mainly in Australia and exludes companies in the finance, mining and primary production sectors. </para>
          <para>Estimates of the apparent earning rates of overseas-owned companies can be derived from data contained in the ABS Bulletins &#39;Foreign Investment 1977-78&#39; and &#39;Foreign Investment 1 978-79 ( Preliminary) &#39; and represent, for each year and all industry sectors, the ratio of income payable (excluding interest on foreign investment in direct investment enterprises in Australia (as defined by the ABS) to the level of foreign investment in those enterprises at the beginning of each year. </para>
          <para>The degree of reliance that can be placed on earning rates so calculated, however, is questionable, mainly because the amount of corporate equities included in the level of direct investment in enterprises in Australia is recorded by the ABS at paid-up value only and excludes share premium, reserves, provisions and retained earnings. The recorded corporate equities figures would, therefore, be substantially lower than the actual level of foreign equity funds over which foreign investors have claims and the extent of under-representation would be compounded by the effects of inflation. By contrast, the statistics on income payable on foreign investment in enterprises in Australia are prepared for each year to reflect a particular set of current transactions between Australians and foreigners and, generally, would not be as susceptible to distortion as a result of inflation. For these reasons, the apparent earning rates shown below for overseas-owned companies will be higher than the actual earning rates. </para>

              <para>During the period 8 April 1976 to 31 December 1979, 539 foreign investment proposals considered by the Foreign Investment Review Board were approved by the Government subject to Australian equity conditions. The majority of these proposals (361) were for acquisitions relating to mineral exploration. In such cases approval is granted on condition that, before proceeding with any development, the parties submit their development proposal for examination in terms of the Government&#39;s foreign investment policy as it relates to new natural resource projects. The conditions applied in these cases will, therefore, only be capable of being met if the exploration activity is successful and the parties decide to proceed with development. </para>

Of those proposals approved subject to Australian equity participation conditions (other than the 361 proposals for acquisitions relating to mineral exploration) 14 are known to have met the conditions. In addition, in eight other cases some progress has been made by the parties towards fulfilment of the conditions. In 10 other cases the Australian equity participation conditions became redundant as a result of the parties deciding not to proceed with the proposal. It should be noted that the majority of the Australian equity participation conditions that have been applied either have not laid down a specific timetable for achievement of the conditions or have prescribed dates for compliance with the conditions which are still some time in the future. The conditions applied in these cases can be expected to be met with the effluxion of time. </para>

Steps are in hand to collect an appropriate dissection on a regular basis. </para>

            <para>By far the greatest number of temporary entry visas issued to overseas sportsmen and sportswomen during the past few years has been to soccer players. Following consultation between my Department and the Australian Soccer Federation, it was decided to limit the temporary entry of soccer players to clubs in the Phillips Soccer League and clubs in the premier division in each State, lt was also decided that no club could have more than four overseas players here temporarily at any one time. These new rules should provide greater opportunities for talented local players in the sport. </para>
            <para>These rules are used as a broad guideline when applications are received from any sporting organisation wishing to bring overseas players to Australia temporarily under long term contract for comparable team events. My Department looks at each application closely and consults with relevant organisations to ensure that there is no undue closing off of opportunities for local talent before approval is given to issue a temporary entry visa. </para>

              <para>and (2) The Medical Rehabilitation and Health Aspects Committee of the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped considered that major medical rehabilitation units should provide as comprehensive a range of services as are set out in the Report of the National Committee of Inquiry into Compensation and Rehabilitation in Australia (Volume 2), (Woodhouse and Meares, 1974), page 33. These services are: disability assessment and remedial treatment of persons who are admitted to hospital as a result of accident, disease or illness who are in need of physical restoration, and who are likely to make near full recovery of function and skill following the provision of medical rehabilitation services of comparatively short duration; preliminary disability assessments, and early remedial treatment and prompt referral thereafter to appropriate institutions and/or organisations of persons who are admitted to hospital as a result of accident, disease or illness, who are likely to have severe residual handicaps and who are in need of long-term, comprehensive rehabilitation treatment and/or training.&#39; </para>

          <para>The Report goes on to state at paragraph 78, page 33: </para>
          <para>Primarily, the medical rehabilitation unit should be designed, staffed and equipped to deal adequately with the complete rehabilitation needs of the shorter-term case (generally speaking, the case capable of resuming normal daily living within three months of the commencement of rehabilitation assistance). In addition, however, the medical rehabilitation unit should be able to deal with the early treatment of the long-term case pending transfer to a specialist medical rehabilitation unit, a general regional rehabilitation centre or other appropriate institution.&#39; </para>
          <para>The Medical Rehabilitation and Health Aspects Committee has estimated that there are probably no more than fifteen major medical rehabilitation units in Australia which would meet these criteria. </para>
          <para>Such units are located as follows: </para>

Their funding is thus not considered separately from the costs of operation of the hospitals concerned. However, it should be noted that in each case, the costs of the units are shared between the relevant State Government and the Commonwealth Government under the hospital cost-sharing agreements. Total Commonwealth outlays to the States under these arrangements in 1 978-79 were approximately $ 1 ,062m. </para>

            <para>Yes. I am advised that place of birth information is requested from persons applying for permanent appointment or temporary employment in the Australian Public Service. Under Section 34 (c) of the Public Service Act the Public Service Board is charged with ensuring that an applicant is a fit and proper person to be an officer of the Service, and place of birth information assists in establishing identity for administrative checks in this regard. </para>
            <para>Although Section 34 (c) of the Public Service Act relates specifically to applicants for permanent appointment it is the administrative practice to apply the same provision to applicants for temporary employment. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The 179,332 Citizen Band stations indicated in the Annual Report of the Postal and Telecommunications Department for 1978-79 refers to the number of Citizens Band Radio Service (CBRS) station licences recorded in the Departmental records as being on issue as at 3 1 March 1 979. </para>
            </item>

              <para>The cost of a CB licence is $25, but this fee will drop to $20onl July 1980. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>and (4) The CBRS licence revenue for the period 1 April 1978 to 31 March 1979 would have been of the order of $4.5m if all licences on issue as at 3 March had been renewed. The annual report correctly shows that Receipts for 1978-79 for CB licence fees were $2,525,700. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>There is a discrepancy between the actual licence fee revenue and the theoretical revenue because of the number of licences which, at 30 June 1 979, were still recorded as licence issues but fell in the categories of &#39;unpaid renewals&#39; or &#39;pending cancellations&#39;. Due to the limited information processing resources available it is normal practice of the Department to rate the issue of licences a higher priority than the cancellation of licences, due to non-payment of renewal fees. There is also a planned delay in cancelling licences to allow for late payments. </para>
          <para>The total effect of these factors at the end of the fiscal year 1978-79 was that some 72,000 licences were still technically on issue although the renewal fees had not been paid. The number of licences, technically on issue at 30 June 1979, had dropped to 173,507 (i.e. by 5,825 from the March 1979 figure of 179,332). However, a decrease in the number of licences issued for stations in the Citizens Band Radio Service is a natural outcome following the announcement that from 1 March 1979 a station licence could cover the operation of five Citizens Band transceiver units in lieu of the previous arrangement of one licence for each unit. </para>

          <para>The radiation exposure to those in the vicinity of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, due to the explosion of nuclear weapons there in August 1945, arose almost entirely from direct exposure to radiation from the exploding weapons rather than from any radioactive debris reaching the ground subsequently. </para>
          <para>The possible effects of fallout on residents of the cities in the long-term have been studied by Japanese scientists (Radioactive Fallout Effects of the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb, Health Physics 34, 621-633, 1978, Shunzo Okajima, Kenji Takeshita, Shiegetoshi Antoku, Toshio Shiomi, Walter J. Russell, Shoichiro Fujita, Haruma Yoshinaga, Shotaro Neriishi, Sadahisa Kawamoto and Toshiyuki Norimura). </para>
          <para>The presence of the long-lived radionuclide caesium- 137 from fallout from the Nagasaki nuclear explosion was revealed in a study group selected for their location and long term residence as being most subject to the fallout. The enhanced level of caesium- 137 in these people is attributed to their eating foodstuffs produced on local farms remaining contaminated with the radionuclide. Following physical examinations and clinical studies, the Japanese scientists concluded that &#39;no physical or laboratory abnormalities were detected among the index subjects of the study.&#39; </para>
          <para>In view of these conclusions, reached from studies of long term residents selected as most subject to fallout, an investigation of abnormalities - malignant or otherwise - in Australians who were in the affected areas following the explosions would not appear warranted. </para>

Broad surveys undertaken in 1977 indicated that the migrant proportion of RALAC patients was approximately 9 per cent, but the majority of these were from English speaking countries. In the general hospitals it was estimated that migrants were about 1 3 per cent of the total number of inpatients. It has been found in practice that in most instances there is a staff member available who can give assistance in translation when required. </para>

The Magistrate refused to order that the further evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nakis</inline> be taken in closed court and his decision was upheld by the Supreme Court. The substance of the grounds on which the application was made appears from paragraphs 25, 26, 28 and 29 of an affidavit filed in the proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in which the decision of the Magistrate was challenged. The texts of those paragraphs are set out in the Judgment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Yeldham which was delivered on 1 May 1 980. </para>

          <para>In interpreting the figures, it should be noted that changes to the Medical Benefits Scheme over the years shown in the table affect the number of services that attract medical benefits and the persons covered by the Schemes. For example, in respect of these items particularly, statistics for 1973-74 and 1974-75 are not directly comparable with those for later years. Prior to the introduction of Medibank in July 1975, a separate Pensioner Medical Service Scheme existed from which payments were made to participating doctors for services rendered to eligible pensioners and their dependants. Under Medibank (from 1 July 1975), such services were included in the Medical Benefits Scheme and hence in the above statistics. </para>

              <para>No. Legislation is being drafted to introduce a Plant Variety Rights Scheme into Australia. The proposals for such a scheme were put to the Government several years ago and since then there has been close examination of all aspects of plant variety rights by experts from all State Governments, the CSIRO and rural industry organisations. These organisations, the Australian Nurserymen&#39;s Association, the Australian Seed Industry Association and the Australian Seed Producers&#39; Association, whose members include small business and farming interests, have thoroughly investigated the operation of similar schemes in overseas countries. They are of the firm opinion that a Plant Variety Rights Scheme would be of benefit to their industries and members. </para>

              <para>I am aware that a number of such allegations have been made. Most of these were printed in a book by P. A. Mooney entitled &#39;Seeds of the Earth&#39; but I have not been able to obtain any other substantiating evidence. Take-overs of -commercial firms by other firms are not confined to the Seed industry but are common practice in most avenues of commercial endeavour. It is most unlikely that take-overs would be initiated by Plant Variety Rights legislation. </para>

              <para>Yes. The Australian Agricultural Council has examined the whole question and recommended that the Government should introduce legislation to establish a Plant Variety Rights Scheme in Australia. It was convinced that it would be of benefit to Australian agriculture and would encourage plant breeding by individuals, commercial firms, and publicly funded organisations. It would lead to the development of new improved plant varieties and allow Australia access to improved varieties from other countries which are presently denied to us. </para>

Consideration is being given to expanding these collections as plant breeding is of great importance to Australia and its rural industries. The maintenance of plant genetic resource material is a separate issue to the granting of proprietary rights over new plant varieties. It should not be confused with the objectives of a plant variety rights scheme which is related to identification registration and ownership of new and distinct varieties. </para>

There is certainly a need for realistic policies and positive action to ensure that the results of research are available and adopted. It is true also that generally, agricultural research is not frustrated by patents. However many technical developments resulting from research efforts have been patented. Plant variety rights, or patents on new plant varieties, do not frustrate research as has been demonstrated in the many countries including the USA, the UK, New Zealand and in Europe, that have operated plant variety rights schemes over many years. </para>

            <para>Officers of my Department and other Departments concerned with the activities of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) maintain close contact with the Scientific Counsellor and the Veterinary Attache who are located at the Australian Embassy in Washington, DC. These officers were briefed by departmental officers before taking up their appointments in Washington. Any announcements on such matters are communicated by the attaches to the relevant Departments. </para>
            <para>In addition various government departments keep abreast of developments in the USA through subscriptions to the US Federal Register, which is a daily record of US Government decisions, intentions and general business. This Register has specific sections relating to the activities of the EPA and the FDA. </para>
            <para>The USEPA is required by section 12 (b) of the US Toxic Substances Control Act to notify foreign governments when certain regulated chemical substances or mixtures are exported to their countries. These chemical substances are ones that are the subject of a proposed or final regulatory control action by the USEPA. Governments are notified only of the first such shipment of a particular substance in any one year. These practices have commenced quite recently. </para>

              <para>and (2) The reference to the introduction of pay parking at Canberra airport in the 1977-78 Annual Report of the Department of Transport was based on approval in principle in June 1978 of a boom gate control system to be operated by a private concessionaire. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Subsequent investigation disclosed that the system . proposed would not be viable at Canberra airport and an alternative control system utilising either parking meters or voucher dispensing machines was decided upon. Study of these alternatives was suspended early in 1979 because of the implications of plans to re-develop and expand the terminal building and car parking areas at Canberra airport. </para>
          <para>Consideration of pay parking was resumed later in 1979. In view of the need to preserve terminal development options, it was decided that control of pay parking should be by voucher dispensing machines supervised by departmental officers. As such a system had not previously been utilised at Australian airports, a number of legal questions concerning the provisions of the Airports (Surface Traffic) Act 1960 had to be resolved before the plan could be implemented. </para>
          <para>Tenders were called in September 1979, and orders for three machines were placed in February 1980; the machines were delivered on 21 April 1980. </para>

            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The primary objective in introducing pay parking at Canberra airport, pending a decision on future terminal requirements, was to reduce traffic congestion in the terminal forecourt area.

            <para>The Australian Transport Advisory Council is advised by its Advisory Committee on Road User Performance and Traffic Codes (ACRUPTC) on provisions contained in the National Road Traffic Code, including the requirement for compulsory daytime use of motorcycle headlights. </para>
            <para>Advice on the legal implications for motorcyclists and other motorists of the above provisions was sought and obtained by ACRUPTC from the State and Territory constituent bodies of the Law Council of Australia; and by the Office of Road Safety, on behalf of ACRUPTC, from the Highway Safety Research Centre at the University of North Carolina, that State having had legislation requiring motorcyclists to use their headlights in daytime since 1973. </para>
            <para>The general consensus of the legal profession in Australia is that non-compliance with a traffic provision does not automatically become evidence of contributory negligence, the question of which ought to be left to the courts. Moreover, ACRUPTC received legal opinion that in a situation where a motorcyclist is suing for damages and the other party raises contributory negligence by the motorcyclist in failing to haVe his headlights illuminated, the onus of proving that the motorcyclist was guilty <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> contributory negligence rests on that other party to prove that, for whatever reason, the motorcyclist was guilty of contributory negligence. </para>
            <para>So far as the situation in the United States is concerned, the Highway Safety Research Centre reported that the issue had never been raised in regard to the North Carolina legislation. </para>

          <para>However the Court, and subsequently, on 5 May 1977, the Court of Appeal, New South Wales Supreme Court, held that the Commonwealth was not legally obliged to refund the rentals paid by the airlines during the period. </para>
          <para>During the litigation the then Minister for Transport met with International Air Transport Association delegations from time to time. He undertook to review the rental situation when, amongst other things, the Court cases were decided and the legal rights of the parties had been clarified. </para>
          <para>This undertaking was honoured. On review it was decided that an ex gratia payment should be made to all airlines involved equivalent to the difference between the rents invalidly imposed and the rents that should have been paid by the airlines for the period. </para>
          <para>The allocation to airline lessees included notional ex gratia credits to TAA ($56,229) and Pan American ($86,042). Those companies did not pay at the increased rates from 1 March 1975. </para>

          <para>The following tables show the relationship of the actual rate of payment of pension or benefit on the first day of each calendar year compared with figures adjusted in accordance  with movements in the average annual earnings and the Con-sumer Price Index. The second and third columns indicate  what the rates would have been had they been adjusted in ac-  cordance with the indices. Figures in parentheses represent  the relativity of the actual payment to the payment that  would have been made if the rates had been adjusted in ac-cordance with the indices. </para>

            <para>Numbers of visitors to Australia, by country of citizenship, who applied for or were granted change to resident status in the years 1975-76, 1976-77 and 1978-79 are provided in the table below. Note that the number of applications approved includes some lodgements from previous years. </para>
            <para>The 1975-76 and 1976-77 figures reflect the effects of the amnesty offered by the Government to overstayed visitors and other prohibited migrants and of the grant of resident status to evacuees from Timor who were admitted on temporary permits. The 1977-78 figures are not available due to deficiencies in the statistical reporting system. </para>
