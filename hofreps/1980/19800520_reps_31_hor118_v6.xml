It is contended that it is imperative for incentive to be given by way of taxation deductibility to encourage membership of Health Insurance Funds on a long term basis or both they and the Public Health Sector will become subject to abuses which could seriously affect their ability to provide an economic and efficient service to the community. </para>

            <para>- According to the information that the Government has, at the moment at least 41 countries have either boycotted or are almost certain to boycott the Olympic Games. It is expected that the list will be added to. For the information of honourable members, I would be happy to include in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a copy of the list. Admittedly, some of those countries are small in terms of athletic prowess, but others are very substantial. They include the United States of America, West Germany and Canada. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That represents a very significant part of the Olympic movement and of the competitive capacity in the world in many of the sports at the Olympic Games. That in itself makes the competition in Moscow much less effective. In fact, in Olympic terms, it makes that meeting a nonOlympics. It means that top athletes of the world will not be participating. Such participation was the purpose of the Olympics and still is. </para>
          <para>Of particular relevance to Australia is not only that fact but also the fact that included amongst those countries are countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, China and Fiji, which are within our region. I believe they are countries alongside which Australia would want to stand in relation to a boycott of the Olympic Games. </para>
          <para>Some 2 1 other countries will not be attending the Olympics for reasons other than political reasons. I will be happy to include in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a list of those countries also. By the time the period for acceptance of the invitation to participate expires I would expect other countries to be added. </para>
          <para>For my own part, I still believe the Australian Olympic Federation will decide to support the boycott and not go to the Olympics. I believe that our. athletics bodies- sports bodies- understand perfectly the reasons which the Government has given for boycotting the Olympics and that they will respond to those reasons when they meet next Friday. I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the two lists to which I have referred. </para>

      <para>When natural disasters causing damage and destruction occur in a State, the Commonwealth stands ready to join with the State Government concerned on a $ 1 for $ 1 basis in meeting expenditure on the immediate relief of personal hardship and distress, except where such expenditure is of a very minor nature. Such expenditures may cover provision of food, clothing, shelter and repair of homes to make them habitable and secure. </para>
      <para>In respect of 'major' disasters, the Commonwealth also assists with expenditures on other agreed relief and restoration measures when it is considered beyond the capacity of the State concerned to meet these expenditures from its own resources. In 1977 arrangements were made to enable the States to assume automatic Commonwealth agreement to inclusion of certain 'standard' measures under the arrangements following specified major disasters.

      <para>The financial arrangements which had applied since 1971 were modified in 1978-79. The Commonwealth previously met all expenditures by a State in a year on agreed measures necessitated by major disasters in excess of a base amount set for the State. Under the current arrangements above-base expenditures are financed on a $3 Commonwealth: $ 1 State basis. The State base contributions, which were doubled in 1978-79, are: </para>

          <para>- If any State wishes to propose measures additional to those which are accepted as a matter of course, it may do so. In Western Australia, where some wheat producing areas were in the fourth year of drought, the Premier proposed certain specific and special measures. They have been substantially accepted. In addition, in New South Wales some additional measures have been agreed upon between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Government, to include the provision of subsidies to councils and other organisations which are approved by the State and which are able to provide emergency water supplies, but such subsidies are to be based on existing facilities and on reasonable additional special costs incurred in providing emergency supplies to primary producers. Some additional support also will be given to primary producers to assist them in meeting special costs incurred in the transport of emergency water supplies to their properties. I mention those two matters because one is quite specifically related to provisions which could be made by local government, and which have been approved in recent weeks, in the drought areas in New South Wales. If the honourable gentleman believes that particular circumstances in relation to local government town water supplies arise out of the drought, that would be a matter for the Premier to put to us. The Premier has, in fact, proposed some additional measures which are now receiving urgent examination, but the matters raised by the honourable gentleman are not included in the matters about which the Premier wrote to me. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of the interest that the honourable member has in the motor vehicle industry, in particular as it applies to South Australia. I will be announcing today the local content performance for 1979 of all five participants in the Passenger Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Plan. I am pleased to say that the recent local content performance of Chrysler Australia Ltd under the Plan has greatly improved. Chrysler, and some other companies, previously did experience difficulty in meeting local content commitments, mainly because of the appreciation of the yen up to the end of 1978. But in Chrysler's case the problems were greater because it was required to achieve a relatively higher content in 1978 and 1979 and the yen's appreciation was accompanied by a decline in the sales of Chrysler's high content Valiant. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I understand that Chrysler is continuing to achieve in excess of its commitment under the Plan and is confident of meeting its obligations in 1980. Chrysler was successful in gaining a proportion of the 5,000 units of passenger motor vehicle quota allocated in March of this year. The Industries Assistance Commission, as the House has been advised, is presently inquiring into the quota allocation system to apply to passenger motor vehicles in 1981. 1 understand that the report will be received by 2 1 September this year. </para>

            <para>-The Final Act of the Conference on Antarctic Marine Living Resources was signed in Canberra today by representatives of IS states participating in the Conference. The convention itself will be formally open for signature in Canberra on 1 August 1980. It is fair to say that the signing of the Final Act marks the culmination of over three years of extremely intensive negotiations to develop a regime for the conservation of the marine ecosystem of the entire area south of the Antarctic convergence. From the outset Australia has played a leading role in the negotiations. Australia acted as host at a special consultative meeting in 1978 which drew up the text which formed the basis for later negotiation. The honourable member for Hawker, from the moment of the convening of this Conference, played a leading role, together with the honourable member for La Trobe, who participated throughout in the delegation from this side, and other members of the Senate and of this place on both sides of the Parliament. I would like to say how much my officials appreciated the work that was done consistently by members on both sides. </para>

              <para>-I think the officials worked very persistently with one aim in mind, namely, to bring about the convention which was signed today. That is a tribute to the work not only of my departmental officers but also of parliamentarians on both sides of the House, for the successful conclusion represents a very significant new direction for the Antarctic Treaty system and its significance should not be underestimated. I well recall, in the weeks after I opened the Conference in 1978, reading review articles about how fruitless the endeavour would be. It has been proven to be quite the contrary. It demonstrates that the system is capable of adaptation to respond to increased international interest in resource issues. This has been achieved in a manner which is consistent with the responsibilities which the Antarctic Treaty partners have assumed for the protection of the Antarctic environment. </para>

          <para>Finally, if there was a plethora of assistance so far as the convention itself was concerned, we can reduce that degree of assistance to a number of Tasmanian members and senators who worked so hard with me to convince other delegates that Hobart ought to be the site of the headquarters of the international commission. The decision to select Hobart, I think, is signal recognition of the role that Australia has played in these negotiations and will certainly provide a focus for continued Australian involvement in an important area of international activity affecting Antarctica. </para>

I give, as an example, the St GeorgeCunnamulla section of the south-west Queensland service. Does the Minister agree that towns such as Cunnamulla, servicing a large area of south-west Queensland, should be given some assistance to maintain this vital service? If so, can he give an assurance that the Government will accept some of the responsibility for maintaining inland trunk air services such as this by providing some subsidy, remembering that the total amount involved will not be very great in relation to the value of the justifiable service provided? </para>

I am well aware also of the representations that have been made by the honourable member for Maranoa and also by the honourable member for the Northern Territory and other honourable members representing these remote areas. The Government is conscious of the need to maintain services to people living in isolated areas because they depend on these commuter services for mail, stores, medical supplies, et cetera. Indeed, the Government has supported these services for many, many years. The Minister for Finance and I have a proposal before us at the present time. We hope to be in a position to make a favourable announcement in the not too distant future. </para>

            <para>- The House and the country are, or should be, indebted to the honourable member for Lilley for drawing on history in this very sad and solemn business. History can be a good tutor, provided people will take notice of it. The fact is, as the honourable gentleman has stated, that Hitler used the Olympic Games for his own evil ends. Today, with the ugly apparatus of aggression by the Soviets in Afghanistan the world is being persuaded that there is something thoroughly respectable about the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union today, in the conduct of international affairs, is desperately seeking respectability. As the Prime Minister and my colleague the Minister for Home Affairs have said, there is slowly coming into existence a more emancipated view of what the Soviet Union is about. </para>

She recorded very graphically and movingly in a few lines the impact made on her and those with her when they were told that the Olympics were being held in Berlin and that all of the Western countries were going there. </para>

            <para>- Being an optimist, I address my question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I refer the Minister to the penultimate paragraph of the High Court's decision in the case of Hardiman and others against the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, where the judges of the Court expressed their disapproval of the Tribunal's somewhat unusual action- to use the words of the judges- in appearing to put substantive arguments in relation to the matters before it. Is it a fact that the advice from the Attorney-General's Department to the Tribunal initially was that the Tribunal should not appear in this case to put substantive arguments. In reliance on this advice, was it the Tribunal's initial inclination not to appear to put substantive arguments? Was the decision to reverse the Tribunal's initial stance taken after consultation between the Attorney-General and\/or the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and Tribunal members? Did the Attorney-General and\/or the Minister argue in favour of the Tribunal appearing to put substantive arguments? If so, what were the reasons for the Minister and\/or the Attorney-General commending this unusual course of action to the Tribunal? Did the Attorney-General and\/or the Minister direct the Tribunal to appear to put substantive arguments? </para>

            <para>-The Tribunal is not subject to direction by Ministers in these sorts of matters. The Tribunal made its own decision- it was not a decision which was based on particular advice- to appear before the High Court in its own way. I can assure honourable members that the Broadcasting Tribunal is very familiar with all that the High Court said in its judgment and will, of course, incorporate in its procedures and approaches all that flows out of the High Court decision. </para>

The question refers to the increasing numbers of tourists entering Australia under enlightened Government policies. Is it the intention of the Government to negotiate with the States to disperse the increasing number of tourists to States such as South Australia and- if I might be parochial- to areas such as the Barossa Valley and the Riverland? </para>

            <para>- As a consequence of the success of the Government's civil aviation policies there has been a very significant lift in the number of tourists coming to Australia. The latest figures in fact reveal an increase of some 25 per cent in the number of visitor arrivals, against an increase of about 12 per cent in the number of tourists leaving Australia. These matters are subject to discussion with the States at regular intervals. The question of regional promotion of tourism, in which I know the honourable gentleman has a very firm interest is being very vigorously promoted by the Australian Tourist Commission in conjunction with State tourist departments. I will consult with my Department and I will consult with other departments that may have an interest in this matter. The House should understand the very keen interest that the honourable gentleman does take in the subject of tourism. I know that many of his electors are really hanging on the answer to this question. I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. </para>

Neither the honourable member for Tangney nor the 91 per cent of people in Western Australia who share his view will be disappointed, because the Government has decided upon the terms of reference and also has decided who will conduct that independent inquiry. I will be making an announcement on this matter to the Parliament before it rises at the end of this week. In the meantime, I assure the honourable member that the Government has been most concerned to ensure that an independent inquiry is conducted. The result of that inquiry will be given to the Government in due course. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Is it a fact that in July 1979 he was informed by a reporter from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> that the wife of the then Australian Broadcasting Tribunal <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Mr Bruce</inline> Gyngell, was working as a consultant for Australian Consolidated Press Ltd, the majority shareholder of television station Channel 9? Did the Minister tell the reporter that he knew that this was a fact? Did the Minister tell the then  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that his wife's employment with Australian Consolidated Press Ltd should cease? What was the response to the Minister by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bruce</inline> Gyngell? Does the Minister consider that a situation such as this constitutes a breach of the pecuniary interest provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act? If so, what has the Minister done about the matter? </para>

            <para>-The position relating to people on organisations such as the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is, of course, a sensitive and important one. I simply say, in answer to the honourable member, that my advice was that any involvement or interest which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gyngell</inline> 's wife might have had in other organisations did not, in fact, put him in breach of the pecuniary interest provisions which applied to him. I make it quite plain that, notwithstanding any official legal position, I believe that people in his position and those sorts of positions must always exercise great caution in matters which could be regarded as putting them in breach of provisions in that general area. The position with respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gyngell</inline> was that any involvement his wife had did not, as I am advised, put him in breach of the provisions. </para>

            <para>-With Oxford by my side, I direct a definite question without notice to the Minister for Science and the Environment. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the very recent decision of the much admired Thatcher Government to abandon, after 1 1 years, conversion from the imperial system to the metric system? Is the Minister aware that the United Kindom's consideration of going metric commenced a century ago and it took but 1 1 years, following the creation of the Metrication Board, to recognise that it would not work? In view of the ancestral background of the majority of Australians and the continuing opposition in Australia to metrication, what makes the Minister think that he can succeed where the United Kingdom Government has failed? Finally - </para>

            <para>-My information is that the United Kingdom Government has not abandoned metrication. The Minister concerned recently announced in the House of Commons that metrication in the United Kingdom was almost complete and that the remaining parts of metrication would be handled by her Department. The Australian position is quite clear; that is, that our metrication process is almost complete. Some time next year the Metric Conversion Board will have completed its work and the matter will come under the responsibility of my Department. </para>

I refer to the fact that, following a political party decision, the honourable gentleman was made Prime Minister in exchange for Supply, supported by unprecedented legal opinion from the Chief Justice together with an unprecedented action by the Governor-General. Is it a fact that at the same time an impecunious solicitor named Sankey commenced ill-founded conspiracy charges against four Labor Ministers, one of whom died in the course of the proceedings, such charges receiving the support of members of his Government and costing many hundreds of thousands of dollars to resolve, that the Government has declined to investigate who financed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey</inline> 's prosecution, and that two counsel retained by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sankey</inline> were then briefed by the Government to prosecute members of the Greek community in the social security frauds case at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars? Will the Prime Minister give an undertaking not to appoint any members of his Government and\/or the counsel now retained in the social security conspiracy case to any judicial office before the forthcoming Federal election, in order to avoid further public outcry and confrontation in this very sensitive area? </para>

          <para>We need to understand the central element of what happened in 1975 when the then Government tried to govern this country in defiance of this Parliament, because this Parliament had not passed money for the provisions of government. Not only that, but the present Leader of the Opposition, as the then Treasurer, sought to cajole or to force the banks to act illegally and improperly to finance the affairs of government. That Treasurer, now the Leader of the Opposition, acted in such a way as to try to force the trading banks of Australia to operate without the law, to put their shareholders' funds at risk and to act totally in defiance of all normal procedures. If the honourable gentleman asks that kind of question, he will get the kind of answer he deserves. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>In the past, apprehensions of loss of employment in the face of technical progress and what for long was called automation have been demonstrated to be unfounded. I do not have time to explore the reasons for this; and the question is whether it is likely to be the same with the new technology with its applications in computer control and robotics. The further question is whether such employment problems are likely to be long term. I don't know how broad the terms of today's subject are, but it seems to me that such issues are central to a consideration of Australian science and technology in the decades ahead. </para>

              <para>-This statement is a report on Commonwealth funding of research and development over the past four years. It is the first such statement. It is a pilot document which I hope will be repeated and expanded annually. It is in accordance with the Government's stated policy of advising Parliament and Australia on trends in the nation's research and development. It is a step towards what I hope will be a wide-ranging discussion, perhaps leading to changes in the future. The statement could not have been produced without the co-operation of my ministerial colleagues and their officers. To all of these, I express my appreciation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The statement is a post-Budget analysis of research expenditure of all Government departments and provides information is essential for those inside and outside government who are concerned that research activities should be linked to national needs. Research priorities need to be adjusted from time to time to meet new demands brought about by such realities as changing population patterns, changing community expectations, changing world industrial and trade patterns and changing energy requirements. It is of critical importance that the policy makers, responsible for the adjustments, have up-to-date information on the allocation of the resources of both the Government and the community. We should all be concerned about research priorities because research today is the basis of the science and technology that affect the community tomorrow. The Government sees science and technology playing a central role in contributing to national economic health. It is a key to the solution of many of the problems confronting our society. Science and technology now pervade all aspects of our lives. They enhance our lifestyles and provide employment and investment opportunities. In Australia, more than 70 per cent of research expenditure is provided by governments. The effective and efficient utilisation of science and technology resources is therefore a major responsibility of government. This Government has consistently accepted that responsibility. </para>
          <para>Some points should be borne in mind when interpreting the statement. It is in part an experiment. The treatment of data has naturally varied according to the source of information. That, however, does not detract from its usefulness. The basic aim has been to present total Commonwealth payments for research. The statement shows that Commonwealth funding of research rose substantially between 1968-69 and 1973-74 and was then maintained in real terms until 1976-77. There was a slight drop in 1977-78 and since then it has been increased to about the previous level in real terms. The statement also shows that private enterprise research and development declined substantially between 1974 and 1977. Preliminary results of the latest survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that this decline has been arrested, and indicate an upturn of 6 per cent in real terms. </para>
          <para>Government priorities for energy and manufacturing industry have been reflected in substantial rises in research and development funding. For example, expenditure on energy research and development rose from $ 12.9m in 1 976-77 to an estimated $30m this financial year. Manufacturing industry research and development support rose from $39. lm in 1976-77 to an estimated $66. 8m. These rises are reflected in the trends in research and development funded by my colleagues the Minister for National Development and Energy <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> and the </para>
          <para class="block">Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman).</inline> Research and development in the areas of health and environment have been well supported in real terms. In welfare research there has been a large relative increase from a low base. Over the four years covered by the statement, the total of capital and other funds available to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has not been reduced in real terms but in fact has been slightly increased. Some activities have been reduced and new ones commenced. In particular the construction of the new Australian National Animal Health Laboratory is now progressing rapidly. In the same period, support for university research provided through the Australian Research Grants Committee has been maintained substantially at a uniform level in real terms. </para>
          <para>In supporting research we must ensure that the work is directed towards national economic and social goals. We must also ensure that resources are used efficiently. In Australia we believe that these requirements can be best achieved through a pluralist pattern which facilitates different approaches for different sectors. Only CSIRO has a wide charter for its research and development interests. This pluralist system has worked well. It works, I believe, much better than a centralised, bureaucratic approach. Our system must place special emphasis on co-ordination and on assigning priorities among sectors. This is a basic tenet of our science and technology policy. We have mechanisms to provide co-ordination, to identify gaps and to recommend on priorities. A wide range of bodies provide scientific and technological policy advice to the Government. The principal independent advisory body is the Australian Science and Technology Council. The Parliament itself has a significant role in this process. The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment and other committees are important sources of advice. </para>
          <para>Given this pluralistic approach, information on resources devoted to research in each sector is critical. I see that as the value of this statement. It informs the Parliament on the allocation of public funds. It provides the various advisory and coordinating bodies with information necessary for their deliberations. Above all, it informs members of the public of the nature and extent of the research and development they are supporting. Having compiled the information, we must look at the effectiveness of our use of the resources. A fundamental four-fold plan is required, firstly, to develop our capability in basic research to provide a store of knowledge and expertise for the future; secondly, to develop our capability in applied research; thirdly, to transfer research achievements, through development, into the market place; and fourthly, to ensure that any undesirable social and environmental impacts of technology are minimised. </para>
          <para>It seems to me that insufficient attention is being paid at present to the fourth element of the plan- the assessment of the possible impacts of science and its applications. I believe that, if this situation is to be corrected, governments should give a lead. They should have a greater involvement in the transfer of research achievements, through development, into the market place. In my view, the promotion of applied science would include assessment and the solution of social as well as scientific and technological problems. CSIRO is already heavily involved in the business of getting research results into the market place. I also intend that my Department shall examine what contribution it can make in this area. </para>
          <para>Those concerned with science and technology should have a pre-occupation with the future and a concern not only for what is, but also for what can be. The aim is to harness professional skills of prediction to the goals and aspirations of the people in the society in which scientists work and live. Thus we can combine what is and what can be with what our society considers ought to be. The public expects science and technology to improve the future. We are experiencing the benefits of space research in new materials and in applications to meteorology, communications and earth resources management. In the not too distant future we may see the use of space's low gravity extreme vacuum environment to enable us to produce new alloys and other materials. We may see energy beamed from space. Biotechnology, the science of creating new organisms to perform industrial processes, offers exciting prospects. </para>
          <para>The public also expects science and technology to contribute to the solution of our problems. I am concerned about our changing population distribution and the decline in some centres west of the Great Dividing Range. I was therefore impressed to learn of research in the United States into small scale industrial technology and rural revitalisation. Such projects could be of great value to a country such as Australia. We are already beginning to see the usefulness of solar energy in remote locations. The growing technological complexity, indicated in my previous remarks, does bring with it the danger of polarisation and conflict. Society is already dividing into those who are familiar with science and those who are fearful of it. There is a rising disquiet in the community about some aspects of science. The possible effect of new technologies on employment is one such issue. There are others. We need to explain the benefits of science. We need to lessen misunderstandings which can arise all too easily. Greater understanding will lessen the potential for conflict over the application of science. </para>
          <para>Science policy should emphasise public education to ensure effective public participation in debate on issues which have profound social effects. I believe this science statement will contribute to this public understanding and improve the capacity of people to make informed judgments about science and technology. I commend it as one step in a continuing effort to make the best use of science and technology for the benefit of Australia and Australians. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>- It is not easy for me to reply quickly to a science statement which contains nearly 70 pages of figures and which was given to the Opposition only in the last couple of hours. I am not complaining about that. I am just explaining why I will not go into detail to any large extent in respect of the actual scientific content of the paper. It is impossible to deal with such a statement in detail now. I hope that when honourable members have had a chance to have a good look at the paper they will be given an opportunity of dealing with it in greater detail. </para>

          <para>I think it would be fair to say- and I do not want to be too aggressive about this-that the statement of the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Thomson)</inline> is a complacent review of the state of scientific research in Australia. The Minister is quite happy with the way things are going. I refer to an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review of</inline> 9 May 1980 which quotes <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Geoffrey</inline> Badger, the  Chairman  of the Australian Science and Technology Council. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Australian reliance on imported technology will make it more difficult for governments to regulate the pace at and extent to which it is introduced, according to a leading technologist. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Geoffrey</inline>Badger,  chairman  of the Australian Science and Technology Council, called for a Government science policy to oversee technological change. </para>
            <para>We perform about 2 per cent of the world's research and development as measured by the number of scientific publications, ' <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Geoffrey</inline> said. </para>
            <para>On the other hand we have a substantial deficit in our technological balance of payments. </para>
            <para>Our receipts from overseas for patents, licences and royalties amount to only 1 1 per cent of the payments we have to make to overseas companies. </para>
            <para>The technology we use is mainly imported and cannot be subject to regulation by governments in terms of the pace and extent of its introduction, at least in business enterprises. ' </para>
            <para>Delivering a keynote paper at Melbourne's La Trobe University Meridith Memorial Lectures this week, he described the low level of industrial research in Australia compared with other developed countries. </para>
            <para>Figures for 1973-74 showed industrial research and development was 37 per cent of all R and D but by 1 976-77 it had fallen to 2 9 per cent of the total. </para>
            <para>Compared with other OECD countries, that figure was less than half the level for every other member country with the exception of Canada. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Surely that is depressing. If we look at the figures- and as I mentioned earlier I have looked at only the first few pages- we see that estimated Commonwealth Government funds expended on research and development in 1978-79 as compared with 1973-74 have decreased in real terms by 18 per cent. Secondly, and in some ways even more depressingly- it ought to be more depressing for honourable members opposite- although private enterprise contributed some 33 per cent of total expenditure on research and development in 1968-69, its contribution was down to 1 8 per cent by 1976-77. The Minister said today in his ministerial statement on science that there has been a slight upturn- I think a 6 per cent upturn- in private business expenditure. However, it is important to remember that this contribution has reached a very, very low level- a depressingly low level. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the research position in Australia. I speak with some feeling on this because I started off my adult life as a researcher in science. I graduated with honours in physical chemistry at the University of Sydney in the year that the atomic bomb was dropped. I was then on the staff of the Department of Chemistry at the University for two years before I decided to change over to medicine and start a completely new career. The situation even then was depressing in terms of the sort of research facilities which were provided in universities. I was involved in work on spectrophotometers. I knew that it took some two or three months to get a number of figures and a number of results that people in the United States could get within hours with better equipment. I could not see any future in continuing that work. Maybe I was easily dissuaded from doing my work, but I think this is probably an indication of the sort of thing which faced other people interested in scientific research in Australia. </para>
          <para>I think it is true to say that Australia 's research effort in our academic institutions is very small in terms of international comparison. Under the present Government it has declined to dangerously restricted levels. Considering our long term national interests, it should be much higher. I know that pleas are made by people who are involved in research just as pleas are made by people who are involved in anything else. This applies to politicians when they go before the Remuneration Tribunal and to people who come to Canberra for Budget discussions. Farmers might speak to the Minister for Science and the Environment, who is at the table, in his capacity as their local member. A lot of special pleading goes on and as politicians we are aware of this. But I think that generally speaking there is agreement among authoritative bodies and persons in Australia that Australia is not expending adequate funds on research in general and on research in academic institutions in particular. </para>
          <para>In recent years the Government has ignored the call for increased funding for research by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development examiners in science and technology, the Australian Science and Technology Council, the Universities Council, the Tertiary Education Commission, the Australian Academy of Science, the Industries Assistance Commission, academic staff associations, the Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training and the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. Whilst each body emphasises particular benefits to be accrued from increased funding for research, the range of arguments for increased research funding usually includes economic well-being and material progress. Research contributes to industrial development, mastery of technological innovation, improved use of resources, energy self-sufficiency and an increased standard of living. In the case of social and public welfare research, benefits include improved insight into the working of our society and the hope of improved services and better social mechanisms for coping with such issues as the social ramifications of technological change itself. Finally, the extension of knowledge is used as an argument in favour of increased research. It is generally argued that it is necessary as a matter of national prestige that we participate meaningfully in the extension of knowledge, particularly in matters related to the Australian skies, sea and land mass, and of course areas of the Antarctic under our care. Such activities contribute to the intellectual and teaching vitality of our academic institutions and may form the basis of practical applications. </para>
          <para>However, there is evidence of neglect in research funding. Adequate funding levels have not been maintained through recurrent expenditure, special research grants, allocations by research funding committees or the granting of Commonwealth post-graduate awards. Firstly, under the present Government's announced programs, recurrent funding for universities and colleges of advanced education during 1980 and 1981 will be held in constant prices at the 1979 level which was about $12m below the needs recommended by the Tertiary Education Commission. The Commission has protested, saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>One particular area of concern to the Commission is the impact of these funding restrictions on research activities. The proportion of universities' recurrent expenditure devoted to research activities has steadily declined. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Australian Research Grants Committee was allocated $ 13.9m in the 1979-80 Budget. In real terms this represents a cut of 8 per cent compared with the amount allocated in 1976-77. The National Health and Medical Research Council was allocated $14m for the current year which represents no change in real terms. That sum is equal to 0.2 per cent of the total health budgetonefifth of one per cent- compared with 0.4 per cent four years ago. The Council has been able to fund only 37 per cent of grant applications for the next year. I think there is a depressing future in relation to grants given by the National Health and Medical Research Council. An important aspect is the post-graduate studentship awards. I have been in contact with post-graduate students in my capacity as a representative of this House on the Council of the Australian National University. I think they have an excellent case; and I am not often persuaded by cases presented by people. The Commonwealth Postgraduate Award Scheme allocation of $8.9m in 1979-80 represents a 9. 1 per cent cut in real terms in overall funding. The number of new Commonwealth post-graduate awards decreased from 725 in 1974 to 555 in 1979. Following the anomalous decision to tax only post-graduate studentships awarded by the Commonwealth, it is estimated that the real value of each award has declined by 50 per cent over the five year period. Compared with average weekly earnings, the award is at its lowest level for at least 10 years. Many of our ablest students of mature age with dependants are being forced to live in conditions close to poverty. </para>
          <para>Finally, I wish to quote, with regard to fundamental and applied research, from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development examiners' reports on science and technology in Australia. It reads:   . . in Australia a disproportion exists between academic research and I.R. &amp; D. Furthermore, we suffer ... a timidity in investing innovative projects. As a result, little science flows into indigenous development, because it is insufficiently concentrated. </para>
          <para class="block">I think that is an important point for those of us who are also interested in manufacturing industry. The quotation continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Little fragments of information and expertise are not enough to start a development, build an export program, or calculate multi-million dollar risks. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>At present no clear national policy for science and technology exists in Australia. In consequence there can be little coherence, sense of purpose or direction in government support for industrial research and development. </para>

          <para class="block">In the first volume of the ASTEC report entitled Science and Technology in Australia 1977-78 ' it was stated: </para>

            <para>The long term survival of manufacturing in Australia requires a high level of modern technology and of technological innovation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think that is very important. On the general philosophical argument I agree with the Minister when he talks in his statement about the growing technological complexity which brings with it danger of polarisation and conflict. Society, as he put it, is already dividing into those who are familiar with science and those who are fearful of it. There is a rising disquiet in the community about some aspects of science. The possible effect of new technologies on employment is one such issue. There are others. Nuclear energy is a very important issue for this country. In many cases there is a lack of understanding on both sides about the benefits or dangers of nuclear energy. </para>
          <para>If we want to compete in the world of the 1980s, the 1990s and 2000 and beyond it is terribly important that we have an intelligent and educated community which is able to take advantage of technological advances and a significant proportion of which is not terribly scared of the disbenefits of science. I am one of those who are optimistic about science. I believe science will solve most of the problems which face us, as it has in the past. I think it is important for the Government and for scientists as a whole to continue to try to persuade the community at large that huge threats are really not involved and for those arguing for and against to put on the platforms not extremists who take only one point of view but people who are obviously able to see both sides of the issue and are able to provide us with intelligent leadership in the future. </para>

        <para>Ordered that the report be printed. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr DOBIE</inline>(Cook)-by leave-The problems of southern Africa are complex and interrelated. Central to these problems are issues of race and black nationalism- the struggle by blacks for an end to white domination of their lives and for the opportunity to achieve social, political and economic equality with whites. Because Zimbabwe was the focus of the struggle at the time that the Sub-Committee on Southern Africa began its investigation, the Sub-Committee decided to concentrate its inquiry initially on that country. This first report is the result of that inquiry. The SubCommittee considered that a detailed examination of the Zimbabwe situation was important not only in its own right but also for its implication for the region. However, the issues of racialism and nationalism are not the only issues of southern Africa. Its economic development, its strategically important geographic position and mineral resources and existing and possible East-West confrontation in the region are also important issues. The Sub-Committee intends to examine these in a subsequent report or reports together with their implications for Australia. </para>
        <para>Although much of the evidence taken by the Sub-Committee was on the Zimbabwe situation, considerable evidence was also taken on the broader aspects of the inquiry. To date the SubCommittee has taken some 2,500 pages of evidence from 80 witnesses, most of it in public session, and considered in excess of 300 submissions. Formal hearings commenced in October 1978 and the volume and extent of the evidence indicate considerable interest in the community concerning events in Southern Africa. As well as submissions and oral evidence the Sub-Committee considered a wide range of documentary source material, some of which is cited in end notes at the conclusion of each chapter of the report. This material came from a wide range of sources. </para>
        <para>In the course of its inquiry into events in Zimbabwe the Sub-Committee was faced with two problems in particular. The first was the difficulty of preparing a report and formulating conclusions in a situation where major developments were regularly changing the course of events. The Sub-Committee began its inquiry some six months after the Internal Settlement Agreement of 3 March 1978. This was followed in April 1979 by the election of the Government of Bishop Muzorewa, by the Lusaka Agreement in August 1979, the Lancaster House conference in September-December, the ceasefire and return to legality in December, new elections in February 1980 which brought <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mugabe's</inline> Government to power, and official independence on 18 April 1980. This marked the end of a British colonial presence in Africa as Rhodesia had been Britain's last colony on the African continent. </para>
        <para>It would be fair to say that Rhodesia had attracted world attention in recent times for two inter-related reasons. The first was the struggle by whites for independence from Britain and the second was the struggle by blacks for an end to white domination and racial inequality. Although a settlement of both issues was achieved eventually through negotiations, it is unlikely that those negotiations would have taken place had it not been for three major influences: The pressure exerted by the black nationalists through a guerrilla warfare of increasing intensity; pressure on the economy of Rhodesia as a result of sanctions and on the economies of neighbouring Zambia and </para>
        <para class="block">Mozambique through their implementation of sanctions; and the election of a black majority government in April 1979. </para>
        <para>The Muzorewa Government was Rhodesia's first black majority rule government. But its ability to institute major social and economic reforms was limited, to some extent, by constitutionally entrenched white safeguards. The Muzorewa Government was also hampered by the fact that it had been elected at an election in which the two major external national parties in the Patriotic Front had refused to participate, basically because they had not been involved in drawing up the 1979 Constitution, but also, and equally importantly, because they did not believe the elections under transitional government control would be impartial. In the event, most international observers at the 1979 and 1980 elections did consider them to have been impartially conducted and administered. </para>
        <para>While the achievement of majority rule in 1980 resolved the political and constitutional aspects of racial inequality in Rhodesia, it did not resolve the economic or social aspects. These remain a problem and a challenge to both blacks and whites. The problem includes an economy built on institutionalised discrimination, separate and unequal ownership of land, white control of industry, commerce, mining and commercial agriculture, a white near monopoly of skilled and better paid jobs and inequalities in housing, education and health services. </para>
        <para>To reorganise the economy without disrupting it and to reallocate resources so that inequalities are minimised and no longer based on race will take time. But the time available to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mugabe</inline> 's Government may be limited because the achievement of majority rule and the promises of two election campaigns have created expectations of rapid change among blacks. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mugabe</inline> will be able to improve the position of the worst affected blacks in the short term, particularly with international financial assistance. But in the Committee's view, in the longer term, he will need to resolve the crisis of expectation while retaining black confidence, retain the cooperation and confidence of whites, increase or at least maintain the overall productivity of the economy and cope with the immense problems of reconstruction. </para>
        <para>With the example of countries such as Mozambique, Prime Minister Mugabe would be well aware of the need to avoid an exodus of expertise and would be unlikely to precipitate a radical redistribution of resources which would force out whites and their expertise, cause the economy to decline and worsen the position of blacks. Additionally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mugabe</inline> would be aware that the size and structure of the present economy is not such that everyone can enjoy the fruits of the modern sector. Nevertheless some redistribution of resources will be necessary to meet minimum black expectations. Land will have to be reallocated on a large scale; black minimum wages will need to be raised; and greater resources will need to be devoted to black education, housing, health facilities and infrastructure such as water supplies, roads and power. </para>
        <para>The white minority cannot expect to maintain its previous share of the limited resources of Zimbabwe at the expense of the black majority. The Committee's assessment is that whites in the less skilled positions will gradually leave Zimbabwe as their standard of living is eroded below an acceptable level. But I believe that the numbers of whites who will leave Rhodesia cannot be predicted because of the large number of variables involved. The important fact for this House to note is that, despite a seven-year guerrilla war, Rhodesia became Zimbabwe through elections which peacefully produced a black government. If this government can successfully run Zimbabwe, reconcile its white minority to black rule and social equality with blacks and achieve a narrowing of economic inequalities, then Zimbabwe should prove a crucial stabilising force on the economies of the front-line states of Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Botswana, Tanzania and Angola. Progress by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mugabe's</inline> Government will also bring pressure to bear on the Republic of South Africa in relation to its internal racial problems and for an early determination of the future of Namibia. </para>
        <para>The Committee made few recommendations but it did believe that there was an urgent need for aid in Zimbabwe and that it should be within the first two years of its independence. The Committee was pleased to note an Australian aid grant of $5m, to be provided over the next two years, was offered by the Australian Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> at the Independence Day celebrations on 18 April 1980 and that $ 1 .5m of it had been allocated for the immediate rehabilitation and expansion of facilities such as schools and hospitals and for veterinary work and agricultural rehabilitation. The Committee welcomes these initiatives and urges the Government to keep the needs of Zimbabwe under review. If requests for additional aid are received from Zimbabwe, the Committee urges that they be considered sympathetically so that the hardwon independence of that country is not jeopardised. </para>
        <para>The Committee also urges the Australian Government and governments around the world to offer what assistance, expertise and facilities they can to assist in alleviating the hardships of rural poverty in Zimbabwe. The Committee also urges the Australian Government to contribute financially to any schemes established to finance land redistribution and agricultural development in an independent Zimbabwe and to provide what other assistance it can such as the provision of experts, technical assistance, training, et cetera. </para>
        <para>I pay my own tribute to the work done by our own Prime Minister at the Lusaka Conference and in the following London Lancaster House talks. As honourable members will observe, this is not a short report. We are confident that it will be regarded as a good report. It is the hope of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and, particularly the members of the SubCommittee on Southern Africa that this report, in bringing together all the current information on Zimbabwe, will become a point of reference for an historical understanding of events that have led up to the independent emergence of Zimbabwe this year and a background to assist in understanding the problems that will continue to face the government of that country. There can be no doubt that Prime Minister Mugabe is fully aware of the massive social and economic problems that he has inherited and the even greater aspirations of his people which will fully test his ability to govern. I wish him well in the gargantuan task ahead of him and his Government. May God guide him to continuing peace and new prosperity for all Zimbabweans. </para>
        <para>I conclude by thanking all those who have assisted the Committee to date, either by presenting oral and/or written evidence or by providing documentary source material. The Committee would particularly like to thank the staff of the Parliamentary Library and the National Library for their assistance in locating- a task in itselfand obtaining resource material, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff for the transcripts of evidence and the Committee secretariat, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Vander Wyk who is the Secretary and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Jill</inline> Chorazy who is the research officer, for their outstanding efforts and assistance.

          <para>-by leave-I am happy to second the remarks of the  Chairman  of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence Sub-Committee on Southern Africa particularly in relation to the staff members who supported the work of the Sub-Committee. One is always amazed, given the extremely limited staff resources that are provided for these committees, that members of the staff are able to achieve in many ways, distinguished and painstaking work in a very short period. I would like to congratulate members of the support staff for the work that they have done in this very comprehensive report. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In a sense, as was pointed out by the  Chairman  of the Sub-Committee, the speed of events in Zimbabwe, tended, if anything, to outpace the Committee. After something like 10 years of a rather frozen situation in Zimbabwe, in recent years things have moved at an accelerated rate. Firstly, there was the internal settlement in March 1978, followed a year later by the April 1979 election. A few months later, this was followed by the Lancaster House Conference from September to December 1979; the February 1980 election; and the coming to power of the Mugabe Government in April 1980. The result of this very rapid movement of events in Zimbabwe has meant that in many ways our report is an immediate report on a rapid pattern of events in southern Africa. One might say that it is a contemporary assessment of complex and quick moving events. It will be interesting to see how history judges such a report. </para>
        <para>As the  Chairman  pointed out, majority rule in 1980 resolved the political and constitutional aspects of racial inequality in Zimbabwe. It did not resolve the social and economic aspects of that inequality. The economy in Zimbabwe remains built on institutionalised discrimination. It is based on a separate and unequal ownership of land; something like S per cent of the population own 50 per cent of the land and the other 95 per cent of the population own the other 50 per cent of the land. In Zimbabwe white control of industry, commerce, mining and commercial agriculture is a fact of life. One has also the white monopoly of the skilled and better paid jobs in the society. Flowing through from these facts there are clear inequalities between the races in housing, education and health services. </para>
        <para>The challenge to the new Government in facing and seeking solutions to these deep seated problems are further compounded by the fact that today Zimbabwe is an armed society. Firstly, on all sides there is a superfluity of guns. Secondly, there are very high black expectations raised by the fact of two elections in two years and the promises made at those elections. Thirdly, as the elections themselves revealed, the problems are further compounded by a significant tribal division within Zimbabwe. Therefore, there is a formidable task before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mugabe</inline> and his Government. Let it be said now that it is a task in which all who desire evolutionary change in southern Africa have a vested interest. If Zimbabwe should descend into chaos and bloodshed the prospects for evolutionary change in southern Africa are practically nil. A successful transition in Zimbabwe is a necessity if South Africa is to have any chance of resolving its multiple dilemmas. It is not a sufficient condition. I am afraid that for every year South Africa's problems remain unresolved the prospect for violent revolutionary change in the republic becomes more likely. </para>
        <para>Nevertheless, unless Zimbabwe manages the present transition with success, for all of us, for the prospects South Africa and southern Africa generally will be unutterably bleak. Thus it is in the interests of the whole international community to support in every possible way the transition now taking place in Zimbabwe. The need for international aid is great, but it should be noted that that aid is really only a short term need. As our report points out, the natural resources of Zimbabwe; the fact that it is a developed modern economy; that it has a communications network second only to that of South Africa; that it has potential as a food exporter in the continent; and that it occupies a pivotal position in the transport networks of southern Africa, all mean that the long term economic prospects for Zimbabwe are good. The problems then are immediate. The immediate need lies primarily in the reconstruction of the agricutural infrastructure which was gravely damaged by the guerrilla war and affected by the last two years of drought. </para>
        <para>The guerrilla war and the conflict that took place, for instance, led to the destruction of cattle dips over much of Zimbabwe. Therefore, cattle diseases are now rife; anthrax particularly. There has been a deterioration in the crops partly because of the isolation forced through the policies of the protected villages. There has been a breakdown of veterinary services; in fact, a general breakdown of the scientific support for agriculture in Zimbabwe, as a result of the seven-year guerrilla warfare. One obvious feature of this is the re-emergence of the tsetse fly in parts of western Zimbabwe. In the last two years drought has compounded these problems. In a country basically and potentially a food exporter there are now severe problems of malnutrition particularly amongst the children. </para>
        <para>Australia can make an immediate and major contribution to the re-creation of the agricultural infrastructure of Zimbabwe. We possess expertise in most of the agricultural fields. We should be able to offer training facilities, personal expertise and financial asistance. One is glad to note that the Government has already taken steps in this direction. When we ask for these kinds of commitments by Australia we should note that in carrying through an aid program in this transition period we are not merely helping Zimbabwe over its immediate difficulties, but we are contributing to a peaceful resolution of the daunting problems confronting southern Africa. Perhaps that is the fundamental reason why people in this society and in other societies should make a major contribution in this difficult transition period. By contributing support for Zimbabwe we are not helping Zimbabwe alone; we are ensuring an evolutionary solution to the grave problems facing southern Africa. </para>

          <para>-by leave-I suppose people justifiably wonder why the member for Swan, a Western Australian metropolitan electorate, should be interested in the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence Sub-Committee on Southern Africa. Whilst my electors talk about other things they are concerned about our nearest neighbour on the western flank. Even though there is a vast distance across the Indian Ocean between ourselves and the continent of Africa, it is our neighbour to the west. People in the metropolitan area of Swan and other areas in Western Australia are vitally aware that southern Africa is our nearest neighbour. It has a great strategic influence on the future of Australia. We have to be concerned because the entrance from the Atlantic Ocean is around the Cape. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It has been my pleasure to be associated with the Committee. It has afforded me an opportunity of learning more about southern Africa. I certainly have taken the opportunity to learn more. If people listening do not understand the importance of the Committee, it is a committee comprised of members from both sides of both Houses of Parliament. Indeed, it is one of the few areas where members of Parliament not only coexist but also arrive at much the same sorts of conclusions based on the reasonable evidence that is given. It is one of those areas where generally there is not much scope for very strong ideological differences on the basis of the evidence. I think people are somewhat surprised to see the unanimity between the  Chairman  of the SubCommittee and the Opposition spokesman. There is no need to be surprised. We make our decisions on the basis of the evidence. It is most important for us, as the  Chairman  did, to convey the good wishes of this Parliament to the new Government of Zimbabwe. I had considerable reservations when our Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> exercised his influence and helped to bring about a situation different from that which I thought ought to prevail. In the long run that may be for the good. Certainly there was no unanimity on this side of the Parliament when that influence was exercised. </para>
        <para>As I say, I hope that in future things will work out and that there will be peace in Zimbabwe, as indeed we hope there will be in all of the countries in southern Africa. One of the real privileges of being associated with the Committee is to see just what developments are taking place and what the prospects are for peace in the future in Zimbabwe and other countries in southern Africa. I am very glad to have been associated with the Committee. I hope that in our next areas of investigation we can reach the same unanimity and come to the same general harmonious conclusions. </para>

          </talker>
          <para>-by leave-I am afraid that most of the information which we are receiving from Zimbabwe at present tends to be pessimistic because pessimistic reporting is what makes the headlines in the modern Press. A more than disheartening attitude was expressed in some of the speeches made in here this afternoon by honourable members who pointed to the great disadvantages and difficulties that Zimbabwe faces. That is true enough, but I want to say something about what I see as the heartening side of it all. In the last few years there have been some democratic developments in a world of trouble. Spain and Portugal have entered into what might be called political democracy. Spain has returned to democracy after 40 to 50 years but I do not know whether Portugal ever had democracy. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Events in two or three other African countries are heartening, but I think Zimbabwe offers the greatest hope of all, given the goodwill of the rest of the world, such as has been shown by the vigor with which the previous Government of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia was pursued by the United Nations and other countries. We now have to ask that people's interests, which in the past were expressed so vehemently about the situation in Zimbabwe, be directed to constructive assistance in a country which has a lot going for it, including the fact that oyer the last two years there has been a dramatic, almost dynamic development in that country. The internal agreement and the elections in 1979 and 1980 were dramatic advances in human affairs by which a country that was torn by strife, which had an active white minority suppressing a very large black majority, has been changed so that it now has what on paper is a democratic government, democratically elected. I hope that people will start to look upon the future of Zimbabwe more with optimism than with pessimism, given that there are difficulties for every country. </para>
        <para>I want to speak principally about what I see as Australia's duty. Firstly, we ought to be able to do more financially that to offer Zimbabwe $5m over two years. I speak as a respresentative of Australia south of the River Murray. Every week in that area a prize of $ 1 m is offered in a lottery. Perhaps we should supply tickets to everybody in the world to see whether they can all get on in on this. It seems to me that we live in a country where nobody seems surprised by sums of money such as that flowing around the country, but if the Australian nation as a whole offers Zimbabwe $5m over two years we pat ourselves on the back. We have to do better than that. There will be some limits to trade with Zimbabwe because it is similar to us in many ways, but on the technical and administrative side we ought to be able to give that country a lot of support. </para>
        <para>Zimbabwe is a country that has much going for it in the form of its people. Many highly skilled and highly educated black Africans who have not lived in that country for some years, ought to be able to go back there and obtain reasonable employment. Many white Africans and many overseas people who have gone to settle in that country ought to be encouraged, by whatever means, to stay. I think we should offer Zimbabwe a great deal of administrative and technical assistance. There may well be some room in Australian universities, technical colleges and tertiary institutions of all kinds for many of Zimbabwe's people while the infrastructure in education there catches up. </para>
        <para>Zimbabwe looks very much like a great deal of New South Wales. It is a country with a good deal of mineral resources at its disposal. It has established a very strong infrastructure in communication, roads and so on. The capital, Salisbury, is as well kept as almost any other city in the world. It was so even at the height of the troubles. A group of which I was a member went there in 1979 when the whole place was an armed camp. It is a country in which the Prime Minister has expressed a dedication to the democratic processes. </para>
        <para>I would think that one of the weaknesses of the situation in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia as has been pointed out here, is the domination of the economy by the white minority, external forces, the big banking systems and so on. I would suggest that we should assist Zimbabwe in the development of a base for public enterprise based upon the African ownership. There are very few African capitalists who would vote for my colleagues opposite. Zimbabwe does not have the capital to invest in large enterprises. Therefore, there is very little chance that the country will buy out existing institutions. As I understand it, Zimbabwe has no public bank in the sense in which we have a public banking system. We could offer a good deal of advice on a large number of public enterprises in this country; many of which are successful, some of which are not. Therefore, I have taken it upon myself to write to the Prime Minister and set out some of the things we do in this country on which we could offer advice to Zimbabwe. The biggest bank of this country is the Commonwealth Banking Corporation of Australia. I think the biggest mining operation in Australia is ran by the Electricity Commission of Victoria. The most ubiquitous communication system is that of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>
        <para>Scattered throughout the country are abba.toirs which are owned by some of the municipalities and enormous publicly owned communication networks, shipping lines and so on. There are even small enterprises which the Labor Government was responsible for establishing such as the publicly owned bakery at Yarrabah in northern Queensland. </para>
        <para>Therefore, I hope that instead of spending our time pondering the great value of the $5m we are to give to give Zimbabwe over two years we concentrate on the whole subject. The other heartening feature is that it has been demonstrated that the world can interfere in the internal misgovernment of a country and demand change. That is one of the world's greatest needs. When we start on all the rest of the villains that run the world and turn their countries into democracies that will be progress indeed. </para>

          <para>-by leave-The report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on Zimbabwe will be a valuable resource document for politicians, diplomats, interested observers and scholars alike. It is an excellent general historical record which also records Australia's interests in events in southern Africa. The Mugabe Government which is now in control of Zimbabwe has enormous difficulties ahead of it. It must meet the aspirations of the black electorate so as not to have a crisis of expectations whilst retaining the co-operation and confidence of the white people. My message to the whites in Zimbabwe- I have been there on two occasions- is that they should understand that Mugabe could well have a crisis of expectations and that they must expect change. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>One of the good points which has not been referred to in today's debate is that there has been, I think, a victory for the West. Certainly it has been a victory for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth, if it has done nothing else in its existence, has justified its existence by the peace that has been achieved in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. I think that needs to be stated. I refer to the role played by the Thatcher Government, Lord Carrington and above all the role played by Australia's Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> at the Lusaka Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. There is no doubt that the Australian Prime Minister and the Australian Government at that Meeting played a very important part in getting the parties together to sign the Lancaster House agreement. Behind the scenes Australia played a very important role in the Lancaster House agreement which led to the solution and the peace in Zimbabwe. It is a credit to Australia. I think it has enhanced its reputation in capitals around the world. </para>
        <para>The new Mugabe Government in Zimbabwe is an anti-Soviet government. That is something that is not often recorded. It is a government which is not friendly to the Soviet bloc. The East Germans were denied an invitation to attend the Zimbabwe independence celebrations. The events in Zimbabwe which have led to peace create a precedent for South Africa itself and its involvement in Namibia. Last week the Council for Namibia, a United Nations body which is concerned with Namibia, visited Australia. It held talks with the Committee whose report was presented today. Those talks were very useful for the members of the Committee, and I hope, for the Council for Namibia. Namibia- previously, the South West Africa mandated League of Nations mandated territory- will have an opportunity for a peaceful change to majority rule elections. South Africans on the one hand and the South West Africa People's Organisation on the other hand can learn lessons from the way in which Zimbabwe has solved its problems. South Africans must realise that they will not be able to conduct internal elections. Similarly, the South West Africa People's Organisation must realise that it cannot be the only party which contests those elections. It must have the confidence that the Patriotic Front had to face the people. If it wants a majority vote it must put it to the test at the ballot box. </para>
        <para>Similarly, the South African Government must pay attention. The South African Government does not have the time available that it thinks it has to adjust to change in that country. The aspirations of the majority in South Africa must be met. There have been recent acts of urban terrorism and today there were reports of an incident in the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg. There will be more occurrences of this kind. The South African Government must realise that it cannot tread on the majority in that country in the way that it has done in the past. The South African Government must meet the aspirations of the majority of people in that country. It should encourage the people to play an active role in an endeavour to stop separate development. All South Africans must be given a chance to have a say in the running of the country. </para>
        <para>I think that a strong black middle class should be developed. That has happened in Zimbabwe and is one of its strengths. It has large numbers of university graduates from all faculties across the board and it has a strong and active middle class in the business sector. It behoves that country well for the future and provides an example for the South Africans to follow. The South African Government must abolish apartheid. Effectively, no apartheid policy existed in Zimbabwe, which has been one of its strengths. There are lessons to be learned by the South African Government from the solution in Zimbabwe. There are encouraging signs in statements from Prime Minister Botha. I hope that those statements are met by reality in political action in that country in the future. </para>

        <para>I think it is necessary also to record our appreciation in relation to the many people who gave written submissions to the Committee and to witnesses who appeared before the Committee. It was not uncommon to have before the same hearing, whether in Melbourne, Canberra or Sydney, representatives of the Zimbabwe African National Union sitting alongside members from the Australian Rhodesian Association waiting to give evidence- two groups diametrically opposed in their views on the future outcome of the Zimbabwe position. It was a compliment to the staff and to the  chairman  that those proceedings were handled in a dignified and democratic way, and that the best evidence was obtained from those disparate witnesses. </para>
        <para>The other point which needs to be recorded is that there was a view, and perhaps there still is a minority view, in Australia that anybody who opposed the Smith regime was espousing a procommunist or pro-socialist cause. I think most people realise that that is absolutely absurd. The solution which is being achieved peacefully and avoiding an enormous amount of bloodshed should be applauded by all who are concerned about international events and about the future of the people of Zimbabwe. Another point which I would like to mention, which has already been stated by other honourable members but which I think should be recorded again, is the work of the Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Vander Wyk and the research assistant, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Jill</inline> Chorazy. I think they were almost put in a situation where they wished they had never started to write the report. This long and valuable resource document will be appreciated by all members of this Parliament and by people outside the Parliament. </para>
        <para>There are a number of aspects in the report. In the brief time available to me I should like to refer to the question of sanctions and the way in which the international community was able to use sanctions against Rhodesia effectively. Very few occasions arise when penalties can be imposed, other than military-type penalties. The use of sanctions is one of the few peaceful means by which the international community can state an opinion that another country should not be acting in a certain way. One chapter of the report clearly states that in the long term those sanctions were reasonably successful. I think it is worth while stating for the benefit of honourable members that on this occasion the sanctions were able to put pressure on Rhodesia at a time when other factors were adversely affecting Rhodesia. The sanctions helped in applying pressure which was also being exerted on Rhodesia by the Patriotic Front and other organisations which were trying to attain what we now regard as basic rights for the majority of people in that country. </para>
        <para>Reference was made to Namibia by the honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Shipton).</inline> The Sub-Committee, of course, has not completed its work. This was only one small part of a general reference given to it by the full Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. This morning the Committee resolved to proceed to examine the situation of Namibia. It is hoped that the example of a peaceful settlement of the difficulties in Zimbabwe will be recognised by the South African Government and by others and that they will help solve the difficulties presently being experienced in Namibia. Recently, of course, representatives from the United Nations Council for Namibia advised members of this Parliament of the difficulties being experienced in obtaining majority independent rule in Namibia. I thank the House for the opportunity of making those few remarks. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">This Bill, introduced into the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> passed that chamber last Friday. It is a simple proposal for an amendment to the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905. It is to correct what is, ostensibly, an injustice. The Act was introduced and passed at a time when wireless telegraphy was in its infancy. That system, so much a part of our every daylife, was not even in operation in Australia when the original Act became law. The new Parliament of the Commonwealth, then only four years from its first sitting, decided to support and, in fact, strengthen the approach proposed by the then Governmentthat is, that like posts and telegraphs, this aspect of the communications system should be a government monopoly. </para>
          <para>Accordingly, the Wireless Telegraphy Act contains provisions which were designed to ensure and protect a government monopoly. It contains a total prohibition against the use of radio. It contains a penalty of five years' imprisonment for the unlawful use of radio. It contains a provision for the automatic forfeiture of any equipment unlawfully used. Those provisions were, in 1905, seen as appropriate to protect not only what was then intended to be a government monopoly but also what was feared as a means by which would-be traitors could provide information to an enemy. </para>
          <para>Today the wheel has totally turned. Today sections of the community are required by law to install and use two-way radio. Fishermen, aircraft operators and others are required to purchase, install, licence and use two-way radio. The Wireless Telegraphy Act is now the basis of a licensing system to control community use- in some cases it is compulsory use- of wireless telegraphy. However, the anachronistic and draconian provisions for heavy penalties and automatic forfeiture now apply to citizens whose only offence is to fail to pay a licence fee upon the due date. </para>
          <para>Two-way radios of the type fitted to many fishing boats in Australian waters cost anywhere between $2,000 and $ 10,000. Yet, if a fisherman forgets, omits or otherwise fails to pay his $25 of $50 licence fee on the due date, he is not only liable to imprisonment for five years but also incurs the automatic forfeiture of his radio equipment. A court is powerless to permit, or direct, the return of the equipment. Neither is there any power for the Minister to direct, after an offender has been dealt with by the court, that the equipment be returned. That situation is recognised as both harsh and unconscionable and the result of a classical anachronism. </para>
          <para>This Bill, therefore, proposes an amendment to the Wireless Telegraphy Act to give to the Minister a discretion to direct the return of otherwise forfeited equipment to the owner. The passage of the Bill will not only correct an anomalous situation but will also enable a particular injustice to be rectified. A fisherman will not only have been fined by a court for his failure to pay his licence fee upon the due date and have suffered a loss of many thousands of dollars of income for the period during which he could not use his boat because it was not equipped with the legally required radio equipment, but also will, unless this Bill is approved, suffer a loss of forfeiture of about $4,500 worth of radio equipment. </para>
          <para>I ask honourable members to join with me in correcting a particular injustice and providing for the elimination of other potential injustices which will occur unless the anachronism is corrected. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

          <para class="block">The present bid by the metal trades unions for a 35-hour week poses a serious threat to the economy and to the employment prospects of Australians. Indeed, it is probably the most serious threat to the economy and employment prospects that we have had in the last five years. Unfortunately, most of the demands of unions in this country over recent years have had an air of unreality about them. The disruption proposed in pursuit of a 35-hour week is yet another folly. But this time it is a most dangerous folly which, if successful, would have dire consequences for employment. </para>
          <para>My concern, as Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, is for the harm which a 35-hour week will do to the employment prospects of future Australians and those presently seeking work. It is of great concern that unions base their case for the snorter week on the simplistic argument that it will help create extra jobs. Yet, when the proposal is analysed more closely, it will be seen that the exact opposite will be the case. The arguments about extra jobs are cynical. They are a cynical attempt by unions to gain wider community support for their own selfish ends. Let me make it clear: The unions' claim will not create jobs. It will both destroy today's jobs and deny jobs to future Australians. Let me re-emphasise recent comments by my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> that the Government is not fooled by the unions' case. Private enterprise is not fooled and the wider community is quickly recognising the unions' transparent self-interest. Even the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> who is at the table for this debate, has publicly opposed, if not destroyed, the arguments put forward by the unions in support of their case. </para>
          <para>The unions' position and its employment consequences are worth examining in some detail. The metal trades unions want to work a 35-hour week- a reduction of five hours on present award arrangements. However, whilst they propose to reduce hours worked by 1216 per cent they do not propose to accept a reduction in pay of the same magnitude. Far from it; they do not propose to accept a wage reduction at all. No doubt the unions think that maintaining the same weekly payment for working 1214 per cent less hours is a clever way to disguise a massive wages claim. The unions argue that the reduction in hours will lead to more jobs. On the basis of one of their leader's claims, the 400,000 or so unionists involved would, by working five hours less a week, help create another 250,000 jobs. That is their assertion. What startling economic logic is behind that claim is not clear at all. It is even more wild-eyed than the claims made in favour of the Labor Opposition's employment creation schemes which we have shown would be at the expense of the taxpayer to the tune of $ 1 ,000m a year. The real fact of the matter is not that a 35-hour week would create jobs but rather that it would reduce job opportunities on a large scale. Working less hours for the same pay and lowering the threshold for overtime payments would boost industry's labour costs by a significant margin at the very time when the economy is showing a greatly improved capacity to absorb an additional 181,000 people in employment over the last 12 months. What timing on the part of the unions to seek to introduce a 3 5 -hour week at the very time when the economy is showing that kind of strength! </para>
          <para>The Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia has calculated that the shorter week would add some 14 per cent to normal hourly labour costs and 2 1 per cent if the five hours' reduction were taken up in overtime. Taking on extra employees to try to avoid higher overtime payments would not be a solution either. They would still have to be paid the higher hourly wage rate and overheads would also be unnecessarily increased. It is small wonder that industry representatives have labelled the proposal as suicidal and as directly threatening some 70,000 jobs. </para>

              <para>- There was pace-setting by the Government of the day and the unrestrained rise in wages devastated employment. As my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe highlights, it was a time not of job creation but of job destruction. As these huge increases- 36 per cent in the award wage of adult males and 28 per cent in average weekly earnings- permeated industry in 1974-75 the result was catastrophic. Employment in the private sector fell by over 150,000. In the manufacturing sector more than 120,000 jobs vanished. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The metal trades unions have such short memories that they can ignore recent economic history. Can they really have such a callous disregard for the health of the Australian economy and the security of employment of their fellow workers? Does the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Hawke, have such a short memory that he does not recall his own words at a union conference in 1979, in bringing home to trade union leaders the fact that when they press for higher real wages they ought to be concerned at the plight of the children of their own members who cannot get jobs. I recall <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> the  President  of the ACTU, flirting fleetingly with humanity and the realities of the proposition that ever-increasing demands for higher real wages would destroy the job prospects of the members of those unions who were demanding them. </para>
          <para>A 35-hour week would be a great blow to the Australian manufacturing industry. Our manufacturing sector remains a cornerstone of the economy and is engaged in a process of revitalisation, better to meet the international competitive pressures of the coming decade. Manufacturing employment, after suffering a loss of 170,000 jobs over the last five years, has now turned the corner. Recent months have shown an increase in employment. This welcome trend must be sustained. It cannot be destroyed, but it will be if a 35-hour week is introduced. The direct consequences of a 35-hour week, bad as they would be for the cost structure and the metal trades industry would be only the start of the decline in employment opportunities. Our international competitiveness would be adversely affected and manufacturing exports would suffer. Domestic consumers would be dissuaded by higher prices from buying goods using metal products. Spin-off effects would reduce jobs in other supplying industries. No doubt other unions would also engage in the crazy pursuit of the success- if one could call it that- of the metal trades unions if they secured a 35-hour week. Labour costs would be pushed up further and inflation accelerated. The hard-won gains in employment growth that I have mentioned- 181,000 jobs in the last year- would evaporate and Australia's economy would be headed for what might be termed properly banana republic status. This is a frightening scenario but one with the real possibility of being foisted upon us if this campaign for a 35-hour week were to succeed. It shows why the unions' claim must be resisted at all costs. </para>
          <para>At this point I commend the judgment of the Leader of the Opposition, who is seated at the table, in identifying the 35-hour week as being so damaging to the economy. I hope, and the Government certainly hopes, that he will play his part in ensuring that sense and reason prevail within the union movement. I do not make that request of him lightly, because I propose to quote directly from his statements which have appeared recently in a number of newspapers. I turn firstly to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 9 May 1 980, in which he is reported to have said:  1 have got to say frankly, that as an economist, not only in terms of being an academic but also as an experienced administrator and a former Treasurer, and recognising as a Government we have to administer the affairs of this country with economic sense, I would not support a 35-hour week at this time. </para>
          <para class="block">Those are the words of the Leader of the Opposition, with which apparently his colleague the honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James)</inline> violently disagrees. The Leader of the Opposition went on: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In my view, it would have damaging consequences to many industries and I see a much greater need at this point to use resources that are available to generate more jobs, to get the economy fully employed rather than moving to a 35-hour week. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I remind honourable members of the terms of my motion: That there should not be a general 35-hour week in Australian industry because, firstly, a shorter working week will have damaging consequences for it, especially in export markets. In other words, I am asking the House to agree not only with the Government but also the Leader of the Opposition. My motion goes on that the resources of the nation, including our work force, should be used to generate more jobs and get the economy fully employed, rather than in trying to force Australian industry into a shorter working week. Again, I ask that the House agree with both the Government's view and that of the Leader of the Opposition on this issue. Perhaps it will be one of those occasions upon which a bipartisan policy can be adopted by the two parties. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the transcript of another statement made by the Leader of" the Opposition on an Australian Broadcasting Commission program on 12 May. The transcript states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden:</inline>The fact is that shorter working hours will not resolve the unemployment problem but rather intensify it. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We are asking by this motion that the Leader of the Opposition stand up and be counted in favour of those people who are presently looking for a job and in favour of the children of union members and others who in the future will be seeking employment. It is indeed a great pity that the metal trades unions have not put the time and resources that they are wasting on a 35-hour week claim into the training area. We must learn as a nation to adjust positively to change in production techniques and its impact on the structure of employment. This will require greater flexibility in manpower policies and training methods, which should be directed to increasing the number of skilled tradesmen produced by Australia and to improving the productivity of Australian industry. The interests of the rank and file members of the unions would be far better served through creative union participation in the necessary restructuring of trade training practices to meet the challenges of the 1980s than by mounting this damaging 35-hour week campaign. The Government would be glad of union assistance and would look forward to the opportunity to co-operate with the union movement in bringing about the necessary changes in trade training. </para>
          <para>As a government we have made great strides towards laying the foundations for sustained and dynamic employment development through the decade. Our objective is to establish a high growth economy with minimal inflation and ready adaptability to the latest technology. With healthy and sustained employment growth in prospect, now is surely not the time to turn back the clock by again pricing labour out of the market. In my statement to the House on employment prospects in the 1 980s on 29 April I noted: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The only sure way of expanding employment is to keep costs down. Private enterprise- not least the export and import competing sectors- is thereby enabled to become more competitive and to expand production and investment, lt is no coincidence that the past 12 months have witnessed not only a pick up in employment but also further strengthening in output. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I can only emphasise that view in the present context and in the present debate. Australian union leaders too often indulge in acts of industrial stupidity, I very much regret to say, which, I would also add, their own rank and file members really do not want to follow. The bid for a 35-hour week in present economic circumstances is the most reckless act that we have seen for some time. I hope that the metal trades unions and their leaders will recognise before further unnecessary industrial disruption takes place their obligation to their fellow workers and to all job seekers. </para>
          <para>I notice that the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> is sitting alongside the honourable member for Hunter. I presume by that that the honourable member for Port Adelaide disagrees with his leader, who has condemned this claim for a 35-hour week. I can assure the community that this Government will be doing all that it can to stop this madness before it develops much further. Let <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> give the leadership to which he aspires by calling off this 35-hour week claim. Let the Leader of the Opposition display the influence which he claims to have within the labour movement. Let members of the Opposition rally behind their leader and behind this Government on this motion. By doing that the Leader of the Opposition will be standing in this House by the words that he has been prepared to utter publiclywords with which we agree. One clear conclusion is to be drawn from this 35-hour week campaign- that is, that it will create great damage, great harm, to the economy and will destroy employment prospects for the future. I therefore have no hesitation in strongly commending this motion to the whole of the House. </para>

              <para>- I am nattered that the Minister should seek to serve his time so productively as to devote himself to reading what I have been saying on economic matters in recent times. He would be well served if he understood what he read; unfortunately he does not. I dilute in no way at all comments that I have made on this subject. I would regard it as being most undesirable should there be immediately or in the very near future the universal introduction of a 35-hour week- that is, something brought in suddenly and disruptively. I can state quite categorically- I will give the source in a few minutes- that that is a view shared by the trade union movement essentially and has been expressed as recently as last night and this morning by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I thought when I entered this debate that I might well find myself in the happy situation of supporting the proposition which was put by the Minister. After all, he stated: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. this House is of the opinion that there should not be a general 35 hour week in Australian industry because - </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">He said: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. there should not be a general . . . </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The operative word is 'general'. The <inline font-style="italic">Oxford Dictionary</inline> states that 'general' means 'completely or approximately universal'. My view has been put in terms of that meaning and in terms of the sudden implementation of such a proposition. However, what the Minister sought to develop today in this debate was not an argument about the implementation of a universal, sudden 35-hour week in industry, but was total opposition to the introduction of a 35-hour week in any pan of industry at any time. That is nonsense on two scores. It is nonsense first on the score that already a substantial proportion of the work force works less than 40 hours a week and very many of that proportion work a 35-hour week. It may be that the Minister is asserting that by implication he excluded that group of people. If so, he ought to declare that. As his arguments stood, as he presented them, he did not exclude those people. Accordingly, he showed the prejudiced approach that he has to this subject and, even more, the ill-informed way in which he adopts his attitudes to it. If, however, he is arguing that that group is excluded and that he was referring essentially to those who do not have a working week of less than 40 hours at present, he simplifies too greatly what is an enormously complex and difficult situation. </para>
          <para>The fact is that working hours in this country are a matter of considerable tension within the community, not just amongst the people at the work benches and in the offices but also amongst their families. This tension provides the genesis for considerable social and economic discord in the future unless there are sensible responses to the way in which the Government develops its economic policies to respond to varying approaches on this matter. I refer to different concepts of justice and need and the capacity of industry to respond to people's expectations. This is an area of rampant inconsistency and injustice. It bristles, I repeat, with difficulties. Let us look at some of the difficulties. For instance, powerhouse workers in Australia except those in Victoria work a 35-hour or 37Vi-hour week. The powerhouse workers in Queensland, as recently as two months ago, obtained a 37'/4-hour week through the generosity of the Queensland Country Party Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen.</inline> That seems to me to demolish much of the conservative proposition which was put without any exceptions at all by the conservative Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. </para>
          <para>Again, I remind the House that 40 per cent of Australian workers- 40 per cent of Australians who are in the work place- are working less than 40 hours a week and a substantial number of that proportion are working 35 hours a week already. Other aspects have to be considered. If they are not attended to sensibly and sensitively by government they will generate a lot of industrial tension with concomitant costs for the rest of the community. The obvious consequence of this will be industrial discord because mostly, the people who are working less than 40 hours per week are people in the more comfortable, more attractive and more fulfilling occupations in the white collar section of industry. That means that those with the less attractive, more unpleasant, most burdensome and least fulfilling jobs are those who are working the longest hours. They are working the hardest and getting the least pay for it. I repeat that the implementation immediately or in the near future of a universal 35-hour week would have devastating consequences. But it would be just as devastating to ignore these factors which I have been outlining and the growing sense of the injustice which is developing in the community. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in fact has set the way on this matter. The Commission said at paragraph 6, page 37 of its national wage decision on 28 March this year: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Each year the Commission will consider what increase in total wage or changes in conditions of employment should be awarded nationally on account of productivity. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is, the Commission has signalled that it is not just there to consider the matter of wages; it is there also to consider the matters of changes in conditions of employment which include, inter alia, the issue of working hours, and that there could be a trade off in terms of productivity. That is a matter I want to come to in a minute because it is generating an enormous sense of aggrievement in the work force at present. There has not been a settlement for productivity through the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission hearings since May 1974. That is a substantial level of discrimination and a massive disadvantage for these people. </para>
          <para>What are the unions talking about? What is the Australian Council of Trade Unions talking about? They are talking about approaching this matter through the proper courses available in the community. They are not talking about going out and holding up employers or closing down industry in the way in which the Minister claimed. They are talking about using the proper processes of conciliation and arbitration, of lodging claims before the industrial court process and having those claims weighed up and, on the facts presented, a judgment made. If it is the view of the court that no case stands, the claims will be rejected. If it is the view of the court that perhaps in particular industries a case does stand, the court will conclude that the claim should be met. But that is a matter for the courts to conclude, not a matter for this Parliament which is a totally inappropriate forum for this matter to be discussed in. Discussion in this place will generate considerable heat, not a little tension and no illumination at all. </para>
          <para>The Minister has sought to polarise and to harden attitudes in this institution, as he will effectively do outside it, on a highly sensitive issue where there was room for greater mutual understanding. </para>
          <para>The ACTU has said this, among other things: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The executive recognising the policy of the ACTU calls for an effective campaign to reduce working time should be conducted having regard to: </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The ACTU lists five points. Point (D) states: </para>

            <para>The reality that such a campaign will not be won overnight; and </para>

          <quote>
            <para>That responses of industry will necessarily be variable. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It goes without saying that the ACTU is also talking about lodging those claims through the industrial court processes. I cannot see any room for cavilling over such a proposition, that is, that there should be fair and impartial adjudication on the facts which are presented. I know that honourable members on the Government side would regard that as the least desirable thing. After all, they spend a great deal of time trying to bluff, bully and bluster at the arbitration system and obstruct the Arbitration Commission. The ACTU also said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The campaign for reduced working time has to be seen in its proper context that a substantial part of our workforce already work less than forty hours per week. The standards which already apply to clerical and administrative employees, coal, oil, electricity generating, stevedoring workers and the existing pattern of employment demonstrate the clear discrimination which applies to working hours in our society. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That tension, that sense of injustice, is not going to go away because of a hortatory speech by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs in the House today. It will grow; it will well up into considerable industrial tension and spill out into industrial discord. There are clear economic costs in that just as there are clear economic costs in moving in the direction about which I have spoken too extensively, too quickly. Those are the things which must be weighed up. </para>
          <para>Let us look at some of the sense of frustration is the work force at present. I refer to the declining living standards and the massive tax rip off from which the average employee is suffering at present. The average employee- that is, the man on average weekly earnings supporting a wife and two children- would have to have an increase in his pay after tax of more than $16 a week to have the same real purchasing power that he had four years ago. Every Australian household is paying $800 now in petrol tax to keep the Government going- this Government with its rapacious taxation policies. The social wage- that is, the additions to people's living standards which are derived through enlightened welfare policies- has been enormously diminished since this Government came into office. For instance, the cost of basic health insurance has gone up from 1 . 1 per cent of average weekly earnings to 6.4 per cent of average weekly earnings. In terms of medical service costs, the people of Australia are paying directly from their pockets $700m more this year as a result of the changes in health insurance than would have been the case if the original Medibank proposals, which the Government guaranteed to preserve, had been retained. The people are getting no more; they are paying that much more taxation. </para>
          <para>If we look at areas such as housing, welfare benefits for dependant children and education we see this erosion taking place with dramatic effect. A family with two dependent children who are living away from home and who are in receipt of benefits from the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, today is $20 a week worse off in real terms than five years ago in spite of a promise to preserve the real spending power of those payments. Welfare spending for Aboriginals has been reduced in real terms by 3 1 per cent or some $35m in spite of grim health problems, deplorable housing needs, educational disadvantage and the worst unemployment rate in Australia. A former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is sitting at the table at the moment; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> and his silence convicts his negligence in his approach. </para>
          <para>Let me make it clear what has been happening as a result of the rip-off going on at the expense of Australian people- families. In the Fraser Government's first four Budgets some $2, 500m was handed out to business in tax concessions. To these concessions must be added another $ 1,680m paid directly as subsidies and assistance grants to industry generally since the end of 1975. The full extent of the Government's generosity to business, to industry, has totalled almost $4.2 billion in four years. This has been paid for by increased taxes. Subsidies have been provided to the large corporate sector by reducing welfare benefits and depressing the living standards of Australian families. Let me go on. </para>

              <para>-The Minister said that companies pay high taxes. Let us get this on the record: Between 1975-76 and 1978-79 the rate of pay-as-you-earn income tax that is the tax paid by the bulk of the families of this country increased by 48 per cent but their wages, salaries and supplements increased by only 35 per cent. In the same period company tax increased by a little over 20 per cent. However, the income of incorporated enterprises increased by well over 32 per cent. That is, taxes increased faster than wages for people but for companies profits increased faster than taxation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let us look at productivity. There has not been an increase and a settlement in respect of productivity since 1974. In spite of that, productivity has gone up 9'/4 per cent. In the same period there has been an increase in average minimum award wages of 59.3 per cent as against a consumer price index increase of 69 per cent. So there has been a loss in real terms in the average minimum award wage of 10 per cent in that period, to which must be added a loss of payment for a 9Vi per cent productivity increase, which means very clearly a loss of nearly $2 1 a week in the spending power of someone on average minimum award rates. </para>
          <para>The attitude of the Government in terms of wages is one of implacable and invariable hostility. But in terms of profit there is always an explanation, always a justification and profits have been soaring in recent times. Again, there have been no proposals by this Government to respond to technology in spite of the finding of the Crawford Committee of Inquiry. These things have devastating consequences for people in the work force. Inadequate provision has been made to attend to these great processes of change which are taking place in the work force. In that situation there will be resistance to these processes of change and individuals in the community will seek to bring about the redistribution that government is failing to achieve whether through changed hours, wages or other conditions of work. </para>

              <para>-Order! The honourable member for Robertson will resume his seat, as will the honourable member for St George who has not yet been recalled. The honourable member for Hunter perhaps requires medical attention. I suggest that he seek it. The Chair elects not to have heard the reflective remarks of the honourable member for Robertson. The Chair was in the process of urging honourable gentlemen to afford honourable members who have been called the opportunity to address the House in silence. This may be a vain ambition in most situations, but I certainly request that honourable gentlemen observe it to the greatest extent possible. I call the honourable member for St George. </para>

              <para>- What are they scared of? It is extraordinary that we have to show the splits in the ranks of the Labor Party from the mouths of its members. We have been trying for more than a week to find out whether members of the Opposition agree on the policy of the 35-hour week. They cannot even agree on the tactic of one of their number, to disrupt debate in this House and to prevent an honourable member who has been called from speaking. They have just split on the floor of the House on a procedural matter. We know that they are completely and utterly split on the question of the 3 5 -hour week. All the Leader of the Opposition had to do was to say in his speech that he acknowledged that this motion was in his words; that it was framed in the words which he used and which were reported to the Australian people last week. All he had to do was to say: 'I will vote for this motion'. He refused to do so and the reason he refused - </para>

              <para>- He refused to say that he will vote for the motion. I think, without canvassing anything you might say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> that is relevant to this matter. The essence of this motion is to ensure that the public of Australia know where the Labor Party stands on this important question of a 35-hour week. The people know where the Government stands. We thought, when the Leader of the Opposition made statements last week, that we knew where the Labor Party stood. The public are entitled to bipartisanship on this extremely vital matter and they are entitled to political leadership from the Leader of the Opposition. He should stick to his words and he should vote with the Government on this matter. If he is not prepared to vote with the Government on this motion, he ought to have the decency to resign from the Parliament and from public life. He should stand by the words that he used last week. If he votes with the Government- and on the presumption that the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> seeks to vote against this motion- he should resign his position as Leader of the Opposition because he cannot carry his party with him. </para>

          <para>The facts are that we have waited for more than a week to find out the official policy of the Labor Party. Last week there were two brilliant speeches, by the honourable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Burr)</inline> and by the honourable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Porter).</inline> Throughout their speeches, in which they set out the serious economic problems facing this country from a general application of the 35-hour week in competitive industries in particular, they called time and again for the Labor Party to state its policy. The two speakers for the Labor Party on that day refused to say whether they agreed with the statement of the Leader of the Opposition that a 35-hour week should not be introduced at this time. We know on good authority that the Leader of the Opposition, during recent meetings of the Labor Party Executive, threatened to resign over this issue. </para>

              <para>- Every attempt has been made to disrupt this debate. Firstly, the Labor Party tried to take points of order which you overruled, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> and then attempted to prevent me from speaking. Then its members walked out of the House and it had the gall to call for a quorum. Members of the Opposition realise that they are hoist on their own petard. They just do not know whether they can support this matter if it has to be decided in this House today on a vote. They do not believe in supporting the Leader of the Opposition. He will not say which way he will vote on the issue. They are completely and utterly split. We know from media reports that the honourable member for Reid described the statement of the Leader of the Opposition on the 35-hour week as pompous and warned that it would be used by the Government. We know from media statements that that was followed by a statement from the honourable member for </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> who took a strong stand against the Leader of the Opposition. We know from media reports that quite a number of other honourable members, although conceding in private that the Leader of the Opposition had a point, stated that they questioned the wisdom of his taking such a stand publicly in the week that the unions had brought their claim. In other words, they are not interested in the truth of the substance of the matter. They are interested only in political advantage and in hiding their true thoughts on the position. They are interested only in misleading the Australian public. </para>
          <para>Would any member in the House believe that it was not a misleading of the Australian public to say, as the Leader of the Opposition did, that the unions are not threatening to go on strike? They have said that every fourth week they will run their own 35-hour week, will have a 41/2-day week and will go on strike for half a day a week. That decision was confirmed again at a meeting of unionists in Sydney today. They passed a resolution to go on strike from now on every fourth week in support of this claim. For the Leader of the Opposition to say that they are not threatening strike action is absolute rubbish. The fact is that all that members of the Opposition have to do is to say how they will vote and what is their policy. There has been no attempt to do that. The honourable member for Port Adelaide, who spoke last week, spent the whole of his time wriggling on the hook in the same way that the Leader of the Opposition did today. </para>
          <para>Let us briefly get rid of a number of the points that the Opposition seems to think matter in this debate. Firstly, it does not matter that 40 per cent of the Australian work force is already on less than a 40-hour working week. It does not matter for the simple fact that that was the position last week when the Leader of the Opposition made his statement that a general move to a 35-hour working week would damage the economy. We say that the move to a 35-hour week generally, and in particular in the metal trades industry, will have serious consequences for Australia, particularly for the export market. There occurs another split in the Labor ranks because the Leader of the Opposition said that this would have serious effects on our export markets. The honourable member for Port Adelaide denied that claim completely. He said, as did the honourable member for Burke <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keith Johnson),</inline> that the metal trades had hardly any export factor and therefore it was not a relevant factor. The Labor Party is split even on the arguments that it is using. </para>
          <para>They talk about the word 'general' appears in the motion. The Leader of the Opposition decided that he could hide behind the fact that the word 'general' is in the motion. He started off by saying: 'I thought I was going to be able to support the Leader of the House on this motion until I realised that the word "general" was in the motion'. The reason why that word is in the motion is that that is what this issue is about. We know that some members of the work force today work less than 40 hours a week. We know that that occurred on the day when the Leader of the Opposition spoke. We are concerned about any immediate movement to a general 35-hour week. That is why the word 'general' is included in the motion. That is exactly why the Leader of the Opposition ought to vote for it. It is not the reason why he should be wriggling on the hook trying to hide behind words, facades and incoherent mumblings. </para>
          <para>The reason why he would not say exactly where he wanted to stand today was that, as he stood to speak, the left wing of the Labor Party tramped into this House, sat down behind him and gave him every possible form of black stare. He had to stand on his tightrope, he had to juggle all the balls, he had to juggle with his integrity, to try to find a formula that would enable him to retain his position as Leader of the Opposition and yet still retain some credibility in the eyes of the Australian public. It did not work. He has failed the Australian people because this is the House of Parliament where he should reinforce his statements. The Parliament is the place where he should get up and, when a motion is on the Notice Paper, in general terms and using his words, he must vote for that motion or be forever discredited in the eyes of the public. Alternatively, if he is not prepared to get his party to vote with him- in other words, if he cannot carry the support of his party- he has to resign as Leader of the Opposition. We want him to stand up and to be counted. We want the rest of the Labor Party to stand up and to be counted. </para>
          <para>Let us take the integrity issue further down the line. Let the honourable member for Reid come into this House, call for a division and oppose this motion. Let him call for a division. Let us see him put his own leader to the sword on this issue. Let us see him put his leader to the test. That is what this debate is all about. The arguments that were produced in an attempt to wriggle off the hook simply will not work. We want a vote on this matter and we want a vote as soon as possible. Today we are dealing with the question of a 35-hour working week. We do not want any vacillation about the future. We do not want any argument based on the claim that one day there will be a 30-hour week and then a 25-hour week. The honourable member for Port Adelaide stood in the House the other day and said that one day, there will be a 35-hour week. He said that then there will be a 30-hour week and then a claim for a 25-hour working week. That is an argument of reduction to absolute absurdity. If his argument is followed we will end up with a 5-hour working week. </para>
          <para>The fact of life is that the left wing of the Labor Party is forcing the Leader of the Opposition into an absolutely untenable position. Unless he votes for this motion today and carries his Party with him, he retains no credit in this country. The left wing of the Labor Party and the trade union movement are pushing this campaign for a 35-hour working week. The left wing leaders of the unions are leading the industrial lemmings' movement to kill the economic prospects of the workers. One man's pay increase is another man's job, as we know. One man's reduction in hours means another machine or a computer. The public wants to know where both the major parties stand. They know where the Government stands. They want to know where the Leader of the Opposition stands. I ask the honourable member for Gellibrand: 'How will you vote?' We have waited for one week and we have not been told how any of the members of the Opposition will vote on this issue. We want a vote. We want all members of the Labor Party to support the motion. Then they can hold their heads up. If they do not vote for this motion, they had better hang their heads in shame in front of the whole of the Australian people and fight it out in their caucus cavern. They will never again have any credibility in the minds of the Australian public. </para>

            <para>-The Government has sought to put the Opposition on trial in this debate. But let us make it absolutely clear that we are in no way on trial. If anyone is on trial in this country it is this Government which is responsible for the highest unemployment we have had for the last 40 years. It is this Government which is on trial. Government members are on trial and will have to answer to the electorate at the end of this year for their mistakes over the last four and a half years. Let there be no doubt about that. </para>

          <para>The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> has talked about a banana republic. He wants a country in which there is high unemployment and banana republic wages. That is what he and this Government want because the Government in the time it has been in office has set out to reduce the living standards of the Australian people. It has sought by alb sorts of policy initiatives to reduce their standards of living so that it can, as it says, try to overcome the inflationary problem at the same time as it is increasing inflation hand over fist by its own policies. It is this Government which is now the greatest factor in inflation in this country. Government-induced inflation is the major inflationary factor at the present time. </para>
          <para>I make those comments by way of introduction. We do not feel in any way on trial in this matter. Our position is quite clear. To make our position absolutely clear, I wish to move an amendment to the motion. I move: </para>

              </item>
            </list>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">I move that amendment as a prelude to talking in more detail about the proposal for reduced working time which is the subject of this debate. That amendment makes it absolutely clear that we believe that there is a right of employees to share in increased national productivity. What this Government has said from the very time it gained office- not beforehand but since it came to office- is that there is no right of working people in this country to share in increased productivity in any way. In the period in which it has been in office it has sought to deny the working people of this country one element of sharing in productivity. More than that, it has sought to take away from the people the real living standard which they had at the time when this Government was elected. It has done that through its wages policy. The result of that policy, which denied wage indexation in most of the wage cases which have been heard since the Fraser Government has been in office, is that the real purchasing power of wages has declined. </para>
          <para>In December 1979, the average weekly earn.ing were 4.5 per cent less in real terms than they were in December 1975. In terms of gross wages, real living standards have declined as a result of that policy of not only denying any productivity increase but also reducing the real value of wages as they were when this Government took office. So all the benefits of increased productivity have gone to profits. This Government says this is a very good thing to have happened. It wants to see it continue. There is no end to this process, as we see it, from the way this Government formulates its policies. </para>
          <para>In the current national wage case, the Government is arguing for a reduction of real wages by 5.3 per cent because it is asking that there be no increase whatever in wages to make up for the 5.3 per cent increase in prices in the December and March quarters of this financial year. So, quite clearly, it says that real wages have not declined enough. It says: 'We want them to decline by at least another 5.3 per cent because we need to do something to offset all this inflation which we keep building into the economy through our oil pricing policies and so on'. That is what this Government is about. The very important basis on which we started this whole debate is that this Government wants to deny any right of working people to share in increased productivity either by way of increased real wages - </para>

              <para>- It is not rubbish; it is absolute fact. It is the wages policy of the Government. That wages policy denies any wage and salary earners the right to share in productivity. Let me make it absolutely clear that we strongly assert the right of working people to share in increased productivity. If that right is not granted there will be a completely divided society where there are more and more have-nots and where a small group of people who own the industry of this country will become richer and richer. That is precisely what this Government wants to achieve. Since this Government came to power its policies have been devoted to that not only in respect of wages and pricing policies but also in . respect of taxation policies, family allowance policies and so on. I have not time to go into those matters now. The living standards of people have been affected not only by the reduction in real wages but also by the taxation policies and other policies implemented by this Government. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Opposition strongly supports the right of people to have some share in productivity. It is important to bear in mind that this right is also supported by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in its guidelines for wage indexation, where it provides for employees to get the benefit of increased productivity. Principle 6 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Each year the Commission will consider what increase in total wage or changes in conditions of employment should be awarded nationally on account of productivity. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">At least it is part of the wage indexation guidelines that there can be a claim for increases in real wages or some other improvement in working conditions in line with productivity. Of course the unions have not sought a productivity increase since the Fraser Government came to office. They have not done so because they have been battling to maintain their real wages through the normal half yearly- or previously quarterly- cases where they were trying to get adjustment of wages for the movements in the consumer price index. They have not succeeded in doing that. The fact remains, therefore, that there has not been in any way an adjustment of wages for productivity over that period. </para>
          <para>The reduction in working time, as a means of passing on productivity increases to wage and salary earners, is a feasible approach. It is a socially responsible approach if it is conducted in the right way. We believe the trade union movement has the right not only to share in productivity but also to obtain that share of productivity by way of increased leisure rather than by increased real wages if that is what the unions prefer to pursue. This is a work-sharing concept which can take various forms. It can take the form of reduced hours each week, reduced weeks each year, or reduced years for a working lifetime. There are a whole variety of ways in which working time can be reduced. If workers are prepared to take the benefits of increased productivity by way of work sharing rather than by increasing real wages for those who currently have jobs, that is a socially responsible approach; not socially irresponsible as the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs would have us believe. </para>
          <para>Indeed, to follow up that point about social responsibility, I would like to quote from a source which I believe is reasonably impartial in all of this. It is not a left wing source, a Labor Party source, or an academic source in Australia. It is from the Director-General of the International Labour Organisation. The Director-General made a report to the Third European Regional Conference in Geneva in October last year. This report was titled: 'Growth, structural change and manpower policy- The challenge of the 1980s'. On page 45 of that document the Director-General had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the light of such considerations, a trend towards work sharing may be viewed as a healthy and natural development, in line with the formally established long-term goal of reducing working time in the industrial world which is also reflected in specific ILO standards, such as the Reduction of Hours of Work Recommendation, 1962 (no. 116). The phenomenal levels of living and productivity, together with the unparalleled systems for income security now prevailing in northern and western Europe, make it possible to give priority to reducing working time over further general increases in material incomes, even when it remains necessary to improve the condition of underprivileged groups. Such a trend also seems desirable, inasmuch as it creates opportunities to improve the quality of life in many ways. Furthermore, - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I ask the House to take particular note of this-  in the immediate <inline font-style="italic">future,</inline> progress in this direction could be very helpful in dealing with some of the hardship caused by current unemployment and in adjusting to an economic environment marked by slower growth than in the past. </para>
          <para class="block">That was quoted from the Director-General of the International Labour Organisation, a man who should know something about this whole business of reducing working hours and its likely impact on the economy and unemployment. He said that the reduction in working hours can make a positive contribution towards relieving the hardships created by unemployment. That should be put against what this Government is saying, that it will be socially damaging and will send us back to the ice age or whatever. It is absolutely absurd to take the attitude which this Government has taken to the 35-hour week or to reductions in working time in one form or another. If workers are prepared to seek reduced working time rather than increased real wages, that is a responsible attitude and one which gets the endorsement of the Director-General of the International Labour Organisation. The people of Australia should be aware that that is the situation; that a person with that kind of prestige has said that this is a responsible approach, one which can help to solve the unemployment situation in the Western developed world. Of course, it is an extremely important point. It is only fair to note that he goes on to argue, as I have virtually said, that because profit margins cannot be squeezed without adverse effects regarding investment such reduction of hours must be at the expense of forgoing real wage increases that would otherwise have been possible. That is reasonable enough. </para>
          <para>I make the point also in respect of squeezing profit margins that in this country there has been a pernicious attempt by this Government to hide the fact that the profitability of companies is rather greater than appears on the surface. The national accounts, as we understand them, are now hiding something like $2.1 billion of company profits. They do not show up in the national accounts but, in fact, are earned by companies and are the basis on which those companies are taxed by this Government. An amount of $2. 1 billion is hidden away from the national accounts because of a stock valuation adjustment which is taken from the gross operating surplus of trading and financial enterprises before they are shown in the national accounts and, therefore, do not show up as company profits. If one were to add in that $2. 1 billion of hidden company profits one would see that there is a far better company profit situation in this country than this Government is prepared to let on. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member asks: What is wrong with that?' The argument is continually used against giving any increase in real wages. The reason to reduce real wages is that company profits share is far below its trend level. In fact, if we add in that $2. 1 billion it is much closer to the trend level. Those points are extraordinarily important. </para>

              <para>- The Minister would not know the first thing about it. He is a moron. Therefore, the social responsibility for the reduction of hours is undoubted. It is endorsed by the Director-General of the ILO. If it is dealt with in the proper way it can make a significant impact upon reducing unemployment in this country. This fact is very important for this country, a country of very high unemployment, because it is facing the prospect of much higher unemployment in the future, not only because of" the ghastly macro-economic policies of this Government but also because of the technological change factor which, as we all know, is increasingly developing and poses the possibility of very high rates of productivity growth in the future. In this situation we may face extraordinarily high levels of unemployment unless we do something different to try to bring about changes in the organisation of our style of life to spread the work around rather than just take the benefits of increased productivity by way of higher material income, in the words of the Director-General of the ILO. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We do not share the confidence of Government members who say that there is no unemployment problem arising out of technology and that we can simply rest assured that other jobs will be created for those replaced by technological change. We believe the faster the rate of growth of technological change the less likely that is to happen and, therefore, the greater the unemployment problem. One way of overcoming that problem is to indulge in these worksharing techniques by reducing working hours and taking the benefits of increased productivity in that way rather than by increasing real wages. That is not to say that there cannot be any increase in real wages at any time. It depends on the rapidity with which working hours are reduced as against the rate of productivity change which is incurred. Obviously, there has to be a balancing off between the two. </para>
          <para>Finally, I want to say that we are not trying to say in any way that reduced working hours is a panacea for unemployment. Of course it is not. It can alleviate the problem, but obviously, if we are to overcome unemployment in this country we also need a drastic change in our macroeconomic and monetary policies so that we can get growth going in this country. </para>

            <para>-Both Bills in this cognate debate, the Tasmanian Agreement (Launceston Precision Tool Annexe) Bill and the Tasmanian Native Forestry Agreement Bill relate to the granting of limited financial assistance to Tasmania on the part of the Commonwealth Government. The Opposition welcomes the measures contained in both these Bills, though they are long overdue. The levels of assistance are miniscule compared with the needs of Tasmania and with the promises made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> before the last Federal election. It is interesting to note that the Fraser Government has been promising all sorts of assistance to Tasmania for years but only in an election year is any of it forthcoming. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Callaghan report on the Structure of Industry and the Employment Situation in Tasmania recommended  22  items for Commonwealth assistance. The Government's response to this report in November  1977  was to draw up a  10  point plan. The other  12  points made by the inquiry were ignored. It is now  2Vi  years since this plan was announced and it is disturbing how little progress has been made upon its implementation. The honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck)</inline> will be speaking in this debate. I am sure he will fabricate a basis of assistance given to Tasmania by the Fraser Government, but still an analysis of the record in this respect is revealing, particularly in relation to the 10  point plan. </para>
          <para>The first of the promises in this plan was to increase defence activity, probably by the establishment of an infantry battalion in that State. The Prime Minister has since ruled out this possibility on the grounds that Tasmania has a low strategic priority. So the first point in the plan proposed by the Liberal Party is the first casualty after the election. The Government has started dismantling its own promise. The second promise was to ensure that the Government's Australia-made goods preference would apply, to the fullest extent, to goods made in Tasmania. That has also been ruled out as being unconstitutional. This means that two out of  10  priorities have fallen within a couple of months of the election taking place. No action has been forthcoming by way of increased specialist courses at the local College of Advanced Education. </para>
          <para>We should examine the assistance that has been forthcoming. I make the point that all assistance provided to Tasmania is very welcome by the Opposition, but the Government cannot take credit for much of it. The shifting of the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and the Environment in Hobart was begun by the former Labor Government, as was the establishment of the Australian Maritime College in Launceston. Similarly, the freight equalisation scheme introduced in  1976  followed the recommendations of the Nimmo Commission, the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Transport to and from Tasmania, set up by the Whitlam Labor Government. I commend the Government for following up these policies. To be fair to all concerned, the Government has to share these initiatives with the former Government, the present Opposition. </para>
          <para>These two Bills also relate to the  10  point plan. The Tasmanian Agreement (Launceston Precision Tool Annexe) Bill provides for a loan of up to  $343,000  to the State Government for acquisition of equipment for the annexe. This assistance is now only forthcoming after the State Government was forced at its own expense to relocate the annexe. This annexe was built in  1939  for the manufacture of products needed for the war effort. After the war it was handed back to the State. With the taking over by the Commonwealth of the States railways, it was agreed that the annexe be relocated. The Callaghan report suggested that the Commonwealth Government make a grant for re-establishment. This has never eventuated. In late  1977,  the Tasmanian Government purchased appropriate premises and moved the annexe at its own expense. The </para>
          <para class="block">Federal Government is now coming across with a relatively small loan. It was not prepared to make a grant of the money. Again, that is another promise which has been made and broken. </para>
          <para>The second Bill, the Tasmanian Native Forestry Agreement Bill, provides for an increase in the maximum amount of funds to be lent to Tasmania for forestry programs. The amount available is to be increased from $136,000 to $236,000 through the remaining four years of the program. The increase of $100,000 over four years is miniscule. It is an increase of $25,000- not $25m-to the State. Again there is no spendthrift approach by the Fraser Government with respect to Tasmania. </para>
          <para>While we believe this support for the Native Forestry Agreement is inadequate, we, nevertheless, support what money is being offered to Tasmania by way of assistance even though it fails to satisfy the recommendations of the Callaghan inquiry. The Callaghan report recommended that funding for these schemes be allocated, not on a dollar for dollar basis, but on the basis of the current equivalent rating for financial aid to the State. Relativity between States in terms of assistance from Canberra should be reflected in agreements such as this and such assistance should not be on a dollar for dollar basis. In the case of Tasmania, funds should be allocated on about a two for one basis with the Commonwealth picking up every two which is matched by the State. </para>
          <para>This loan is also to be capitalised over a 20-year period with interest repayable after this every six months over 40 years. Under these terms, total repayments will be very much greater than the original loan. So the Commonwealth again does very nicely out of this. To embark on this measure, there will be no skin off the noses of the Commonwealth, the Treasury or the Fraser Government. Both of these measures combined with the others outlined in the last Budget represent a total expenditure of only $ 1 . 3m, over half of which is in the form of repayable loans. So much for the massive efforts of the Fraser Government in Tasmania! This is particularly disturbing because of the disadvantages suffered by Tasmania as a result of its island status. This status has given rise to economic disadvantages which have had inevitable social consequences. </para>
          <para>Tasmania has one of the highest unemployment rates of all the States, but Commonwealth assistance to improve this situation has been very inadequate. One decision which has been heralded as a great employment boost is that to build a marine research centre for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Hobart, but the total number of permanent jobs which will be created will be about only 150 and even these will not be forthcoming for five to seven years. Again we see no relief of the urgent unemployment problem in that State. The Callaghan report pointed out that 5,000 new jobs have to be created if the Tasmanian unemployment situation is to be eased, yet the Government is talking about 150 in five to seven years from now. Under the Fraser Government, this will get worse, not better, Tasmania will suffer even further under Fraser federalism. The loss of the Whitlam formula for State funding will affect Tasmania much more than any other State concerned. This financial year Commonwealth funding to the State will decrease by about $ 18m in real terms. At a time when Federal Government revenue is increasing, particularly with the crude oil levy- the petrol tax; $2, 500m of tax- which the Commonwealth was not collecting two years ago, the Government will disadvantage Tasmania by $18m. What a paltry deal for that State. </para>
          <para>Funds to all the States are generally being cut back; not just funds to Tasmania. The Fraser Government has agreed that State funds will be maintained in real terms in 1980-81. This will still mean a lower level of funding than in the last financial year. All that has been promised after 1980-81 is maintenance of funding in money terms. Well, it will not take long for inflation to cut the heart out of that. If Tasmania is forced to levy an income tax surcharge because of that, it will have to raise more funds than any other State on a per capita basis. Tasmanians should just ponder that prospect, the prospect of a second tax- double taxation- in Tasmania thanks to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> 's federalism. </para>

          <para>The Fraser Government came to office in 1975 proclaiming its dedication to States' rights and its determination to reverse the policies of the Whitlam Government. It reversed them all right. It is bleeding the States white. It advertised new federalism as the means by which the States would be advantaged. The implementation of new federalism is now opposed by all State governments, conservative and Labor alike. That point needs to be well and truly understood. Let us get away from the general funding formulas to the question of roads. My colleague the honourable member for Shortland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morris),</inline> the shadow Minister for Transport, pointed out that the Government has failed to allocate adequate road funds for 1980-81 which will cause further deterioration of Australian roads and, of course, will increase the level of unemployment. He went on that one of the worst States affected will be Tasmania which is to receive $27. 7m compared with the $38m it should have been allocated to maintain its 1974-75 grant in real terms. So again, to maintain the value of the spending it would need to have received about another $1 lm. We hear all this trumpeting from the Government about the $1.5m it will spend over a number of years, half of which is in loans anyway. </para>
          <para>So what is the Government giving Tasmania? First of all, it is taking this sort of money back. It is not giving the money it should be givinganother $llm. It is dropping State funding by about $ 18m in real terms. It is really squeezing Tasmania dry, and all in the face of the fact that, as I said earlier, not only has there been a massive increase in personal income tax this year under the Fraser Government but also there has been a dramatic increase in the petrol tax- $2,500m. This year alone the Commonwealth will collect $3.4 billion- that is, $3,400m- from petroleum products, taxes, excises, levies, et cetera. This does not include company tax on, say, the Bass Strait producers. Despite this growth in revenues we get this mean, vicious treatment of Tasmania. I was talking about this question of a general cost to Tasmania. The doubling of bitumen prices in the past year will also add to the difficulties of road construction. So, not only do we have a declining commitment of money but also we have rising costs. This is a feature of the way in which Tasmania is treated. </para>
          <para>We hear the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> and the honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck),</inline> like Bib and Bub, up and down in this chamber, talking about Tasmania. What have they produced? They have not produced anything of substance. The State still has massive unemployment and in particular, social problems. It is removed from the mainland. It has all those cost disadvantages and the Fraser Government just is not producing the goods. The Tasmanian public has to understand very clearly that the members it is sending to this House-the honourable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Newman), the honourable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Burr),</inline> the honourable member for Franklin and the honourable member for Braddon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Groom)</inline> and the others- are just not doing anything for that State. In fact, Tasmanians will suffer massive hardship compared with the kind of funding they were getting from the Whitlam Government. They should well understand that despite the kind of populous politics that these honourable members engage in, as if they themselves were the sole defenders and owners of the interests of Tasmania, in fact that is not the case, and the record of the Fraser Government just does not stand up to scrutiny. </para>
          <para>In contrast, the Labor Party has outlined on many occasions the ways in which it could assist Tasmania. A Labor government would designate Tasmania as a development region thus making it eligible for a range of selective assistance programs. The sorts of problems faced by Tasmania cannot be dealt with purely by broad brush macro-policies. Attention must be given to the regional consequences of such policies whether they be to do with monetary policy, manufacturing adjustment policy, or whatever. In addition, there is need to have policies which are designed specifically to favour a developing region. </para>
          <para>I will briefly outline some of the specific policies which will be implemented by a future Labor government. There will be a more equitable sharing of Federal Public Service jobs among the States. This will mean the creation of many additional jobs in Tasmania. Employers who create new and permanent jobs will be subsidised by the payment of a standard unemployment benefit for each new employee. A development fund will be created, funded jointly by the Federal and State governments to promote industrial development. Designated growth industries will qualify for a 50 per cent investment allowance and negotiated flexible depreciation allowances. The desirability of a new fare structure to encourage air travel to Tasmania will also be explored. Subsidies will be made available for some freight carried within Tasmania to encourage development of designated industries. </para>

          <para class="block">Bill, but the Bill is about assistance to Tasmania no matter how one looks at it. I made the point very clearly in the earlier part of my remarks that both these measures are related to the 10-point plan, that piece of phoney electioneering devised by the Government in the 1977 election campaign to try to dupe the Tasmanian people about all the feverish activity they were going to see, and this has been the belated effort which the Government has proposed from that. To show that effort in context one has to paint the picture, the economic backdrop, of the way in which Tasmania was funded under the Labor Government and the way it is funded now, on a whole range of things. Quite frankly, no intelligent and honest assessment of the situation would find in favour of the present Government. </para>
          <para>We in the Opposition support any measure which will support Tasmania. It does have special difficulties such as its distance from the mainland; the sea; and the fact that its industries have cost disadvantages. In fact, the community generally is disadvantaged in so many ways. Tasmania must be treated as a special case by the national Government. I do not believe that is happening. Even in this small sense, token as the Bills may be, the Opposition supports them whole-heartedly and urges upon the Government a much more favourable and ambitious policy towards assistance to Tasmania. </para>

            <para>-I intend to speak only on the Tasmania Agreement (Launceston Precision Tool Annexe) Bill 1980. 1 will confine myself to the Bill and not do what the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> has just done; that is, speak all around the subject. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bede</inline> Callaghan reported to this Government some two years ago on the structure of industry and the employment situation in Tasmania. Following consideration of his report by the Government, it was decided to give financial assistance to that State and this assistance was announced in the 1979-80 Budget. This Bill, which authorises the payment of a loan of $343,000 to Tasmania to help meet the reequipment costs associated with the reestablishment of the Launceston Precision Tool Annexe, gives effect to that announcement. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>One might ask why the banks or, more particularly, the State Government does not lend this small amount of money. In fact, one might ask why the Federal Government is taking the important time of this Parliament to discuss such a small item. Basically, it comes down to the fact that the State Labor Government of Tasmania has little or no interest in its industry and that the Federal Government has had to fill the gap, helping with this and a number of other such projects. All Government supporters appreciate Tasmania's needs and are prepared to stand up and say how we would help meet them. In contrast, the socialist Opposition's interest in Tasmania is now dead. It realised how poorly it was doing there and made the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> shadow Minister responsible for that State. I am not sure what he was shadowing. I suppose that he was trying to shadow the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and all of the members of the Cabinet, who have shown their interest in Tasmania, especially our two Tasmanian Ministers, as well as the five honourable members- of course, all Liberal who come from that State. I need hardly mention the other honourable members on this side who are prepared to be involved in other aspects of Tasmania for that State's good. It is interesting to note that the socialist Opposition has now moved the honourable member for Blaxland to other shadows and has wiped Tasmania from its books. I am sure that Tasmanians will have noted that and will vote accordingly. </para>
          <para>In helping Tasmania we help all Australia. Without going through the whole economic exercise, I say that Australia's continued financial health will depend upon the expansion of industry, by way of technology, for export purposes. We must have our exports of wool and wheat, of minerals and coal, but Australia's employment and balance of payments depend to a very large extent on industry and its ability to expand. The only avenue for expansion, given Australia's small population, is to be found overseas. Thus, the proposed loan to the State of Tasmania can be seen in a much wider context. </para>
          <para>The history of the Launceston Precision Tool Annexe began with its establishment by the Commonwealth during World War II as part of the new aircraft industry. This involved the manufacture of precision jigs, gauges, dies and tools. After the war, the annexe was transferred and was later operated as the railways workshops under the control of the Tasmanian Transport Commission. Its role will continue to be that of a provider of precision items to industry, with perhaps more emphasis being placed on the heavy industries of mining and paper manufacture. The role is demonstrated by the details given in the Schedule of equipment. An examination of that Schedule reveals that the most expensive tool is a universal mill of the Huron type, which is to cost of the order of $70,000. The third item on the Schedule is a universal. A universal what is not clear. One might guess that it might be a lathe. Perhaps the Minister for Science and the Enviroment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Thomson)</inline> could provide that information. It is of interest to note that the Schedule calls for the provision of computer facilities, to cost up to $60,000 for time-keeping, job costing, pay roll management, and sales and inventory record-keeping. They will also be used, with the four numerically controlled machine tools, to prepare programs and, of course, more easily to revise and store such programs. Also listed in the Schedule are three small universal milling machines and three centre lathes, to cost a total of $120,000. Besides being useful as production machines, they are at the heart of apprentice training. Apprentices and their training represent an absolutely essential ingredient of the expansion of industry to which I have referred, and the ability to train apprentices weighed heavily in making the decision to grant the loan. </para>
          <para>I am sure that there is a very good reason for the Bill's consisting of only four small clauses, without accompanying information, and all of the details being given in the attached schedules. Perhaps this is a new way of drafting legislation, but it is awkward if for no other reason that that it lacks headings. I ask the Minister why such an arrangement has been used. The First Schedule, which sets out the form of the agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Tasmania, gives details of the financial arrangements. It states the maximum amount of the loan as being $343,000 for the purchase and installation of certain machines listed. It authorises advances and the procedure of payments and repayments. The latter are to take the form of 20 equal half-yearly payments, to begin on 15 January 1981. The interest rate payable is to be that for long term bonds and, for this purpose, is described as 'the rate of yield to maturity of the loan of the longer or longest term of the last loan raising by the Commonwealth ... for public subscription prior to the date upon which the advance or payment was made'. Perhaps the Minister can also explain how that will be affected by the new tap system loans. </para>
          <para>The Schedule includes the requirements that one regularly expects with such loans. However, if this Parliament is to debate such Bills as this and not just leave them to the Executive it should have the means to do so. Honourable members should be considering the proposed loan as would a board of directors. That requires the presentation of a complete set of financial statements and an analysis of expected benefits. Although I am sure the responsible Minister has made his assessment on the basis of such figures and analysis, to make the debate complete we should all have access to the same material. </para>
          <para>Here again we see the Government giving to Tasmania assistance that the socialist Government of that State will not give. We see a visionary approach which will help not only Tasmania but also the whole of Australia, as this nation expands its industrial base to ensure its future, for the good of all Australians. </para>

            <para>- I wish to confine my remarks in this cognate debate to the Tasmanian Native Forestry Agreement Bill and say at the outset that the Opposition supports the measure. However, I must be honest and say that that support is not exactly unqualified. The Opposition takes exception to the manner in which finance is to be made available to the State of Tasmania for the project in question. I will discuss that matter a little later. At this point I would like to precis the original Act and put the legislation into perspective. « </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The existing agreement, under the Tasmanian Native Forestry Agreement Act 1979, set up a forestry program whereby the Commonwealth matched, on a dollar for dollar basis, funds provided by the Tasmanian Government to establish a eucalypt plantation on land acquired by the State. The loan was for an amount of up to $136,000 a year- not a great deal of money in total budgetary terms. The financial assistance for the program was to be given over a five-year period commencing July 1978 and extending to June 1983. Briefly, repayments were to be deferred for 20 years. The loan was to be repaid in equal six-monthly instalments over the next 40 years. The catch comes when we consider interest. During the 20-year deferment the loan is to accrue interest at the long term bond rate. This added to the capital sum amounts to a hefty amount for Tasmanians eventually to repay. One might say that the Federal Government is being something of an Indian giver. It is anything but generous in the repayment terms. That is where the Opposition differs from the Government in respect of this measure. </para>
          <para>We claim that it would have been more effective and, in fact, more practical to have given Tasmania a special purpose grant- that is, a section 96 grant- and to let it get on with the business of forestation without this sword of Damocles hanging over its head. Now, as it stands, it is looking at an enormous loan repaymentadmittedly, 20 years off. But the question is: Will there be anything left out of the profits for Tasmanians after the Commonwealth has extracted its pound of flesh? I sometimes doubt it. What use is this forestry scheme if its overheads are so high? After all, the giving of aid for such projects as this is as a result of the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bede</inline> Callaghan in his committee's report which was tabled in September 1 977. That committee was set up by the Tasmanian Premier in 1976 to study the structure of industry and employment opportunities in Tasmania with a view to overcoming the high unemployment situation. I might say in retrospect four years later that despite the Government's attempts, albeit fairly weak attempts as they always are, that unemployment situation still persists. The Commonwealth agreed with the findings and suggestions that were put forward as a means of assisting Tasmania with its special problems, which of course are not quite so apparent on the mainland. The report left no doubt in anybody's mind that Tasmania requires special Government consideration. One is tempted to rub this in for the advocates of the free market economy. Without assistance to the public sector Tasmania would sink without trace. In his speech last year when introducing the original Bill the then Minister for Primary Industry stated: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. the Government has agreed that it would adopt a considerate attitude to policy-making affecting Tasmania. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">That was the first time that I had heard the euphemism 'considerate attitude' used to describe basic Keynesian economic principles. No doubt there is a Freudian mental block that inhibits the coalition Government when it comes to stimulation of the public sector. However, a rose by any other name smells just as sweet. In this case, a eucalypt forest by any other name will smell just as sweet no matter how we describe the Government's assistance for the plan. It is a vital necessity, as the Callaghan report makes clear, that Tasmania be assisted with an infusion of Government finance in order to improve industry and eventually to improve employment prospects. </para>
          <para>I would not be so ungenerous as the present Government was when in opposition when we as a government were trying to introduce legislation to assist Tasmania. Its members always used to accuse us of pork-barrelling. That was absolutely ridiculous. I will not sink to that level. 1 think that we in this Parliament are all aware of the problems of the less populated States. We would all like to see them overcome their problems. The amendments foreshadowed in this Bill will increase the original grant of $136,000 per annum. This legislation allows for the provision of a further $100,000 per annum for the next four financial years to supplement the original amount. The repayment terms are just the same; that is, they are just as absurd, just as meanfisted, just as miserable. There is to be a twentyyear deferment period during which the interest will accrue at the long term rate. The total amount is to be repaid in six-monthly instalments over 40 years. The Tasmanian Government and the Tasmanian people will have this debt around their necks for a total of 60 years. Compare that situation with the alternative of a section 96 grant. The honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> who spoke earlier in this debate, pointed out that the Government has money running out of its ears. Of course it could have afforded to make such a grant. The Labor Government was accused by the then Opposition of being too centralist and too inclined towards, big government. </para>

              <para>-That was the slander that honourable members opposite put around. Yet, I ask the House: Would it not be just and right, given that we all agree with the Callaghan proposals to assist Tasmania in a big way, to expedite that financial assistance in the most effective way, not with this messy 60 year contract, for God's sake? The present Government accused us of being inclined towards big government. Consider the bureaucracy that will grow up around the servicing of this loan. Fraser federalism creates more problems than it solves. Under a Labor government Tasmania would have been given a grant with no strings attached. This would have proved cheaper in the long run. After all, we are all Australians, whether we are from Darwin, Hobart, Goondiwindi, Gulargambone or even Parramatta. What is good for one part of the country is good for the nation as a whole. If the provision of a special purpose grant is the most efficient way in which to promote a forestry scheme or any other financial project, then that is how it ought to be done. The little idiosyncrasies of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> about 'self-help', 'life not being meant to be easy' and giving all 'power and responsibility ' to the States, should not stand in the way of the most practical method of implementing financial assistance. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>At any rate, $236,000 a year is now available from the Federal Government for eucalypt for.estation programs. Fortunately it is a native forest program, unlike some other forestry programs that have been introduced. For instance, the program in Western Australia introduced foreign and exotic species into the environment. This program will be an asset to the landscape as well as a sound economic venture. This Bill also amends the original Act so that the financial assistance from the Commonwealth may now be used to acquire new land for new forests. I think that a reasonable equation is that conservation equals improvement to the environment. But when we start talking about improvement to the environment I think we have to take quite a number of factors into consideration. Conservation policies must be tempered with the realities of the real world such as the requirements of the electorate, the need for various services and programs that the electorate requires, and eventually the need for employment. </para>
          <para>I think it has become fashionable in the last few years for almost extreme conservationists to forget the realities of the real world. I remember once being away in the Northern Territory with the Expenditure Committee. We had as our adviser a very eminent gentleman who, it is to be regretted, passed away about six months ago.  His  name was Kel McGrath and he had been a Dean of the Forestry School at the Australian National University. I learned so much in a few days from Kel McGrath about what forests are all about. He was able to point out to me that whereas foresters are sometimes considered to be the rapacious enemies of forests, ripping down trees, in fact this is not the case. Anybody who has had the time with a real, eminent forester that I have had realises that foresters really love the forests. They love the trees, they love the environment and all the work that they put into forests in silviculture programs in fact improves the forests and the environment. I know that the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Thomson)</inline> will understand this as he is a gentleman who is very interested in conservation. Sometimes we let our minds run away with us when we talk about conservation. Conservation must certainly be reined in in practical terms. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is delighted that this money is to be spent on improving the native forests in Tasmania and not on growing exotic species that are foreign to our landscape. </para>
          <para>I point out that this assistance is part of a package which is designed to boost Tasmania's economy, a package which includes other assistance nominated in last year's Budget, such as the restoration and development of the Port Arthur region, a pilot industrial estate at Legana, reequipment of the Launceston Precision Tool Annexe and assistance to build educational facilities within a fish centre at Hobart. </para>

All of these things will occur as a result of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Bede</inline> Callaghan 's report, which I mentioned earlier.

              <para>-The House should take no notice of the honourable member. He is actually my dummy. I play him with my foot. I am a ventriloquist. When we take note of the repayment plan for the loan of $236,000 which is the basis of this Bill we begin to see that the Government is less than generous in its dealings with Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> I am pleased to see that two Tasmanians have entered the chamber in the course of this debate. I conclude my remarks by telling the House of ft few of the things that a Labor Government will do to assist Tasmania in an unfettered way. It will not tie it to a 60-year repayment period that lessens the effectiveness of the loan or, in fact, cancels it and gives it a negative effect. </para>

          <para>I would like briefly to outline some of the specific policies that would be implemented by a future Labor Government to assist Tasmania. There would be a more equitable sharing of Federal Public Service jobs among the States. This would mean the creation of many additional jobs in Tasmania, something which this Government has not been able to implement despite the brains of the honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck),</inline> the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman),</inline> the honourable member for Wilmot <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Burr)</inline> and the honourable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman).</inline> Secondly, employers who create new and permanent jobs would be subsidised by the payment of the standard unemployment benefit for each new employee who found a job. A development fund would be created, funded jointly by the Federal and State governments to promote industrial development. Designated growth industries would qualify for a 50 per cent investment allowance and negotiated, flexible depreciation allowances. The desirability of a new fare structure to encourage air travel to the State would be explored and, having been explored, would' be implemented. Subsidies would be made available for some freight carried within Tasmania to encourage development of designated industries. Finally, structural adjustment assistance would be provided on the basis of two-to-one funding. </para>
          <para>In summary the Opposition gives this Bill some qualified support because it is at least some attempt to produce new industry in Tasmania. But we find it not at all satisfactory or sufficient. I point out to the Tasmanian members in the House that a Labor Government would find a way of implementing assistance to Tasmania in a much more flexible, practical and valuable way. </para>

            <para>-The Tasmanian members of this Parliament are delighted that the Australian Labor Party has seen fit to support these Bills because we think they are of immense importance to Tasmania. But I found some of the comments that were just made by the honourable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr John Brown)</inline> a little difficult to understand. It seems now, with an election looming within the next six months, that the Labor Party is finally realising that Tasmania exists. I remind the honourable member for Parramatta- I urge the honourable member not to leave the chamber- that his party in government had three years in which to implement some of the measures which would be of assistance to Tasmania. However, his party was very noticeable by the fact that it did nothing at all to help Tasmania. On the other hand, the present Government made promises during election campaigns that it would do positive things to help Tasmania. This Government has made good the promises that it made to the people of that State. </para>

          <para>I would like to give the House some idea of the attitude to Tasmania of the Labor Party during its period in government. Tasmanians well remember the classic statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Enderby,</inline> the then Attorney-General, that Tasmania in fact was an island surrounded by water. I thought that was a marvellous piece of deduction from the then Attorney-General who in fact is a Queen's Counsel. We also remember the classic statement that came from the then Minister for Transport, the present honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones).</inline> When invited to Tasmania to look at our roads, he made the statement that there were more votes in Newcastle than there were in Tasmania. </para>

              <para>-I noted that the honourable  member for Parramatta, now having determined that Tasmania is of some importance because an election campaign is looming, pointed out that the Australian Labor Party would implement these measures in Tasmania with no strings attached, that the Labor Party would not make available this assistance by way of loans, as the present Government is doing, but by way of handouts or grants. I ask the honourable member for Parramatta: If this is the attitude of the Labor Party why did it not do these sorts of things when it had the opportunity to do so in government? </para>

          <para>The present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> promised that in fact he and his Government would make positive moves to assist the economy and the people of Tasmania. This is exactly what this Government is doing. It has made positive contributions to Tasmania, through the initiative of the Callaghan plan and other measures that I would like to mention. It has not just talked in terms that might attract a few votes now that an election is coming around. </para>
          <para>I remind the House that the two Bills we are now discussing provide assistance under the Callaghan plan to the Launceston Precision Tool Annexe and Tasmanian native forests. These two measures are being implemented under what the honourable member for Parramatta referred to as the Callaghan plan. I compliment the honourable member for Bass, the Minister for Productivity <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman),</inline> and other Tasmanian members of this Parliament who worked so hard, first, to persuade the present Federal Government to set up the Callaghan inquiry into the structure of industry and the employment  situation in Tasmania and, secondly, to make positive moves to see that the Government implemented the recommendations made by Callaghan. The two measures before us are just two of the recommendations made by Callaghan. I think considerable credit is due to the Minister for Productivity, the honourable member for Bass, that he has been able to convince his Cabinet colleagues about this matter. Considerable credit is also due to other members from Tasmania in that they have been able to convince their party colleagues that these measures are necessary and of vital importance to Tasmania. </para>
          <para>The legislation seeks to assist the development of the Launceston Precision Tool Annexe by providing a loan of $343,000 for the acquisition of equipment essential to its viability.As the honourable member for Parramatta has already said, that is not a gram; it is not a handout on behalf of the Government. It is a loan that will be repaid by a commercially viable organisation. I think that point needs to be borne in mind by honourable members when they are considering this legislation. </para>

              <para>- Thank you. I acknowledge the support from my colleague the honourable member for Franklin. This Government recognises we can stand on our own two feet provided that we are given the opportunity to do so. The measures now before us, and other measures that are being implemented under the Callaghan plan, give the Tasmanian economy the opportunity to develop on a fair, reasonable and equitable basis alongside the economies of the larger States of Australia. We are proud of what this Government has done. Tasmanians are proud of the efforts that have been made by the Minister for Productivity and honourable member for Bass, and. by my Tasmanian colleagues- the honourable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Goodluck),</inline> who is now in the chamber, the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> and the honourable member for Braddon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Groom).</inline> Collectively all have made a contribution to impress on the Government the most urgent need to provide Tasmania with other assistance. Progressively this Government has done that by way of freight equalisation, the transfer of maritime and Antarctic science divisions and so on. These are some of the measures taken by this Government to give very real and positive assistance to Tasmania. We from Tasmania are indeed grateful for what this Government has done in recognising those needs of the State. </para>

          <para>I say to the honourable member for Parramatta, in closing my contribution to this debate, that while his party, the Labor Party, was in office it did precisely nothing for Tasmania. In fact it failed to recognise even its existence. This Government promised that it would help Tasmania and has done purposeful things to honour the promise that it made to the people of Tasmania. I assure the honourable member for Parramatta, the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> and their colleagues that, whilst they might be making bleating noises now that an election is looming, they might as well spend their campaign money in the mainland States because the people of Tasmania recognise those who have done the work and who have been able to produce the results. I assure honourable members opposite that the people of Tasmania, given the opportunity of an election, will re-elect from that State the people who have been able to achieve so much for it. We have been able to do that with the positive cooperation of a first-class government led by a first-class Prime Minister. </para>

            <para>-If the amendment were accepted Australians could involve themselves in pirate whaling operations anywhere. We do know that pirate whaling ships are taking protected species, undersized whales and lactating females and calves. It would be nonsense for the Australian Government to be seeking to have all countries impose a world-wide ban on whaling and, at the same time, pass legislation which allows its citizens to take part in whaling as freely as they wish outside the Australian fishing zone. The Government will continue to seek this world-wide ban on whaling through its commissioner on the International Whaling Commission. The amendment proposed by the legislation committee will weaken and limit the capacity of the Australian commissioner to the International Whaling Commission to achieve the Government's stated policies. We cannot expect other countries to take seriously bur attempts to give a lead in introducing a total ban on whaling if our legislation does not oppose such a ban in respect of all Australian citizens. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>This Bill is for an Australian law to implement an Australian policy on whaling. The amendment would unacceptably weaken the Australian stand in both the domestic and international spheres. Honourable members should be aware that in 1946, Australia, by signing the International Whaling Convention, accepted an obligation to control world-wide the activities of its citizens in relation to whaling. Section 7 of the Whaling Act 1960 passed by this Parliament gives clear effect to that obligation. It states that the restriction on whaling should apply within and without the Commonwealth. This was a clear indication of the policy of the Government to extend its laws on whaling outside the territorial limits of the nation. That Bill was passed by the Parliament in 1960. </para>
        <para>The Government is surprised that attempts are being made to change that situation in 1 980. If we accepted the amendment Australia could be in breach of its obligations as a signatory of the International Whaling Convention of 1946. Article 9 of that Convention states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Each contracting government shall take appropriate measures to ensure the application of the provisions of this Convention and the punishment of infractions against the said provisions in operations carried out by persons or vessels under its jurisdiction. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The article continues: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Prosecution for infractions against or contraventions of this Convention shall be instituted by the Government having jurisdiction over the offence. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I note that article 9 of the International Whaling Convention specifically mentions 'persons under is jurisdiction'. This amendment which was proposed by the Legislation Committee would contravene both the spirit and the letter of that Convention. I reiterate that Australia has considered whaling as an appropriate matter for extra-territorial restrictions on Australians since 1946. Other countries have acted similarly with respect to whale protection and conservation. The United States of America and New Zealand are examples of this. </para>
        <para>The Whale Protection Bill 1980 as presented to this Parliament makes it illegal for Australians domiciled in Australia to take part in whaling anywhere in the world. If they wish to take part in whaling they have a choice: They may change their place of domicile to that of another country and could then therefore legally under Australian law take part in whaling operations. This is as far as the Government is prepared to go. To go any further weakens our case and our policy for seeking to impose a universal ban on whaling. On 4 April 1979 the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Government upholds the central conclusion of the Inquiry into Whales and Whaling, namely, that Australia should pursue a policy of opposition to whaling and that this policy should be pursued both domestically and internationally through the International Whaling Commission and other organisations. The Government will continue to be an active member of, and to support, the International Whaling Commission, and to support efforts to revise the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. In particular, we will seek the extension of the Commission's charter to the conservation of all cetacea. </para>

          <para>- I am disappointed that the Government has not accepted the amendment. As we indicated in the legislative committee, we support the Bill with one exception, in clause 6. We have commended the Government for introducing this legislation. We are very supportive of its desire to ban whaling throughout the world. I want to pay tribute to the people who belong to Project Johah. People such as Tony Gregory and others fought hard to bring about the ban on whaling. It is wonderful to see that they have won an international conservation award. This legislation is a tribute to their efforts, for which we commend them. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>However, the fear of the Opposition concerns a question of civil liberties and civil rights that arises from this legislation. Australians who are living, at least temporarily, outside Australia and are doing something that is perfectly legal in the country in which they are working could find, on returning to Australia, that they are subject to fines of up to $100,000. Whilst we want to see whaling stopped, we find such a possibility abhorrent. We have looked at the legislation and have anguished over this question; but overwhelmingly we supported the civil libertarian point of view. People doing something perfectly legal in another country could on their return to this country, be charged with having done something that was illegal here. I give perhaps a not very good analogy. If abortion were illegal in this country, a woman going outside the country for an abortion could, upon returning to Australia, find herself being charged with a crime because abortion was illegal in this country. One could go on and on giving similar analogies, but I do not propose to do so. I think that principle is wrong. If it were suggested that we introduce legislation like that in this country I am sure that the majority of Australian people would be outraged. </para>
        <para>I have spoken to people from Project Jonah and I have recognised their genuine concern. They have suggested that if clause 6 is amended, as recommended by the Legislative Committee, Australian whalers could register ships under flags of convenience and operate from places such as Taiwan, Indonesia or any other country one would care to name and whale just outside the 200-mile limit and, therefore, get around this legislation. That is a possibility. Basically, that is what is behind the proposal of the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Thomson).</inline> After further discussions today, we suggest that we proceed with the amendment proposed by the legislation committee. However, if after a period of, say, 12 months we found that this provision was being abused and that Australian whalers were getting around the law by operating under flags of convenience, perhaps then we would have to overlook the civil rights position and move a further amendment to overcome the problem. </para>
        <para>The Minister has suggested that accepting the amendment will diminish Australia's influence on the International Whaling Commission. Quite frankly I cannot see that. I do not believe that this legislation, which is banning all whaling, and the taking of any whaling products by any Australian vessels, crews, aircraft or whatever, is something of which Australia as a nation should be proud. I doubt very much whether the fact that someone might come in and say: 'Ah, yes, but Australian residents can live in Chile, Peru the Argentine or Taiwan and they can go on and whale' in any way diminishes the case of the Government. If it does those people who are arguing against the Government are nitpicking. This legislation will stand strongly on its own. The point that I made in the legislative committee was whether leaving the Bill unamended will any way increase whaling or maintain whaling as it is now. I do not believe it will do either. Any of those countries that I mentioned before who want to continue whaling surely will do so. They will operate outside the 200-mile limit as pirate whalers on the high seas. If they cannot get Australian crews or Australian whalers they will get their own nationals to do it. For the life of me, I cannot see, nor can the Labor Party see, that the whale of one life will be saved by this amendment. </para>

            <para>-It disturbs me just to look at the Prime Minister. It makes me nervous and apprehensive. I am sure that he will forgive me. Even I make mistakes. I would suggest that the amendment be given a trial of at least 12 months. If at the end of 12 months we find that there are Australian in significant numbers- I do not mean the odd Australians- operating pirate whaling ships from countries such as Taiwan, we should have another look at the legislation and perhaps agree to the Government's argument. I rest my case by saying that we ought to carry this amendment because there is a civil liberties position to uphold. </para>

I really believe that in this debate there is a degree of muddled thinking about the issues that are involved. I can well understand honourable members being concerned about the extra-territorial reach of Australian law or the law of other countries when it is improperly based. Australia has had some difficulty in relation to some law of the United States. Laws have been passed in this Parliament to protect Australian corporations - </para>

            <para>- I am glad that the honourable gentleman agrees with me. A test of the relevance of a national law is whether the person or the corporation to be touched by the law has an adequate connection with the country passing the law. If there is no connection with the country passing the law, I think the extraterritorial reach is wrong, and plainly so. That is basically the case in relation to the United States law to which this Government has objected. We are not proposing that our law in relation to whaling have an extra-territorial reach for people or corporations which are not significantly connected with Australia. That is the difference. I think that is a very significant difference indeed. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I would like to go through the details for a moment. The amendment plainly would weaken the Whale Protection Bill. I will seek to show that it would weaken it substantially. I believe that that would be regrettable. Since 1946 there have been some extra-territorial reaches in Australian obligations. We supported the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which imposed obligations of quite a severe kind. We upheld the principles of the Convention, as in the Whaling Act 1960, within and without the Commonwealth. Although that Act may not have had the same extra-territorial reach as this legislation, there was an extra-territorial element in it. The House has been presented with a long list of Acts which have an extra-territorial element. No one Act is quite the same as another. Each stands in its own right and has to be argued separately. There are no exact precedents, one law to another, in this instance. </para>
        <para>The issue here is whether people normally resident in Australia should be denied the opportunity of whaling in Australian ships or in the 200-mile fishing zone, or whether Australian citizens ordinarily domiciled in Australia also should be denied that opportunity. If we were to restrict the application of our law to people living in Australia and operating off Australian shores in the 200-mile fishing zone there will be very serious defects in the law. There will be opportunities for the purpose of the law to be evaded, and opportunities for the purpose of Project Jonah and everything behind that campaignwhich I know the honourable member for Robertson supported, as did this Governmentto be put in jeopardy in a way that should not be the case. </para>
        <para>If the amendment which was accepted by the legislation committee, which the honourable gentleman supports, were accepted and endorsed by this House, then quite plainly Australian citizens who are ordinarily domiciled in this country would be able to charter or register vessels for whaling either in International Whaling Commission countries or in other countries. In that sense we would not be meeting our obligations that we have stated within Australia and internationally in acceptance of the Frost report to do everything we properly can to outlaw whaling within Australia and within the world. New Zealand and the United States of America have found no difficulty with a stronger extraterritorial element in their laws than we are proposing here. This legislation has been carefully drafted to try to catch Australian citizens who are ordinarily domiciled in Australia. If a person is living overseas and has cut his connections with this country then I would agree that we have no real right to catch him under our laws, but if he is ordinarily domiciled in Australia and seeking to evade the law by chartering or registering vessels from or in countries where whaling is permitted then he is plainly seeking to evade the thrust of our law in a way which I believe on a free vote the majority of honourable gentlemen in the Australian Labor Party would not support. </para>
        <para>There is another amendment that could be proposed, as I understand it, to restrict the activities of such Australian citizens who are ordinarily domiciled here to countries operating under the International Whaling Convention. If those people were trying to whale from a country where pirate whaling was undertaken then our law would catch them. That is closer to the Government's position than it is to the position of the Australian Labor Party, but there is still a gap. I think that it would be less likely that an Australian citizen ordinarily domiciled here- I emphasise that because that is the person whom we are seeking to catch; not somebody who has cut his connection with this country- under those circumstances would be able to go whaling be-  cause under the whaling licences and whatever of the International Whaling Convention contries there are probable limits. The chances of an Australian citizen being able to charter or register a whaling boat from an International Whaling Convention country is probably remote. The chance is there, but it is probably remote. </para>
        <para>If the amendment of the honourable gentleman is agreed to then whaling anywhere, from a pirate country or whatever, will be permitted. The likelihood of that occurring would obviously be very much greater. I believe that the amendment which the Legislation Committee passed, which is supported by the honourable gentleman, is obnoxious to the conservation of whales and whaling. I believe it ought to be rejected on good and proper grounds. I can understand well arguments about civil liberties, but I do not believe they are valid in this case. I do not believe that they should concern this Parliament in this case because the Government has been concerned to frame a law which catches Australian citizens who are normally domiciled here who, by their actions, plainly seek to evade the law. It is probably unlikely that we would know of or learn of somebody who might just go to work on a whaler as an individual. It is much more likely that we would have brought to our notice the activities of a person who chartered or who sought to register a vessel in a country overseas for the purpose of whaling. That would not be permitted under the law as it is proposed by the Government. </para>
        <para>I hope very much that the House will Accept the stronger law because I believe it upholds the principle without jeopardising important principles of civil liberties which I know are important to all honourable members of this House. I believe that if the issues are seen clearly the Government's legislation will be supported. The very fact that the honourable gentleman himself indicated, I think, some sense of weakness and some lack of conviction about his own amendment by indicating a trial period in itself demonstrates that it might well be better to have the trial the other way around. I do not believe that the honourable gentleman or any person in this Parliament has made out a case that the civil liberties of an individual would be unfairly or improperly prejudiced as a result of the legislation that is before the House. I ask members to look at this matter clearly and to bear in mind what the extra-territorial reach of laws does involve, when it is proper and when it is improper. I end on the point where I began: It is proper if the person or the corporation has a sufficient connection with this country to enable our laws to touch that person or corporation. It is not proper if that person has cut his links with this country to such an extent that he no longer belongs to it or is part 'of it. The Government is not seeking to apply the law in such cases. I hope, and believe, that the legislation will be supported. </para>

            <para>-There were enough of them to give a clear majority to the decision which we reached. I find it rather sad that in a piece of legislation which is compassionate, sensitive and which sets out in the most sincere way to preserve one of the most beautiful creatures of the sea- the whale- the spirit of which we support wholly, includes a clause as draconian as clause 6. As the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> pointed out, this clause sets out to institute a situation in which an Australian who is regularly or generally domiciled in Australia, having engaged himself in some whaling activities, no matter for how long or to what degree, in some other part of the world- the clause allows that- where whaling might be legal, even in a country which is a signatory to the International Whaling Commission as Australia is and which is partner to the conventions of that Commission, could face a fine of $100,000 on coming back to Australia. I do not think that it would weaken our resolve to be part of a world-wide conservation scheme to assist in the preservation of whales if this clause were removed. I felt that the </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para class="block">Prime Minister weakened his own case by suggesting that the person the Government is trying to catch is the person who goes to another country or outside our territorial waters and leases or charters a boat and involves himself as a proprietor in the hunting of whales. The clause does not spell it out to that degree. I would think that the possibility is there. </para>
        <para>I point out a scenario of some young Australian who is on holiday in Europe. He then finds himself in Norway and short of money. He finds himself a job in the whaling industry, works there for a couple of weeks and comes back to Australia. Some kind pimp reports him to the Government as having involved himself to such a minor degree in whaling and flensing. He is then faced with the prospect of a $100,000 fine or a period in gaol. I think that the Government is weakening the resolve of its own case. It is trying to put itself forward as a government compassionate and sensitive towards the whales- I applaud that- but what about its having some sensitivity to 'civil liberties'? There is a weakness in the clause and I think that the Government should have a rethink about it. I do not support the view of the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> that there should be a 12 months trial period. I think it is such an important issue in relation to civil liberties that it should be enshrined for all time in this legislation. </para>
        <para>There is another important point which is worthy of comment. This Government has formed a number of back bench committees, one of which I am a member of, which go to no end of trouble to carry out investigations and inquiries, to reach decisions and to bring down recommendations which are put before the Parliament. Such recommendations are supposed to be replied to within six months. In most cases it is more like 12 months before they are replied to and when the Government does make its response it very rarely institutes any of the findings of the recommendations of those committees. What is the point in the Government's setting up legislation committees on which members from both sides of the House sit to investigate these matters fully and to come up with amendments- I might add that this amendment was overwhelmingly supported by the committee- when such amendments are flung back in their faces by the Government? I hope that the Government supporters who are members of that legislation committee and who supported the amendment put forward by the Opposition- it is very similar to an amendment put forward by the honourable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Drummond)-</inline> have the courage at least to vote with the Opposition and against the Government for its failure to accept this recommendation. </para>

          <para>-In considering the report of the legislation committee and the amendment proposed by that committee perhaps it is instructive for us to remind ourselves of the reason that whales need to be protected. Whales are one of the few animals whose intelligence approaches that of human beings. They have large brains both in absolute terms and in relation to their own body weight. Perhaps more importantly the area of the brain which controls the emotions and affective states of the whale are well developed, and scientific research shows that whales have a complex emotional life. The nervous system and that portion of the brain which relates to pain especially are very similar to those of humans; therefore, they feel pain much as we do. Whales are social animals which live in groups. They relate to each other as individuals and the bond be-' tween mother and offspring is maintained beyond the lactation period. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Therefore, on this basis the killing of whales can be justified only if three preconditions are met. The first is that there be an overriding human need for whale products. The second is that the killing of whales should not cause serious depletion of the whale population. The third precondition is that the killing should be undertaken in a humane manner. Currently none of these three preconditions is being fulfilled. There are adequate substitutes for whale products. Indeed even the oil of the sperm whale now has an adequate substitute in jojoba oil. That was one of the main products of whales which was difficult to replace. Furthermore the serious depletion in the whale population is now generally acknowledged. For example, nearly all species of whale located in the Southern Hemisphere have been depleted to about a quarter of their initial stock levels. In some species this depletion is far worse. </para>

            <para>-The House is dealing with the report of the legislation committee, not the clause. The maximum potential growth rate for whales is about S per cent a year and this is unlikely to be achieved in most circumstances. Because whales produce their young at a rate of less than one a year that growth rate will not be achieved. Hence this serious depletion is a major problem to be considered. The killing methods applied to whales are totally unsatisfactory. This is especially so when compared with the methods used for the killing of cattle or sheep. In about half the cases when whales are killed instantaneous death occurs. For the rest the quickest death is about three to seven minutes. In many cases it takes some 25 minutes for a whale to die. As I mentioned earlier whales feel physical pain in much the same way as humans because of their complex brain system. The Frost inquiry commissioned by this Government confirmed the inhumanity of the present methods of killing whales. Therefore, because those three propositions - </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>I was about to say that because those three propositions are not fulfilled it is important that the legislation as proposed .by the Government, including the extra-territorial provisions, is passed. The amendment which was passed by the legislation committee was passed largely because of arguments based on civil liberties. I believe there is an overriding necessity, because of those points I have just made, to protect the whale situation rather than the civil liberties of Australian citizens. On that basis the amendment moved by the legislation committee is unsatisfactory. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The amendment would not provide any sanction against Australians engaging in whaling except those operating within the 200-mile limit of Australian waters. Therefore, Australians could undertake whaling outside the 200-mile limit or elsewhere in the world on three bases: Firstly they could engage in whaling under the flag of an International Whaling Commission member country which had not banned whaling completely. We should remember that some 90 per cent of the total whale catch is taken by members of the IWC and, in particular, Japan and Soviet Russia through the operation of their factory ships. Secondly, an Australian could engage in whaling elsewhere in the world on the part of a country which is not a member of the IWC such as Peru, Chile, Portugal, Spain, South Korea, Taiwan and China. Those countries are not only taking whales but also are taking whales that are being determined by the IWC as deserving of protection. Thirdly, of course, we have the situation of pirate whaling ships operating under flags of convenience. These operators take protected species. They take undersized whales and they take lactating females and calves. Indeed having done that, they often use only part of the whales they have taken. The operation of this third category is a direct challenge to the conservation of whales. </para>
        <para>The legislation, including the extra-territorial clause, is important. It is of great credit both to the Government and to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that the legislation has been placed before this House. Indeed I welcome the entry of the Prime Minister into this debate because it showed his personal commitment to this clause. It is important that this clause be maintained because of the high international and domestic profile the Government has taken on this issue. The Government instituted an independent inquiry into whales and whaling under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Sydney</inline> Frost. On the basis of the report of that inquiry the Government introduced the legislation we are now debating in this chamber to ban whaling in Australian waters. It based that legislation, as recommended by the Frost inquiry on the New Zealand and United States legislation. </para>
        <para>The Government has also banned the importation of whale products from 1 January 1981. We have supported and achieved through the International Whaling Commission a sanctuary for whales in the Indian Ocean. We have also initiated in the IWC a study of the extent to which exploitation of krill and other marine resources will have an effect on future whale populations. Most importantly, the Government has sought vigorously a world wide ban on whaling. Therefore, for the Government to back down on the extra-territorial provisions as proposed by the legislation committee would weaken the legislation and would weaken the position of this Government in its international resolve to achieve a ban on whaling. It has been suggested as a possible substitute amendment that the extra-territorial provision should not apply to Australians operating through member countries of the IWC and that we should allow Australians to engage in whaling in accordance with IWC quotas. A number of aspects of the IWC and its administration are unsatisfactory, although, of course, its operation has much improved since the days when it was a whaler's club. The IWC now operates on the basis of quotas recommended by its scientific committee. Recently certain queries have been directed at the validity of the conclusions of that committee. Many people believe that the scientific committee has understated the need for conservation. Furthermore, the IWC has been accused of ignoring the recommendations of the scientific committee. This was much in evidence at the thirty-first meeting of the IWC in July 1979. At that meeting there was support for the United States to permit Eskimos to continue hunting bow head whales. There was much compromise before final agreement was reached on quotas for various whales. This was contrary to the recommendation of the scientific committee. Indeed, Australia's Commissioner to the International Whaling Commission, John Ovington, made an impassioned plea for the scientific committee's recommendations to be more closely accorded with. He stated that the IWC would have little credibility left if, for the fourth time, it ignored the recommendations of its scientific committee. </para>
        <para>On that basis, it is important that the recommendation of the legislation committee be rejected. Furthermore, as the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Thomson)</inline> has already said, the Whaling Act instituted in 1960 has extra-territorial application. Also, under the articles of the International Whaling Convention, we are required to have extra-territorial provisions. For all those reasons, I believe that the recommendation of the legislation committee to remove the extra-territorial application of this legislation should be rejected. The position, as stated by the Government through the Minister and through the Prime Minister earlier in this debate this evening should be supported. </para>

In the courts, we would have to pay for the legal fraternity to try to prove them guilty. It just shows one how specious these arguments are. It is interesting to know also that the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Thomson),</inline> who is at the table, does not seem to be concerned that he would be issuing 12-month permits to people who are likely to kill whales accidentally. Is that pan of clause 1 1 of the Bill designed to protect the Japanese longline fishermen who fish in their own territorial waters? Why should the Government be granting 12-month permits? I ask the Minister Why should he grant 12-month permits to those people who are likely accidentally to kill whales or other cetaceans? This part of the legislation under clause 11 was designed to protect the Japanese long-line fishermen once again. </para>
        <para>In the legislation committee which considered the Whale Protection Bill, under clause 31, subclause 2 (a) and (d), I asked the Minister about ships that would be allowed to enter Australian ports. There were some exclusions to the provision regarding the vessels and this had something to do with the cargo. These vessels that break down outside or in the Australian territorial waters are allowed to enter Australian waters because of certain cargoes. Would that cargo - </para>

            <para>-Yes. I am addressing the Minister. I thought he was concerned in catching Australians who would be engaging in illegal activities in whaling. I thought he might take that into consideration, and catch these illegal whalers; and if there were any Australians on those whaling fishing vessels he might be able to apprehend them when they came into port. I will finish on that note and bow to your decision. Quite clearly, the provisions of clauses 1 1 and 3 1 of the Bill are very shallow. I support the amendment that was passed by the legislation committee. It was supported by honourable members from both sides of the House who were members of the legislation committee. I am very sorry that the Minister has taken this course of action. </para>

          <para>-Tonight we are debating whether the amendment made in the legislation committee be disagreed to. Much of the extraneous argument that has been brought forward about the protection of whales bears no relationship to the decisions which the House has before it; in fact, there is very little argument. There is certainly no argument on my part whether whales should be protected. In fact, I go so far as to say that whales should be protected and Australia should use its influence in international whaling agreements through the United Nations and other forums to convince the countries that are presently whaling to cease such activity. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There is no question in my mind that the extra territorial reach of the provisions of this Bill, in respect of which the legislation committee has recommended amendment, is ridiculous in the extreme. There is no question as to the bona fides of the majority of Australians in wishing to protect a mammal such as the whale in the future, and there is no question that we should be using our influence in all spheres and forums to do just that. I find myself in a position where a reasonable compromise has been offered to the Government in this matter. I believe that that has been carried by an overwhelming opinion in the legislation committee. An overwhelming concensus was reached in another place in which we had an opportunity to express our opinions. It is my contention that the provisions of this Bill in that respect are too draconian. It is a measure that will bring ridicule on the Australian Government, because it is a law that could not be policed. No country would be prepared to agree to extradition proceedings to bring Australians back to Australia to face the draconian measures that are detailed in the Bill. </para>
        <para>I believe that the Government is sparring with shadows in the clause in which it seeks to extend extra-territorially the conditions imposed by the Bill. I ask the Minister whether he can give me the name of one Australian who is presently engaged illegally in whaling anywhere in the world. I certainly know of nobody. I asked the Minister whether he could supply me with a list of names, or even one name of an Australian who is presently engaged illegally in whaling when there is no legislation in force to this effect, and no real inhibiting factor on an Australian engaging in whaling around the world. I believe that there has been a genuine offer to the Government to reach a compromise situation. If the Government is prepared to ignore the forms of the Parliament and if the Government is not prepared to accept the clear concensus in another place, I must oppose the legislation. Therefore, I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Robertson and carried in the legislation committee. I will support the amendment to be moved by the honourable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dummond),</inline> which I believe seeks to achieve a reasonable compromise situation. </para>

          <para>-I seem to be in some minor disagreement on this matter with the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Thomson)</inline> who is at the table and with my leader, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> That is a pity because we agree on most matters. I do not believe that any reasonable case has been established by the Government for extraterritorial reach of this law. I do not believe that the removal of the extra-territorial provisions will, in fact, substantially weaken this measure. I concede that I have some doubts about the whole measure and that the best advice I can get is that those species of whale that are, in fact, endangered, might be in greater danger because we are not actively participating in the whaling industry. Be that as it may, a question of legal principle is involved. It seems to me that it is unreasonable that any citizen should be required to accord with the requirements of two laws that may be inconsistent. It seems to me that that sort of situation ought to be avoided as carefully as possible, wherever possible. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>An Australian citizen or a person who is not an Australian citizen but who is domiciled in Australia might go overseas and in some way get involved in the whaling industry. It is conceivable that that activity within the whaling industry might even be accidental. I concede that if such activity were accidental that would probably be a reasonable defence in court. It is not reasonable, though, that that person should even be faced with charges for perhaps operating a typewriter in a whaling company or for doing some other activity that was perfectly legal in the laws of the country in which the person resided at the time. I do not believe the term 'ordinarily domiciled' is adequately defined. I suspect that it cannot be adequately denned. Therefore, a serious question of civil liberty arises. I support the amendment moved in the legislation committee. In the event of its not being agreed to I will support the amendment to be moved by the honourable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Drummond).</inline></para>

          <para>- I speak as one of the 12 members of the legislation committee which discussed this matter. There was talk of an overwhelming vote as far as the amendment is concerned. Might I advise the House that if only two members on that committee had changed their minds, the vote would have been a draw. I think that is the extent to which the vote can be described as an overwhelming vote. </para>

            <para>- It was probably underwhelming. I bow to the finer knowledge of the English language of the honourable member for Lalor. We have been talking about civil liberties tonight. We have been talking about illegal acts overseas and things like that. We have also had put to us examples which I think miss the point entirely. I think that this Bill is comparable to other Australian legislation. I mentioned in the legislation committee that what this Bill sets out to do, along with other Acts, is to set down Australian standards for Australian citizens acting not only within Australia but in other parts of the world. I should imagine that any person domiciled in Australia, knowing that there was a particular Act within Australia which imposed penalties or a law within Australia that made certain things illegal, would take those standards with him when he travelled overseas. He would not set himself the standards of the countries to which he travelled. One can only take the example of a murderer, and here I do not mean an abortionist. Just because there is a penalty for murder in Australia, if a person goes overseas and there is no penalty for such a crime, that would not leave a person free to commit that crime overseas. I think it is most important that we set these Australian standards. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I do not see anything draconian in this legislation. In fact, what we might be talking about as being draconian is the penalty of $100,000. The purpose of the amendment is not to question that penalty of $100,000. I just cannot follow at all those people talking about draconian measures in connection with this amendment. The civil liberties are those that I have indicated. The people who will lose their liberties are those who commit a crime or whatever overseas. If that is the extent of the loss of civil liberties, I do not think anybody really minds. I cannot see my civil liberties being decreased by this legislation. As I say, it is only the guilty who will have any problems about that. </para>
        <para>It was also mentioned in the legislation committee that this legislation will not decrease the amount of whaling done overseas and that therefore whales might be in ever-diminishing numbers. That is no reason for Australia not to take a stand. There are parallels in other aspects to which we should be giving our attention and on which Australia can take a lead, even though it may not affect the eventual result. So, in the few moments I have left, I have no hesitation in supporting the legislation. I see nothing inconsistent about it. It has been discussed in the legislation committee. I just say that being one of those four members who supported the retention of the Bill as it was, I did so for those reasons and I will continue to do so. </para>

            <para>-In deference to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> I withdraw. May I say that there is absolutely no question that in so far as the honourable member for Swan represents the view of the members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia they are a whale killing ratpack because he has said that he wants to kill them all. He wants to kill the whales and the porpoises. He wants to kill them all, and he makes no attempt to withdraw that remark. That is the point I want to make. I, as a West Australian, want to disassociate myself from those who are part of that ratpack and who are interested in killing whales and who want to resurrect the whale industry not only in Western Australia but also in other parts of Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>There is a great inconsistency in the Government's position on this measure. Although clause 6 takes the extreme position that it shall be illegal for anyone normally domiciled in Australia to take whales anywhere in the world, clauses 9 and 11, taken in conjunction, make it possible for fishermen in this country to take porpoises and other small cetaceans. In fact, permits for that purpose have been issued. I refer honourable members to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of the proceedings of the legislation committee. I asked the Minister about clause 9, which provides that it is all right for someone who is normally fishing for something else to take accidently a porpoise or other form of small cetacean. However, clause 1 1 provides that the Government can issue licences to fishermen to take porpoises incidentally to the catching of other fish, and it has done so. If the Government was as dinkum as the Minister for Science and the Environment <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Thomson)</inline> and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> have stated this evening, was really that passionate about this issue, it would ensure that no Australian fishermen could take any cetaceans, whether large in the form of whales or small in the form of porpoises, dolphins and the like. I would not have throught that it would have embraced the sentiments of the honourable member for Swan and thought that it was all right to kill them all. That is the great inconsistency in this Bill. On the one hand, the Government is prepared to issue permits to fishermen to take dolphins. On the other, it is prepared to bring in what it admits is a very extreme measure, under which it may fine up to $ 100,000 any hapless Australian who finds himself overseas engaged in whaling in some form or other. That is a very important inconsistency. </para><para>The Government's case really falls down- and this is one matter on which I agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie- because it has failed to bring forward any evidence that Australians are engaged in private whaling anywhere in the world. There is no law against Australians engaging in whaling now, here, or overseas as far as I know. Certainly there is no law preventing Australians domiciled in Australia from engaging in the whaling industry anywhere in the world. There has never been such a law. Where is the evidence to suggest that that activity is so widespread, that Australians have such a great passion for killing whales anywhere in the world, that clause 6 is really necessary? If the Government were prepared to bring in evidence to show us that Australians were engaged in the killing of whales in other parts of the world, not only would I support this measure enthusiastically but every other Opposition member would do likewise. The Government 'scase falls down in another regard as well. The Prime Minister himself said that the clause in virtually unenforceable. </para><interjection>

            <para>- He said that there was no way in which the Australian Government would know of all the instances in which Australians who were normally domiciled in Australia were engaged in the whaling industry elsewhere. That he said can be proved. Everybody knows that an unenforceable law is a bad law. Therefore, unless the Government can demonstrate the way in which the proposed law can be enforced there is absolutely no obligation on this Parliament to pass this measure. The only justification for such a measure would be that it was persuasive in getting Japan and Russia to pass similar laws to ensure that their citizens were not engaged in whaling in other parts of the world. It is the Russians and the Japanese who are the main culprits in this whole exercise. They are the ones who are taking whales far outside their territorial limits, who are threatening the whole whale species, who are engaged in inhumane acts, who are brutally killing whales, that we are really trying to get at. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>I repeat, if the measure were at all persuasive in convincing the Japanese and the Russians to take similar measures I suppose that one would have to give it serious thought. But we have seen, in relation to the activities of the International Whaling Commission, that the Russians and Japanese are quite unconvinced, quite implacable in their conviction to continue whaling throughout the world, both in their own territorial waters and in that of other countries if they can get away with it. Therefore until there is evidence that a measure such as this can be persuasive in wiping out whaling throughout the world, it is not justified in terms of the infringement of civil liberties which it entails. </para></speech>

          <para>Clause 6, page 4. line 18, after 'Australia' insert 'and persons not being Australian citizens (who are ordinarily resident in Australia) (except such Australian citizens (or such Australian residents) who engage in whaling operations which are in accordance with the International Whaling Conventions)'. </para>
        </motion>
        <para class="block">On 13 May I canvassed the reasons why I thought an amendment should be moved. It gives me no great pleasure to propose an amendment which is in conflict with the consensus of the Government parties to which I belong. But I believe the part of the Bill which deals with the extra-territorial activities of Australian citizens does not have the support- in fact, far from it- of the majority of my party. </para>
        <para>The amendment extends the Bill to include residents of Australia and allows citizens and residents to engage in whaling activities which are in accordance with the international whaling convention. I do not wish to be dogmatic in any shape or form about the resident part of the amendment. It appears to me that this provision is used in many Bills. All I seek is a logical explanation from the Government as to why such a provision should not be included in this Bill. I would like to quote two examples where such a provision is used. The first is the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Bill 1978. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> in his second reading speech said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In all the circumstances, including the need to preserve international relations, there is a need for legislation to deal specifically with the problem, including preparations in Australia for these activities. </para>
          <para>To this end, clause 6 will prohibit incursions into foreign countries for the purpose of engaging in hostile activities. This clause will apply to Australian citizens, persons ordinarily resident in Australia and persons who at any time during the period of one year immediately proceeding the commission of the offence were present in Australia . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It appears to me that that is a clear indication that the residents provision has been and can be used in this type of legislation. </para>
        <para>I would like to turn briefly to another piece of legislation- there are many such pieces of legislation- namely, the Pollution of the Sea by OU Act. This piece of legislation, after indicating that oil is discharged and so on provides that the owner and the master of an Australian ship is each guilty of an offence against this section for so doing. The legislation, when mentioning the owner or master of an Australian ship, does not in any way mention the words 'Australian citizen or resident'. Annex A of the Act provides that it is an offence to drop oil 30 miles from the Yugoslav coast in the Adriatic Sea. I do not wish to be dogmatic in any way about the resident provision that this amendment proposes to insert. I still seek an explanation from the Government as to why this is not a right and proper amendment to this Bill. </para>
        <para>Turning to the other part of the amendment, I do not wish to canvass, nor do I have the time to do so, all the arguments which were raised last week and during the sitting of the legislation committee. However, let me make a very brief precis of them. The legislation breaks new ground. What directions will future governments give to their people? As I said last week, one could imagine that those who smoke pot in California, which is highly illegal in Australia could come back to this country and face prosecution. Are we more interested in whales than in the health of our people? I also use the example of uranium. </para>
        <para>I appreciate the questions the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> posed in his speech: Really and truly will one whale less be killed in the world because of this rather draconian-type legislation we are introducing, and is there any chance that the Government will desire to police the Act? It would be quite easy, as has been pointed out by other speakers tonight, for someone to work overseas in an office of a company which that person did not realise was heavily involved in the whaling industry. According to this legislation, that person could be subject to prosecution on his return to Australia. Many speakers noted during the legislation committee debate that the question of extra- ' territorial legislation is a very vexing, complex and important one. The extension of a nation's laws beyond that nation's perimeters is something that should be done only in extreme circumstances. If this amendment is passed by the House I will be moving a consequential amendment. </para>

          <para>- I will be very brief. The Opposition does not support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Forest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Drummond)</inline> simply because it does not believe that one can be selective aboutcivil liberties. Either one opposes people being fined in countries where a practice is perfectly legal or one does not. The amendment proposed by the honourable member suggests that we should divide the world into two sections; one where people can be fined if they return and one where they cannot. This would be perfectly legal in both of these areas. However, one belongs to the International Whaling Commission and the other does not. So as a matter of principle, to be  consistent we oppose the amendment. </para>

          <para>- I find myself in complete agreement with the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> on this matter. This amendment is not acceptable to the Government partly for the reasons which the honourable member has just stated. The amendment misses the whole point of the Government 's policy which aims to give a lead to the international community in the introduction of a world wide ban on whaling. We could not give that lead if we were to tie ourselves of our own volition to an existing international practice that permits whaling. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As I said in my speech on the previous amendment the Government, through the Whaling Commissioner and the International Whaling Commission, will make every effort to persuade other countries to ban whaling throughout the world. We will do that using the legislation as it stands without amendment. This legislation will give us much greater authority to carry out this objective. I will not go over once again the reasons for the Government's position. The Government does not accept the amendment. </para>

            <para>-This Bill is supported by the Opposition. The reason for this Bill was some failure on the part of Ministers when gazetting certain acquisitions of lands by the Commonwealth prior to the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act coming into force on 1 July 1978. There was some doubt whether the gazettal in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</inline> No. S 1 16 on 29 June 1978 was properly performed. If there were some legal doubt about acquisitions being gazetted in that <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> it could lead to some unhappy consequences in a number of areas. The Opposition, whilst deploring the necessity for this legislation, because it shows a failure on the part of the Government to perform its duties accurately, is not surprised that it has happened. The Opposition supports this legislation which makes certain of the legality of that gazettal. </para>

            <para>-In the absence of the honourable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder)</inline> I want to say a few words on this Bill. In the years that he has been a member he has been a dedicated representative of the people of the Northern Territory. He is not able to be here tonight. As has been mentioned by the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman),</inline> the Bill is not being opposed by the Opposition. The Bill ensures that there is no legal doubt about acquisition of lands by the Commonwealth for its purposes in the Northern Territory. Some of those purposes for acquisition include defence, as was mentioned in the second reading speech of the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr John McLeay),</inline> and a number of other reasons which I will not enumerate on in my speech in the second reading debate. This Bill is obviously beneficial to the people of the Northern Territory and to the people of Australia generally in that the legality of the acquisitions should be beyond any doubt. This is what the Bill does. Again I pay great tribute to my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory for the part he played in the development of self-government for the Northern Territory and for the time that he has been a member of this House. </para>

            <para>- I remind the House of the remarkable incompetence that this Bill displays. The fact that the Government has to bring in legislation such as this to overcome a piece of administrative neglect back in 1978 shows this incompetence. It is a remarkable achievement even for this Government. I remind the House that the Government now has an average of one major blunder of this sort a year. The New South Wales redistribution was passed before the 1977 Commonwealth election which, of course, did not comply with the law. It had to be withdrawn and hurriedly brought back to the House and passed by the Parliament. Then there was the blunder on the brandy excise legislation two or three years ago. This was found to be totally misconceived inasmuch as the brandy was not produced in Australia. There was already an excess of supply and there had to be a rapid change. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>About three years ago a States Grants Bill for Aboriginal affairs passed through the House. Honourable members opposite, through their Minister, adopted the policy of bypassing the Senate. They did not bother to send that Bill to the Senate. It went to His Excellency the Governor-General with the necessary signatures on it attesting that all the requirements of the Constitution had been complied with. Of course all that Bill had to go through all the procedures again. Then there was the notable case which caused a great deal of disadvantage to one of the local businesses in Canberra. The Australian Capital Territory Consumer Affairs Council brought down a report in which a firm was mentioned quite erroneously. These are just samples of the incompetence with which this country has been inflicted since this Government seized power. Those are just the cases we know about. There must be dozens of others which are obscured either through incompetence or because the Acts are simply administrative ones. </para>
          <para>This Bill seems a fairly devious way- I am not talking now about the machinery of the Commonwealth gazettal- of overcoming some of the difficulties created in the attempt to give the Northern Territory a degree of autonomy. I hope we take a good look at the general direction of development in the Northern Territory. It should have a free hand in those areas for which it is responsible and we should develop a co-operative attitude in those areas where it is necessary. We need co-operation with the States in an increasing number of public interest areas rather than the confrontation which this Bill implies. </para>
          <para>This Bill is an interesting application of the rights of the Commonwealth to acquire land. Over the years that we have been confronting the Government on the question of Aboriginal land it has continuously denied its capacity to take steps such as this. However the legislative and administrative machinery is readily available. </para>
          <para>The Bill is an intriguing document. I have glanced at the Schedule in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</inline> describing the land to be acquired by the Commonwealth, and I suggest to the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr John McLeay)</inline> that as a piece of information for the community it is fairly obscure. One might say that it is obscurantist. It describes the land in all the traditional terms. Even for somebody who might know the area it is difficult to establish to which area it refers. In a document such as this the land ought to be defined more precisely so that people who may well become the victims of an acquisition order of this sort at least might be aware of it. This does not occur only in the cases where we are simply confirming historic questions but it can occur also when people are quite unaware that their land has been acquired under Commonwealth acquisition legislation. This has happened in the past. By looking at the schedule, there is no way that one can tell what it is about. </para>
          <para>It is an interesting document also because it describes one piece of land as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>All that parcel of land in the Northern Territory of Australia containing an area of 75 square metres more or less being Lot 369  1  , in the Town of Alice Springs- </para>
          </quote>
          <para>One wonders for what purpose a lot of 750 square feet or thereabouts is being used. It is the sort of thing that the very early land boomers in Melbourne and Sydney would have decided was a bit small for them. I remind the House and those countless thousands outside the House who are listening carefully and continuously to the debates here that this is another example of the remarkable incompetence of this Government. I hope that people will not trust them any further than the next election. </para>

              <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>I withdraw. These two Ministers have imposed a merciless, insensitive and systematic slashing of expenditure in Aboriginal socio-economic areas. In 1975 the Whitlam Labor Government allocated $130m for Aboriginal affairs. In 1979 the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> allocated $125m despite the fact that the Aboriginal population has increased by 2.2 per cent each year. Using the most conservative deflator index that is a cut of 3 1 per cent in real terms. One of the worst and most shameful cuts in Aboriginal affairs has been in the health area, where there has been a cut by 1 5 per cent in real terms over five years. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The average life expectancy of an Aboriginal is 50 years, compared with 72 years for a non-Aboriginal. The Aboriginal infant mortality rate in the Northern Territory- 48 per 100- is five times higher than the rate for the rest of the population. What did the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program report tabled last month state? It established that more than one in five aged Aboriginals are totally blind; that a further 21 per cent are blind in one eye with impaired vision in the other eye; that one third of aged Aboriginal men and almost half of aged </para>
          <para class="block">Aboriginal women have a sight-threatening trachoma disease; and that 90 per cent of the Aboriginal people examined by the trachoma team had never encountered an eye doctor before. These appalling findings speak for themselves against the background of systematic cutting of Aboriginal expenditure. </para>
          <para>Two health problems are seldom mentioned in this Parliament. They are shameful problems. It is not the shame of the Aboriginal people who suffer these conditions but the shame of Australian governments for forcing them to live in the squalid and degrading environment in which these diseases flourish. I refer to Hansen's disease, or leprosy, and sexually transmitted diseases, specifically syphilis. Professor Hollows, who led the trachoma team told the Department of Aboriginal Affairs last September: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There were 14 individual cases of leprosy in the Northern Territory and 16 in Western Australia in 1977. That is a strike rate per 100,000 of 54 in the Northern Territory and 100 in north western Australia. </para>
            <para>Overseas, the highest strike rate is just over 50 for the five most affected countries- the poorest Third World nations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">On this analysis northern Australia has the worst leprosy rate in the world. As a statistic that is horrifying enough. Imagine how much more horrifying it is for the people inflicted with this disease, which was introduced from abroad and propagated by white Australian neglect of Aboriginal health problems. The disease has a long incubation period of up to seven years. But, of course, it occurs in the most abysmal of living conditions. I quote again from what Professor Hollows had to say to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am seeing Hansen's disease sufferers in Darwin from Alice Springs. Leprosy is occuring in Alice Springs now and there have been two cases in Bourke. It is a bad living conditions disease and it will go on occurring while living conditions are what they are. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Northern Territory notifications for sexually transmitted syphilis went from 35 cases in 1973 to 703 cases in 1977. The non-Aboriginal rate rose from 50 to 166 cases. The strike rate for Aborigines in 1977 was 27 per 1,000 compared with two per 1,000 for non-Aboriginals. Professor Hollows wanted to implement a mass screening parallel to the trachoma effort but he received no support from either the Federal Department of Health or the Northern Territory medical services. The trachoma survey would have presented an ideal opportunity for the screening and treating of these diseases. Now we must rely on the extension of community-based Aboriginal medical centres or, if we could extract the money from this anti-Aboriginal Government, a trachoma-type survey in north Australia for both leprosy and sexually transmitted diseases. </para>

              <para>1 ) Several advertising agencies have been used in recent years to publicise the Government's programs and policies in the health field. These agencies have been selected jointly by my Department and the Australian Government Advertising Service, the Branch of the Department of Administrative Services which is responsible for arranging Government advertising. Under the system for arrangement of such advertising, separate agencies are used for creating advertisements and then for placing them with the media. In the past year, for example, three agencies- Fountain Huie Fish Pty Ltd, Compton Advertising Aust. Pty Ltd, and Schofield Sherbon Baker Pty Ltd- have been used for creating advertisements. Two other agencies- Berry Currie Advertising (N.S.W.) Pty Ltd and Fortune (Aust.)

            <item label="(">
              <para>1) (a) and (b) For the Government's views on local refining capacity see the statement by the Minister for National Development of 1 June 1978. The Government's position is supported by the extent of refinery expansion and upgrading which has taken place in recent years. For example during the four years ended December 1978 the average installed capacity at Australian refineries increased by 5.2 per cent; furthermore during the same period refinery outturn increased by 9.2 per cent while demand for petroleum products increased by only 7.3 percent. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>and (3) Not necessarily. Recent increases in refinery capacity have been achieved by the expansion of existing refinery facilities, not by the addition of a new refinery. Over the next eighteen months to two years the Total Oil Company plans to expand its refinery at Matraville, New South Wales from the present 12,000 barrels per day capacity to 45,000 barrels per day. The Government knows of no firm plans to build a new refinery. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) (a) There are 45 nuclear medicine centres in Australia able to use four approved radiopharmaceuticals manufactured from cyclotron-produced radionuclides. These are (i) Gallium 67 Citrate, (ii) Thallium 201 Chloride, (iii) Indium 1 1 1 Calcium DTPA, (iv) Sodium 22 Chloride. The number of hospitals using each one depends on their requirements and available equipment. For example, Thallium 201 requires expensive computer facilities and hence usage is mainly limited to the larger centres. All four radiopharmaceuticals are imported from overseas and the radionuclides have half-lives longer than 60 hours. Procurement from overseas of radionuclides with half-lives less than 60 hours is difficult and for half-lives less than a few hours is impossible. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>However, it must be realized that the abovementioned cyclotron-produced radiopharmaceuticals service a very small proportion, probably 5 per cent or so of the patients imaged in most nuclear medicine departments in Australia. </para>
          <para>There are no cyclotrons in Australia at present for the production of radionuclides for medical purposes. (b), (c) and (d) Information is not available on the number of overseas hospitals that are using cyclotronproduced radiopharmaceuticals.

                    <item label="(2)">
                      <para>There are hardly any radionuclides of medical importance which, in practice, are produced both by nuclear reactor and cyclotron. Hospitals, therefore, do not normally have to indicate preference for a particular radionuclide on the basis of its method of manufacture. </para>

          </list>
          <para>Preference for radiopharmaceuticals using cyclotronproduced radionuclides over reactor-produced radionuclides is thus not related to hospitals but rather to the radionuclide and its proposed use. For instance, cyclotron-produced Iron 52 (8 hour half-life) which cannot be made in a reactor is  preferred to reactor-produced Iron 59 (45 day half-life) for use in bone-marrow studies. Also Iodine 123 ( 13 hours halflife), which can only be produced by a cyclotron, is preferable to reactor-produced Iodine 131 (8 day half-life) for thyroid studies, but, reactor-produced Technetium 99M (6 hours half-life) is only marginally inferior to Iodine 123 for this purpose. Some Iodine 123 labelled compounds, for example Iodine 123 Iodohippurate, are preferable to the corresponding Iodine 131 compounds since the resulting absorbed radiation dose is less and the image quality is better. However, the 13 hour half-life of Iodine 123 introduces procurement problems and the radiopharmaceutical cost is much higher. </para>
          <para>The number of types of investigations for which radiopharmaceuticals manufactured from cyclotron-produced radionuclides are preferred to those manufactured from reactor-produced radionuclides is small. The precise number would require detailed cost benefit studies which are difficult and have not been reported in the scientific literature. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Cyclotrons do not necessarily produce isotopes of a better quality than reactors. However cyclotrons are able to produce some radionuclides that cannot be produced in a reactor. The majority of these have a reasonably short half-life and consequently result in low radiation doses when administered to patients. This is an advantage but, as indicated above, is not the only consideration. Such short half-life isotopes, however, may increase the risks of radiation exposure for the staff handling them. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>For very short half-life radionuclides such as Carbon 1 1, Nitrogen 13 and Oxygen 15 with half-lives of 20, 10 and 2 minutes respectively, the cyclotron must be adjacent to the nuclear medicine centre. In addition to this requirement, highly specialised scanning equipment (Positron Scanner) is required in order to make the most efficient use of these radionuclides. Radionuclides with such short half-lives have not commonly been used for routine patient care. Consequently, Australian hospitals could be provided with radiopharmaceuticals which have half-lives between a few hours and about 60 hours and which are not available to them at present, through a cyclotron located in some central position. To supply centres wishing to use very short half-life radionuclides would require a cyclotron at each centre. However, as indicated earlier, the use of cyclotron-produced radiopharmaceuticals accounts for approximately 5 per cent of the patients attending nuclear medicine departments. </para>
          <para>HIFAR could not be replaced by a cyclotron for the manufacture of certain essential radionuclides in high demand, particularly Technetium 99M and Iodine 131. </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) The potent biodegradable insecticides named insecticidal esters discovered by CSIRO's Division of Applied Organic Chemistry are currently in the development stages. As announced in a statement by the former Minister on 1 1 July 1979, CSIRO has selected two companies, Roche-Maag Ltd and Nippon Kayaku Co. Ltd from 36 applicants to participate with the Division of Applied Organic Chemistry in a 3-party program to develop and exploit these compounds on a world-wide basis. This program is proceeding satisfactorily with promising results and good co-operation between the three parties. At present emphasis is being given to small scale field trials and laboratory tests by the companies to determine which of the many possible insecticidal esters should be selected for commercial production. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In Australia, Roche-Maag Ltd has a very active program preparing and testing these compounds in their laboratories on Australian pests. The CSIRO Division of Applied Organic Chemistry is currently undertaking back-up research and is developing ways to increase the potency of the compounds even further. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>In 1977 when they were first announced, the compounds apeared to be effective against insects but harmless to mammals. The test results obtained since then have substantiated this view. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>and (4) As mentioned in the first part of this answer these compounds are not yet at the commercial stage. CSIRO is collaborating with Roche-Maag Ltd and Nippon Kayaku Co. Ltd in a development program to bring them to commercial use. It will take 3 to 5 years to develop the methods for large scale commercial production and to complete the safety tests required under the regulations to prove that there will be no adverse toxic effects, before any specific insecticide can be registered for use in Australia. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(5)">
              <para>To date CSIRO has lodged a total of 50 patent applications on these compounds in Australia and overseas. Of these, 6 have been granted and the rest are still under prosecution. CSIRO does not expect any difficulty in obtaining those patents. </para>
