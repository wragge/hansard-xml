            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Is it a fact that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has placed an embargo on the taking of long service leave, except in exceptional circumstances, until the end of the financial year as a money saving measure? Has this measure been taken because the ABC is experiencing some financial difficulty at present? Will the Minister tell the House what action he has taken or will take to alleviate that situation? </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of the matters raised by the honourable member. If the ABC faces difficulties in the performance of its basic functions- I would have thought that long service leave was a fairly basic function in any organisation- it is always open to it to argue at the time of Additional Estimates or at the time of ordinary Estimates that it needs extra funds. We are always open to such approaches and I repeat the claim that if there is a difficulty in an organisation such as the ABC pursuing its normal activities we will hear from it to that effect, and we will listen sympathetically. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would like to say that the Government has taken a number of decisions in recent times with respect to the ABC which ensure that at the very least the ABC receives an inflation adjusted amount to cope with rises in the cost of living. That is the basis on which discussions about the ABC&#39;s annual financial situation begin these days and will begin for a period ahead. We have also provided that the ABC will be able for the first time to retain extra earnings above a certain amount which it makes through the sale of its own product, and that of course is an incentive for creative activity and for the ABC to produce more of its own programs. As I said, I am open to approaches from the ABC if it believes its priorities are such that it needs to approach the Government about these matters. </para>

            <para>-I ask the Minister for Health: Is it a fact that in recent years the Federal Government has provided funds to State governments under the National Drug Education Program for use in drug education programs? Is it also a fact, however, that these funds are not permitted to be used for drug rehabilitation purposes and that even in the area of education they are not permitted to be used in relation to alcohol as distinct from drugs? If my understanding on these points is correct, will the Minister explain to the House the reasons for these restrictions? In view of the great national importance of these issues- the fact that effective drug education cannot be divorced from drug rehabilitation and the fact that in both education and rehabilitation drug abuse cannot be realistically separated from alcohol abuse- I ask whether the Minister and the Government will give urgent consideration to removing from the conditions for the use of the relevant Federal funds the two major restrictions to which I have referred. </para>

            <para>-As the honourable member for Ballarat would know, the National Drug Education Program, which has been operating since 1970-71, aims at assisting all sections of the community, in particular young people, to develop healthy and discerning attitudes towards all drugs. We believe very strongly that education about drugs is terribly important for the overall wellbeing of the community. Commonwealth funds for drug education have been provided annually for distribution to the States. Allocations are assessed each year in line with the demonstrated needs which are set out in programs submitted to the Commonwealth and State drug education authorities. This financial year the Commonwealth has appropriated $59m for projects approved under the Community Health Program and within that program of approved projects there are - </para>

              <para>- Within the program of approved projects located in the various States are 37 projects which relate specifically to prevention, treatment or rehabilitation in the fields of alcoholism and drug abuse. Of these projects, 22 are conducted by State agencies and 15 by voluntary organisations. This financial year the Commonwealth will provide approximately $6m for these projects on a 50-50 basis with the States. </para>

          <para>I think it should be noted that the activities of a substantial number of projects provide general community health services which encompass alcohol and drug abuse. So, the level of funds available under the Community Health Program may not cover some of the situations which the honourable member has brought forward, but I can assure him that the Government gives wholehearted support for the very commendable efforts of voluntary organisations whose projects are aimed at providing, particularly for young people, educational facilities and opportunities to understand and to take special note of the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse. If there are any specific aspects which the honourable member would like me to look at I would be very happy to do <inline font-style="italic">so.</inline></para>

In relation to current allegations of ghosting of the Australian National Line payroll by members of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia, is the Minister aware that, under current operating procedures, the Federal Police is unable to investigate activities affecting a Federal department or a statutory authority unless specifically requested to do so by the Minister responsible or by the management of the organisation concerned? As any police investigation of ghosting on the Melbourne waterfront could well reflect on the competence of the ANL management and thus make it highly unlikely that it or the recently established interdepartmental committee would request such investigation, will the Minister personally consider whether the Federal Police should investigate this matter without delay? Will the Minister also consider allowing the Australian Federal Police in future to investigate matters on its own initiative without needing a formal request from the Federal department or statutory authority concerned? </para>

            <para>- The major recommendations of the Sweeney report relating to accounting, auditing and reporting of the financial affairs of industrial organisations of employers and employees was originally the subject of legislation brought into this House about two years ago. Since then a great deal of detailed work has been done, particularly in a tripartite subcommitteeI pay tribute to its work- of the National Labour Consultative Council, towards drafting regulations to give effect to that legislation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As the House will be aware, a week or so ago I introduced further amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which were found necessary as a result of that detailed examination. Those amendments cover the majority of the Sweeney recommendations. The original reason for setting up the royal commission, as the honourable member has pointed out, was the alleged payments to maritime unions.  His  Honour made a recommendation that such payments be prohibited by law. </para>
          <para>This is an extremely complex matter. It has been the subject of detailed investigation by several departments. In other words, legislation will probably not be able to be confined to one area. The Government is at the moment considering how best to give effect to the final recommendation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney. As soon as it is in a position to provide effectively for the prohibition which he recommended, legislation will be brought into this House. </para>

            <para>- I welcome the question about the Primary Industry Bank of Australia. It gives one an opportunity of reminding the House that this bank, which has been in operation for a mere 16 months, has already refinanced loans in excess of $200m to almost 3,000 primary producers throughout Australia. In other words, the bank has been an unqualified success and implements a proper and long standing aspiration of the great bulk of Australia&#39;s primary producers. The interest rate rises which are on both sides of the ledger and which were announced yesterday by the bank merely reflect what has occurred with other interest rates throughout the community in recent times. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable member&#39;s question also gives one the opportunity of remarking again that so far the rise in interest rates in this country has been extremely subdued compared with what has taken place in other countries. The purpose of increasing the borrowing rate by PIBA is to make sure that adequate funds will continue to be made available by the subscribing public. The honourable member and the House generally will be aware that because of the action taken by the Government to make available lower interest funds through the use of income equalisation deposits, the interest rate is indeed lower than may otherwise have been the case. </para>
          <para>Although the honourable gentleman will understand my traditional reluctance to commit the Government in advance to precise attitudes in these areas, he will understand that the Government regards the continued success of the Primary Industry Bank, having regard to the need for it to operate on a proper commercial basis, as a very important policy objective of the Government. </para>

            <para>-There are some assumptions in the honourable gentleman&#39;s question which may well not be accurate. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> said that he wanted a referendum on whether industrial powers should be placed in the hands of the Commonwealth he was ignoring the fact that there are very direct powers in the hands of the New South Wales Government which were very relevant to the oil industry dispute but which the Premier was totally unprepared to use. Indeed, when the New South Wales Government used powers for the emergency distribution of petrol those entitled to buy under the emergency procedures were approved not by the New South Wales Government but by the Transport Workers Union. That would seem to me to be an abdication by government in a very important matter. If a government in a State that is charged with some responsibilities towards its own people is prepared to abdicate its responsibilities in that way, clearly that State will be open to the kind of blackmail that the Transport Workers Union has in fact pursued. </para>

          <para>The honourable gentleman ignores the fact that section 45D has been used in relation to a number of disputes, and that in a number of disputes it has been highly successful. In the Utah dispute over coal exports the section was used, and used with effect. There are other disputes in which it was used. Of course, a large part of what the honourable gentleman has to say on this matter is governed, as I understand it, by the decisions of the Adelaide Conference of the Australian Labor Party, which bind every member of the Opposition and, as I understand it, members of the Labor Party in the States, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran.</inline> Against that background it needs to be understood that the Adelaide Conference decided that all pains and penalties should be taken off unions for breaches of the law and that they should be given the authority to operate in an unbridled fashion against the best interests of Australians.

              <para>-This House needs to understand and the Australian people need to understand that at the Adelaide Conference of the Labor Party a conscious decision was taken to remove the actions of Australian trade unions from any pains or penalties under the law and to remove all restraints from trade union behaviour. If the Australian Labor Party takes the view that bodies as powerful as modern trade unions with annual incomes of up to $10m should be allowed to exert an uninhibited power within the Australian community without any restraint of law whatsoever, that is not a view that is shared by honourable members on this side of the House. Against that background, I regret that the honourable gentleman might well be part of a minority in relation to some matters and that he might not share that sentiment. However, he also is bound by the policy. </para>

He will be aware of the grave effects on thousands of Australian working people in country areas of the recent industrial anarchy by some sections of the Storemen and Packers Union of Australia. Has the Treasurer received representations from the National Farmers Federation in relation to hardship to many of those people in paying tax assessments that are shortly to become due? Will he consider waiving penalties for late tax payments in cases of individual hardship? Will the Treasurer also consider the additional problem of producers being caught with two incomes next year- 1980-81- whereas they would normally be caught with one income in each of the years 1979-80 and 1980-81? </para>

            <para>-I think that the honourable gentleman will be aware that the administration of the Income Tax Assessment Act and therefore the matters under existing law of the remission of penalties and extensions of time for payment of tax are not matters that come within my personal discretion; rather they come within the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation. I should inform the House that last week, during my absence, my colleague the Minister for Finance, who was then Acting Treasurer, had some discussions with the Commissioner of Taxation on financial problems that wool growers might experience as a result of the storemen and packers industrial dispute. We were informed by the Commissioner that he is very aware, as indeed is the Government and all members on this side of the House- I hope that honourable members on the other side are equally aware- that problems could arise.  His  branch offices have been asked to grant wool growers who have not received payment for their clips appropriate additional time for payment of tax. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Accordingly, wool growers who are adversely affected by the storemen and packers dispute and who are thus unable to pay their income tax in full by the due date notified in their assessments should make individual applications for additional time to the taxation offices at which they lodge their returns. The Commissioner has informed the Government that these applications will receive, as is appropriate, sympathetic consideration. Where extensions of time are granted through inability to pay tax, taxpayers can be quite confident that additional tax accruing will be remitted in full provided they adhere to the terms of the extension. I might point out to the honourable gentleman that it is not a novel situation in cases of proper hardship for extensions of time to be granted and remissions of penalties to be given. </para>
          <para>The proceeds of auctions carried out in 1979-80 will be assessable as 1979-80 income, even though the cheque in payment may be received after 30 June. Any delay in shipping wool auctioned before 30 June will not affect tax liability. In the case of wool that is affected by the dispute and not auctioned by 30 June, the fact  that the value of the wool can be included in the 1979-80 income year will ameliorate the problem. In any event, those affected will be able to take advantage of the averaging provisions which exist for primary producers. </para>

            <para>There appeared in the edition of your magazine of March 19, 1980 an article titled &#39;How the Government Condones Waterfront Graft&#39;. </para>
            <para>I have had investigated the allegations contained in the article that ANL is making &#39;Ghosting&#39; payments to painters and dockers employed by the Line in Melbourne. Those allegations are simply not true. The Line has secure and detailed procedures relating to work payments to all its employees, including painters and dockers. According to our records, wages payments have been made to painters and dockers for hours actually worked and to those persons who have performed that work. </para>
            <para>Insofar as the photographs accompanying the article are concerned, the actions depicted are simply and innocently explained and do not support the construction attempted to be placed on them. </para>
            <para>Contrary to your allegation, ANL management does not condone criminal activities by any of its employees. If anyone can produce to the Line substantiated evidence that fraud or criminal activities are taking place over which the Line has control or responsibility, we will take strong and immediate action to see that such activities cease. I would also suggest that such evidence be immediately placed in the hands of the police. </para>
            <para>It is a pity that the Line was not given the opportunity prior to publication to reply to and correct the many inaccuracies that are contained in the article. We repeatedly requested that we be afforded that opportunity, but this was denied us. The only prior advice we received on the content of the article was that some portions of a previous draft were read over the telephone to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Welch</inline> for comment. That earlier draft appears to have been substantially changed prior to publication. </para>

            <para>-Is the Minister for Post and Telecommunications aware of Telecom Australia&#39;s recent announcement of a profit in excess of $ 100m? Does the Minister recall Telecom&#39;s policy decision a few years ago to discourage people deliberately from sending telegrams by pricing them out of the reach of even the above-average income earner? Has the Minister been to any weddings in recent times and witnessed at first hand how the traditional greetings by telegram have been almost totally eliminated as a direct result of Telecom&#39;s decision? Will the Minister personally request Telecom more than seriously to consider the introduction of a special low cost rate for greeting telegrams sent, say, three days prior to a wedding, a 2 1st birthday, an anniversary or other important occasion, thus making possible the revival of a pleasant custom that Telecom alone has destroyed? </para>

            <para>-One thing needs to be very plain. This Government is going to support the interests of small business and of individuals against the overwhelming power either of large and powerful trade unions or of large and powerful corporations. I think that probably we have come to one of the most unhealthy circumstances that we could possibly have within Australian society when we find an alliance, the appearance and reality of an alliance, between a large and powerful company and a large and powerful trade union, designed to deny the existence, the right to survival, of a small businessman trying to operate in a related area. That is something to which there is a total commitment on the part of this Government- opposition to that kind of alliance and support for the rights of small companies, small people. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>After all, that goes to the heart of what this Australian society is about- the average person in the community; the small businesses in the community; if one likes, the little people in the community who, as this case has shown, plainly need the support of the law and of governments against the kinds of arrangements that have been made by the Amoco company and by the Transport Workers Union of Australia, in the presence as I understand it of the New South Wales Government and, as has been stated, under the auspices of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. We need to establish the concept that industrial disputes should be settled on the basis of principle and not on the basis of power or the unification of power between large corporations and powerful trade unions. </para>
          <para>So there is a grave and serious principle underlying the dispute involving the Transport Workers Union. The commitment of the Government to support the rights of individuals, of citizens and of companies will not be diminished. Our support for section  45D  has not diminished and indeed we will be looking to ways in which that section can perhaps be modified to make it clearer that the sort of behaviour that has occurred is outside the law and will be on future occasions. My colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations will be making a statement on these and related matters shortly after Question Time. That will show the Government&#39;s determination to exert its influence and its authority to support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> &#39;s kind of operation. The Government&#39;s support will be given not because of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> as a person but because of the kind of position that is symbolised by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> and what he was seeking to do, and by the circumstances in which he has been put by arrangements between Amoco Australia Ltd and the Transport Workers Union. </para>
          <para>I ought to say that, as I understand it, Amoco put out a statement either last night or this morning to the effect that had I been briefed on the results of a discussion between Amoco and some of my ministerial colleagues I would not have said one or two of the things that I did. I was briefed on that discussion and also I have the advantage of having seen a document which is in the Government&#39;s hands and which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Moore made available to us- the confidential, secret agreement involving Amoco and the Transport Workers Union under the auspices of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The advice that was given as a result of the meeting with Amoco, but more particularly the nature and content of the secret agreement, filled me and the Government with the gravest possible concern. It does not make Amoco appear in any better light; it makes the company appear in an infinitely worse light. If it wishes to challenge that, I suggest that it publish the secret agreement. </para>

            <para>- Is the Prime Minister aware of suggestions by a vice-president of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that it was organisations representing the wool growers rather than the brokers which were responsible for the Full Bench appeal which has caused such disruption in the wool export industry? Is he aware that the wage of a worker in the wool stores can be approximately $ 1 38 net a week - </para>

              <para>- Is the Prime Minister also aware that the net wage of a worker in the wool stores can be approximately $138 a week including the controversial $8? Is the wool industry in such a parlous state that it cannot offer a fair and reasonable wage to its key workers in addition to proper returns to growers such as himself? </para>

            <para>-Again the honourable gentleman seems to miss the point. If there is a deficiency in the wage, that can be argued before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, as indeed it has been. It ought to be noted that it was a Full Bench of the Arbitration Commission that overturned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples&#39; decision because it believed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples had not followed the guidelines. I suppose the honourable gentleman would want it said that the Arbitration Commission had established the guidelines. I suppose also that the honourable gentleman would want it said that the trade unions have a right of appeal against a decision, either to the Commission or through the weight and brute force of collective bargaining, but that employers should not have the right of appeal. We happen to be determined to try to uphold the decisions of the Full Bench. It is a pity that the honourable gentleman, together with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Staples, was unable to do just that also. </para>

            <para>- by leave- Honourable members will recall statements made in the House in recent days regarding the outcome of proceedings under the auspices of the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in relation to the Transport Workers Union of Australia dispute involving Leon Laidely Pty Ltd. The Government has now had the opportunity to consider a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Moore on those proceedings. These proceedings took place against the background of a decision by Amoco Australia Ltd not to supply petroleum products to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely.</inline> The Government deplores the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> &#39;s fundamental right to trade freely has been denied and that this outcome followed proceedings in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> was denied the benefit of being present or represented. Action depriving a person of his rights in this way is totally unacceptable to government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In these circumstances, the Government considers it has a responsibility to take action designed to redress the inability of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> to have his rights properly considered. Accordingly, the Government has initiated steps to provide <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> with the opportunity to present his case before the same forum which previously dealt with this matter in his absence. I have thus requested the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to reconvene the previous proceedings in this matter and to invite the following parties: The Commonwealth Government, Leon Laidely Pty Ltd, the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association, the Transport Workers Union, oil companies, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and the New South Wales Government. </para>
          <para>In the course of these proceedings the Government will be submitting strongly that the parties should direct their efforts to developing a proper resolution of all issues involved in the matter and, in particular, should take into account the position of Leon Laidely Pty Ltd. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> and the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association would thereby have the opportunity to discuss with other parties, for the first time, positive ways of settling the matter to the satisfaction of all. I might add that this matter will be raised at a meeting of oil company principals this afternoon, and their positive support for this approach will be requested. </para>
          <para>I would express the Government&#39;s general concern that in circumstances such as this case a secret agreement can be reached under the present law between two parties at the expense of a third party who is not present. An examination by officials has been instituted on the implications of this, and, in particular, on what can be done to resolve what the Government regards as an unsatisfactory situation. The Government is concerned at any contrivance to frustrate the purpose of section 45d, namely the stopping of organisations- unions or companies- from hindering or preventing commercial dealings between a third party and the boycotted company. Accordingly, the Government has initiated an urgent and full review of section 45d to determine whether amendments are required to ensure the effectiveness of the section. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>-The statement made by the Minister for Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street),</inline> in some instances, shows some common sense. But I suggest that honourable members read a copy of the transcript of the interview of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> with John Laws on radio station 2UE this morning in conjunction with this statement made by the Minister. They will then be able to see the confrontationist attitude which is being taken by the Prime Minister. This Government seems not to understand the arrangements that can exist in industry on a number of matters, one of which is industrial peace. Many of the Government&#39;s supporters, amongst whom are numbered companies, both large and small, have with their work forces those sorts of arrangements which operate throughout this country. It is complete hogwash for the Prime Minister or any other Minister or any other member on the government side to tell us that this is a fight about the little man, the rights of the little man and the civil liberties of the little man. I remind honourable members opposite that when we came into office at the end of 1972 we let out of jail about 15 of those little men who had been put there by their Government because they had followed their conscience and would not go to Vietnam. So let honourable members opposite not tell us about their conscience in respect of the little man. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline>had an arrangement with both the union and the companies involved as to where he would distribute his petrol. He broke the agreement. As to the calling of all the parties together, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> was not at the first meeting because it was decided, either of his own volition or through instructions from his solicitors, that the best way for him to tackle the problem was to use the horrendous section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. I said in this place yesterday- and I reiterate it today- that section 45D in its present form, let alone a revamped section which is now being threatened, will one day bring Australia to its knees. It completely ignores not the deals but the arrangements that have been made in industry throughout this country. It is of no use the Prime Minister saying that some of the companies and some of the unions are getting too large. That happens to be the way in which an economy like ours develops. The position is the same in the United States. It is the same in the United Kingdom. It is the same in Germany, Italy and any other Western country one cares to name. The fact is that the companies will get larger and the unions will get larger in order to be able to combat the powers of one another. </para>
          <para class="block">That has been laid down many times by many people not the least of whom is John Galbraith. So it is of no use saying this is a bad thing. If the Government wants to break monopolies let us debate in the Parliament how they can be broken. </para>
          <para>If the Government thinks that the number of oil companies operating in Australia is not enough and we should double it, it should bring a motion into the House and let us debate how it can be done. Perhaps there could be fewer unions. But every time we have discussed the matter in the Parliament honourable members on both sides of the House have said that we have too many unions; we need fewer unions; we have to facilitate amalgamation in order that we can bypass some of the demarcation disputes and other industrial disputation which is brought upon our heads because of the arrangements which exist in Australia at the moment. We have 308 registered trade unions. Anybody in his right mind knows that is far too many. But this matter can be solved. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Industrial Relations has said the Government will ask <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Moore to handle it. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Moore has had criticism heaped on him in this Parliament by this Prime Minister over the last two days for not doing his job. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Moore is charged with under the Constitution is the settling of disputes and that is what he did last week. He settled the dispute and the people are back at work. But the Government is not happy with that. Just listen to this for a bit of madness. This is the Prime Minister speaking this morning- not five or six years ago when he was still reading articles by Ayn Rand- in an interview on 2UE. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If the trade union movement or the Transport Workers Union wants to confront the people of this nation - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I do not know whether that has ever been on:  and confront the Government that is defending those interests, then it can do so, but the Government would not retreat. The Government will not withdraw whatever the consequences. </para>
          <para class="block">Can honourable members imagine the leader of any country telling the people as our Prime Minister has told the people of Australia &#39;We are going to take action irrespective of the consequences&#39;? It is like Ayatollah Fraser telling us he does not know what will occur as a result of what he has made up his mind to do. But as I said on the radio program when I was asked to comment, what the Prime Minister has done has been to back the Government into a corner from which it cannot escape. He has to have confrontation now. The oil company officials who will be in Canberra this afternoon will be told: &#39;Irrespective of the previous arrangements you have had with private carters, you have to give them the oil so they can distribute it willy-nilly right across the metropolitan areas of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane and break all the arrangements and contracts that have been held between the Transport Workers Union and the oil companies themselves&#39;. Let us bring Australia to a standstill because Ayatollah will be satisfied that this is politically popular, that this will in some way improve his position as a politician in this country. Can honourable members imagine the leader of this country saying: &#39;Irrespective of the consequences we are going to take this action&#39;? He says that at the same time as a statement is being prepared in which the Government says: &#39;We want to get all the parties together to see whether we can get some rationale into this&#39;. But the last paragraph of the statement does not tell us that the reconvened meeting to be held tomorrow will discuss section 45D. What the Government is saying is that it hopes to get everybody to bow to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> &#39;s wishes tomorrow. </para>
          <para>In addition, the companies are to be told that section 45 D will be stiffened so that the arrangements that were made last week can no longer be made between the companies and the unions, irrespective of the fact that they were made under the chairmanship of the most prestigious person in industrial relations in this country, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Moore. This whole episode is a farce. If the Government wanted a settlement of this matter it could reach a settlement quite simply. It could say to the oil companies, to the unions and to the contractors: &#39;Make the arrangements, and let us all have a look at them and let everybody abide by them&#39;. There have to be some rules about the way in which these things operate. We cannot expect that the people driving the petrol trucks from any of those oil companies will say: &#39;Let the Laidelys of the world go where they like and let our jobs be up for grabs&#39;. That will not be acceptable to organised labour in Australia, whether it be in the oil industry, the car industry, the textile industry or whatever industry it may be. That sort of thing will not be accepted. All the Government will do is inflame the situation. </para>
          <para>That is so in relation not only to this episode because we can read that into what the Government is doing with respect to the other major dispute involving the Storemen and Packers Union of Australia. What utter madness! The storemen and packers in Melbourne and Sydney are on strike so the Government says: &#39;We will help the situation. We will close down every wool store in Australia so that no wool at all leaves Australia&#39;. </para>
          <para class="block">A week ago the Government was supporting the graziers in saying that the graziers could go into the wool stores and shift the wool themselves. This Government is not interested in decent, proper and constructive industrial relations. This Government, as the Prime Minister said this morning, is interested only in bringing the industrial relations system to its knees, irrespective of the consequences for the people of Australia. That statement by the Prime Minister ought to be the slogan in everybody&#39;s head when they vote perhaps on issues such as this which the Prime Minister will continue to raise between now and the end of the year. </para>
          <para>There are no benefits for the average Australian in this attitude being adopted by the Government. There are no benefits and there are no winners. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> nor people like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laidely</inline> will be winners in the long run. We have to learn to understand that the 125 of us who sit in this House do not have a monopoly on what is right in industry. Many arrangements are made in industry which people may not like. Many honourable members opposite do not like the fact that many major companies in this country demand that every employee become a member of a trade union before starting work. Nevertheless, for the purpose of industrial peace in many industries that is the standard law that operates between employees and employers. The sort of arrangement which has been made between the oil companies and the distributors has been respect in the industry. One person has stepped outside that arrangement and it may be worth while having a look at it to see whether we can get some settlement around it. </para>
          <para>It is not the sort of issue which should set a match to Australia. We should not be tearing up the rule book because of this one incident. We should not be providing the plank or the launching pad for the Laidelys of this world to use the great provisions of the Trade Practices Act to bring Australia to its knees or to have a major industrial confrontation. If the Government thought that a conference of the parties was necessary some time ago, it should have called such a conference. It should not be doing so under the camouflage of saying that it will toughen section 45D. The Government will make the companies and the unions much tougher operators than they have been in the past. They will have absolutely no respect for this Government which they see as an intruder in proper and constructive inustrial relations in this country. </para>

The work of the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation- INFCE- has been brought to a successful conclusion. The final conference of INFCE met in Vienna from 25-27 February. It adopted a report, made up of the reports of eight working groups and a summary and overview of the evaluation. This amounts all told to over 1 ,000 pages of documentation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is appropriate that I report to the House on the results and conclusions of INFCE. This is not only because the INFCE study represents a large investment of time and effort over more than two years in an area of activity which has attracted significant international attention. Its outcome also bears closely on Australia&#39;s uranium export, nuclear development and non-proliferation and safeguards policies. Australia made a significant contribution to INFCE. We played a major role in bringing the controversial Working Group 3 study on assurances of nuclear suupply to a constructive conclusion and contributed significantly to a number of other INFCE studies. </para>
          <para>Honourable members will recall that INFCE was established at an organising conference in Washington in October 1977 following a reassessment by the United States Administration of the risks of nuclear proliferation and consultations among the &#39;Summit Seven&#39;. The concern was to see a full examination of how nuclear energy could be made widely available to help meet the world &#39;s energy needs and at the same time of the ways in which the possible proliferation risks arising from an expanded world nuclear industry could be minimised. Both these principal themes were incorporated in the terms of reference of INFCE. </para>
          <para>INFCE was not intended to produce a comprehensive assessment of nuclear power in comparison with other energy sources. Nor was its aim to make a thorough evaluation of the environmental, health and safety impacts of nuclear power, although aspects of these were touched upon in various working group reports. Above all, importance of INFCE rests in the opportunity it provided for a detailed examination at governmental level of the international ramifications of nuclear energy. Diverse and cross-cutting interests were represented among the 56 countries which participated in INFCE: Nuclear weapon and non-weapon states; parties and non-parties to the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty; developed and developing countries; resource suppliers and consumers; technology holders and recipients; and countries from different political and economic groupings and all geographical regions. Given this diversity, it is a tribute to all participating countries that each of the reports of the eight working groups and the final report were adopted by consensus. This is notwithstanding that parts of the reports may be subject to differing interpretations. </para>
          <para>INFCE has performed two principal functions. Firstly, it has collected, collated and evaluated an enormous amount of data on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Much of this is not new, but never before has it been presented under one head. This material will be an invaluable reference point for governments. Secondly, INFCE has developed guidelines for consideration by governments in developing domestic and international nuclear policies. At the midterm plenary conference of INFCE in November 1978, Australia&#39;s representative, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox, Ambassador-At-Large with responsibilities for non-proliferation and safeguards, emphasised that while INFCE was not expected to produce final or comprehensive solutions to energy or non-proliferation problems, it had a responsibility to make recommendations on these matters. Within the limits imposed by a consensus procedure, I believe that INFCE has satisfactorily fulfilled this task. </para>
          <para>INFCE &#39;s eight working groups covered all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle from uranium supply and demand through enrichment, reprocessing and recycling of plutonium, fast breeder reactors, spent fuel management, waste management and disposal and advanced reactor concepts. Another working group dealt with assurance of nuclear supply. The full report of INFCE will be available to honourable members through the Parliamentary Library. In the meantime, I am presenting with this statement a limited summary of the principal conclusions of the study prepared by the Government for the convenience of honourable members. In my remarks today, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I believe that it would be useful if I drew attention to some of the major areas of INFCE &#39;s conclusions which are of importance to Australia. </para>
          <para>The Further Development of the Nuclear Industry </para>
          <para>Turning first to the further world-wide development of the nuclear industry, INFCE concluded that for countries outside the so-called centrally planned economies nuclear power can be expected to make an increased contribution to the world &#39;s energy needs over the next half century. INFCE &#39;s supply and demand comparisons, which assumed the exploitation of all presently known uranium resources, show that further sources of production, which will have to be supported by new discoveries, are likely to be needed before the end of the century. INFCE concluded that, provided that the necessary additional exploration and investment can be made, the industry is likely to be able to meet requirements up to the year 2000. These findings lend weight to the Government&#39;s decisions in 1977 to grant approval for the opening of new uranium deposits in Australia to help meet the needs of an energy deficient world. They underline the importance of encouraging continuing exploration and investment in the Australian uranium industry. </para>
          <para>Based on its long term uranium supply assessment, INFCE concluded that if nuclear capacity growth approaches INFCE &#39;s high projection uranium supply after the year 2000 might be inadequate and substantial deployment of improved thermal reactors and fast breeder reactors would be required to provide assured electricity supply. It is important that adequate supplies of uranium be available so that countries will have the widest possible choice among fuel cycle options. INFCE concluded that present enrichment capacity in operation or under construction will cover projected demand for enrichment services up until about 1990. To cover projected demand beyond then additional capacity would be required. INFCE recognised that countries with large indigenous uranium resources, such as Australia, had a substantial commercial incentive to develop national enrichment facilities. Fairly long lead times are involved for the establishment of new enrichment ventures and to this end the Government announced last year that it was proceeding to examine the feasibility of establishing a commercial uranium enrichment industry in Australia. The Minister for Trade and Resources <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> referred to these points in his statement in the House on 5 March when tabling the report of the Uranium Advisory Council on uranium enrichment. </para>
          <para>INFCE &#39;s findings on the interim storage of spent fuel and the disposal of waste are reassuring. The study concluded that, on the basis of the technologies evaluated, the radioactive wastes from any of the fuel cycles examined can be managed and disposed of with a high degree of safety and without undue risk to man or the environment. In relation to spent fuel management, INFCE concluded that whilst the amount of spent reactor fuel held in interim storage was likely to increase significantly- even with reprocessing- up to the end of the century, the technology for storage was established and expansion of existing capacity would not present undue difficulties. </para>
		  <para>Reprocessing</para>
        <para>I will now turn to the findings of INFCE on the reprocessing of spent fuel to recover the plutonium and unused uranium and the use of that plutonium. At the outset of INFCE, reprocessing and plutonium usage were regarded as the most controversial issues to be addressed. There were strong differences of opinion. Some believed that the economics and the proliferation risks were such that there should be no early move to use plutonium on a commercial scale. Others took the view that reprocessing was an essential element in the further development of their nuclear energy programs and in the growth of energy independence and one which demanded an early commitment. These opposing views were moderated by the INFCE discussions. INFCE has also put the risk of plutonium into perspective by discussing also the proliferation risk associated with uranium enrichment. </para>
        <para>INFCE identified a number of considerations basic to the reprocessing question. Firstly, as plutonium is an inevitable by-product of the operation of nuclear power plants, the fundamental question is its management. There are two choices: To leave the plutonium in stored spent fuel elements without resort to reprocessing; or to reprocess spent fuel and thereby to separate plutonium for recycling in existing thermal reactors or for use in fast breeder systems. </para>
        <para>Secondly, the use of plutonium obtained through the operation of nuclear power plants is not the easiest or most efficient route to acquire fissionable material for nuclear explosive purposes. Specially constructed facilities to produce highly enriched uranium or weapons grade plutonium are likely to be preferred on technical and economic grounds by any country contemplating production of an explosive device. Thirdly, as I have already indicated, INFCE &#39;s higher projections of the demand for nuclear energy suggest that uranium supply might not be sufficient to meet requirements after the year 2000. In these circumstances, reprocessing and recycling of plutonium would be essential. Fourthly, the economics and choice of particular fuel cycle strategies will vary from country to country. In deciding whether or not to pursue reprocessing, governments will take account of a range of factors, including proliferation risk, economics, energy security, resource utilisation and the environment. </para>
        <para>INFCE concluded that, in the event of reprocessing developments, the concern for the future would be to adopt the best technical safeguards and institutional measures to increase the protection of material against diversion to nonpeaceful uses. A number of countries have said that they intend to pursue the use of plutonium on a commercial scale. On the basis of experience with safeguards to date, INFCE found that materials accountancy, supplemented by limited containment and surveillance measures for existing operating reprocessing plants, was generally capable of providing effective international safeguards. It was unforeseen that the establishment of future large commercial reprocessing plants would require improved safeguarding techniques, but that there was sufficient time to develop these given that the commercial use of plutonium was still a decade or so away. A working group established by the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency is now studying safeguards for reprocessing facilities. </para>
        <para>On the question of institutional measures, INFCE recognised the importance of the establishment of arrangements which would place the storage of plutonium under an effective international regime. Such arrangements have been under detailed consideration for more than a year in an expert group working under the auspices of the IAEA. Australia is participating actively in this exercise and a related one on the international management of spent nuclear fuel. </para>
        <para>These conclusions of INFCE will bear closely on Australia&#39;s position on reprocessing. In his statements to this House in 1977 on the Government&#39;s nuclear safeguards policies, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> said that Australia had reserved its position on the reprocessing of spent fuel derived from Australian-origin uranium pending the outcome of INFCE and other international consultations. He said that the Government would require a provision in bilateral safeguards agreements that reprocessing of Australian-origin material could take place only with its prior consent. In my own statement on 24 August 1978, when I tabled the nuclear safeguards agreements concluded with Finland and the Philippines, I noted that the Government&#39;s position had never been one of rejecting out of hand the reprocessing of Australian-origin nuclear material. Prior consent clauses in safeguards agreements give Australia the right to agree on arrangements under which reprocessing of Australian-supplied material might take place. The Government would not consent to such reprocessing if the conditions and arrangements were not fully satisfactory in terms of our nuclear non-proliferation objectives. As honourable members will be aware, some of Australia&#39;s bilateral safeguards agreements commit us to negotiations after the conclusion of INFCE on the conditions under which the reprocessing of Australian-origin material might be permitted. Negotiations on new agreements now under way also need to address this issue. </para>
        <para>The Government has kept the question of reprocessing under review since 1977. We believe that, with the conclusion of INFCE, it is timely to advance our consideration of possible arrangements for the exercise of our prior consent rights, which could be applied if the Government were to decide that the eventual reprocessing of Australian-origin material were to be permitted. Final decisions in this regard would be taken only if the Government&#39;s nonproliferation objectives were fully satisfied. </para>
		<para>Non-Proliferation and Safeguards</para>
        <para>INFCE addressed many aspects of the nonproliferation question. INFCE was primarily concerned with the technical aspects of possible misuse of materials, facilities and technology in civil nuclear programs. It recognised, however, that a decision by a government to construct nuclear weapons was essentially a political one motivated by political and national security considerations and that international pressure was the principal deterrent. It was acknowledged that technical measures against proliferation were only relevant in the context of broader political and institutional arrangements. This underlines the need to pursue non-proliferation objectives on a broad front. Successive Australian governments have supported safeguards on the civil nuclear industry, applied through the IAEA in Vienna, and have advocated non-proliferation and nuclear arms control measures in the United Nations and other forums. </para>
        <para>INFCE concluded that no single judgment about the risk of diversion from the different fuel cycles could be made which was valid both now and for the future. It was considered more important and constructive to identify those points in the fuel cycles which are sensitive from the proliferation standpoint. On this basis, the study concentrated attention on technical measures against proliferation and on safeguards arrangements. INFCE did not identify significant problems with the safeguards methods applied by the IAEA to existing civil nuclear facilities, but saw further improvement of existing methods as necessary for meeting safeguards objectives in future large commercial enrichment and reprocessing facilities. </para>
        <para>Non-proliferation conditions attaching to the supply of nuclear materials, equipment and technology received particular attention in the discussions in Working Group 3 of INFCE which dealt with assurance of long-term supply. Australia was a co-chairman of this group, along with the Philippines and Switzerland. We sought and secured the co-chairmanship because we regarded Working Group 3 as the main vehicle in INFCE for pressing Australian concerns to strengthen the international non-proliferation regime and because of our interests as a major potential supplier of uranium and possibly of enrichment services. </para>
        <para>There is a close inter-relationship between the acceptance of stringent non-proliferation conditions in international nuclear trade and assurance of supply. Without appropriate nonproliferation measures, the climate of confidence necessary to sustain nuclear trade on a stable and secure basis will be lacking. An increased risk of proliferation will not only threaten political and strategic stability but also will undermine international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Conversely, improved assurance of nuclear supply could contribute to nonproliferation objectives, inter alia, by reducing the incentives for the spread of sensitive technology, and will be an important factor in an effective international non-proliferation regime. </para>
        <para>Nuclear importing states pressed the desirability of predictable application of nonproliferation conditions in nuclear trade. They drew attention to the potential for supply disruption caused by unilateral changes in these conditions. They also pointed to the uncertainties created by the application of differing nonproliferation conditions by individual supplier governments in bilateral agreements. </para>
        <para>To meet these concerns of consumer countries and the non-proliferation concerns of supplier countries, INFCE took up an Australian initiative and recommended several measures to facilitate this supply assurance/non-proliferation nexus: </para>
        <para>Firstly, the establishment of appropriate mechanisms for the updating of nonproliferation conditions in bilateral agreements; and </para>
        <para>Secondly, the development over time of common international approaches to the differing non-proliferation conditions applied by supplier states in bilateral agreements. These could be implemented through bilateral agreements and perhaps later through joint declarations, codes of conduct and other multilateral or international instruments. </para>
        <para>In short, INFCE acknowledged that an evolutionary approach, building on existing arrangements, would contribute to the maintenance of effective international non-proliferation arrangements in nuclear trade which could be implemented in a manner acceptable to both supplier and consumer countries. Australia is prepared to join actively in such efforts, but entirely without prejudice to the maintenance of the strict safeguards standards which we laid down in 1977. </para>
        <para class="block">The Post-INFCE Period </para>
        <para>INFCE has represented an important step forward in the international examination of nuclear issues. It has provided essential background against which future decisions can be taken, and it has pointed the way to new ground and to new initiatives. INFCE has built on bases already laid, for example, by the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty. Australia considers it essential that international efforts in the directions established by INFCE should be sustained in the years ahead if lasting results are to be achieved. </para>
        <para>Over the next few years, international efforts to promote an enhanced consensus on nuclear energy and non-proliferation issues are expected to continue. It will be essential that Australia take an active part to ensure that our nonproliferation and commercial interests are protected and advanced. In this regard, the Prime Minister emphasised in August 1977 that Australia&#39;s ability to influence non-proliferation developments will depend to a great extent on whether or not it is a major supplier of uranium. Only as a producer and supplier of uranium can Australia be an effective force in achieving improved international safeguards and controls. </para>
        <para>Australia&#39;s approach to non-proliferation issues post-INFCE will be based in the shortterm on seeking limited practical objectives. These will constitute building-blocks for the broader and longer-term objective of an enhanced international consensus. I have already mentioned the IAEA expert studies on international plutonium storage and the international management of spent fuel which hold out the prospect of workable and effective multilateral schemes to reduce proliferation risks. There is also the possibility of building gradually upon the work of INFCE Working Group 3 in the area of the non-proliferation conditions applying in international nuclear trade. </para>
        <para>One kind of institutional arrangement which could contribute to non-proliferation objectives and which has received greater attention internationally as a result of INFCE is the possibility of multinational participation in sensitive stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, particularly enrichment, reprocessing, and fast breeder reactors. Arrangements would need to be tailored to individual circumstances. Somewhat different approaches might be adopted for enrichment and reprocessing or even for the same stage of the fuel cycle. The multinational concept has direct implications for Australia. In January 1979, in announcing that it was proceeding to study the feasibility of establishing a commercial uranium enrichment industry here, the Government said that multination participation would be fully examined and in particular the potential advantages from the non-proliferation viewpoint. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, it will be clear that INFCE has brought together, in a single study, examination of a wide range of issues confronting governments and the nuclear industry. It has also brought together disparate points of view and encouraged a great appreciation of the different perspectives among participating countries. In carrying forward the work of INFCE, it will be important that a spirit of consensus continues to mark international nuclear discussions in order to avoid confrontation on north-south lines or between suppliers and consumers. The issues are of such magnitude and the eventual stakes so important that an appropriate balance must be struck among the manifold and competing interests involved.

            </talker>
            <para>- In reply to the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> I immediately advert to the fact that the summary was available in Vienna in January of this year and the preamble in that summary clearly indicated that the first plenary conference of the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation group was held in Vienna in November 1978. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The group decided that the International Atomic Energy Agency should be requested to publish the final reports. I say that because it is quite clear that the matter has been under consideration for some considerable time. It is on that note that the Opposition regards the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> as being inadequate in what we are about because the Government has been using the existence of INFCE as an excuse to delay discussion on many of the very important issues surrounding uranium and Australia&#39;s export of it. We have been told all the time to wait for the results of INFCE, that it would provide the basis of informed discussions. But we would say that the INFCE fig leaf as fallen. The Government still refuses to discuss the central issues as they affect Australia and Australian policy. </para>
          <para>The Minister&#39;s statement is very long on what INFCE has to say, but very short on what the Australian Government&#39;s policy is. A long summary of INFCE is not a substitute for discussion of Australian policy. </para>
          <para>Let me take one example. At the heart of the INFCE report is the assertion that without reprocessing there may be insufficient uranium in the post year 2000 period to service the Western world&#39;s energy requirements. There will not be enough uranium, according to the report if a once-through cycle strategy is adopted. The report argues that, if nuclear energy demands are to be met after the year 2000,. it will not be adequate to rely solely on enriched natural uranium. It will be necessary to reprocess the spent uranium fuel and to use it in thermal and fast breeder cycles. In other words, it is arguing that reprocessing is necessary and virtually inevitable. </para>
          <para>Reprocessing, of course, involves the extraction of plutonium from the spent reactor fuel and plutonium can be used to manufacture explosive nuclear devices. </para>
          <para>Let us have a look at what has been the policy of the United States of America in respect of these matters. It is for these very same reasons that the United States has attempted to encourage the use of once-through cycles only where the spent fuel is not reprocessed. As honourable members know, the United States has been anxious to talk about storage facilities on islands perhaps in the Pacific region. The United States did so for the reason that it felt there was a danger, not only in that aspect of storage, but also if reprocessing took place as to what was going to happen to two things-the plutonium thereby extracted and the safe disposal of the residual high level waste. It is for that same reason that one of the planks in the Government&#39;s socalled safeguards platform was to prohibit reprocessing without prior consent. </para>
          <para>How did the Australian Government react to this fundamental point in the INFCE report? Does the Government agree with INFCE? What did the Minister have to say about it in his statement? We were told at length the considerations that INFCE put forward as being relevant to the development of Australia&#39;s position on reprocessing. As far as the Australian Government&#39;s policy is concerned, we have been told no more on this matter than we learned from the statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> some three years ago. </para>
          <para>The Government must have a view. INFCE began in 1977 and we have been represented in the evaluation right throughout. The principal conclusions of the study can hardly have come as a surprise, a bolt from the blue. The final report, as we note, was published some months ago. </para>
          <para>The Minister pointed out that conditions under which reprocessing might be permitted will need to be addressed in what he described as negotiations on new agreements now under way&#39;. Presumably he meant the negotiations with Euratom and Japan. The Minister gave no assurance that these conditions would be publicly announced prior to their being negotiated. Does he intend to inform the Parliament as to the Government&#39;s policy, or will he wait to see how its position, whatever it might be, fares in negotiations with Euratom and Japan and then represent the lowest common denominator compromise reached through these negotiations as consistent with the Government&#39;s safeguards policy? We are just not going to be told what the Government thinks about these matters. What the Minister has said, or rather chosen not to say, is totally in accord with the Government&#39;s consistent policy of secrecy on nuclear matters. The Opposition put on record again in August last year that it was expressing its dissatisfaction over the Government&#39;s secrecy; over its previous refusal to table the model safeguards agreement. We had to read the details of the safeguards agreement in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Morning Herald,</inline></para>
          <para>There has been a continuing refusal to inform the Parliament as to what we are about. A month ago I saw appear on the list of Questions on Notice a question by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holding),</inline> a very relevant question, concerning INFCE. It is Question No. 5307 on the Notice Paper. It still has not been answered. It has been ignored. </para>
          <para>A fortnight ago in the Senate, the Government refused to disclose, even in the most general terms, the present state of the negotiations with Japan and Euratom on the present safeguards arrangements. The Government has many things to hide. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the INFCE report itself. The report by and large is a document written from the perspective of the uranium buyers and the nuclear establishment. Its approach throughout is to talk about assurance of uranium supply firstly and about nonproliferation as a secondary matter. I might point out that the Minister&#39;s Department has gone to the trouble of producing a summary of the INFCE report. The text of this Australian summary has been attached to the Minister&#39;s statement. We wonder why such an action was necessary because there was a perfectly good summary attached to the INFCE report itself. It is not too difficult to determine the reason if it is compared with the summary that INFCE made. It is impossible not to be struck by the bias in the INFCE summary towards the uranium consumer- the uranium buyer whose overriding concern is not safety but simply the supply of his energy needs. This bias leads to some startling conclusions. </para>
          <para>For example, we are told: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Working Group 3 asserted as a general principle that assurance of supply and assurance of non-proliferation are complementary. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There may be circumstances when they are, and the report refers to some, but to assert this as a general principle is absurd, as well as dangerous. On that general principle we would best prevent Pakistan from developing a bomb by signing it up with a long term contract. That is the logic of Working Group 3&#39;s general principle. In his statement the Minister was careful to say that improved assurance of supply could contribute to non-proliferation objectives. The example he gave, namely, that of assured supply reducing incentives for the spread of sensitive technology, is weak and highly challengeable. I am surprised that he used it. But even the Minister shrinks from endorsing the INFCE conclusion as a general principle. </para>
          <para>The Government purports to have established prior consent as one of the pillars of its safeguards policy. The Minister laboured this point in his speech. We might then expect him to have something to say to the Parliament about an INFCE proposal that is in direct contradiction to that policy. Prior consent is a subject which causes INFCE some general difficulty, not just in respect of transfers to Third World countries, but also in respect of reprocessing. The potential for, as INFCE sees it, the arbitrary exercise of prior consent causes it some concern. INFCE says that prior consent should be: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Exercised in a manner that is predictable and that conforms to any understanding that may have been reached between the parties when the right of prior consent was established. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This again raises the question which I raised earlier of the Government&#39;s reluctance to be open with its policy thinking. Does the Government propose to conform with the INFCE proposal on the question of prior consent? If it does, what are to be the policy guidelines? Is it to conform with understandings reached when the safeguards agreements were concluded? Are there any understandings that this Parliament has not been told about </para>
          <para>There are two other major issues arising from the INFCE that I would like to deal with. The first concerns the updating of non-proliferation undertakings. The Minister made much of this in his statement. He talked about INFCE having taken up an Australian initiative of updating non-proliferation conditions. What the Minister did not tell us, however, was rather more interesting. In this connection, Working Group 3 suggested: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Assurances of supply could be enhanced if the adoption of such mechanisms were to be complemented by guarantees regarding the continuity of supply during the re-negotiation process. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Stripped of its diplomatic tautology, this simply means that the withdrawal of supply is not to be used as a negotiating lever. This no doubt is fine from the viewpoint of the uranium buyer, but what it says about updating and improving safeguards is in effect that the buyer will be free to decide what updated non-proliferation measures he will accept. At the very least, assured supply will not encourage a positive attitude towards new and tougher safeguards on the part of the buyer. At worst and taken to its logical conclusion, it will mean that updated agreements are to be settled on the buyer&#39;s terms. The Government, of course, has not only chosen not to enlighten us on what its attitude is on this question, but has not even chosen to let us know what the question is. </para>
          <para>The other subject I wish to draw attention to is the question of institutional arrangements which might strengthen proliferation resistance to the fuel cycle. It is clear from the report that INFCE leans strongly towards multinational or international fuel cycle schemes. This is a most important issue and we would have hoped that at this stage the Government would have been able to express views on it that go beyond vague generalities, despite the complexities of the questions involved. From what the Minister said, it would appear that once more he is saying less than he could. Certainly the Government should explain precisely what it means by the generalisation it favours. For example, in what situation would arrangements need to be tailored to individual circumstances? What are the direct implications for Australia and how does the Government see them? Certainly, where any risk of diversion might seem possible by a country, its chances of effecting such a diversion might be considered to be diminished to the extent that it is linked with other countries and accountable to them for its performance of part of the cycle. On the other hand, from Australia&#39;s view, such arrangements should not be designed in any way which would diminish Australian control over its uranium. </para>
          <para>A principal problem in the Government&#39;s policy remains its willingness to lose control of its uranium at the earliest possible opportunity. As the Opposition has pointed out on numerous occasions, Australia is the only safe country in the world which abandons control of its uranium at the very beginning of the fuel cycle. In all other countries, the governments maintain control throughout the cycle. They control the cycle at every stage, whether it be the enrichment stage, fuel processing or reprocessing. </para>
          <para>But the Australian Government&#39;s only interest is in selling yellowcake. It shows no interest at all in controlling the rest of the cycle. Its principal motivation has always been commercial. There is therefore some irony in the fact that the production of uranium in Australians getting under way now against a background of weak markets, as the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> said as recently as 17 March. The weak state of the uranium market makes a mockery of the Minister&#39;s statement that INFCE energy forecasts lend weight to the Government&#39;s decisions to approve the opening up of new uranium deposits. In casting around for justification of its bad decisions, the Government has had to resort to INFCE when the real test is in the market place. And in the market place, the Government is failing. </para>
          <para>But safeguards are only one aspect of the problem. Safeguards alone represent very little. They have significance only as part of a wider scheme of things which must include control of the fuel cycle, safety and resolution of the problem which apparently INFCE thinks has been solved but which the Opposition and the Labor Party certainly do not- and that major problem is waste disposal. It is right to look to future possible multilateral rather than bilateral arrangements as providing potentially a more secure framework to minimise non-proliferation risks. But even such arrangements in themselves would be inadequate without also resolving the outstanding problems of control, safety and waste disposal. And in looking towards multilateral arrangements or common approaches, we should not assume that they will of necessity provide a better framework. </para>
          <para>In this respect, INFCE provides an important lesson. We should not allow the uranium consumer and the nuclear establishment to set the terms. We should not be slaves to consensus if it means weakening rather than strengthening controls. Australia is a major uranium producer. It is uniquely placed to exert an influence that consumers should not be able to ignore. To judge by INFCE however, this Government lacks the necessary political will. It adopts a policy of ready compromise so that nothing will stand in the way of commercial sales. Its approach is secretive indeed. The Government&#39;s reticence over negotiations with Japan and Euratom probably derives from its safeguards <inline font-style="italic">policy.(Extension of time granted).</inline> I was making the point that the Government&#39;s reticence means that its safeguards policy could be running into serious trouble. The Japanese will be most unlikely to accept conditions from Australia that are more onerous than those they have accepted from European countries. What this all points to is the fact that the Government&#39;s short-sighted commercialism is not only dangerous and has been pursued despite the risks involved for ourselves and for future generations in the absence of proper guarantees of safety, waste disposal and non-proliferation but also it will simply prove incompatible with even the maintenance of a pretence of concern for anything but commercial gain. </para>
          <para>Let me advert to what has been said. In the statement it was foreseen that the establishment of future large commercial reprocessing plants would require improved safeguarding techniques. But if a country is going into the cyclethe Labor Party has definite reservations about that because improved technology has yet to be developed- if a country is in the process of what this Government is about, it becomes very clear indeed that it will have to talk about international control in the enrichment process, in the reprocessing process, in the safeguarding of plutonium and in the safeguarding of the waste. That has to be done. Yet here we have a government that just sells the yellowcake to somebody, some person. But in all those processes I have just mentioned, some other government has some control. Does this not prove the lack of logic in the Government&#39;s policy- that we lose control of this fuel on the first sale; somebody else gets it? It is no good talking about a piece of paper that shows that we have some control over the safeguards. If it has gone into a fuel cycle, then as INFCE implies it virtually will be subject to international control. We should own and control the fuel all the time. That is the first thing. </para>
          <para>The Opposition&#39;s point of view is: Why should we be getting into this area of technology which INFCE blithely says has been solved? In France, I looked at the reprocessing and waste disposal position. The waste disposal technique of vitrification by the French is certainly not accepted by the Americans. We have to look only to Professor Ringwood &#39;s test of the glass vitrification process. He shows that the glass would break down if the uranium waste were put in the ground in glass and certainly if it were put near salt. He has proved that. That is the very reason why the United States has never wanted to encourage reprocessing. For example, plutonium could be taken out of the reprocess fuel, but one is still left with the high level waste disposal problem. How can this problem be solved? In our view, storing it on a Pacific island is not the way to solve it either. </para>
          <para>The point the Opposition is about is that if we start to talk about this fuel, we have to talk about proliferation and a great risk of nuclear destruction of the world. Certainly we have to talk about international control at present. But we say to the Government: Do not abandon the Australian people merely for a hole in the ground for a few paltry dollars when the Government could be using its own technology and techniques which might improve some of the advances alleged to have been made already. Our scientists at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission have ideas about different methods of enrichment. There are different points of view on Ringwood &#39;s view on waste disposal. It would be far better for the Government to be putting its resources behind these technologies because then we could perhaps lead the world in areas where it certainly needs help. </para>
          <para>It is of no advantage to be told that we are concluding agreements with Finland and the Philippines. Let me make it very clear: The Philippines has a lot of problems, not the least of which is political instability. Why in the name of fortune would we be encouraging the Filipinos to have a nuclear reactor? It boggles the mind. Looking at this issue of nuclear technology, a nuclear reactor, such as Japan has, has to be closed down for at least three or four months of the year for what is called maintenance and the reservicing of the fuel. If the Government gives an underdeveloped country such as the Philippines one reactor it must at least give it two because there has to be a backup when the first one is closed down. There is serious unrest in the Philippines. If we look at a recent statement by a Catholic bishop we see that he feels that there could be a revolution in the country because of this suggestion that the new economic order will use energy and industrial complexes to get the poor out of the villages to put them into factories to earn a dollar a day. They would not be happy in this situation. It is contrary to social justice. It would lower their dignity. It would deprive them of what they should be about. </para>
          <para>It would be far better for us, from the point of view of helping the Philippines, to be talking about intelligent aid. A number of our scientists do this. If honourable members go to the Philippines and have a look at the aid that is givenparticularly by the engineers of the SnowyMountains Engineering Corporation- building roads and irrigation projects, they would see marvellous results which are the best in the world. But to sell the Philippines a reactor is to create enormous problems, and the Minister must agree. We cannot entrust the fuel cycle to somebody who might not have any of the principles we hold. I am not talking about the present, I am talking about the future. The same would apply in respect of Zia in Pakistan. We cannot entrust fuel to these sorts of people. If the Government does not have integrity and some understanding of political stability it is heading for disaster. </para>
          <para>One of the best results would be to improve the standard of life of people in other countries. This can be done by agro-economics. We should be improving the fuel cycle or the rice strain at village level. In the Philippines the International Rice Research Institute, which is led by Australians, is producing a rice which grows on a 110-day cycle. This gives the village people a doubling or a tripling of their income. It is far better to leave the people where they can grow food and improve their standard of living. We should not be rushing around talking to some self-appointed dictator or a progressive madam and selling reactors to them. To suggest that we will receive good money for the fuel is nonsense. </para>
          <para>In the Association of South East Asian Nations group, and South Korea, we have to predict that within the next seven years every country will have a change of leader, either by natural causes or otherwise. We should not get too involved in this issue until we develop our own technologymost importantly, if and when we do own and control that fuel throughout the whole cycle. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave- The House will recall that in agreement with the States the Government established a national committee of inquiry into housing costs in 1977. The committee, chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ernest</inline> Eyers, presented its report in September 1978. The recommendations of the inquiry have been the subject of extensive study and debate by governments and industry since that date and have already had a significant impact. Today I want to outline to the House the action the Commonwealth has taken in its own areas of responsibility in response to that inquiry. As the vast majority of the inquiry&#39;s recommendations relate to the responsibilities of the States I will also outline action taken by the Commonwealth to assist and encourage State initiatives. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The single most important contribution the Commonwealth can make to stabilising housing costs and ensuring access to home ownership is to maintain an economic climate which minimises inflation, maintains the incentive to invest and ensures the availability of housing finance. It must be recognised that increases in housing costs and prices have moderated significantly since the early 1970s as a direct result of this Government&#39;s policies. From 1973-74 to 1974-75 new house prices went up 25 per cent as measured by the consumer price index- CPI; from 1977-78 to 1978-79 the increase was 4.2 per cent. Prices of established houses have actually fallen in real terms in all capitals other than Sydney, as measured by recent Real Estate Institute survey data. First mortgage finance from banks and building societies is readily available to credit-worthy borrowers in most areas of Australia. The volume of lending in fact rose by 16.1 per cent in 1979. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has acted positively in taking steps to follow through recommendations of the committee of inquiry. It is acting to stimulate new building techniques to reduce costs. The </para>
          <para class="block">Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act will be extended <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> that grants can be given for research and development in building and construction techniques as well as building materials, products and fittings. As from July 1980, approved projects will be eligible to have up to half of their costs met by grants up to a limit of $500,000 per company per year. It is not enough just to stimulate new techniques and materials. Their application can be hampered by difficulty in getting approvals from local governments. To help overcome this problem the Commonwealth will strengthen its support for the Australian Building Systems Appraisal CouncilABSAC which carries out technical assessments of new products. High level technical support will be provided to ABSAC by the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction and also by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Company expenditures on tests carried out at ABSAC &#39;s request will become eligible for grant assistance under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act. These actions should establish ABSAC as the national appraisal centre for new building technologies. Together with the amendments to the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act they will both encourage innovations and speed their acceptance by local and semi-government authorities, banks and insurance companies. </para>
          <para>The Government agrees with the inquiry that stability in the building industry is important to keep housing costs down. This stability requires a steady flow of housing finance. We have asked the committee of inquiry into the Australian financial system to consider whether any institutional reforms or other special measures in addition to policies already being pursued are necessary to maintain a stable flow of housing finance. To improve efficiency in the production of land and housing and the use of existing housing stock careful consideration is being given to the best means for upgrading research and statistics available to the industry. The timeliness and availability of some statistics are already being improved. The Department of Housing and Construction and the Australian Bureau of Statistics are continuing to work for further improvements in this area and will report to Cabinet. </para>
          <para>Finally, so far as purely Commonwealth action is concerned, the Department of Housing and Construction will seek opportunities in its own housing construction activities to pursue low cost alternatives in engineering standards, residential design and the provision of services such as electricity. The objective is to provide well researched examples of new and cheaper techniques that can be applied by industry and the relevant State and local government authorities. As was indicated in the report, State and local governments have a very substantial responsibility in efforts to contain or reduce housing costs. State and local governments therefore have the critical role in following up the inquiry&#39;s recommendations. However, the Commonwealth will actively assist and encourage them to take action to reduce housing costs. The Commonwealth Government is funding housing costs research through existing programs. It is cooperating with the States in existing ministerial forums such as the Local Government Ministers&#39; Conference to encourage complementary action by all States, and, in particular, it has established a new, special purpose Ministerial Council on housing costs. </para>
          <para>The inquiry recommended that the States and Commonwealth sponsor projects to examine alternative planning and engineering standards. Under the national water resources program the Commonwealth will assist the States to fund studies designed to reduce the cost of financing, supplying and maintaining water services including sewerage. An amount of $248,000 will be provided by the Commonwealth for the research in 1979-80 alone. The studies deal with matters such as alternative wastewater collection and treatment systems and will be carried out in New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria. The studies will cost more than $l.lm in total, over the next three years. Existing Commonwealth-State ministerial forums have also been used to pursue the inquiry&#39;s recommendations. The Commonwealth has provided secretariat and technical support for a comprehensive review of the mechanisms for coordinating building regulations among the States and Territories. The resulting report will be considered initially by the Local Government Ministers Conference to be held next month. The report has made recommendations which should lead to more uniform building regulations, a greater sensitivity to the costs imposed by regulations and a speedier adaptation of building codes to accept new technologies. These steps will improve the efficiency of the industry and thereby lower costs. </para>
          <para>Another example of the use of existing Commonwealth-State forums is action by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> to have the Australian Transport Advisory Council study the development of uniform legislation for the movement of prefabricated houses throughout </para>
          <para class="block">Australia. This could have important implications for rural housing costs as well as for the manufactured housing industry. </para>
          <para>Because the inquiry&#39;s recommendations overlap a number of ministerial portfolios at State and Commonwealth levels, it became clear that existing arrangements for Commonwealth-State co-operation were not really adequate to follow up the report. For this reason the Commonwealth took steps to establish a special intergovernmental council. The first meeting of the Ministerial Council on Housing Costs was held just two weeks ago. At that meeting the States outlined the considerable progress that they had already made in implementing measures to reduce costs, but agreed that there was more to be done. The Council agreed on a work program. It will investigate a common code for residential subdivision engineering standards; assess the scope for reducing the costs of buying and selling a home, including stamp duties, registration costs and fees charged by lawyers, real estate agents and financial institutions; examine the controls over urban redevelopment, infill the rehabilitation; consider the need to draft uniform construction and park development codes for mobile homes; and work to improve statistical information on housing markets. These are highly practical issues basic to efforts to reduce housing costs. The Commonwealth is providing technical and research support to the Council, which will meet again in June to discuss progress. </para>
          <para>This statement has briefly outlined the wide range of detailed actions that have flowed from the report of the national housing costs inquiry. It must be emphasised that these actions are continuing. It is recognised that the job is not finished. At all levels of government further steps can and should be taken. I intend to keep honourable members informed from time to time of progress being made by governments at all levels in containing and reducing housing costs. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>-The empty statement we have just heard from the Minister for Housing and Construction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Groom)</inline> is one of the most disappointing and disturbing statements ever given by a Federal Minister for Housing. I am mystified why the Minister&#39;s advisers would allow him to present this empty and hollow proposal to the House today. From the Minister&#39;s statement it is difficult to believe that he has even read the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Housing Costs, which was released some 20 months ago. It is just not a fact that it was presented only recently. I repeat that it has been in the hands of the Government for 20 months. The Minister&#39;s statement shows that he has not clearly understood the main thrust of even the Committee &#39;s argument. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister outlined several responses which, though belated, are welcome, in relation to low cost housing design and experimental materials; but even these showed no concern for energy efficiency in building design and material. We know that not only our country but the world generally is going through at least a liquid fuel energy crisis. People reside in their homes for a great deal of the 24 hours of the day, but in this report there is not the slightest mention of design for energy efficiency. When will the Government produce its so-called energy policy? When will it deal with one of the most important aspects, energy efficiency in building materials and in the construction of building a home. </para>
          <para>Nor did the Minister admit that although the price index for material used in home building rose by 5.9 per cent in 1978-79, it rose by 13 per cent from January 1979 to January 1980. Apart from that, the Government has merely indicated that in the future it will refer some of the matters discussed in the report to other committees and working groups. The Minister has given no assurances that effective action will be taken to reduce or even slow down the rate of housing cost increases. </para>
          <para>Let me remind the House of the first major finding of the Committee of Inquiry. Since the Minister does not understand, and has had very little to do with the report, I refer him to page 3 thereof. Paragraph 1 states:   . . quite serious difficulties have been and are being experienced by people, particularly first home buyers, seeking to purchase or rent housing. It is clear that would-be purchasers of dwellings now find it necessary to save longer to cover deposits and transaction costs and must thereafter devote larger proportions of their disposable incomes to housing debt service than did their counterparts ten years ago. </para>
          <para class="block">I do not want to ridicule either the Minister or the Government but that statement was made not by me as an Opposition spokesman but by a committee of inquiry set up by the Government into the cost of housing, one that reported 20 months ago. That was its first finding. I ask the Minister to study it. Under the housing policies of this Government, the situation has continually grown worse. Ten years ago nine out of ten people could afford to buy their own homes. Today, only one out of ten people can do so. I believe that the situation will get worse because, next to unemployment, housing is the most serious social problem in this country. This Government has failed to deal with and to meet the really serious problems presented by the housing crisis, which is growing in this country, particularly in the lower price sector. Later I will give figures to prove that as many as 80 per cent of single income earners are unable to purchase a home. The Committee&#39;s report went on to explain the reasons for the effects of this situation:   in the absence of initiatives by government, the difficulties facing prospective home buyers and renters are likely to continue. In fact, a continuation of the prevailing economic situation is likely to see a widening of the gap between the cost of housing and its  affordability. </para>
          <para class="block">That is a further statement by this Government appointed Committee damning the Government&#39;s policies. It was placed on record 20 months ago, yet no action has been taken by this Government concerning it. If time allows I will give the facts and details how this Government is withdrawing from the housing market, how it is withdrawing from both the private and public sectors. In Sydney the median price of established houses is about $62,000 and, at the bottom end of the range, the market price for a new house and land package in the outer western suburbs of Sydney is $42,000. </para>
          <para>I live 1 5 miles from the Sydney General Post Office. Sydney stretches for something like 35 miles west and 35 miles south-west of that point. Today that is where the population growth is occurring and where most of the housing development is taking place. When one gets 20 or 25 miles out of Sydney- say, Blacktown which is over 20 miles from the city centre- one has to travel two or three miles to get to a block of land. The frequency and cost of transport is a serious social problem. People are being forced into these areas to seek housing. People cannot get a grant under the Home Savings Grants Scheme if they are paying $42,000 for a block of land and dwelling because the Government Scheme cuts out at $40,000. People on a single income below $15,000 a year- that is equal to 125 per cent of average weekly earnings- cannot afford to buy a home today. Something like 80 per cent of single income earners in this country are disqualified from owning their own home. It takes the average income earner more than 10 years to save the required deposit to be eligible to obtain a $30,000 loan to buy the cheapest available home in the metropolitan area of Sydney. </para>
          <para>Housing prices in Sydney have been rising on average at the rate of $1,000 a month. More and more people are seeing their chances of owning a home fading day by day. The only program that the Government has available to help this situation is the Home Savings Grants Scheme. I challenge any Government member or supporter in any Liberal seat in metropolitan Sydney to say that he can get land and a dwelling for less than $40,000 in order that one of his constituents can buy a home. This is not possible because the Home Savings Grants Scheme phases out at $40,000. </para>
          <para>These problems are not confined to Sydney, as the Minister for Housing and Construction would have us believe. The average cost per square metre for a contract built house in Sydney rose from $186 in 1976-77 to $231 in June 1979. That means that the construction costs for a 12- square home have risen from $25, 100 to $3 1 ,200 in two years. In Melbourne the contruction costs of a 12-square home rose from $27,000 to $30, 100 over the same two-year period. In Perth a 12-square home that could be built for $25,600 in 1977 now costs over $27,000 to build. What is the reason for the increases in building costs? The Master Builders Association of Victoria made a statement in its journal of 14 February 1 980. This is what that Association had to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Unless there is a sustained rise in building activity so that manufacturers can increase their production volumes, building materials can be expected to rise at an even higher rate in 1980. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister said that the Government was concerned to stabilise housing costs by maintaining an economic climate which minimises inflation. But inflation is now back into double digit figures. Interest rates are rising. A rise of one-half per cent in interest rates from 1 1 per cent to 1 1 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent on a 25-year loan of $30,000 means a rise of $ 1 1 a month in repayments. In other words, the repayments will be increased from $294 a month to $305 a month. That one-half per cent increase means that the total repayments over 25 years rise from $88,210 to $91,482; a rise in the home buyer&#39;s debt of $3,270. If interest rates increased by 1 per cent this would mean an increase in repayments of $6,000 to $6,500. </para>
          <para>I seek the leave of the House to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table setting out the monthly repayments on loans of $20,000, $25,000 and $30,000 repaid over a 25-year period with interest rates ranging from 5.5 per cent- which we used to get in the good old days- to 12.5 per cent, which rate will be reached pretty soon under this Government. </para>

              <para>-I thank the House. Surely this Government cannot claim that its policies have brought stability to the home building industry. Loan approvals to individuals for housing across Australia fell in December 1979 to the lowest level for two years. Building approvals fell in December 1979 to a low of 9,989. The house building price index rose to its highest level in six years. New dwelling commencements in 1978-79 numbered 119,000. The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry estimated that without inflationary pressures it could build at least 135,000 dwellings a year. In a period of unemployment with many people waiting for homes, we find that new dwelling commencements are 12 per cent below the level that is needed. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In the December quarter of 1979 new dwelling commencements fell by 2,000 below the September quarter level. There is no stability shown by these figures. Rather they indicate unevenness, uneasiness and insecurity in the building industry. The Minister has given no indication that the Government intends to find out what people need in the different regions across Australia in terms of quality and quantity of housing. If the Government intends to investigate these matters and do something about the situation it should do so. </para>
          <para>This Government is withdrawing from both the private sector and the public sector of the housing industry. The amount of money that the Government makes available in the public sector for housing in Australia has fallen from 3.9 per cent of Budget expenditure to 1.1 per cent this year. Next year the amount will be even lower. The only policy that this Government has in the private sector is its Home Savings Grants scheme. In the cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Darwin it is extremely rare to be able to purchase a new or old home for less than $40,000. If it is this Government&#39;s policy to withdraw more and more from the public sector of the housing industry and leave it to the private sector there will be an enormous crisis in this country. There are at least 100,000 persons homeless now. There are at least 250,000 people living in temporary housing accommodation and there are over 70,000 families on housing commission waiting lists. The Minister and the Government stand condemned for net acting On the report made by a Government committee. </para>

          <para>-by leave-On 22 November 1979, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence tabled its report Australian Defence Procurement&#39;. In the course of the investigations of the Sub-committee on Defence Matters allegations were made to the Sub-committee that there had been intimidation by the Department of Defence of a prospective witness and a witness. The nature of the allegations was the subject of a separate hearing of the Sub-committee on Defence Matters. Subsequently, the Department of Defence was given an opportunity for those of its officers involved to reply to these allegations. The replies were forwarded by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> on 19 November 1979. The Sub-committee received conflicting views on whether intimidation of the prospective witness and the witness actually took place. It understands the apprehension of those public servants in regard to what they believe to have been intimidation. But it also appreciates the sensitivity of the Department of Defence to unfortunate Press publicity arising out of submissions placed before the Subcommittee. On the evidence available the Subcommittee cannot establish that such intimidation took place in relation to the Sub-committee&#39;s investigations. Therefore, the Committee and the Sub-committee believe that further pursuit of the matter is unlikely to lead to a definite conclusion. The Committee and the Sub-committee consider that it is essential that parliamentary committees should, at all times, have full access to all relevant evidence and that witnesses should have free access to committees to give evidence. However, this must be done within the accepted rules relating to the disclosure of classified or other restricted information. </para>

          <para>-by leave-The matters on which the honourable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter)</inline> has just reported are matters which are of some concern to me and of some concern to members of the Joint Committee on </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Foreign Affairs and Defence. One of the witnesses based most of his claims of intimidation on matters which were not before the Committee and which has risen some considerable time before the Committee even considered the subject matter from which his complaints arose. That witness and another witness, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Berthelsen,</inline> both were, and are, of the very strong opinion that they were intimidated and are being discriminated against in matters relating to their employment because of activities which they undertook before a parliamentary committee. The truth or otherwise of these matters is not for me to establish and it is not possible for me to establish. </para>
        <para>Certain factors, however, cannot be ignored by this Parliament if, in fact, parliamentary committees are to continue to have any form of effective inquiry capacity in areas of sensitivity where government and the Public Service is concerned. My understanding is- a statement was made before the Committee- that the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Berthelsen</inline> whose case, I think, is the prime one at least, in relation to the allegation of intimidation was derived from public sources. On the day following the giving of that evidence he was asked to sign security documents which he had previously signed. That cannot be taken as evidence of intimidation nor would it be possible for someone to establish a case on that basis. It is also a strange coincidence. But, subsequent to that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Berthelsen</inline> has been subjected to a number of activities which may or may not derive from his appearance before the committee. These activities do threaten his future employment as an officer of the Auditor-General&#39;s Department which reports directly to this Parliament and which, as a consequence, threaten the ability of committees of this Parliament to conduct inquiries where evidence of public servants which may be contrary to the views of more senior members of the Public Service is required. </para>
        <para>It is a matter of some seriousness and a matter which has not been resolved by this Committee because it was not possible- nor- and I say this advisedly- was there substantive evidence able to be produced that intimidation took place. There was, surrounding this matter, considerable newspaper publicity, the responsibility for which may rest with any of the parties involved. At least one allegation contained a matter of certain written documentation between an officer of one department and the head of another department. My understanding is that currently, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Berthelsen</inline> is on the transfer list or on a request for transfer list from his Department. There are difficulties in governments dealing with what it would see as persons who are unreliable in sensitive areas. I acknowledge this. But the Parliament also has the problem of determining whether it can protect those people who come before its committees and who give honest information which embarrasses persons who have total control over their future promotions and careers. It is a matter which I raise now because I think it is of real consequence to the future operation and capacities of parliamentary committees. This case has been closed, as I would see it, unsatisfactorily because it was impossible to reach a satisfactory resolution of it. It has not been to the Parliament&#39;s benefit that that has happened. </para>

          <para>- by leave- When this matter was brought to my attention I, of course, investigated it. I was satisfied with the response that I got from the officers of the Department of Defence that no intimidation had occurred. Now the  Chairman  of the Sub-committee on Defence Matters has reported to the House that the Subcommittee has been unable to find any evidence to substantiate the allegation. The person who made the charge has the whole of the onus on him to discharge. He cannot say: &#39;I make a charge and it is up to you to disprove it&#39;. But this is not the occasion for dilating on the way parliamentary committees work. I hold very, very strong views as to the totally unsatisfactory way in which some parliamentary committees conduct their business. I think it is high time, if these committees are to proliferate and be active, that they take into consideration the means whereby those people who appear before them are adequately protected. I await the opportunity, when the report of my friend from Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter)</inline> is being discussed, to expand on that. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think that parliamentary committees which are involved in wide-ranging examinations and discussions should have attached to them a parliamentary counsel to examine and to crossexamine witnesses. I think that when records of some people who appear before parliamentary committees are revealed to the House honourable members will be astonished to think that they have been able to secure for themselves thoroughly unmerited reputations- before the Committee for a start and in the public arena. This is a very grave matter. I have always held to the view that it is the authority of this Parliament that counts and not a committee outside. I am no admirer of the congressional system of government. That is the way in which I have been brought up. I admire the Westminster system of government, not the congressional system of government. I fear that both sides of this House are seeking to commingle the two. If the establishment of a committee system is desired, I implore those honourable members of goodwill to try to find ways and means of protecting those who appear before the committees and to protect also the reputation of the Parliament. </para>

            <para>- Yes, in the interpretation by the honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Shipton)</inline> of the remarks that I have made. The honourable member said that in saying the matter had been unsatisfactorily resolved I had indicated some dissatisfaction with the report. The fact is that something can be unsatisfactorily resolved without there being a capability of satisfactorily resolving the situation. I also point out that satisfaction as expressed by the honourable member for Higgins in respect of evidence coming before committees is, I think, limited to evidence from those people who are agreeing with and appearing with Government support. There is a quite different situation where a public servant seeks to give a contrary point of view. </para>

            <para>-On 19 February a statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> included a considerable announcement relating to defence matters. The Parliament has not at this stage had the benefit of an expansion of that statement, but one part of the statement is now a matter which this House and the nation must be seriously concerned about, and that is a very brief reference in that statement to an expanding role of cooperation with United States forces using facilities in Australia. It should be made quite clear that the Opposition, both in its Federal platform and in all statements which have been made in this House, supports the continuing co-operation with the United States under the ANZUS Treaty. We also have not questioned the use of Australian facilities by United States defence personnel. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I make those statements quite clear and concise at the start of these remarks because I think it is extremely unfortunate that debates on matters which are relevant to Australia and Australia&#39;s role in decision-making processes tend to be conducted on the basis of slogans and of what is best for next week&#39;s elections. We should at least on some occasions in this House be prepared to consider the decisions that Australia makes on the basis of what is best for Australia&#39;s standing in the world and what is best for Australia as a nation. Clearly we are committed to co-operation with the United States in respect of defence matters and we generally agree with the United States on matters of foreign policy. We are an independent nation, therefore we have to be in a position on occasions so that we can disagree. There are some notable instances of such disagreements in the past. </para>
          <para>This discussion of a matter of public importance comes forward as a result of suggestions and answers which were made in this House by the Prime Minister yesterday and statements which he has made outside this House and, more importantly, the failure of the Government to make any clear statement of the offers or the intentions of the Government in respect of Australian sovereignty and the development of defence co-operation and to what extent that will take place. It is fairly clear that during discussions in the United States earlier this year the Prime Minister without prior consultation with other Ministers of his Government, especially the responsible Ministers, made offers of assistance to and sought offers from the United States which were not mere extensions of the existing Australian policy but were in fact completely different policy initiatives which would place Australia&#39;s position as an independent nation in a quite different context from that which it currently occupies. Certainly there is a difference- a vast difference between co-operation in the use of defence facilities by another nation and the establishment of a defence facility for garrisoning troops on Australian soil. That is what home basing means and that is what we are currently talking about. We are talking about a decision taken almost over coffee by the Prime Minister to turn Perth into a nuclear target without any form of defence of or consideration for the population of that city. It would be a first strike nuclear target. </para>
          <para>If Cockburn Sound were capable of expansion and money were available for that expansion to turn it into a major nuclear vessel base for the United States with home base facilities, we would reach a situation in which nuclear weapons would in fact be stored on Australian soil, which is contrary to the existing understood policy of both parties in this Parliament, because there cannot be nuclear carrying vessels home ported without facilities to store the weapons when the vessels are under repair or when they are in port. So nuclear weapons would in fact at that stage be stationed on Australian soil. We would be a home base for major strike units of the United States fleet. In that context we would certainly be targeted as a prime nuclear target. It may be arguable that North West Cape or Pine Gap is not necessarily a prime nuclear target. But a major naval installation with operational nuclear weapons certainly would be. </para>
          <para>We are not in a position to know what the Government has offered because I doubt that the Prime Minister himself knows and based on the only reports available to the Australian community as to what took place at the ANZUS meetings in Washington neither do any of the Ministers who were present. It appears that the United States assumptions were different from those which are now said to be the responses of the Australian Government. Did we in fact make an offer through the Prime Minister as a nation to be part of an international commando force to go with armed forces into trouble spots wherever required and most likely without any consultation with the Australian Government? The Cuba of the West! Did we make that offer? The Government has now denied that it made the offer. We do not know what the Prime Minister actually said in consultation. Have we asked the United States to meet the cost of building up Cockburn Sound to a size and capacity which would accommodate major United States naval fleet units? Technical advice given to the United States Senate Foreign Affairs Committee last year indicated that Cockburn Sound met very few of the requirements of the United States for the basing of vessels. There has been constant pressure from Australia for the use of that base. We must have a suspicion at least that that pressure is applied not because we want the United States to use the base but because we want the United States to pay for the expansion of the base to make it usable by Australian forces. </para>
          <para>We should remember the record of the Government. Three days before the 1 977 State election in Western Australia it was stated that two destroyers and two submarines of the Royal Australian Navy would be based at Cockburn Sound, thus making it a permanent operative home naval base facility. By a mere coincidence, four days before the 1980 State election in Western Australia the Prime Minister announced that the Government had taken a decision to home-base vessels- he did not specify the number on this occasion- at Cockburn Sound. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and I think I would be less than proud to win elections if I had to tell lies to do so. The facts are that the 1977 announcement was made without any prior planning of what the Government intended to do. It was like many defence announcements- a set of words without any follow-up or practical consideration. Now to all intents and purposes we are offering to hand over to the United States a major defence installation in Australia. The United States is an ally but its foreign policy does not always coincide with ours. I know it is nice to run the slogans that it always does, but some honourable members, including the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen),</inline> will remember that in 1963 this country was on the verge of being prepared to go to war over Indonesian claims to the territory of Dutch New Guinea. We were opposing those claims to the extent that we even bought the Fills, but the United States announced that because of pressures and requirements in other places in the world Indonesia could have West Irian. It was not a decision favoured by Australia and certainly it was not a decision which we would have supported publicly. It was not a decision which even now could be said to be a correct one. </para>

          <para>Recently in an interview on a radio program the Prime Minister equivocated when asked whether Australia had offered base facilities at Cockburn Sound to the United States. He also expanded his answer considerably. In answering a question the Prime Minister said that the offer had not been rejected or withdrawn. He also made this rather wide statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We had offered the use of facilities across a wide range of fronts and the Americans are examining what they want to pick up. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I would like to hear the Prime Minister set out in this House exactly what limits there are on the endangering of Australian centres of population by turning them into prime nuclear targets as a result of the establishment of military facilities. Let us remember that a nuclear strike against a target in Australia would be given a considerably lower priority for an American response than a target in the United States would. A nuclear strike against Perth would not be regarded as a direct strike against the United States and the response would probably be against a Soviet target outside the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. So at the moment Perth is a first strike target but would not have a first retaliation rating. I am sure that the Government does not intend to commit any funds to protect the population of Perth. The serious question is where Australia will stand if we take the decision to provide military bases on Australian soil for the Americans to operate from. </para>

              <para>-I think we would be kneeling in the free world; that is exactly the status we would deserve. A good ally can also be one which stands on its own feet. I do not think the honourable member for St George would understand that. There is no need for a nation such as Australia to crawl and for its Prime Minister to sit up and beg like a canine friend wanting a pat. The facts are that our independence and our right to make decisions on the commitments we will make internationally and otherwise have to be important to us. When we wish to make independent decisions in the interests of the Australian people or of Australia as a whole, we must be capable of making those decisions. They cannot be made if we are seen by the world as a dependant rather than as an ally. Certainly the Prime Minister&#39;s position in the Lancaster House talks on Rhodesia could not have been what it was had we not been seen to be an independent nation expressing our own views rather than a nation under suspicion of extending other people&#39;s views. </para>

          <para>There are serious doubts about the integrity of the policies which are being put forward by this Government as having real meaning and consequence for Australia. The facts which must emerge and which Australians must consider are that the Government talks a lot about defence, does little and is prepared to sacrifice significant Australian sovereignty if in return it can find someone else to pay the price that it is not prepared to meet for defence facilities which it would like to have but which do not hold enough priority for it to invest money in. Unless the Americans build a facility at Cockburn Sound before 1983, the Government will then make the same offer to base United States destroyers or other vessels in that area as it is making today. </para>

I think it is unfortunate that too much consideration is given in this House to electoral effect and that not enough is given to the importance of Australia&#39;s standing. We have witnessed the Prime Minister crying crocodile tears and heard him say much about bilateral arrangements. We have never seen him offer basic information to the Opposition. Now we have before us many statements in various documents about what Australian sovereignty we have offered other people, but this House has not heard the detailed statements which the Parliament is entitled to hear. </para>

            <para>- My friend the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> commenced his speech with a fervent expression of support for the ANZUS Treaty. I am bound to say that I will seek to prove that his speech represents as explicit a repudiation of the ANZUS Treaty as any I could imagine. I am sorry that the honourable gentleman has introduced this quite unnecessary matter of public importance this afternoon. For nearly five years now in the position of Minister for Defence I have sought to cultivate in this House and, I hope, in the country something of a bipartisan approach to the problems of defence in the country. After a very long time as a member of this House I have a deep personal view that it is to no avail any party taking the view that electoral gain is to be made out of the defence field. We are, I trust, one people with one nation. Defence planning today is too complex and too expensive to be exposed to the accident and to the caprice of the electorate. I implore my honourable friend to reflect most earnestly on the clear need for greater bipartisanship to be displayed in defence matters. It saddens me that the honourable gentleman this afternoon has invited the House to consider a matter of public importance in the terms that he has put before us. I seek to illustrate the difficulty in which the honourable gentleman finds himself. Article II of the ANZUS Treaty states: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>In order more effectively to achieve the objective of this treaty the Parties separately and jointly by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That treaty was signed in 1951. What the honourable gentleman has put to the House in his argument this afternoon is this: &#39;Oh well, if Article II states that, we are at liberty to be selective about it. Those things that touch us one way we will have a look at; those things that we look upon with disfavour, we will chuck out&#39;. In other words, the honourable gentleman&#39;s approach to the ANZUS Treaty is to select those matters that please and reject those that displease. </para>
          <para>The honourable gentleman has mentioned sovereignty. I would have thought that the invitation, the offer to participate with and assist the United States in discharging the massive and crippling burden which she discharges in the world today in the defence field was an exercise of sovereignty, not abandonment of sovereignty. I will display to the honourable gentleman and to the House the enormous burden that the United States is discharging today in the whole field of defence. But, first of all, let me turn to the allegation made by the honourable gentleman that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> went off to the United States and made all sorts of offers and suggestions without consultation with the other two Ministers who were primarily concerned. I have seen that allegation published elsewhere by some erstwhile major who is a scribbler of sorts. The simple truth is that on 2 1 January my friend the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> and I were with the Prime Minister in Melbourne. I am not in the habit of whistling up everybody to be on display when matters of high public importance are being discussed by a small group of Ministers. There was nothing that my right honourable friend discussed in the United States that both the Foreign Minister and I were not privy to before he left. All of us were determined that there should be placed before the United States without any ambiguity whatsoever the clear commitment by the Australian Government- and I trust by the Australian people- that we would seek to help the United States wherever we could. </para>
          <para>Let me say this to the honourable gentleman: If he looks at a map of the Eurasian continent he will come to two conclusions: Firstly, how fragile the military balance in that area is and, secondly, that there is but one power on earth that can match the military preponderance of the Soviet Union and that is the United States of America. In that area we find some of the classic focal points of maritime history. I refer to the Strait of Hormuz- I will say something about that laterthe Suez Canal, the Strait of Malacca and round the Cape. They are four of the seven classic focal points of maritime history. The Arabian trade accounts for in the order of a thousand ships a day and trade with the Far East accounts for 1,300 ships a day in that area. If we put them on end from London to Edinburgh and back that would account for the numbers of ships that sail in that area. There was a time prior to 1 963 when the world could look upon what Joseph Conrad called not the use of the sea but the exploitation of the highways of the sea when those highways were free and could be used freely. That is no longer the case today. I shall adopt, with respect, the language used by the then Secretary of State for the United States Navy when appearing before a congressional committee. Speaking of his own country, he had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We are an island; for us, use of the seas is not just convenient- it is vital. The Soviet Union, a great land power, has much less need for access to the sea. Why, then, does she continue to strengthen both her already powerful naval fleet, including naval aviation, and her sizeable merchant marine? I believe it is because the Soviets correctly perceive that any faltering in our resolution to maintain maritime superiority could make the seas the Achilles heel of the United States and the free world. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is us. He continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To the extent, then, that they have the capability to carry out effective sea denial, they have an option for economic blackmail or strangulation, all with the gravest consequences, and all below the nuclear threshold. </para>

Why did he say that? I remind my friends, not in a spirit of the hostility, to look at the map. They will see those sea lanes- the highways, as Joseph Conrad described them. It was left to a Russian no less- Czar Peter I- to say: </para>

          <para class="block">The Soviet Union today has two hands and is using them. I remind my honourable friend that it was only a few weeks ago that I implored him to look at a map of the Persian Gulf area to see Afghanistan in relation to the Strait of Hormuz and to bear in mind the enormous amount of oil that flows through there to keep this country, the United States, the whole of Western Europe and Japan going. The Russians have shown themselves to be a very patient people. They may not take action today, but what of five, fifteen or 20 years? The Russians are prepared to wait. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister made the following offer to the United States: &#39;How can we help you?&#39; The Russians have a large army already in close propinquity of the Strait of Hormuz. In order to maintain the military balance in that area, the only power, I repeat, on earth that can exercise the countervailing influence, the counterweight, to the Soviet military preponderance in the area- the United States- must exercise and maintain its logistic supplies across thousands and thousands of miles. Is it not a sober consideration for men and women of goodwill to say to an ally: &#39;How can we help you?&#39; I repeat- I have never disguised this-that I have said to the United States authorities and to British authorities: &#39;There is Cockburn Sound. Come and use it. We will be happy to see you &#39;. I do not propose to resile from that statement. </para>
          <para>Let me say this to the honourable gentleman: Two United States submarines- the <inline font-style="italic">Haddock</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Los Angeles-</inline> will be in Cockburn Sound very shortly. They are both nuclear powered submarines. Am I to understand from listening to the wild, chimerical arguments from the member for Corio that on that day Perth, Fremantle and Cockburn Sound will be prime nuclear targets? What nonsense! Is the honourable gentleman serious when he says: &#39;You are going to pick out one part of the world and make that a prime nuclear target&#39;? Let me tell my honourable friend that I happen to hold very strongly to the view that the possibility of a limited nuclear war is very remote indeed. I see nothing but the end for the whole of mankind if we start down that track. That is a personal philosophy that I hold deeply. I find it a nonsense proposition that the honourable member should say: &#39;Well, there it is. If the United States does take up the Prime Minister&#39;s offer that area will become the one prime nuclear target in the world&#39;. That is an unreal proposition. </para>
          <para>Let me refer my honourable friend to a view which was put by a man with whom I sat in the House for years. We have remained friends although we were political rivals. I refer to the former Prime Minister and honourable member for Werriwa. Only four years ago during a debate in this House on visits by nuclear powered warships <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Before I proceed I should make it plain that there is regrettably in the public mind a great deal of confusion about nuclear ships. There is a difference between nuclear armed ships and nuclear powered ships. Nuclear armed shipspresumably only nuclear armed naval ships- have come to Australia for very many years. They have come from several powers. Successive governments have accepted that naval ships these days are quite likely to be nuclear armed. It is impossible to expect the navies of other countries to specify for public consumption which of their ships are nuclear armed  and which are not so that any country which is host to those ships may require that only those which are non nuclear armed can come to the ports. If that information and that requirement are imposed it becomes a matter of public knowledge which of the ships in any particular navy are nuclear armed and which may not be. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I remind the honourable gentleman that this is what was said by a friend of a lot of us, the former member for Werriwa. I thought that was a thoroughly rational statement. But the honourable gentleman today sought to take his party a distance away from that rationality. </para>
          <para>I think the House should not speculate upon Soviet intentions and to say: &#39;Well, they are there in Afghanistan today, 90,000 of them, establishing facilities which give every intention of permanence. There it is; they occupy one of the most strategic salients in the world.&#39; I repeat that one of the most strategic salients in the world is occupied today by the Soviet Union for a reason which it has not stated. There is no point in speculating about it. </para>
          <para>We must look at Soviet capabilities. That is what Admiral Gorshkov has built up. He has survived purge after purge within the Soviet political framework. He has shown that he is durable in that sense and for that, if no other reason, he is entitled to admiration. But he has built up this enormous sea power. If honourable members read his book <inline font-style="italic">The Sea Power of the State</inline> they cannot escape from the conclusion that it is as the Admiral tells us for the purpose of spreading Soviet influence right throughout the world. </para>
          <para>The statistics, I know, do not impress people. Admiral Doenitz started World War II with 50 diesel-electric submarines. Today there are 350 submarines in the Soviet inventory, 1 50 of which are nuclear powered. The Soviet Union launches one every six weeks. Why? That is the question. Only a few days ago I received from the man who made that statement- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Claytor</inline> who was at the time Secretary of State for the Navy and who is now the  Deputy  Secretary of the United States Department of Defence- a very generous personal letter. Am I to reply to that letter in the next day or so and say: &#39;I was very glad, Graham, to get your letter. P.S. We will not be welcoming you or the United States ships to Cockburn Sound &#39;? I make it quite clear on behalf of my right honourable friend, the Government he leads and Government supporters, the United States Navy always has been welcome at Cockburn Sound and it is doubly welcome today. </para>

          <para class="block">Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> for his brief lecture on history and geography. However, what we are concerned about really is the future. It is no good for the Minister to come in here and say that he is not interested in making defence an election issue, that he is not interested in the electoral gains that might come from it. The Minister said that he fears leaving the complex issues of defence to the caprice of the electorate. It might be as well if the Minister were for a start to level with the electorate as to what he intends with this country&#39;s defence today and tomorrow. </para>
          <para>Just take this point of electoral consequences. My friend, the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes),</inline> has already pointed out that this Minister seems to have a propensity for making statements in relation to defence on the eve of elections. But that did not start with him. Oh, no! We have to go back to 1 966 which is when Prime Minister Holt first elevated Cockburn Sound into the area of an election issue. Prime Minister Gorton revived it in 1969 and fortuitously, just before the 1972 election, was able to commence construction of the Cockburn Sound facility. Then, of course, in 1977 the Present Minister for Defence promised to home base Australian vessels in Cockburn Sound. Nothing happened. So in 1980- just a few weeks ago- he was able to make that commitment again, almost unchanged, to home base Australian vessels in Cockburn Sound. Cockburn Sound has become some sort of triennial phoenix. Every three years it bobs up in all its magnificence just at the time of an approaching election. </para>
          <para>What has happened as far as Cockburn Sound is concerned is that the Government has become desperate. It has for years wanted the United States of America to move in and occupy the Cockburn Sound base. Prime Minister Holt obviously had this in mind in 1966. Gorton offered it to the United States in 1970 and Defence Secretary Laird said at that time that, when circumstances were appropriate, they would use it. But we find that up to this point the United States has not accepted the offer and this Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, has now become desperate.  His  desperation was made even greater when he discovered that the United Staes mission of defence officials looking for additional military facilities in the Indian Ocean area bypassed Australia. It went to Kenya, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Somalia to look for additional military facilities for the United States. It did not come to Australia. As a result of that slight, the Prime Minister decided to demand that the United States make use of the Cockburn Sound facilities. </para>
          <para>The other point that has to be made is the very great difference between visits by foreign vessels whether they be from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, India or whatever, and home porting foreign vessels on the Australian mainland. That is what is being proposed and that is what we fear very greatly. It is about time the Minister levelled with the Australian people and told them that he is proposing to embark on a totally new and totally unexplored area of home basing foreign nuclear powered and armed vessels, right in the bosom of my electorate, right in the midst of the Perth metropolitan area. </para>
          <para>The attempts by this Government to utilise fully Cockburn Sound have been desultory indeed. What does Cockburn Sound have at the moment? It has one Attack class patrol boat with a bofors gun that sometimes works. It is all very well for the Minister to threaten me with the fury of a bofors gun. How would he like to be bobbing around in the Indian Ocean with nothing between him and salvation but a World War II bofors gun that is likely to pack up at any moment? That is the nature of this Government&#39;s commitment to Cockburn Sound and that is the reason for its desperation at this point. Of course, when the Attack class is finally phased out and replaced by the Fremantle class patrol boat there will be one of those vessels in Cockburn Sound. We were told up until a few weeks ago that this vessel too would be armed with a bofors gun. I am now happy to say that the Minister has decided to review that decision. But I am not happy to say that he has been prepared to exclude the possibility of arming those vessels with some kind of missile capability. It seems to me that the highly skilled and highly motivated members of the Australian Navy deserve far better treatment from this Minister and this Government than the worn out tired old equipment that it is prepared to give them. </para>
          <para>As I have said, there is a very great difference between having occasional visits from foreign vessels and home basing. This is really where the dangerous situation arises. We know that as far back as 1969 a Liberal Minister for Defence admitted that a United States communications base at North West Cape would become a target in the event of a nuclear war. We know that in 1975 Schlesinger gave testimony to a Senate committee in the United States in which he referred not to a major nuclear war but rather to a limited nuclear war. He was asked in what sort of targets the Soviets would be interested under his flexible targeting, limited nuclear war concepts. He said: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. the Soviets are not necessarily limited to the strike we have outlined here (i.e., one against US missile silos) . . . they could, for example, just decide to go after the communication systems to our submarines. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>I mention that because in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Muskie</inline> &#39;s State there is a communication facility at Cutler, Maine. </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Schlesinger,</inline>instead of using the example of Cutler, Maine, might just as well have used the North West Cape because it is an identical facility. It is a communications facility for US submarines. There are circumstances in which it might be preferable for an enemy of the United States with intercontinental ballistic missiles capability to knock out a facility away from the United States mainland. I realise that the Minister for Defence dismisses the concept of a limited nuclear war even though it has been embraced by former Defence Secretary Schlesinger and is the conventional wisdom of the United States at this moment. The Minister for Defence in the Australian Government dismisses it. Yet it is a possibility which we cannot ignore. What is now becoming more and more clear is that even in a limited nuclear conflict a facility such as the North West Cape becomes a nuclear target. This view has been supplemented in Australia in evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in June and August 1976. As the evidence of one of the witnesses, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr G.</inline> Jukes, a senior fellow at the Research School of Pacific Studies at the Australian National University, relates specifically to Cockburn Sound as to what this Government now intends, I will quote what he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Cockburn Sound comes into an entirely different category because of its location in a major population area. While it remains a secondary RAN facility, it probably does not merit a Soviet nuclear weapon. But should there be grounds to associate it with the follow-on to Polaris and Poseidon, as would be the case if visits from United States nuclear-armed warships are solicited with an excess of zeal, it will certainly become a Soviet nuclear target. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is what the Minister has in store for us. That is what he has in mind for the people of Perththe home basing of nuclear powered and nuclear armed United States vessels in Cockburn Sound. What this indicates quite clearly is that the Prime Minister, this Minister and other Canberra based defence strategists are prepared to sacrifice the people of Perth. They know that it would be a nuclear target. They know that it would be an extraordinarily attractive target for any enemy of the United States because they would be able mortally to bruise the United States without actually threatening the United States mainland. That becomes a very enticing prospect in a situation where there is a particularly limited nuclear war. </para>
          <para>Let me just turn to one other danger associated simply with visits from nuclear powered warships. I refer to the fact that in July of last year the United States <inline font-style="italic">New York,</inline> which is a nuclear powered submarine, was to visit the city after which it took its name. However, the Mayor of New York, Mayor Koch, refused permission for a vessel of the navy of his own country to enter the harbour of the city of New York. The reasons, he said, were two-fold. In the first case there was a risk of fuel leaks or explosions occurring in this heavily populated area. Admittedly, Perth is not as heavily populated as New York, but there are very many people whom I hold very precious. Secondly, the Mayor believed that there was a risk terrorists might seize the vessel and hold the city to ransom and that this out weighed the benefits of any visit. </para>

            <para>-Like the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen),</inline> I felt sorry that bipartisanship has vanished on this occasion. I also felt sorry for the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> who stumbled around and did not seem to be quite sure of what he was here for. He knows that we have an alliance with the United States. He knows that we really should be for it and supporting it. There was the wildly flapping and wildly quacking left wing which seems to have become rampant within the Australian Labor Party in the last couple of days. That flapping and quacking were the reasons why he spoke today. There are other prompters, but it is clear to me- I think to everybody in this House who listened- that there is a unity ticket between elements in the media and the Opposition. The Opposition has been encouraged to pursue this ridiculously worded discussion of a matter of so-called public importance. Personally, I am glad that it did. I am glad that the Opposition fell for it because it gave the Minister for Defence and me the opportunity to point out quite clearly that the defence of Australia is the most vital thing that any government can be concerned with. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Following from that, we must be mindful and willing to accept whatever alliances suit us. The United States alliance does suit us at the moment and is helpful to us. Accordingly, following from that, all United States Navy ships, whether they are nuclear armed, nuclear powered, a combination of both, or whether they are conventionally powered, are welcome in Western Australia. I speak on behalf, not only of the Government and the Minister for Defence, but also of all Western Australian members of Parliament with the exception of the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dawkins).</inline> We welcome the American presence. The ships can come here any time they like. I might say that we should undertake arrangements to circulate the speech of the honourable member for Fremantle in the letterboxes in Fremantle. He does not even know that Cockburn Sound is not in his electorate. The Cockburn Sound naval base, Garden Island, is in the electorate of my colleague, the honourable member for Canning <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bungey).</inline> It was never in the electorate of the honourable member for Fremantle. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Fremantle wants a nuclear free zone around Fremantle. He is engaged with a whole lot of half wits in that city who want a nuclear free zone. We all know what this means. It means that we should abandon the defence of Australia. We should forget about defending ourselves. We should allow anyone to lob anything they like on us and we would not defend ourselves. That is the sort of nonsense that the honourable member and his colleagues in the Fremantle Council have been going on with. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> I am happy to report to you that they were absolutely abolished. </para>

              <para>-Maybe he does, but they were sent away packing. They were sent away packing because there are some sensible elements in Fremantle who did not want to be associated with this nonsense. The honourable member is leaving the chamber. It is no wonder. He ought to be ashamed to come in here and ask for a nuclear free zone in Fremantle. The only thing I am surprised about is that my future opponent in Swan has also associated himself with this ridiculous nonsense. It is a shame and a pity to see someone who is normally deserving of respect being associated with such nonsense. On the other hand, the poor fellow is only following the present line of left wing ideology which is now riding rampant in the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> is captive to it. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> is captive to it. All those who hope to replace both of them are also captives. When the Opposition loses the next election- it is going to lose it because of having policies that are as silly as these- the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition also will probably be replaced in time because he will keep on losing. What honourable members on the other side of the House cannot understand is that the attitudes they have had, not just for the last couple of years, but since 1955 are not acceptable to the Australian people. I admit that there was an aberration for a short time, but the Australian people woke up to the Australian Labor Party. When is it going to wake up to itself? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I join with the Minister for Defence. We want a bipartisan foreign policy and a bipartisan defence policy. We want everyone in this country to be aware of Australia&#39;s situation. We want everyone to understand that we must defend ourselves and understand the difficult geographical position that Australia is in. We have appealed and asked for bipartisanship. It is not forthcoming. The Opposition still persists in having these attitudes which are totally alien to the majority of the Australian people. Every time the question of the American alliance comes up, every time there is a question of our using the assistance the United States can give us, whether it is nuclear or conventional, the Opposition takes this funny attitude. We know that most members of the Opposition, in their hearts, are probably well disposed towards the alliance. They must be because in some respects Australia has depended upon it and very greatly in the last couple of years. How much longer do they expect the Americans to come to our assistance and to keep making offers when there is a section of the community- a small section, and the Labor Party represents it- that does not want that American alliance but wants to drive the Americans away? That is absolutely crazy to those of us on this side of the House who have the interest of this country at heart and who want Opposition members to join with us in helping to defend this country and to preserve all the things we know are important in this part of the world. We offer Opposition members this opportunity time after time, but they reject it. They come forward with piddling, puerile, piffling matters of public importance such as this which are of no consequence at all. </para>
          <para>They should be ashamed. They should be ashamed to be associated with people in the Press Gallery, the left wing of the Labor Party, the crazy conservation groups outside and the left wing trade unions and the pro-communists within those unions who are determined to destroy this country. No wonder the Australian voter will not have the Labor Party as a government. I have said the same sort of thing time after time in this place. Labor members say the same sort of thing back to me, but I do not take any notice because I have been put here by the people to see first and foremost that Australia is defended. Labor members are pushed along sometimes by pro-communists and certainly by rabid left wing ideology. They have driven the </para>
          <para class="block">Labor Party into the position it is now in. The Labor Party is in a corner it cannot get out of. In order to fulfil the expectations of the people outside the Parliament who promote the Labor Party, Labor members have to put forward matters of public importance such as this. </para>
          <para>This has not always been the case. There was a time, not so long ago, in fact in 1974, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard-</inline> and I do not know how Labor members can deny him now- in answering a question had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There are long-standing arrangements under which ships from the navies of friendly and allied countries visit each other&#39;s ports and facilities, by permission in each case of the host Government. When the facility at Cockburn Sound is completed I would expect that under these arrangements there would be calls there too from time to time by ships from friendly and allied navies, including the USN and RN. No arrangements beyond this long-standing practice have been entered into or are contemplated. </para>

              <para>-So it is said, and I think he was too. I think he would be ashamed of the attitudes Opposition members, particularly the honourable member for Fremantle, are putting forward today. Why the people of Fremantle elect him, I do not know. I know why the people of Swan elect me but why the voters elect him, I do not know. He has to understand that Western Australia is the most isolated State with the smallest population and the greatest riches. Yet he is doing the best he can to drive away the greatest and most important ally we have. Time after time in this chamber the Minister for Defence has made clear what is necessary if Australia is to survive. The Minister brings forth documentation; he is sincere and Opposition members know that he is genuine. So why do they not support him? I think it is absolutely deplorable that a so-called matter of public importance can be put forward by the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes),</inline> who in so many other respects is such a sensible fellow. I cannot understand it. Possibly he has been prompted by those wild left wingers, who have now elected two more to the Opposition front bench. This is what is pushing the honourable member for Corio, and I am sorry for him. He can be absolutely certain that what the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> had to say in this House the other day about whatever arrangements will be entered into will be adhered to. The one thing that we can be absolutely certain about- and I join with the Minister for Defence in saying this- is that United States ships are welcome, any of them and as many of them, nuclear powered or conventional, as the United States wants to send. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">Our suggestion, as the amendment will show, is that the Committee should omit the words &#39;but does not bind the Crown in right of a State or of the Northern Territory&#39; and substitute &#39;and of each State and the Northern Territory&#39;. This indicates that we want the Human Rights Commission to be an effective commission, one that can deal with the laws as they affect human rights and matters which, as we were at pains to point out on previous occasions, relate to people&#39;s rights in the main and which are at present controlled by State law. So if there is to be any effective control and effective examination of human rights and if we are to implement what we have told the United Nations, namely, that we will ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and bring into Australian law the human rights therein expressed, it follows that we should say that human rights legislation will apply to State laws and the laws of the Northern Territory. Accordingly, the amendment will be moved on that basis and in that spirit. We are mindful of the fact that the Government is taking the view that it does not want its law to override State law; it merely wants to set up some sort of tame commission to which we may refer matters and which in turn will report to a Minister on whether laws are in accordance with the Covenant. That is no way to protect the rights of Australian citizens. It is no way to endorse this Covenant. It is no way to ratify the Covenant. Despite the protestations of the Government the Covenant specifically provides that its provisions should extend to all parts of Federal States without any limitation or exception. The High Court of Australia, in a series of judgments which go back to Burgess&#39;s case, clearly established that if we enter into an international covenant or an international treaty under the external affairs power of the Constitution any legislation introduced pursuant to that treaty or covenant may take precedence of State laws. </para>

            <para>-Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Chairman.</inline> The point we are trying to make is that in this human rights Covenant there are a number of matters which relate to rights of people, such as rights of assembly which are being denied in Western Australia. Yet we do not see any amendments moved by the members from Western Australia to protect the rights of assembly of trade unionists and others. If there is a rejection of those rights there should be an appeal to a judicial tribunal, as this Covenant provides. There is no provision for such appeal. We also complain quite bitterly about the discriminatory laws operating in Queensland, particularly against Aborigines who can be denied rights in their settlements. Surely that is discrimination, which is foremost in Article 2 which covers discrimination on the base of race and colour. These are matters that are not to be approved of in any way, yet they occur in Queensland. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>There is a right to demonstrate in a normal democratic fashion providing the public interest is in no way jeopardised. That is not applicable in Queensland. We do not see members from Queensland suggesting that the State laws ought to be in any way subject to these criteria. In fact, at the Premiers Conference when it was first suggested by Federal Ministers that this Covenant should apply to the States it was loudly objected to by the Premiers of Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. Is this Bill to be just a charade, a Bill containing a statement of a principle and nothing more? This is a legislative chamber. If the honourable members have any principles at all, any conscience about anything at all, they at least might try to make it operate in making law, and not just bring in wordy statements which mean nothing if the law is not to be changed. </para>
        <para>In the last few weeks we had a long debate here about the question of the rights of the unborn. But it could not change the law because an amendment suggesting that the legislation might apply to the States was defeated by the same people that moved that amendment. It is hypocritical, to say the least, to be using this forum to talk about statements of principle but do not do anything about the law. If the principles of honourable members opposite are so entrenched, as they ought to be, why do they not do something about this matter in the States in which they live? If they cannot do it there why do they not pass laws in this Parliament that could override those State laws that they say do not conform with those principles? </para>
        <para>The proposed amendment would give this Bill much greater power. It would affect all Australian laws relating to the human rights of people. It would be tangible evidence of our bona fides as members of the International Human Rights Commission. We should practice what we preach. We should introduce into Australian law a set of criteria which could guarantee that people would have a right to object to a court about breaches of their rights. In other words, they would be enforceable rights. The principles in the Bill are not enforceable, but we propose that they be enforceable. Thereby, we would guarantee an effective democratic system.

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">-The Deputy</inline>Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> has gone to the heart of the matter: Is this a Human Rights Commission Bill or a States rights commission Bill? We have to decide whether those things in which we have a firm belief about human rights transcend any consideration of constitutions or any established practice of the last 70 or 80 years. As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition asked are we going to treat all Australians as worthy of the consideration of this Parliament in this matter, or are we not? This legislation will cover perhaps 250,000 people in Australia in the general sense, and in those particular senses that apply to Commonwealth law, I suppose the 14 million of them. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I am sure that if the Committee examines this matter thoroughly it will come to the same conclusion as we on this side of the chamber, as was implied by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> in a remark he made during an earlier debate: Surely we are one people on this one continent, or something to that effect. What is the score in this matter? There are a number of things that we would have thought were basic to Australian society: Freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of association, equality before the law and equality at the ballot box. In one way or another some of these rights are transgressed by various States. </para>
        <para>I raise the point that concerns the people of Australia at the moment; that is, the situation of the Aboriginal people of Australia and their rights, particularly their rights to their land. Their rights will be effectively enforced only if the Australian Government, through its powers in this Parliament and through the authority conferred upon it, takes the matter up and uses its authority against certain States. At present there is what we might call a great deal of uneasiness, rising to the point of tumult, amongst Aboriginal people in Western Australia and South Australia about the situation of their rights to their land. In both instances they are in the hands of governments which do not believe in their rights. This is a long fought argument. I thought that this Parliament at least had given its imprimatur and had adopted these rights as national principle, and therefore the rest of Australia should also. I appeal to the Committee to take heed of this and to take note of what the Deputy Leader&#39;s amendment really means. </para>
        <para>I am absolutely astonished that at this stage in the development of our Federation we should have such a clause in a Bill dealing with human rights. Clause S states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth but does not bind the Crown in right of a State or of the Northern Territory. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Instead of going through all the trouble we have with this piece of legislation, we could have brought it in as an Australian Capital Territory ordinance and had it apply to .this part of Australia and left it at that. We have gone through an enormous exercise over the last few years in consideration of this matter in committees, by references, by studies and disputes, by demonstrations, by arguments in both Houses and passing it backwards and forwards and here we are still persisting with what is surely an anachronism, the preservation of State rights in this matter. </para>
        <para>I am just thinking for a moment on some of the things to which we ought to apply ourselves, apart from the land rights of the Aboriginal people, apart from the rights of people to demonstrate freely whether in the streets or at public gatherings anywhere. There are some features of the electoral laws of the States which are against the general principles of the Australian Constitution and the Australian way of doing things. There are still elective bodies in Australia which are not elected by adult suffrage. I find that intolerable at this stage. In Victoria it still applies only in municipal elections but in South Australia I think there is now adult suffrage for elections to the upper House. I do not think that is the case in Tasmania yet and I am not certain about the score in Western Australia. This has been a long slow haul. These reforms will finally be brought about only if this Parliament exercises its authority, establishes the principles and makes the legislation enforceable. Laws of this nature which cannot, or will not be enforced may as well not be passed. We live in a world in which pious resolutions produce very few results against the kind of ruthless and unscrupulous opposition that we in the Labor movement have run up against. </para>
        <para>There is a continual upheaval in the industrial scene, caused sometimes by the intransigence of employers and sometimes by the interference of governments and sometimes, I have no doubt, by the intransigence of the people in the workforce. The whole of the operations of this Parliament ought to be aimed at evolving some kind of national scheme which will produce an acceptable result, an acceptable system of guaranteeing human rights and freedoms across the continent. Once again I make an appeal, in particular on  behalf  of members of the Aboriginal race who are still beset with the greed of those who place diamonds before people, uranium before people, bauxite or even cattle before people in these instances. It has been a long, hard fight. I thought that we had won it. I believe that we have won it in the community as far as the exerting of actual pressures against Aboriginals in local society is concerned, when anyone takes up the issue, but I mast admit that I am a bit shaken by the fact that there still exist in the governments of South Australia and Western Australia, and notoriously that of Queensland, people who will attempt to subvert a free society and deprive the Aboriginal people of their rights. If the Bill does not take that into account we might as well not bother with it at all. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will support what the Deputy Leader  of  the Opposition has had to say on the matter. </para>

It would be purposeless for the Parliament to talk about human rights in theory onlynot providing any effective machinery for granting the average Australian citizen recourse to the resources of this Parliament on the national issue of human rights- by virtue of the fact that the Bill virtually confined its operations to territories which effectively were under the control of the Commonwealth. </para>

        <para>I suppose that we are all products of our history and, because of the way in which the Austraiian nation has evolved, the reality is that if grave infringements of human rights take place they tend to take place within the States rather than within the Commonwealth territories. This is largely because it is the States which provide the legal fabric, the machinery as a result of which the rights of the individual, as against those of the States, are currently most under challenge. More people are arrested in the States because the police powers which govern civil liberties and basic human freedoms are legally entrenched within the various statutes of the States. </para>
        <para>The Government says: &#39;We will talk about human rights&#39;, but one cannot talk about human rights in abstract. When we talk about Soviet dissenters we talk about the iniquity of a woman displaying a placard and for that offence being given seven years in gaol. That is, of course, iniquitous but it is equally iniquitous that I and my friend the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> can, as part of our civil rights, give our views on a particular issue by taking part in a demonstration in Melbourne and - </para>

However, the moment one asks him: &#39;Why are you not concerned about human rights in your own State; why are you not concerned about human rights of the average Australian citizen who happens to live in Queensland&#39;, all of a sudden he becomes mute.

            <para>- Prior to the suspension of the sitting, I was concerned to make the point that we have an incredible situation existing in Australia. Victorians and people living in Melbourne, such as myself and my colleagues, can involve themselves in a march or demonstration in order to draw community attention perhaps to a political, industrial or social matter of concern. That demonstration can take place peacefully without any threat of violence or without any suggestion that there is a breach of the law. If citizens from another part of the Commonwealth choose to go to Queensland to do exactly the same they could find themselves imprisoned. They are not proceeded against by a summons as they could be, but are locked up for periods from four to six hours. Then they are fined $50. </para>

        <para>It is that kind of anomaly which the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition seeks to overcome. We cannot view human liberties in Australia as virtually divisible in terms of State attitudes and borders. State boundaries are something that we have inherited. On matters which go to the fundamental rights of the citizen as against the State- I use the term &#39;State&#39; in its broadest term- it seems to me that as a national parliament we have to be prepared to assert that individual human right, when the rights of the average Australian citizen, are one and indivisible throughout the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth and the Australian people should not tolerate variations which can, in fact, infringe very severely upon the rights and liberties of Australian people depending upon the particular political philosophy or the narrow interpretation that may be imposed upon those rights and liberties by one State government. That is the difference on this new proposed clause between the approach of the Opposition and the approach of members on the Government side, although I am bound to say that some supporters of the Government in another place were not prepared to take the view that has been taken by some honourable members in this Committee. They shared the view of the Opposition that one cannot make any kind of commission effective, or deal with the question of human rights, unless one is prepared to enable the Human Rights Commission to pursue transgressions of human rights whenever and wherever they occur- that is, in whatever States those transgressions occur. That is the heart of the argument. </para>
        <para>If, within the community of nations, Australia is wanting to assert the rights of world citizens to human freedom and liberty, we must make certain that this Parliament has put our own house in order. I am afraid that that is not the situation in Australia today. We do not have to do anything more than look at the fourth annual report of the Commissioner for Community Relations. That is a report of some 137 pages. It lists transgressions in human rights and exercises in racial discrimination that have occurred within Australia within the last 12 months. I say, as a tribute to the Commissioner that he has not been prepared to abrogate or diminish the strength of his comments. Where there have been exercises in racial discrimination which infringe on human liberties, he has been prepared to report them to the Parliament. It is extraordinary that this Parliament has not once in four years set aside any time at all to discuss one of those reports. This Parliament has not once in four years taken time off for that purpose. </para>
        <para>Let me just deal with one of the random issues, the refusal of the Government of Queensland to allow Aboriginal women in an Aboriginal settlement to receive social service benefits to which they were entitled under the laws of the Commonwealth. I do not have the time to enlarge upon all those recorded limitations and restrictions, many of them based upon the most overt exercises involving not only the infringement of human liberties but exercises in racial discrimination which flow through to involve restrictions on human rights and freedoms. In some parts of this Commonwealth some Aboriginal citizens are treated as second class citizens, where the laws - </para>

          <para>-The amendment proposed by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> would change the whole character of this legislation in such a way that the consequences deserve to be explored. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition proposes to alter the sense of clause 5 so that the Act binds the Crown in right of all of the States as well as the Commonwealth. In a shorthand way, that is the position. I think it is fair to ask the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition what is the consequence of what he proposes? Briefly, it would reverse the whole compact and totality of the Australian Federation. If the Human Rights Commission were to be given executive powers it would reverse that compact with the power of execution. Honourable members should appreciate that fact and they would know that what I say is totally correct. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>For ten years before Federation, the States came together; they bargained together; and they ceded certain powers to the Commonwealth. Since those days there has been an enormous increase in the powers which the Commonwealth has been able to exert, both through interpretation of the High Court and also through interpretation due to the administration of economic powers. This would give that whole process an enormous shift. There are contradictions also involved in it. In a sense it would wipe out the States. If one looks at the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and if one looks at the rights which are to be covered by it- political, social, human and so on- one asks oneself: What would be left for the various States to administer? There would be nothing left for the States to administer. I am puzzled and fascinated at the fact that the two speakers who preceded me in this debate were members of State Parliaments for many years. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Melbourne Ports was an alternative Premier in a State Parliament for a number of years. I am wondering when he went around Victoria whether he said: &#39;I want you to make me Premier so that I can dismember this whole State, so that I can make of the Constitution a sword with which to cut up any State powers so that they are almost totally unrecognisable&#39;. It is a nonsense proposition to say that most of the disputes concerning rights, whether civil, political, economic or whatever they happen to be, exist within the States because they are the areas which are left to the States except insofar as the Commonwealth has certain powers given to it. So, it is a nonsense argument to make that point. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holding)</inline> would realise that, with the sense of honesty that overtakes him from time to time. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I have looked at Article 50. I have also looked at the interpretation of the Burgess case to which the honourable member referred. The interpretation of that case simply means that the powers involved in an international treaty do not necessarily ipso facto reside in the central government of one of the signing states. Each case is to be judged on its merits. In that case, Latham said that in terms of aviation it was common sense, appropriate and sensible that the powers reside in the Commonwealth and that was the judgment that was made. There are grey areas here. Nevertheless honourable members cannot say that ipso facto, merely because of the accession to a treaty, the power lies with the Commonwealth in respect of these matters covered in the Covenant. Every State parliament would be operating under a falsity and under a delusion. If all the honourable members here were to campaign for or to propose the elections of the State governments they should be sufficiently straightforward to make that point. I look at the wealth of rights which are covered in the Covenant. I refer to Part I, Article 1. It states: </para>

It would be difficult to say that there would be anything left.

The honourable member argued very strongly that certain rights had been denied that person. The rights which had been denied that person fell under a number of those categories. But was it ever suggested either by the Opposition here or by the New South Wales Government that those rights ought then to be determined not within the New South Wales industrial jurisdiction but within and by the Commonwealth? That was never acceded to. They, in fact, conceded the point that certain obligations lay upon a different level of government </para>

In the debate on the motion moved by the honourable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lusher)</inline> last year, which became known as the abortion debate, one of the strong arguments made was that it was not appropriate for the Commonwealth to pass legislation which would impinge upon the obligations of States in respect of the unborn child. It was said that this was a matter for State jurisdictions and that it lay within State jurisdictions, within State criminal codes and within State health administrations. On that occasion it was ceded, almost automatically and instinctively, that it lay with the rights and obligations of the States. Yet here in terms of reportage, in terms of the information which would be carried and the rights of investigation, all those rights are to be ceded to the Commonwealth. That should make it perfectly clear to the Committee that once we agree with the proposition put forward by the Opposition we come up with some enormous contradictions that lead us nowhere. The Latham case, the private member&#39;s motion which was debated here last year and the misinterpretation of the Burgess case in the High Court in 1936 all point to this fact. I think members will agree that were this amendment to be passed an enormous power would reside in those people who could decide what they would investigate and how they would investigate it. All the smaller States would tremble and they ought to tremble because it would not be their own social patterns that would have sway; they would be subject to and become a creature of the social patterns as determined in the larger States- in the large aggregations of populations- and their civil rights would be determined in the large aggregates of populations. </para>
        <para>Finally, civil rights are determined in a number of areas. They can be determined at a number of levels of government. If rights which are determined within a State administration are judged to be incorrect, it is for voters in those States to make their judgment and they do make their judgment from time to time. The people of South Australia, from which the honourable member for Port Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Young)</inline> comes, for a number of years judged that it was appropriate for the multitude of rights which were administered by that State to be determined by that State Government. In those State elections, did the honourable member say: &#39;We want to strip the State of any authority or power whatsoever. Give them nothing&#39;? That was never said. Nobody in the Opposition has said that at all. Yet that proposition is the logical consequence of the amendment moved by the Opposition. Add this amendment to what it hopes to do in terms of executive powers and in terms of the power of Executive administration and we have just that situation. I would say that those honourable members on this side of the chamber who would defeat this amendment are acting in common sense and are acting according to the federal compact which was a distribution of rights and of obligations. Were they to do otherwise it would make those people in various communities, who determine their own patterns of life, a hostage to some central authority that would impose its own authority upon them without any say whatsoever. </para>

          <para>- It is always distressing to hear the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> in this frame of mind because from time to time he is quite sensible. But on this occasion, once again, he has been quite absurd. What he is saying is that it is all right to have a Human Rights Commission so long as it cannot look at the area where most of the infringements of human rights in fact, occur. So long as it cannot do anything or investigate anything, he is happy to have it. That is the burden of what he is saying. What the Opposition, on the other hand, is saying is that if we are going to have a Human Rights Commission at all, for heavens sake let it do the job that it is set up to do. Let it investigate all the infringements or possible infringements of human rights that exist throughout the country. If the honourable member for Lilley was going to be at all consistent what he ought to be doing is arguing alongside the honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cotter)</inline> and the honourable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Martyr)</inline> in saying that this Bill should not be enacted at all and that there should not be a Human Rights Commission at all because that is what they have said. If he is prepared to say that - </para>

          <para>- With the greatest of respect, the honourable member for Swan commenced his speech a couple of weeks ago by saying that he wished that he did not have to vote for this measure at all but that if he did have to vote for this measure he wished that it had a particular amendment which he was pursuing. Now the honourable member for Kalgoorlie goes even further and says that we should not entertain the idea at all. If the honourable member for Lilley was prepared to go that far then at least his argument would be consistent. But what he is saying is absolute nonsense. Perhaps it is acceptable, logically, to say that Australia should never have become a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Surely if we are to become a signatory to it then we have to extend the provisions of that Covenant to all parts of Australia because otherwise it is a total nonsense. </para>

But that is the power on which the amendment hangs. There is certainly a possibility that it would be upheld by the High Court. In fact, we would say there is a strong possibility that it would be upheld. But in any event, what is wrong with trying? The point is that there should not be a situation in which there is one standard of human rights in one part of Australia and another standard in another part of Australia. </para>

            <para>- The extension of the powers of the Human Rights Commission into the arena of the State parliaments was brought into sharpest relief in recent times in relation to the dispute in Western Australia involving the Aboriginal people at Noonkanbah station. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ranted last night about none of us on this side of the chamber understanding that Noonkanbah station was really only a pastoral lease and asked what right anyone who held a pastoral lease had to invoke mineral rights or to pretend to prevent those people who were exercising mineral rights from exploring and drilling on a pastoral lease. The point that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ought to understand is that the only reason that it was necessary for the Commonwealth to provide funds for the acquisition of the Noonkanbah pastoral lease was that there was no Aboriginal land in Western Australia which the people of Noonkanbah could own. There was no Aboriginal reserve. There was no land at all with which they had any association. Therefore, it was decided the Aboriginal people at Noonkanbah should be provided with the funds to acquire that pastoral lease. The net result of that was that it did not become a pastoral lease in the normal sense of the term. It did not become a pastoral lease in the sense of the pastoral base the honourable member for Kalgoorlie owns. It became the home of these people. It also became the place where the whole of the religious and cultural traditions of these people of Noonkanbah resided. In this context Article 17 of the Covenant which this legislation seeks to introduce into Australian law provides: </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is the important point for the people of Noonkanbah. Noonkanbah is their traditional home and is recognised as such in the pastoral lease which they hold. Similarly Article 1 8 states: </para>

        <para class="block">There is no way that the Aboriginal people of Australia can pursue their religious beliefs without the control and ownership of the land which holds the symbols of their religious beliefs. So in a very real sense the extension of the powers of the Commission into the States does at least provide an opportunity for the Commission to investigate and report to this Parliament on the questions which are the deepest and most important to the Aboriginal people of Australia and indeed to the people of Noonkanbah. </para>

          <para>A STATEMENT BY THE PREMIER, SIR CHARLES COURT, ON NOONKANBAH </para>
          <para>Communications to the area are poor but, from messages received I understand that representatives of Amax, the Mines Department and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Community Welfare went to Noonkanbah early this morning, ahead of the arrival of the first equipment, to talk to the local Aboriginal community about the proposed drill and camp site. </para>
          <para>This was in accordance with the undertaking we gave. </para>
          <para>Subsequently, I was advised that the first of the equipment had moved on to the agreed location and had commenced preparation of the site. </para>
          <para>Later messages advised that, as a result of the meeting at Noonkanbah, Amax had been given approval to proceed. </para>
          <para>To meet a community request, Amax has agreed to use No. 2 drilling site instead of their preferred site which had previously been referred to as No. 1 site. </para>
          <para>It was also agreed that the camp site would be near the drill site. This was preferred by the community. </para>
          <para>The community have agreed that contractors can upgrade the roads. </para>
          <para>There has been an assurance from the community that there will be no further difficulties. </para>
          <para>Naturally, I will have to wait until we get more detailed information, which no doubt will be available when somebody returns to Derby, where there are better communications. But it would appear that things have proceeded largely as we predicted. </para>
          <para>Amax have advised us of the demand made on them by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bob</inline> Hawke, calling for the cessation of all activities at Noonkanbah pending talks with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> Cook and threatening industrial action. </para>
          <para>We have advised Amax that they should tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> that there is no industrial question involved. Sacred sites are being protected and we have no intention of allowing this to develop into land rights issue. </para>
          <para>If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cook</inline> wants to talk to anyone, he should talk to the Government as Amax are merely meeting their obligations under the permit they have from the Government. We would be only too pleased to talk to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cook,</inline> if for no other reason than to be sure he understands the full facts. </para>
          <para>STATEMENT BY MR JIMMY BIEUNDURRY,  CHAIRMAN  KIMBERLEY LAND COUNCIL, MEMBER WESTERN AUSTRALIA STATE LAND TRUST AND NAC REPRESENTATIVE FOR WEST KIMBERLEY </para>
          <para>Charles Court has lied in saying that AMAX went on to Noonkembah with the Aboriginal community&#39;s consent. The company forced its way on with police support and the connivance of the Federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs. A police force of 1 1 men with four cars and a &#39;paddy wagon &#39; reinforced AMAX&#39;s move to the Pea Hill sacred site. The company and Mines Department officials had then given the Community an ultimatum that they would drill on the Pea Hill site unless directed by the Community to an alternative drilling area which is also a sacred site. </para>
          <para>Police stood by with the &#39;paddy wagon&#39; to arrest Aboriginal people if they refused to consent. This is what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court calls negotiation and agreement. </para>
          <para>The Noonkembah community has told me and the Regional Director of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Long,</inline> only the day before, that they were hoping for a cooling off period during which the Western Australia Museum would do a complete survey of all sites on the station. It is only two days ago since the Premier assured them that there would be no drilling without prior negotiation between the Company and the community, and no drilling whatsoever on sacred sites. </para>
          <para>Again <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court has openly lied to the Aboriginal people. </para>
          <para>Aboriginal people have been threatened with an ultimatum or the alternative of arrest for protecting their religious beliefs. </para>
          <para>The police, the Company and the Government had deliberately set out to catch the Community off guard while they awaited the Premier&#39;s promised negotiations with AMAX and the arrival of Museum personnel. </para>
          <para>I challenge the Regional Director of D.A.A., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Long,</inline> as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney&#39;s</inline> representative at Noonkembah yesterday, to provide his account of the events and to declare whether the community&#39;s consent was given freely or under duress. There was no doubt that the most extreme duress was used. </para>
          <para>I am concerned at the role played by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Long,</inline> who apparently had several days&#39; notice of the Company&#39;s intention to move on to Noonkembah. Despite scheduled appointments in Perth <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Long</inline> had chosen to remain for the past few days in Derby to participate in yesterday&#39;s events. Despite this prior knowledge <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Long</inline> failed to communicate anything of what was impending to the community or the Aboriginal Legal Service. </para>
          <para>Consequently, the community had no warning and no recourse to legal advice. </para>
          <para>I would also doubt the proposed Federal investigation of yesterday&#39;s events, given that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney&#39;s</inline> most senior official in W.A., <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Long,</inline> was- under the terms of the 1974 Commonwealth-State Agreement on Aboriginal Affairsalso under the direct control of the W.A. Minister for Police and Community Welfare. </para>
          <para>Aboriginal people have lost their wishes and their religious beliefs have been violated by the combined action of AMAX, the police forces, the Mines Department and the Ministers for Community Welfare and Aboriginal Affairs in such circumstances. </para>
          <para>Against such forces Aboriginal people have no hope of justice or means to gain and maintain dignity and respect. </para>

          <para>- I intervene for only a couple of minutes to respond to the arguments raised by the honourable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dawkins).</inline> May I say with the greatest of respect- and I am not unsympathetic to the motives of the Opposition in respect of the amendment before the Chair- that the Opposition ought to consider the full implications of clause 1 1 of the Bill. It highlights the philosophical differences between both sides of the chamber in that the Government has provided the framework for the States to request the Human Rights Commission to carry out functions within their State territories but at the State&#39;s request. I accept the bona fides of the honourable member for Fremantle in believing that we as a Commonwealth Parliament ought to legislate to ensure that the powers of the Commission apply in respect of the activities within each State. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We on the Government side of the chamber support the federal system of Government and the compact which binds together six sovereign States in the Commonwealth of Australia. We do not believe in the imposition upon those six States of the will of Canberra. The argument is as simple and as short as that. So I say to the honourable member for Fremantle that there is nothing to prevent any State Government from going to the Commonwealth Government under proposed section 1 1 and making an arrangement with the responsible Minister for the performance on a joint basis of the functions laid down for the Commonwealth Human Rights Commission in respect of each State. I say to him that we on this side of the chamber are not prepared to impose the will of Canberra on the States. We do not believe in a centralist form of government. We support the federal system of government. </para>
        <para>It is for that very reason that I invite the honourable member for Fremantle and honourable members opposite to give this legislation a fair trial to see which States come forward and say: &#39;We would wish the Commonwealth Human Rights Commission to apply within our State territories&#39;. I think the honourable member might be surprised, because my belief is that there will be a move within the States to bring individual States under the umbrella of the Commission. </para>
        <para>In conclusion, I say that what is involved is a distinction between a centralist approach and an approach of co-operative federalism. I support the Government&#39;s stand on this matter because I believe that if we co-operate and invite the States to join us we will get a much stronger and better Human Rights Commission than if we bludgeon them over the head with a stick from Canberra. Canberra is not the fount of all wisdom and centralist government is not the best government for the people of Australia. </para>

          <para>-I join issue with a couple of the points which have been made and which, I think, seriously misinterpret both the position of the Opposition and our attitude towards this amendment. It is not a question of there being a centralist direction from Canberra; it is a question of Australia, having signed and been a party to a covenant, carrying out its obligations under that covenant. I refer the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hodgman)</inline> to Article 50 of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which states that it &#39;shall extend to all parts of federal States without any limitations or exceptions&#39;. At the time that Australia freely signed the Covenant it did not say: &#39;We must explain to all those other nation states that what we are signing binds Australia in respect of only the area of Canberra and other Federal territories&#39;. At the time the Northern Territory would also have been included. That was never suggested or implied. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The signing of a covenant of this kind is a serious exercise. It is not something that is done lightly. No one in this chamber has been more vociferous than the honourable member for Denison in reminding other nation states of their obligations under the Covenant. But what do we do when those other nation states say: &#39;When members of the national parliament of Australia go to the assemblies of the world to sign on behalf of Australia and when they call upon other nations to meet their international obligations, they do not really mean it. They really meanand what they have to be taken to mean- is that they are signing only for the area of Canberra and for a couple of small territories?Is that what the honourable member for Denison seriously wants the other nation states of the world to believe? That is the implication of the argument of the honourable gentleman. It is also the implication of the argument of the honourable member for Lilley ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kevin</inline> Cairns). </para>
        <para>In international terms and in terms of the obligations that rest upon all nation states, when we sign these covenants we have to be taken to mean what we say. What would the honourable member for Lilley and the honourable member for Denison say if there was another civil rights claim within the Soviet Union and the Soviet leadership said: &#39;When we signed this covenant, of course, we were talking only about the area of Moscow. This infringement took place in the Ukraine, which is a state, and we cannot do anything about it&#39;? That argument would be rejected out of hand by the two honourable gentlemen opposite. It would be treated with contempt by the nations who are parties to this Covenant. Just as they are entitled to treat that argument with contempt when it is raised in respect of any other nation, they are entitled to treat the argument that has been advanced by the honourable gentlemen opposite with the contempt that it deserves. We signed these Covenants pursuant to the foreign affairs power of the Commonwealth to do so under the Constitution. </para>
        <para>What we have heard tonight is an argument about States rights and the compact of federalism. What it comes down to is very simply that there are honourable members opposite who find it easier on their consciences to talk of human liberty in the noblest terms, and to wax eloquent about human rights anywhere in the world except in their home town. These gentlemen, like some of the provisions in this Bill, have transformed political hypocrisy into a new art form. The true sadness in all of this, after listening to the words that they uttered here today, is that they never seem to perceive the depth of their own deception. </para>

        <para class="block">Whilst the content of this amendment is not major, it is of great significance. In Australia, the Executive- that is, the Cabinet- can ratify international treaties such as the International Covenant without any parliamentary approval. However, the Opposition agrees with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen, Senator Publick</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> that this Parliament should express through legislation its unequivocal commitment to ratification. Ratification, of course, will not necessarily do anything for human rights; only legislation can do that. It has already been made clear that the Government is not really going to affect the problems of human rights as they exist in the States and the Northern Territory. We have a firm commitment to enacting real human rights legislation. We see ratification as a statement of that commitment. We do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> &#39;s argument that the Parliament has no place in the matter of ratification. We do not think that proposition is acceptable. Our amendment merely provides that the Parliament itself would be the instrument that would ratify the Covenant and would not just leave ratification to the Executive. I move: </para>

        </motion>
        <para class="block">Clause 9 relates to an amendment that was moved in the Senate. The purpose of our amendment is to give the Commission the power to report to the Minister on the action that Australia needs to take. Honourable members will notice that clause 9 (1) (d) contains the words &#39;when requested to do so by the Minister&#39;. We are trying to make the point that because of the amendments accepted in the Senate clause 9 ( 1) (d) is now a very anomalous provision. The preceding paragraph (c) deals with the power of the Commission to recommend Commonwealth action on its own initiative in relation to human rights. Paragraph (e) deals with the power of the Commission to report on inconsistencies between various international instruments and the Covenant. Both of these paragraphs allow the Commission to report on its own initiative. However, paragraph (d) which was introduced in the Senate and which deals with reports concerning action needed to be taken by Australia- I draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the word &#39;Australia&#39; is used against the word Commonwealth &#39;-to comply with the provisions of the Covenant only allows the exercise of that power by the Commission on the request from the Minister. So honourable members can see the inconsistency. </para>
        <para>Paragraphs (c) and (e) specify that the Commission can exercise its power on its own initiative. However, the Commission can use the power contained in paragraph (d) only when requested to do so by the Minister. So our amendment provides that when it appears desirable to the Commission to do so the Commission should take the initiative. In our view there is no sense in what the Bill provides in this respect. The Commission should be able to report on its own initiative as to what Australia should do to comply with the Covenant. </para>
        <para>We make the point that the very interesting expression introduced by the word &#39;Australia&#39; really means the whole of Australia not just the Commonwealth. In the time of the Labor Government we always substituted the word Australia&#39; in lieu of the word &#39;Commonwealth&#39;. The only meaning that could be given to the word &#39;Australia&#39; is Australia as a total concept, a continent and a complete entity. It does not mean the Government and the Parliament of the Commonwealth. It means the governments and the parliaments of the Commonwealth and of each of the States along with the Northern Territory. So there can be no argument about our first amendment. We wish to make it very clear that paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) should be completely consistent. </para>
        <para>I turn now to our second amendment to clause 9. This amendment provides that where the Commission considers it is relevant and conducive to the proper performance of any of its functions under the preceding paragraphs- those are the ones to which I have referred- and to the protection and advancement of human rights in Australia to examine and to inquire, it can make a report to the Minister as to its results. We make this explanation. The amendment is very much a compromise proposal which the Government ought to accept. It allows the Commission to investigate and report upon the state of human rights and the violation of human rights in the States and the Territories and to report to the Federal Minister upon those issues. We do not believe it goes anywhere near far enough to overcome the denial of civil liberties in State jurisdictions which, of course, have been the subject of submissions in earlier amendments. However, if the Government is serious in its view that simple publication of denials of human rights through reports in this Parliament will have a significant political impact it cannot refuse to acccept this amendment. </para>
        <para>The amendment involves no intrusion whatsoever on the rights of States which will be left with the ultimate decision about whether to change their laws, Acts and practices or otherwise. It is totally consistent with the overall philosophy, which we believe to be a very weak philosophynevertheless it is the Government&#39;s philosophyunderlying this Bill. It will improve the legislation only marginally. If any action could prove the lack of bona fides of this Government and its subordination to the governments of Queensland and Western Australia, it would be refusal to accept this very innocuous amendment. </para>

          <para>- Perhaps I might just shortly reply on behalf of the Government. As the Government has both in this place and in the other place refused to accept amendments which would extend the functions of the Human Rights Commission to include State laws and practices under State laws, it does not accept these amendments. The amendments are contrary to the Government&#39;s federalism policy under which we have a clear recognition of the proper roles and responsibilities of the States in matters of human rights. This Government works on a basis of co-operative federalism with the States and Territories within the overall political framework of the federal compact. It would not be practicable within that system of federalism within Australia for the Commonwealth to legislate and therefore to impose upon the States in areas of their constitutional responsibility all the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Against that background, both within the provisions of this Bill and through the administrative and Executive practices of the Governmentfor example, through the ministerial meetings on human rights which will be held between Commonwealth and State Ministers- the Commonwealth will be embarking upon co-operation with the States and the Northern Territory in the field of human rights. Particularly through the ministerial meetings on human rights it will operate through a forum for intergovernmental discussions on human rights matters. Therefore, what we are doing is totally consistent with the federal compact of the political structure of Australia under the Australian Constitutution totally consistent with our philosophy of cooperative federalism, and totally consistent with our effort to see that human rights intrude into all parts of Commonwealth and State responsibilities. </para>

        <para class="block">Paragraph (f) states:  the subject-matter of the complaint is not of sufficient concern to the complainant. </para>
        <para class="block">This clause deals with what the Human Rights Commission may do in its discretion if it wishes to hold an inquiry as a result of a complaint. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that paragraph (a) of sub-clause (4) of clause 10 gives the Commission power not to deal with the complaint if it is frivolous, vexatious or is not made in good faith. The Opposition&#39;s amendment seeks to leave out paragraph (f). It provides that the Commission need not act on a complaint if it is not of sufficient concern to the complainant. We make the point that a complaint should be dealt with on its merits without a restriction being imposed in this fashion. This matter came to notice in the second reading stage of the Bill. It was raised by the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barry Jones)</inline> who mentioned the legal doctrine of locus standi and its relevance to the formal legal rules that are to apply. Not only are many aspects of these rules objectionable, but there is a particular reason for opposing them here. We do not want frivolous, vexatious or mala fide complaints going to the Commission. However, the Commission already has power under paragraph (a) to dismiss those matters which it deems to fall into that category. </para>
        <para>Recently the honourable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Martyr)</inline> prompted a debate on one aspect of human rights. What a great opportunity this amendment would give him to make a complaint to the Commission on all the matters that concern him. He would not be precluded from making a complaint on the ground that the matter about which he sought to complain was not of sufficient concern to him personally. If we have a genuine interest in the rights of people we should not have complaints dismissed on the basis that the person complaining is not deemed to have a sufficient concern. I think it is unnecessary that the Commission should have the power to decide not to hold an inquiry on that basis. Anybody who is concerned about a matter- and in the debate so far a number of honourable members have already expressed their concern about certain matters- should at least be given the chance to request that the Commission hold an inquiry into it. That is the purpose of this amendment. </para>

          <para>- I subscribe to the view that many of the amendments moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> are motivated by a genuine belief that the Bill would be improved by the acceptance of his amendments. However, there are some clauses in the Bill which serve to protect the interests of individuals in the community who may be reported for reasons which are not well motivated. I do not wish to rake over old coals, as I said some weeks ago at the second reading stage of the Bill, but I recall very clearly being a victim of a person whose motivations were highly political. </para>

            <para>-That is right. My namesake, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, makes certain observations. I was motivated by goodwill when I drew the nation&#39;s attention to the fact that members of a certain group of people in Brisbane were stealing pension cheques from letter boxes and cashing them. For identification purposes, I mentioned that group&#39;s racial origin. I do not suppose it will do any harm, because I am not going to name the person concerned, but a Queensland Australian Labor Party senator was shooting off letters and telegrams to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> demanding that I be brought to court, so to speak. </para>

            <para>-It is a good story and it is worth repeating. I would have thought that the honourable member would have used his influence to have the amendment proposed by his  Deputy  Leader withdrawn. Obviously he has not heard the story so I have to repeat it. As I was saying, I was in all the strife in the world. The motivation of this Labor senator was political.

        <para class="block">The first amendment deals with an arrangement that can be made by the Minister with a State or the Northern Territory. According to this Bill, that arrangement would be in relation to &#39;the performance by that State or Territory or by an authority of that State of Territory on behalf of the Commonwealth . . . relating to the promotion of the observance of human rights&#39;. Let us make it very clear: On a literal interpretation, this would allow the Commission to be divested of powers, and for those powers to be given to State governments. In our view, it would be an appalling situation if powers were given to Queensland or Western Australia to administer human rights legislation which would relate only to the Commonwealth area in their State. As has been said before, one of the arguments with this whole legislation is whether human rights are more important than State rights. It is not even the Commission but the Government which will be responsible for any divesting of the powers of the Commission in favour of the States. The Commission does not even have to consent to the taking away of its powers. In other words, if the Government were prepared to put forward an amendment to the effect that such arrangements would need to be approved by the Commission and would be subject to disallowance, of course the Labor Party would have another look at the matter. But this part of the legislation, in its present form, is quite unsupportable. I think that everybody would agree with that. But we could not for one moment tolerate the fact that observance of human rights should be the subject of examination by the States I have mentioned and probably by most States in general. </para>
        <para>The second amendment deals with an arrangement being made under this sub-clause, which arrangement shall be in writing. Such an arrangement can be varied or revoked and if so, shall be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> We are suggesting that any arrangement made in this fashion shall come into force and shall take effect as provided by regulations made for the purpose. The second part of this amendment provides that if any regulations providing for the bringing into force of an arrangement are disallowed then the arrangement shall cease. This amendment seeks to give to the Parliament a veto power over any arrangements that can be made under clause 1 1. All that is required at present is the gazettal of these arrangements. The Parliament is not placed in the position of overseeing any whittling away of the powers of the Commission. </para>
        <para>A similar amendment was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen.</inline> I thought that if I mentioned that fact, this amendment might attract the support of at least one or two Government members. In our opinion, the amendment does not go quite far enough but we are happy to put a bipartisan compromise, knowing full well that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> thought that this would be the way in which to deal with the matter. In view of what has happened already, of course we can well understand that the Government is pretty blinkered to any suggestions that we might make to improve this Bill, even if we are suggesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s amendment has some merits. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Chairman,</inline> the matters have been explained at length. </para>

        <para class="block">The amendments which I have just moved raise an issue which has been before the Parliament in many ways, and that is the question of freedom of information. During the last two years two significant developments have occurred. The first is the decision of the High Court in the Sankey v. Whitlam case and the second is the all-party report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on the Freedom of Information Bill. Both the High Court and the Senate Committee clearly stated that the practice of conclusive government certificates denying access to government documents is not consistent with modern democratic practice. The Opposition opposes provisions such as this in any piece of legislation. In relation to human rights, the Commission, weak and deprived of power as it is, should have every relevant piece of evidence placed before it. </para>
        <para>Here we see a provision whereby evidence can be denied to the Commission where the Attorney-General furnishes a certificate to the Commission certifying that the disclosure of the information concerning a specified matter or the disclosure of the contents of a document would be contrary to the public interest. But we are saying: Let the Commission be the judge of that matter and do not have this sort of administrative, executive-like ability to veto information. We are well aware, when we appoint people to be commissioners, that they have a sense of responsibility. They have a sense of what would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia or the disclosure of communications. The Government just cannot leave to what might well be a bureaucratic decision on the issue of a certificate the denial of evidence to the Commission. We make the point that if the Commission is as weak as we say it is, how much weaker will it be if it cannot even get evidence because the Attorney-General furnishes the certificate. </para>
        <para>I think that what I have said adequately explains the thrust of what the Opposition is about. I think it is good for democracy that we have as much disclosure of information as is possible. It is very clear that information often held in secret is often misused at later times. It is important that, when there are matters relating to human rights in particular, the Commission so appointed is not denied evidence by a certificate which alleges that it will be a problem to furnish such information in terms of our defence, our security or for other reasons. </para>

          <para>- Just in case it should be felt that the Government was seeking, for some ulterior or sinister purpose, to put the Commission in a position where it might keep secret to itself certain information, I feel I should place the background of this clause before the Committee. These sub-clauses are similar to provisions already existing in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act and the Ombudsman Act. The question arises, as the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen)</inline> quite properly pointed out, against the background of the Freedom of Information Bill. That Bill is still under examination and will be the subject of a report by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. It is the Government&#39;s intention, until that study is  completed, to include these provisions in this Bill. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I should point out that under sub-clause (3), the Attorney-General is not required to issue a certificate. Sub-clause (3) allows the  Chairman  of the Commission to consider disclosure in some cases. So I think the Committee will appreciate that the Government considers it prudent, until final decisions are made on the terms of the Freedom of Information Bill, for these clauses to remain in this Bill as they presently exist in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act and the Ombudsman Act. </para>

        <para class="block">We say in this amendment that any person aggrieved may institute proceedings under the legislation by way of a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction for a number of remedies. We indicate in the proposed new clause what the remedies would be. There could be an injunction and an order directing the defendant to do a specified act. The question of damages could arise. There could have been damage to a person. The question of humiliation could arise. The new clause could provide for the enforcement of some other relief. The significant part in this matter is enforcement. </para>
        <para>This is one of the most important amendments to the Bill. It is a matter of record in the Senate that three Liberal Senators- Missen, Puplick and Bonner- despite their arguments in the Senate in support of these types of amendments, succumbed to the Government&#39;s pressure and did not vote for them. The provisions of the amendment are drawn from the Racial Discrimination Act which the Government, when in Opposition, supported in 1975. We do not believe it goes anywhere along the track to the effectiveness we would like, but it has the potential to transform ineffectual legislation into legislation which has some effectiveness. In other words, if a person is deemed to be aggrieved or feels aggrieved and a certificate has been furnished clearly indicating that an act or practice is inconsistent with or contrary to a human right, surely there has to be some method of enforcement. We cannot have this charade, this cosmetic piece of legislation  which says one can go so far and must then stop and nobody can do anything about it. If this amendment is rejected and the legislation containing no enforcement provisions is passed the Parliament will have abdicated its responsibilities. I will quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hamer</inline> said in the Senate. He is not of the Labor Party, as you know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Chairman.</inline> He said: </para>

Late as. it is and disappointing as it has been to hear the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> say that he is unable to agree to any reasonable argument, on this occasion the provision of enforceability where a certificate is available at least should be acceptable to the Government. </para>

          <para>- In view of the fact that the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lionel Bowen),</inline> places such weight on this amendment I should comment upon it. In doing so I do not intend to detract from the strength of the Government&#39;s argument against it. The burden of that argument was carried by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> in the Senate during the lengthy debate on the Bill in that place. I simply make the point that the amendment is inappropriate in a measure designed to establish an inquiring, conciliating, educating and reporting body. As the honourable member pointed out, this provision is drawn from the Racial Discrimination Act. One can well understand it appearing in the Racial Discrimination Act which is legislation of a different kind. Hence it is appropriate that rights created under that Act be supported by the power of an individual to commence litigation in support of that right. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Another point can be made to show the point of view adopted by the Government; that is, that this amendment is unprecedented and if it were allowed in legislation of this kind- as I have said, it is a measure designed to establish an inquiring, conciliating, educating and reporting body- it could well be a matter of creating through the back door a Bill of Rights for the Commonwealth with powers extending throughout Australia. There is a host of differences of opinion as to whether Australia, having a common law background supported by certain rights created under the Constitution, should have a Bill of Rights. The Government does not believe that citizens of Australia would be better served by a Bill of Rights than they are presently served by the conjunction of common law rights and statutory rights of the Commonwealth, States and the Territories. </para>

        <para class="block">Evidence could be obtained, and it could be reasonable evidence, but simply because a person has been a member of the Human Rights Commission, a court of this land can be prevented from getting that evidence. I do not think that is at all right. In other words, if a person were subpoenaed who had been a member of the Commission and who had evidence which was of importance to the court, why should there be this embargo, veto or suggestion that even though the evidence is available the witness cannot give it because that particular person had been a member of the Commission or a member of the staff of the Commission referred to in clause 27. This could well mean that where evidence exists we will not be able to get it. So we would have a Bill that would not allow human rights to be enforced. Under this particular cause it could take away the common law right of complainants. The evidence could be there in somebody&#39;s knowledge and somebody&#39;s control, yet it could not be got out of the witness because it was evidence gathered in the course of working for the Commission. If the Commission, in the course of its investigations, obtains evidence which a complainant might wish to place before a court, why should the complainant not be entitled to put the evidence before the court? This clause prevents it. Again I shall quote <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen.</inline> This must be of some doubtful value now because all the previous quotations have not swayed the Minister. He said that it was &#39;a highly unwise clause &#39;. </para>

            <para>-The Minister says that that is right. He is not at all swayed by whatever <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> says. A complainant in a court could say: &#39;I can get evidence from a person I can subpoena&#39;. This would be a rare occasion. A witness in the box could say: &#39;I want to give the evidence, but an objection will be made because under the Human Rights Commission Bill, even though the evidence existsthat means the truth of the matter exists- I cannot give the information to the court&#39;. I repeat, the Bill is weak enough as it is, but to deny even the admissibility of evidence on a common law normality is from the point of view of obtaining evidence, going from the sublime to the ridiculous. Accordingly, we again urge the Government to reconsider its position. If it is not prepared to do so now we urge that at least it give consideration to the matter when the measure is returned, as it must be, to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition opposes this legislation. It is not necessary to go into any detail concerning it at this stage. A cognate debate took place. The main emphasis was on the question of the Human Rights Commission and its ability to operate within State laws and ensure enforceability. The significant point about this Bill is that virtually it does away with the office of the Commissioner for Community Relations, who was appointed under a Labor administration. Although he may remain, it appears that he would be completely subservient to the Commission. That is a poor indictment, in particular, of the Government&#39;s interest in matters relating to migrants and the great job that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> has been able to do. It does appear that because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> happens to be a Labor appointee his position is to suffer a demise. </para>

            <para>- I intend to take only one minute of the time of the House. It is an indictment of this House and the Government that legislation, which takes away from a lot of small people in this community, especially migrants, will remove the Commissioner for Community Relations from their access and remove what they see as their spokesman from the Commonwealth. I know that this is embarrassing to the Government and it is embarrassing to whichever party is in power, but it is and was an office which served a very useful purpose for people who had complaints and had nowhere to go with them. Those people get no service from Liberal members when they go to them and now they will get no service from any other place. </para>

There is a long history of his continuing political activities. I plead with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> to unyoke himself from his continuing interests in politics and take racial relations out of the political forum.

There is no ethnic community in Australia which would make the accusation that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby,</inline> in endeavouring to serve ethnic harmony in this community, ever politicised his office. What we have is a typical Liberal Party smear. What was the evidence that was adduced by the honourable member opposite? Al Grassby has never nominated since he has been Commissioner for Community Relations. The mere fact that honourable members might read an allegation in a newspaper about someone in public life does not make that allegation true. </para>

I did not accept that as the truth because I read it in a newspaper. I have read that the honourable member for Fadden has a propensity for all sorts of cakes and people leaping out of them, but I do not necessarily believe that because I read it in a newspaper. I do not believe those sorts of things. I simply say that Al Grassby has served the ethnic communities well. The real test, the real judge of that, is not what his former political opponents might say on the basis of what they might read in a newspaper. The real test of that is the view of the ethnic communities themselves. There is not one ethnic community in Australia that would not give Al Grassby full measure for the job that he has done in servicing faithfully and well ethnic communities in endeavouring to reduce racial discrimination in this country. </para>

            <para>-The first three of these Bills- the Distillation Amendment Bill, the Excise Amendment Bill and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2)- relate to the production and use of ethanol as a fuel for internal combustion engines. The Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax (Repeal) Bill will remove the 2.125c a litre tax on liquefied petroleum gas used in automobiles. The measures contained in all these Bills are designed to encourage the use of alternative liquid fuels and are therefore welcomed by the Opposition as we believe there should be greater diversification in Australia&#39;s liquid fuel sources. These measures, although minor, are particularly welcomed because of the reluctance shown by the Government in the past to encourage the development of synthetic fuels. Although these policies represent a step in the right direction, a great deal more could and should be done by way of energy research, development and demonstration if synthetic fuels are to make a significant contribution to Australia &#39;s energy needs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is no single panacea to our impending problem of a shortage of domestic liquid fuels, but ethanol as a petrol extender, LPG as a substitute fuel, as well as methanol, coal liquefaction, shale oil and others can each contribute. The ultimate choice among competing fuels should be based largely on overall costs, but insufficient information about the economics of these alternatives is available at the moment. Therefore it is difficult to assess their potential impact. For this reason, the level of research needs to be increased. Although production of these fuels on a large scale may not be essential as yet, we should be in a position to commence production if the necessity arises. The record of the government, though, has been very poor in this area. A survey by the Department of National Development shows that in 1977, the Government spent $2.30 per head of population on energy research and development compared with more than $9 a head spent in the United States and West Germany and about $5 in Canada. </para>
          <para>Even the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council, which was established to foster and support additional research, has been given a very inadequate level of funding. In 1978-79 total expenditure by NERDDC was only $4m and in 1979-80 the budgetted figure is $9.1m. This years&#39; expenditure will represent only 0.3 per cent of total oil revenue flowing to the Government. That is very low indeed. Revenue from crude oil will be at least $2,400m and excise on refined products will reap the Government $956m, but expenditure on energy research will be only $9. 1 m. This is far too low. Expenditure on ethanol research is even less impressive. In 1978-79, NERDDC allocated funds for ethanol research totalling $ 1 . 55m to be spent over three years. If this Government were really concerned about the development of alternative liquid fuels, this level of expenditure would be increased. </para>
          <para>Let me look specifically at the measures contained in these Bills now before the House. They are aimed at encouraging small scale farm production of ethanol. The main measure is to introduce a new class of distilling licence to be known as an &#39;experimenters&#39; licence which will authorise the distillation of spirits from any material to enable research into the production of ethanol for use as a fuel. This should enable a more realistic assessment of the technical, environmental and administrative problems involved in small scale ethanol production and may also allow for a better assessment of production costs. The other major change contained in this legislation is to remove the excise on ethanol. Currently it attracts a duty of $19.25 per litre, which itself makes the cost of ethanol prohibitive as a fuel extender. </para>
          <para>Although this Government&#39;s policies on alternative fuels leave a lot to be desired, these measures are at least moving in the right direction. Ethanol, or ethyl alcohol, has the advantage that it can be produced from a range of plantsthe most promising in Australia being sugar cane, sugar beet, cassava and wheat. It can be used directly as a fuel in turbines or mixed with petrol in standard internal combustion engines, and has the added advantage of being less polluting than motor spirit. The use of ethanol in Australia has so far been negligible although blends of up to 15 per cent have been used in some areas of Queensland in the past. </para>
          <para>The one country that has used ethanol on a large scale is Brazil. A compulsory alcohol addition to gasolene to a level of 5 per cent was legislated for in 1931. The major motivation at the time was to stabilise the sugar industry. Since then the alcohol content has varied. At present the average blend is about 9 per cent ethanol. Brazil is also the only country producing engines for straight ethanol use. About 600 cars are running on an experimental basis at the moment. Brazil of course is placed quite differently from other countries. It is endowed with considerable amounts of spare fertile land and a major factor in the development of ethanol has been the chronic overproduction of sugar. The gasahol program in the United States has also been facilitated by overproduction problems in the maize industry, as well as subsidisation by the Government. </para>
          <para>The major barrier to ethanol usage in Australia is its high cost of production. There is considerable uncertainty about the costs involved and recent studies have come up with a wide range of estimates. One study by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation put the cost range in December 1978 at between 38c and 49c a litre for ethanol produced from cassava, 44c from sugar cane and 48c from wheat. These figures compare with an average cost at that time of 12c for motor spirit ex-refinery. This study concluded:   . . there are no economic reasons for turning to the renewable resource based alcohol fuels at present. </para>
          <para class="block">However, other studies have shown less pessimistic results. The Sydney University Research Centre believes that ethanol could be produced at a cost of between 22c and 28c a litre. This lower cost estimate is reached because of the development of a different technology which reduces conversion process costs. </para>
          <para>One of the factors contributing to poor economics is the low energy efficiency of ethanol production. The final liquid fuel product represents only 30 per cent to 40 per cent of total energy inputs compared with about 90 per cent for refined fuels from crude oil. A considerable amount of waste is also produced. Nine to 12 litres of waste have to be disposed of for every one litre of ethanol produced. Even though the marginal economics at this stage dictate against large scale ethanol production, they do indicate that more research work is necessary. Small scale research is one means of doing this. Alcohol blends still have economic problems but it is hoped that with further development the technology will become more efficient and thus competitive with conventional fuels. </para>
          <para>The other Bill now before the House relates to the removal of the 2.125c a litre excise on LPG for automotive use. This decision, announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> in his energy speech in June last year, is supported by the Opposition. LPG could ultimately satisfy 10 per cent to 15 per cent of Australia&#39;s liquid fuel requirements, although the Government&#39;s current policies are acting against the full utilisation of this fuel. Because of the policy of pricing domestically consumed LPG at the ruling export price, the price has increased from $88 a tonne in January last year to $252 a tonne at present. These price increases have had a detrimental effect on the use of LPG both in motor vehicles and as a general fuel. As an automotive fuel, LPG still remains competitive with motor spirit, despite the recent price increases. The price differential is currently about 14c a litre, which means that conversion costs are recouped in about 34,000 kilometres. However, demand for car conversions has dropped off considerably because fleet owners are concerned about the likelihood of further large price increases removing this price differential. They are also worried about safety standards. </para>
          <para>This Government&#39;s policies on LPG are, to put it mildly, in chaos. It has policies aimed at encouraging the use of LPG but at the same time it has a pricing policy which discourages its use. The most significant impact of this policy has been on household users. LPG is now considerably more expensive than electricity, but the cost of conversion to electricity for an average house is about $ 1 ,500. Natural gas reticulation in some towns will provide relief in the next few years, but for the remainder the choice is between high LPG prices and converting to electricity at considerable expense. Because of this, the Government found itself in a position of having to introduce a subsidy of $80 a tonne for household users. But this subsidy is still not operational. Also, two days after the subsidy was announced the price of LPG was increased by $ 105 a tonne which more than offset any benefit likely to arise from the subsidy. An additional problem associated with nigh LPG prices for households is that many gas utilities are in severe financial difficulties and are threatening to close. The Government&#39;s policies on LPG have only resulted in rapidly increasing prices and in considerable confusion. If LPG is to make a significant contribution to Australia&#39;s liquid fuel supplies, the Government must act to sort out this mess. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I direct my remarks to the Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax (Repeal) Bill. Firstly, I congratulate the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland),</inline> the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and the Government on making this important move. Currently, transport uses 57 per cent of all oil consumed in Australia. This figure is expected to remain fairly constant over the next 10 years. Products derived from oil are the only form of efficient portable energy available for the time being. Liquefied petroleum gas appears to be the only visible alternative to oil presently available to meet our short term needs. Although LPG cannot be envisaged as a major alternative fuel for motor vehicles, the National Energy Advisory Committee in its report of July 1979 predicts that by 1990 the indigenous supply of LPG should be sufficient for about 5 per cent of the national motor spirit market or about 8 per cent of the spirit market in Melbourne and Sydney. It is within the major cities, particularly Melbourne and Sydney, that LPG can be seen as an alternative fuel. Rural areas in Victoria are also particularly suited for the use of LPG as an automotive fuel. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On a national basis, 67 per cent of motor vehicles are used in urban areas and account for 74 per cent of the total motor spirit consumed. Taxis, buses, fleet vehicles and transports are just a few of the areas where LPG can reduce transportation costs as well as the level of exhaust emission fumes. The Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria, a government statutory authority, has recognised the need for conservation of our liquid fuels by establishing the LP Auto-gas Division. This Division has been created to promote the use of LPG as a viable alternative to petrol. The LP Autogas Division provides a complete service to the motorist who is interested in converting his car or truck to LPG. There is a display showroom featuring imported and locallyproduced equipment, a workshop manned by specially trained mechanics and a fleet of demonstration vehicles. </para>
          <para>In July 1979 the Gas and Fuel Corporation, as part of its LPG promotion, conducted a four-day car economy trial around Victoria. The aim of the trial was to promote and to encourage the motoring public to consider LPG as a reliable, economical and low-pollution alternative fuel. Based on metropolitan fuel prices at that time the results of the trial indicated that cars running on LPG saved an average of 45 per cent on fuel costs. Further tests on the LPG-converted vehicles established a number of other benefits for the motorist such as longer engine life, longer spark plug life, fewer oil changes, clean exhaust emissions, smoother driving power through higher octane rating and minimisation of fuel losses by spillage. </para>
          <para>In September of last year, the Federal Government Members Transport Committee, led by its very active  chairman,  the honourable member for Mitchell <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cadman),</inline> also conducted a road trial over three days. The route was from Sydney to Canberra, then returning to Sydney. The trial produced significant information that had not previously been available on exhaust emissions for LPG and diesel fuelled vehicles compared with petrol driven cars. The tests, which were conducted by officers of the New South Wales Department of Motor Transport, showed that the amount of carbon monoxide emitted from the petrol fuelled car was 21.84 grams per kilometre compared with 1.12 grams per kilometre for the LPG powered car and 0.45 grams per kilometre for the diesel engine car. The introduction of stage 3 of the Australian Design Rule 270 on emission controls would require carbon monoxide emissions to be reduced to a maximum of 18.6 grams per kilometre. LPG emissions are far below this level and far below the emissions from petrol fuelled motor vehicles envisaged in the near future. </para>
          <para>In recent months there has been considerable speculation about the price differential between automotive LPG and petrol. Many refer to this matter on a percentage basis. However, I look at it in terms of a cash difference- that is, the actual cash margin between the prices of automotive LPG and super grade petrol. Based on Melbourne prices we can see what in actual fact has occurred. In January 1979, the price of super grade petrol was 20.7c per litre compared with 1 1.3c for LPG, a price differential of 9.4c. But at the end of January this year the price of super grade petrol was 33.1c per litre and the price of LPG was 18.5c per litre, a differential in price of 14.6c favouring LPG. I repeat that the price of automotive LPG was 9.4c per litre cheaper than the price of super grade petrol in January last year, but is currently 14.6c per litre cheaper. Whilst I realise that these margins vary according to the relevant freight rate on each fuel in different parts of Australia, I emphasise the economic viability of LPG to many motorists in Australia who are above average users of their vehicles. </para>
          <para>The Government is committed to an energy conservation program which is designed to encourage a shift in energy use away from oil to alternative fuels. In June of last year the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> announced a number of initiatives to encourage the wider use of LPG, including the removal of the 2.15c per litre liquefied gas road vehicle tax. This Bill will repeal that tax and is a vitally important part of the program. I am acutely aware of the effect that recent massive price rises have had on the interest of motorists to convert their cars to LPG. The industry has virtually come to a standstill in spite of the obvious economic advantages I have already explained. I have joined with my colleagues in pressing the Government in the strongest terms to look at the future of automotive LPG pricing with the aim of restoring the conversion industry to its former vigour. I must say that delays in implementing safety regulations in the States have had a most detrimental effect on vehicle conversions. However, the industry is poised to resume as soon as these various matters have been resolved. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I join the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> in discussing cognately these four Bills before the House. I would like especially to talk briefly about the Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax (Repeal) Bill 1979 because I think that it and the allied subject matter shown an incredible amount of inconsistency and confusion on the part of the Government. As the honourable member for Indi <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ewen Cameron),</inline> who preceded me in this debate, has indicated, there is a great deal of concern about the effect of the Government&#39;s policy. The purpose of the Liquefied Gas (Road Vehicle Use) Tax (Repeal) Bill is to remove the tax on liquefied gas for road vehicle use. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think I should say as a matter of historical interest that the tax was first proposed, and sensibly proposed, in the Budget Speech of the then Treasurer in 1974-75. The view was taken, quite appropriately that users of liquefied gas propelled vehicles made no contribution to government revenue while users of vehicles powered by other fuels significantly contributed to the maintenance of roads. The rate of tax at that time was set at 2c per litre. I understand that that was 40 per cent of the rate of excise duty on petrol at that time. It was set so as not to erode revenue and not to inhibit the expansion of the use of gas. It was also determined that for five years increases in the tax would be limited to 50 per cent of the increases that occured in the petrol excise. </para>
          <para>In August 1 977 the tax was increased to 2.125c a litre. This increase was in line with the increase that occured in the petrol excise. As part of an energy conservation program and with the intention of shifting energy use from oil, the tax is to be removed. I suppose this action would represent a consensus from both sides of the House. There is obviously a feeling that use of liquified petroleum gas should be encouraged and if the imposition of an excise is a deterrent to that use, then it is a reasonable proposition that that excise should be removed. In fact, I understand that although we are discussing this Bill on 19 March the abolition of the tax is to be effective from 28 June 1979. 1 think that is provided for in clause 2 of the Bill. I am not quite sure how that can be done, but I understand that is the situation. I may be corrected by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Garland)</inline> if I am wrong in that regard. </para>
          <para>The encouragement of the use of LPG as a conservation measure seems to me to be retarded. This Government has contrived to hike up the price of LPG because of its world parity pricing policies. LPG happens to be the casualty in this respect. LPG has gone to world parity pricing and oil prices have not yet gone to world parity. There is obviously some inconsistency in the Government&#39;s attitude in this regard. I understand that the oil industry does not complain at all about the price differential between petrol and LPG which averages 13c a litre. There is no move to cream off the oil company profits in any way by an excise tax or any other kind of penalty. Of course, the oil companies are wallowing in a very lucrative harvest as a result of the world pricing policy. Whilst the oil companies are happy enough, the consumers are unhappy. The large fleet owners around the countryside are extremely displeased. They want to see some changes about world parity pricing. They have to hone in on this world pricing factor. I think many of them feel that the Government has gone too far in its enthusiasm in bringing LPG to world parity pricing. </para>
          <para>So far as parity pricing of oil is concerned, there has been a recent switch in government policy. I think there is a reflection of the attitude of the electorate in that respect. I think the Government is now going to review the policy every six months, or at least after every election. It is certainly not anxious to put up the price of petrol as a result of world parity policies. After all, the cost of petrol has risen from 16.5c a litre to 35c a litre since the Fraser Government took office in 1975. </para>

              <para>-I was referring to the increase since December 1975. 1 stand corrected. This is an increase of over 120 per cent in four years. But the great price leap in LPG was caused by the fact that LPG moved to full parity pricing on 20 January. The price rose by $105 a tonne. As I said, parity pricing for oil has yet to be achieved. LPG has already achieved it. That is the real distinction. That is the very essence of the argument that is taking place about this matter. This is what the honourable member for Indi was referring to. The incentive to operate on LPG is decreasing because the price differential is decreasing. I think some fun and games are going on in relation to this matter. I think the Government is invoking a thimble and pea act. </para>

          <para>Let me put the matter to the House in this way: On 19 January the Government introduced an $80 a tonne domestic subsidy on propane gas. On 20 January, the next day, the Government accepted a Prices Justification Tribunal recommendation to raise the price of propane by $ 105 a tonne to $252 a tonne. In other words the benefits accruing from the subsidy were neutralised. The price of LPG soared from $88 a tonne in January 1979 to $252 a tonne for propane and $290 a tonne for butane. </para>

The honourable member who asked me that question is obviously interested in this matter because it affects the rural consumer. I understand there is an enormous amount of controversy in the ranks of the Government and that there have been delegations of back bench members to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and other Ministers complaining about this matter. The rural people are up in arms about the effect of these policies. Domestic use for country users is fast going out of fashion. Country people are the victims of this Government&#39;s policy. It seems to me that natural gas and electricity are priced more competitively. It is an absurd situation if the whole purpose of this policy is supposed to have regard to the need to reduce oil prices and to use gases, the products of petrol, if on the other hand because of the circumstances to which I have referred the prices are becoming uncompetitive. </para>

          <para>The honourable member for Indi made some reference to safety factors. I just want to mention this matter very briefly. I feel the Government has been quite inept and inadequate in its handling of safety factors. I suppose one could say that there is a constitutional prerogative on the part of the States in relation to this matter, but we obviously cannot have different standards in the six States and the Territories of Australia. There has to be a far more significant lead on the part of the national Government to popularise the use of LPG in vehicles and to look at the safety issues. I see a number of newspaper headings which have just been made available to me and which refer to the high level of danger that apparently still prevails in respect of the use of LPG vehicles. I see in the <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne Herald</inline> on 25 October 1979 an article headed &#39;40 flaws in LPG rules &#39;. The article stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Society of Automotive Engineers has found more than 40 flaws in the regulations governing installation of liquid petroleum gas in vehicles. </para>
            <para>The Society has sent a report to the Australian Standards Association, urging changes to the regulations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Some people contend that we take unnecessary risks when we arrive at a service station and seek to fill a vehicle from a container, that we should be able to buy a container; just as truck drivers go out and buy oxygen and acetylene in containers, we should be able to do that and place the containers which are filled with gas in our vehicles. Whether that is controversial- I see one member shaking his head as though he does not accept it as a fair proposition- the fact is that many other proposals have been put forward by the Society of Automotive Engineers which seem to be beyond argument. Insufficient work has been done in that regard. </para>

          <para>-As most honourable members probably know, I am no longer the shadow Minister for Veterans &#39; Affairs. However, tonight I want to raise an issue which I promised a veteran I would raise. I want to deal with a matter that concerns <inline font-weight="bold">Mr James</inline> Hammond of 16 Palmerston Street, Currajong, North Queensland, who was referred to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ted</inline> Lindsay, who is the Australian Labor Party candidate for the Federal seat of Herbert, which includes the town of Currajong. During service in France in July 1916 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hammond</inline> received a bullet wound in the abdomen and side and was taken prisoner by the Germans. As a prisoner of war he endured three difficult operations and was in hospital for five or six months. Following great discomfort and uncertainty he was finally found unfit by a German medical board and was subsequently exchanged for a German POW and repatriated to Switzerland for the rest of the war. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>First he received a disability pension of approximately 10 shillings a week, as he remembers it, for some years after the war. Then, because he was working, he did not bother about the pension. For the last 15 years or so he has received a 70 per cent disability pension, which on present figures amounts to just under $30 a week. In 1979 his condition worsened. Let us remember that he is now 84 years of age. In 1 979 following an increase in the severity of existing symptoms as well as in the number of symptoms, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hammond</inline> who was then aged 83, applied for an increase in the rate of disability pension. He was at that time suffering from increased pain in the region of the abdominal wound. I might point out that his abdominal wound was severe. One part of his iliac crest was shot away and his intestines were damaged and exposed when he was originally injured. Following his application for an increase he was summarily informed that his pension had not been increased from 70 per cent but had in fact been reduced to the 30 per cent rate of only $ 12.56 a week because allegedly he had been over-assessed previously. </para>
        <para>I must say that this Government has behaved in an extremely callous way. I think even honourable members opposite would agree that this person who is aged 84 has not received very much recompense from this country after having been severely injured in the First World War. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hammond</inline> applied on the advice of his medical practitioner for an increase in his disability pension because the disability was getting worse. But what did the Government do? It reduced his pension from 70 per cent to 30 per cent. How much will the Government save by reducing its assessment of his level of disability? It just strikes me that this is possibly over-zealousness on the part of some officers in the Department of Veterans&#39; Affairs. I know that the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann)</inline> was not able to come into the House tonight. I told him that I would be speaking on this matter and he apologised for not being able to be here. I hope that as a result of my raising this matter in the House people will have another look at it. I hope that they will look at the report from the Department which reduced this already miserly pension of just over $29 a week to below $ 1 3 a week. </para>
        <para>I hope not only that will <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hammond</inline> be helped but also that the Minister will instruct his Department possibly not to be too precise in the application of very stringent rules. We should remember that we are dealing with a person who is 84 years of age, who was very severely injured originally, but who did not take advantage of his pension rights to which he has been entitled for the last 60 years until he became very old. But when his condition worsened and he applied for an increase he received a letter <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> the Department informing him that his assessed rate of disability has been decreased. I appeal to the Government to reverse this decision and to realise that the treatment he has received can only be described as callous in the extreme. </para>

          <para>- I want to raise a matter that arises from a statement made by the honourable member for Phillip <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Birney)</inline> regarding the decision of somebody to place the royal coat of arms on the new High Court of Australia building. In an article which was published in a Sydney newspaper the honourable gentleman described the Chief Justice of Australia as pompous. The article reads: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>A Liberal MP today described the Chief Justice <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick as &#39;pompous&#39; for wanting a $2 million British coat of arms on the new High Court building. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I think that this is quite an unwarranted attack on the Chief Justice. For a start, the coat of arms is not costing $2m. I do not know how much it is costing, but it is not $2m. As I understand it, the decision was not made by the Chief Justice alone, because ever since the High Court of Australia Act was passed last year all of the decisions relating to the administration of the High Court have had to be taken by the court. So every member of the court is responsible for its decision, which the honourable member quite rightly condemns, but he is wrong in sheeting the whole of the blame on to the Chief Justice. </para>
        <para>I went to the building and I was astonished and appalled at the waste of public funds on it. The extravagance of the building is, I repeat, appalling. The honourable member is correct in drawing attention to that aspect of it. It is a court of Australia. The court should proudly bear the </para>
        <para class="block">Australian coat of arms and none other, perhaps apart from the coats of arms of the various six States. This court exists to interpret the Commonwealth Constitution and to act in this country as the highest court of appeal from decisions made in any of the courts of the various States. To have the royal coat of arms there would be archaic. I believe that every member of the High Court, not just the Chief Justice, is guilty of an offence against Australia&#39;s dignity and nationality. No red blooded Australian can get any pride out of having the royal coat of arms on the highest court in the land. </para>
        <para>The honourable gentleman went on to say that it is the function of the Chief Justice to interpret the laws of Australia. It is about time that he understood that this is his only function. I must repeat: Why has the honourable gentleman gone out of his way to pick on one judge when he knows perfectly well that under the High Court of Australia Act all the Judges are equally responsible for decisions of the High Court. The High Court is not administered by a single judge- by the Chief Justice. It is administered by the court. It is quite clear that that is what has to happen. </para>
        <para>What worries me is that, from the investigation I have made, the Public Works Committee has never been consulted by the High Court in this matter. The decision of the court- I repeat the court, not the Chief Justice- to put up the royal coat of arms in the High Court and the cost of it are matters that were never put to the Public Works Committee, ratified or endorsed. Of all organisations and institutions in the country that ought to know the law in relation to the duties of the Public Works Committee, it is the High Court. The High Court above all, should know that nothing it does should transcend or contravene the law. That is what has happened. The decision to put up that expensive coat of arms, although it did not cost the $2m mentioned, is a contravention of the law. </para>

            <para>-The honourable member for Shortland &#39;s reading of the Standing Orders reconciles with my recollection. It is difficult at times to follow the exchange of interjections and conversation when they are at levels higher than should occur. The Chair was attending to the honourable member for Dension to ensure that he did not contravene the Standing Orders, but he was sailing very close to the wind. I will require the honourable member for Denison to be more circumspect in the use of his language. </para>

Under the latter, there is a vigour brought to debate which really tests the Standing Orders. In a case where an honourable member can persuade the Chair and the House that another honourable member has genuinely offended, the Chair would request the honourable member offending to accommodate the situation and to withdraw.

I raise a matter which is of serious concern to a number of people and has a direct relevance to the future development of our defence forces. At present there is a situation whereby members serving in the defence forces reserve receive their pay for service tax-free. When that member puts in his time in the interests of the nation, he receives taxfree income. I think that every member of this chamber is aware of that situation and agrees with it. </para>

        <para>There is, however, a second group of persons serving in the Citizen Military Forces who are currently being persecuted by the Department of Social Security, I think within the law, but nevertheless outside the spirit of the arrangements for those people. They are having the amounts they receive in payment for service in the CMF or other reserve occupations in the armed forces deducted from their unemployment benefit when that benefit is their sole source of income. So in fact they are being taxed on 100 per cent of their earnings less a minor amount. They are much worse off in income terms than would normally be the case with the person who receives additional income in the form of tax-free income. These people are penalised. Not only are they penalised directly and in advance, but they are penalised in arrears. They receive their cheques once every six months. That income is regarded as past earnings and they are then penalised on unemployment benefit payments which they will be in receipt of in the future. </para>

            <para>-Whether they can average it or not, the facts of the matter are that they are penalised for the receipt of moneys for service in the reserve, whereas a person who may have an income of $20,000 a year is given a tax-free benefit. I do not dispute that tax-free benefit. What I am saying is that all members of the reserve should be treated the same. Members of the reserve who participated in a three-day camp in Victoria over the long weekend will lose two weeks&#39; unemployment benefit for their service to the nation. Those who participate in long camps- and there are a few of those each yearand who happen to be unemployed for a relatively short period will be required to go one week without unemployment benefit before payment is restored. I think the Government ought to do something about the matter. </para>

          <para>- I too raise a matter in the adjournment debate tonight which I am sure will meet with the concern of all honourable members. Some days ago, the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Margaret</inline></para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Guilfoyle) made certain announcements regarding funding programs under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act. I notice that a great many members of the Parliament, both Government and Opposition, had some very good news regarding those announcements. However, it was soon brought to my attention that the Ferntree Gully and District Association for the Mentally Handicapped did not win approval for a residential hostel for the Knoxbrooke association. As my colleague, the honourable member for Casey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Falconer)</inline> confirms, this is a most excellent local organisation which applied in 1976 for Commonwealth funding towards the establishment of a hostel to accommodate certain residents of the area who are mentally handicapped. </para>
        <para>It was a great disappointment to me to discover that the Knoxbrooke proposal had missed out on the funding announced for 1980-81.I say tonight that, from the point of view of residents of my electorate, the announcements so far are not acceptable. I came into bat in this Parliament in 1 975 and one of the specific matters on which I was elected to this Parliament was that I would obtain for the Knoxbrooke group funding for that residential hostel. At the time, I went out on a limb to give an undertaking that in the course of my parliamentary career I would obtain funding for this proposal. There would be some cynics around who whould say that my time is running out. However, I am not one of those who would likely succumb to a situation whereby the Government that I represent fails to make a commitment which I believe should be met. I say that it should be met because, in relative terms, the number of mentally handicapped people in the electorate of La Trobe who are getting to the age where they can no longer be cared for by their parents and consequently will require hostel accommodation is very considerable indeed. </para>
        <para>I was pleased to see that the Monkami association gained approval for its hostel proposal, and I congratulate the honourable member for Casey in that regard. However, I say in the most unequivocal terms that I believe that the Minister for Social Security should look again at the funding programs for 1 980-8 1 . On the basis of equity, justice and priorities for those most in need, I believe that the Minister should give the most earnest consideration to approving the Knoxbrooke project. In the days and weeks ahead, I will be reinforcing that statement at every opportunity that is available to me. On behalf of the people of La Trobe, I cannot accept the decision so far and I appeal once again to the Minister to reconsider her announcement. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>to (7) The &#39;print-outs&#39; referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> article are believed to be a copy of handwritten notes maintained by operation supervisors at the Sydney (Pitt) Manual Assistance Centre for recording disturbances during shifts. The maintenance of such notes is standard practice at all Manual Assistance Centres, but it is considered that the release of working documents of this nature would not provide meaningful information to persons not fully conversant with the total operational system. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>References in the article to overtimings and charging faults in relation to the Pitt IOC exchange were drawn from a copy of the minutes of a meeting of an engineering operations team which meets monthly to review the performance of this very large and complex exchange, to investigate and follow up any observed deviations from normal operation, and detect potential problems. Almost all of the problems referred to in the minutes represent minor disturbances to the IOC exchange operation which have no impact on subscriber connections. </para>
          <para>In the event of a failure of a IOC exchange all metering is suspended until the controlling computers return to normal operation. At that stage calls which have terminated are recognised and are cleared down. Claims that the IOC exchange causes massive overcharging when computerfailures occur are therefore unfounded. Combinations of faults in the Telecom network can give rise to incorrect charging but the probability of these faults occurring together to cause overcharging to a particular subscriber is very small. In general the network is designed to &#39;fail safe&#39;, that is, to either undercharge or not meter at all when a failure occurs. </para>
          <para>All queries concerning subscribers&#39; accounts are investigated to the fullest extent in both the technical and accounting areas and there is no hesitation in making an adjustment to an account which is shown to be incorrect. If there is any justifiable reason to doubt the accuracy of the account the benefit of doubt is given to the subscriber. </para>
          <para>As mentioned, the network is designed to undercharge in cases of equipment failure, however, the overall level of complaints about metered calls is low compared with the use made of the national network. Less than 1 per cent of telephone accounts are queried in a total of about 9 million accounts issued each year with a large number of these complaints being related to new subscribers&#39; first accounts. Instances of overcharging due to proven technical failures are rare. Nevertheless about.05 per cent of accounts issued are adjusted in favour of the subscribers concerned, mostly as a matter of business judgment. These figures include cases where error is due to human factors. </para>
          <para>I have previously indicated the Government&#39;s commitment to the introduction of a system of automatic message accounting for telephone accounts. Such a system is now being introduced progressively for international subscriber dialling. Introduction of AMA for STD calls will be a substantial engineering undertaking involving the installation of new equipment. Although the number of accounts presently disputed is small such a call record system would obviously be appreciated by many subscribers and Telecom presently plans to introduce AMA for STD calls progressively as an optional service. </para>

              <para>1 ) Yes. The amounts quoted, however, which are rates per kilogram, refer only to excesses of letters, postcards, small packets and printed papers (other than those enclosed in special bags.) The Universal Postal Union Congress decided to retain the existing rate, equivalent to about $0.56 per kilogram of excess, for the special printed papers bags known in Australia as &#39;Printpost Direct Bags&#39;. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>It is difficult, at this stage, to estimate the precise amount but current estimates indicate that Australia could receive an additional $A9m (approximately) in the first year of application of the new rates. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Yes. Because of changing mail patterns, however, it is difficult to estimate, at this stage, sums which will be paid in 1981 when the new rates come into force. It is expected though that, from 1981, the annual sums paid to Australia will be something in excess of $5m from United States of America and $2m from United Kingdom. </para>

            <item label="(4)">
              <para>It is estimated that nearly 90 per cent of overseas publications purchased by the bulk of Australian libraries come from the United States of America and Great Britain. The larger academic institutions might be expected to be closer to 80 per cent because of their foreign purchases to support various teaching programmes. The National Library of Australia purchases 47 per cent of its publications from the United States of America and Great Britain, the remainder come from other sources to fulfil the National Library &#39;s policy and role of collecting material which other libraries deliberately do not collect. </para>

              <para>The estimated annual expenditure by Australian libraries on library materials is $50 million. No figures are available nor could be accurately estimated for the purchase value of periodicals only.

            <para>The Consumer Price Index comprises 105 expenditure classes (eg beef and veal, lamb and mutton, fresh fruit). Each of these expenditure classes has a weight reflecting its relative importance in consumption in the period chosen as the weighting base period. The weights for expenditure classes remain fixed for about 5 years at a time. The weights are reviewed at about 5 yearly intervals and where necessary are changed to reflect up-to-date consumption patterns; in other words a new weighting base period is adopted. Thus in compiling the quarterly Consumer Price Index numbers no account is taken of short term changes in consumption. The last review of the CPI weights was completed in 1977 when weights reflecting consumption patterns in 1974-75 were introduced. The next review is underway now and is planned to be completed in 1982. This review will take account of changes in consumption patterns which have taken place since 1974-75 and in general the new weights will reflect consumption patterns in 1979-80. </para>

              <para>Individual recognised hospitals in Australia report to their appropriate State health authorities. Currently, there are variations between States as to reporting procedures, and the Uniform Financial Procedures Committee of the Hospital and Allied Services Advisory Council has been working for some time to produce uniform reporting acceptable to all States. </para>

          </list>
          <para>At the Commonwealth level, some aggregate data is dealt with on a nationally uniform basis. Also, the Commonwealth receives financial and operating data on individual recognised hospitals as part of the Commonwealth/State hospital cost-sharing arrangements. Although individual hospitals may not record financial or statistical information in a nationally uniform manner, this information when supplied to the Commonwealth is in a standard format which enables it to be computer processed into general categories so as to provide broadly uniform financial data and statistics on a national basis for those general categories. Because the initial detailed data may not be exactly comparable comparisons on an individual hospital basis may generally not be satisfactory, but as stated above work is proceeding towards uniformity. No doubt the Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals will also be examining hospital data provision, collection, reporting and dissemination. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: (a), (b) and (c) very preliminary estimates of health expenditure in Australia in 1978-79 are that total expenditure was approximately $7,950m. Outlays from Commonwealth Government sources were $2,901m. Data to enable estimates of expenditure by State and local government and private sources in 1978-79 to be made are not expected to become available for some months. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Recently revised estimates of expenditure on health in 1977-78 show that, of a (rounded) total of $7,293m, the Commonwealth Government provided $2,690m State and local governments $ 1 , 745m, and private sources $2, 857m. </para>

            <para>-The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member&#39;s question:  (1), (2) and (3) My attention was drawn to statements by the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs, in an interview broadcast on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> on 20 September 1979, in answer to questions about the underspending of grants made through my Department to the Queensland Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Porter</inline> said that &#39;approval often comes through late in the year&#39; and the onset of the wet season could delay building programs in communities in north Queensland. He also referred to &#39;general initiatives which we don&#39;t accept in this State because we regard them as antipathetic to the indigenous people&#39;s best interests&#39;. The latter comments could not relate to funds provided through State Grants which are made to support programs proposed by Queensland Government Departments. There was significant underspending between 1975-76 and 1978-79 in State Grant programs administered by the Queensland Departments of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement, Health and Education but I am not aware of any &#39;points of difference still outstanding between the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Queensland Government&#39; in relation to this matter, though not all the unspent moneys have yet been repaid. </para>

              <para>1 ) Our understanding of French policy in New Caledonia is that while France is committed to a lengthy development plan- the first 10-year phase of which will cost $A1,450mthis commitment is not necessarily exclusive of consideration of independence.  President  Giscard D&#39;Estaing reaffirmed France&#39;s support for the plan during a visit he made to New Caledonia in July 1 979 but also implied that France would abide by the will of the majority of voters in the territory should they indicate preference for independence when he said &#39;. . . this program will not be conceived nor imposed from afar. France will do nothing against the will of the people, democratically expressed. You have the real responsibility for your own future &#39;. </para>

              <para>) The development plan itself does not refer explicitly to independence. But in presenting it to the Territorial Assembly in Noumea in February 1979, Secretary of State for Overseas Territories Dijoud, asked the independentist parties publicly to defer independence ambitions for the next ten years. This was not accepted by those parties which have, accordingly, rejected the plan itself. </para>

            <para>The Ministers also announced that in response to a request from the British Government, the Government had decided that the small team at Bindura would remain in Rhodesia until shortly before independence. The team of four led by Lieutenant Colonel Hubble, would take on more of a liaison role at regional level between elements of the Patriotic Front and the Rhodesian Security Forces. The Ministers said that reconciliation and integration of the formerly opposing forces would be an important task in the transitional period between the elections and independence. </para>
