<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a point. The convention has been that two hours' notice is given to the Opposition of statements of such significance. To this point we have not seen the statement. We have had a copy of the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry for much less than an hour before the House commenced. It is obvious that if the matter is not debated forthwith-given the reputation of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) based on a solid track record in this place- it never will see the light of day as a matter for debate in this Parliament. Therefore, the implication is clear: The Government does not wish to have an extended or even a limited debate on this matter in this Parliament today. In those circumstances I register for the record the snide tactic being adopted by the Prime Minister, the obvious motivation being to avoid exposure to rigorous debate and criticism, and suggest that the proper procedures ought to be adopted on this occasion. The Opposition should receive two hours' notice. At the very least there should be a firm undertaking that debate will be suspended and will proceed at about five o'clock this afternoon so that we can more extensively consider the material before us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I have presented the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry. In mid-August 1981, discoveries were made in the United States of America of horse meat having been substituted for beef by an Australian meat export establishment. Immediate steps were taken both in the United States and in Australia to retain meat from the establishment concerned. As a result of these discoveries, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) took a number of immediate steps to which I shall later refer in more detail. When this substitution became public knowledge in both countries there was a public outcry , particularly in Australia. Allegations of widespread malpractice were made in this Parliament and in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the immediate effectiveness of the measures taken at that time the Australian meat industry had been severely tarnished. It was imperative, Mr Speaker, that Australia's international reputation be cleared. The Government believed that the only means by which this could be achieved to the satisfaction of everyone in the community was through the establishment of a Royal Commission of high standing and repute to examine the matter. Letters patent appointing the Honourable Mr Justice Woodward to conduct the Royal Commission were issued by His Excellency the Governor-General on 12 September 1981. The Commission was charged with inquiring into:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Whether administrative arrangements and procedures for the supervision of the handling of meat for export are adequate to ensure that all meat exported from Australia meets the requirements prescribed by law;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Whether malpractices are occurring, or have occurred, in the handling of meat for export or the exportation of meat;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Allegations made, whether in public or to a Minister, department or authority of the Commonwealth, of malpractices alleged to have occurred during the past ten years, in the handling of meat for export or in the exportation of meat;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Whether such allegations were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Whether in response to such allegations, any illegality or corruption occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>As allegations had been made also in relation to malpractices in the Victorian meat inspection service, His Excellency the Governor of Victoria issued, on 15 September 1981, a royal commission which complemented the Commonwealth Commission but which related to meat for human consumption in Victoria. In November 1981 the Governor-General issued a further commission in relation to meat for human consumption in the Northern Territory. Because of the considerable degree of overlap between the three commissions, inquiries in relation to all three were conducted jointly and concurrently. The Royal Commissioner has discharged his three separate obligations by presenting a single report. However, his concluding recommendations relating to the three separate governmental jurisdictions are set out separately. The Commission's report was presented to the Governor-General and the Governor of Victoria, and forwarded to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory on 17 September. The Commissioner recommended that Appendix H, which is a separate volume to the report, not be released until after any criminal proceedings against those named or referred to in it have been completed. I add that charges have been laid or are pending, I am advised, in 21 instances. Convictions have already been obtained in nine instances. Legal proceedings are under consideration in another 26 instances. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset I should say that, on a dispassionate reading, the findings of the Royal Commission are overwhelmingly positive. The Commission has commended the Department and the Minister for Primary Industry in relation to their actions in the wake of the substitution incident. Whilst there was a great deal wrong with the meat inspection system prior to the substitution incident, the Royal Commissioner has found that actions taken since then have been the appropriate ones. He has endorsed also most of the proposals advanced by the Department of Primary Industry for further improving the system. The positive suggestions that the Commissioner has made are being and will be followed up vigorously. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, before going to the Royal Commission report in detail, it would be useful for honourable members if I recalled the total background against which the Royal Commission inquiry was held. The meat industry is one of Australia's vital rural industries. The estimated value of production last year was $3.2 billion-more than a quarter of the gross value of rural production. It is a substantial export earner with exports of $1.3 billion to some 60 overseas markets. The problem of wasteful dual meat inspection services in the four larger States has bedevilled the industry for many years.</PARA>
<PARA> Following overseas complaints many years ago the original Commonwealth veterinary service was expanded to an export inspection service in all States. New United States laws in 1963 and 1967 required greater Commonwealth controls. In 1964 some States, concerned at the increased Commonwealth role in meat inspection, sought and obtained agreement that State and Commonwealth inspectors work side by side in export establishments. Over the years this situation has led to costly duplication and some fragmentation of administrative controls. Between 1972 and 1978 there were no fewer than six major State or Commonwealth inquiries into meat inspection. At all these times the objective of the Commonwealth was to participate in any reasonable arrangements to achieve a single inspection service. However, because of the attitude of some States, no progress was made in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA> In November 1978 the then Minister for Primary Industry, in yet another attempt to resolve the issue, established a committee of inquiry with terms of reference specifically directed to the solution of problems of meat inspection administration. I want to address this particular inquiry in some detail because it was material in relation to an adverse finding by the Royal Commission against the Minister for Primary Industry. The importance of this matter will become clear later in my statement. The Chairman of this inquiry, the Honourable C. R. Kelly, and the other committee member, Mr W. B. Buettel, presented their report to the Minister for Primary Industry on 11 February 1980. The whole thrust of their report, tabled in Parliament on 27 February 1980, was directed to the establishment of a new type of single meat inspection system-an Australian meat inspection service or AMIS. </PARA>
<PARA> In the presentation of the report to the Minister on 11 February 1980, evidence shows that the discussion was centred around the principles and proposed structure of a new AMIS. Mr Kelly also, at this brief meeting, raised the general issue of malpractice in meat inspection as reflected on pages 12, 13 and 66 of his report. However, at the time, and as indeed evidenced in his report, these allegations were of a most general nature, and have remained so.</PARA>
<PARA> Neither in his report nor in his meeting with the Minister did Mr Kelly put forward any positive or specific evidence of names of people engaged in serious malpractice. Even at the Royal Commission, Mr Kelly was not able to present any specific information and he has not done so since. If he had it would have been passed on to the police for investigation. Some matters of immediate administrative concern that arose in the Kelly inquiry were passed on to the Department by Mr Landos, the departmental executive officer to the Kelly Committee. I have been advised that the Bureau of Animal Health followed up that with its field staff but, as later events showed, not vigorously enough. The notes taken by Mr Landos during the inquiry were never referred to Mr Nixon by Mr Landos or Mr Kelly. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I interpolate here to say that a little later, when I have concluded my remarks, I will seek leave to table further documents. They are documents from which I will be quoting. They have been available, with the exception of one piece of paper, to the Royal Commission. Once certain names have been deleted, the minutes that Mr Landos took in the course of the Kelly inquiry also will be tabled. They are very substantial in terms of volume and number. That tabling probably will not be done today, but it will be done tomorrow. The names need to be deleted because the discussions that the Kelly Committee undertook were undertaken on the basis that evidence given to members of the Committee would be confidential. It would be in breach of that confidence if the names were to be included in the documents tabled. So more documents will be tabled today and again tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly's key recommendation for the establishment of an Australian meat inspection service was studied but rejected by the States. The Commonwealth was prepared at all times to support AMIS. In further pursuit of an improved system a Commonwealth-State commmittee of the Australian Agricultural Council, set up in 1980 following the Kelly report, still failed to resolve the issue of a single service. </PARA>
<PARA> At a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council in Hobart in February 1981 the Minister for Primary Industry took yet another initiative to resolve the issue. A high level working group was established to consider further options. Yet again, however, no satisfactory consensus emerged. It is quite clear that the central preoccupation and the priorities attached to both the Kelly report and the Commonwealth consideration of it were the achievement of a single meat inspection service. This is clear in Mr Kelly's evidence to the Royal Commission . I quote from page 10264 of the transcript:</PARA>
<PARA> We were much more interested in the problems of administration and having inspectors available at the right time and at the right place than we were, at that time, about the bribery and corruption. That was a secondary matter to us. Getting the machinery to construct it to work well was our first requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>It is even more explicit on page 10267 of the transcript where Mr Kelly says:</PARA>
<PARA> I was much more interested in the welfare of AMIS than I was of the comparatively minor skullduggery that I knew about. </PARA>
<PARA>It is also explicity clear on page 66 of the Kelly report itself:</PARA>
<PARA> Starting a new system would give us the opportunity to turn over a new page. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly goes on to say on page 66 that when the new page is turned some specific problems in relation to inspectors and industry behaviour should be tackled with firm resolution. The priorities of the Kelly Committee were explicity clear. Its major concern and the thrust of its deliberations were on a single inspection service. As I have said, the Commonwealth Government has vigorously pursued the central recommendation of the Kelly report. That is the issue of a single inspection service. Unfortunately, however, because of jurisdictional problems with some States these efforts met with little success. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the so-called issues of malpractice. As I will demonstrate in more detail not one specific allegation was put to the Minister by Mr Kelly. I will further demonstrate that the inherent problem on these matters has all along been the fact that specific allegations which could be pursued in an appropriate way were never given to the Minister. In the Royal Commission report itself to which I shall shortly turn the Commissioner confirms in paragraphs 2. 34 and 2.35-I will use that terminology throughout these remarks; the first number will refer to the chapter in each case if honourable members wish to refer to the particular parts from which I will be quoting-that much of the information supplied initially on malpractices was little better than rumour, and that it finally took a major joint police task force, including 37 detectives from the Australian Federal Police and the Victoria Police, to produce satisfactory evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me again emphasise that the Kelly report was not a confidential document. It was tabled in Parliament shortly after it was received and sent to the States and industry for public discussion. It is easy now to be wise after the event but I think it significant that to the best of my knowledge no question was asked of the Minister in this House on the malpractice allegations in the Kelly report until the publication of an article by Alan Reid in the Bulletin on 22 September 1981. I should also point out to the House that the Commissioner himself reports in paragraph 2.75 that if he had had to report in April of this year-April 1982-after seven months of investigation with the full powers of a royal commission:</PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of the evidence then available--</PARA>
<PARA>As late as April of this year-</PARA>
<PARA>I would have reported that malpractice in the industry was rare, and felt compelled to recommend that, in the light of that finding, many of the present security measures were unnecessary--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, security measures introduced by this Minister as a result of the substitution scandal-</PARA>
<PARA>and that no fundamental change in administrative arrangements was required to prevent or detect malpractices. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in April 1982, some 26 months after Mr Kelly presented his report to the Minister for Primary Industry, the Royal Commission after seven months of investigation still did not have any substantive evidence of malpractice. It took three more months of the investigations by the Royal Commission, with the full powers that such a commission has, to uncover satisfactorily the malpractices of sections of the meat industry and the corrupt activities of some members of the meat inspection service and some members of the police. In relation to malpractice, I would like to draw attention particularly to what the Commissioner said in paragraph 7.4 of his report:</PARA>
<PARA> The malpractice which led directly to the setting up of the Royal Commission, namely species substitution, proved to be the most serious malpractice which the Commission uncovered. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner goes on to say in paragraph 7.6:</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the most serious cases of species substitution are concerned, there is no evidence that this occurred in the export trade before late 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>Significantly therefore, Mr Speaker, according to the Commission, in relation to the most serious malpractice ever to come to light-species substitution in the export trade-there was little or no evidence to show that it occurred before Mr Kelly brought his inquiry to an end. It is worth noting that there is no reference to meat substitution in the Kelly report and there is absolutely no suggestion whatsoever that Mr Kelly raised this most serious malpractice with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the events of August 1981 which led to the establishment of the Royal Commission. Following the first ever confirmed finding on 13 August 1981 of horse meat in a shipment of Australian boneless beef to the United States, the Australian meat industry found itself in a crisis situation with the potential of immense damage to it. The Minister for Primary Industry took immediate action. Establishments were deregistered, spot checks were introduced in all States and security and surveillance were immediately increased. Further measures were introduced within days. A new system was devised for security seals, a special task force was set up to co-ordinate a nation-wide sampling and species testing program and police investigations were intensified. </PARA>
<PARA> Shortly afterwards the Minister for Primary Industry introduced legislation to increase substantially penalties for illegal export of up to $100,000 fine or five years imprisonment or both; stringent new security control measures were introduced in cold stores with the sealing of meat transport vehicles and containers; and an outside consultant was appointed to review these measures. The Minister for Primary Industry convened a special meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council on 4 September to review the measures taken and to examine policies and practices for controlling knackeries, denaturing pet meat and identifying game meat for human consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the Minister for Primary Industry is to be commended for his prompt and decisive actions on this matter. As early as 17 August the United States Special Trade Representative, Ambassador Brock, expressed to him satisfaction with the way in which the Australian Government was dealing with this issue. This confidence of the United States Administration was reflected in the release to the United States market on 4 September of 24,000 tonnes of Australian beef valued at $40m-a very short time after the first discovery of malpractice, of meat substitution. The Parliament now has before it the report of the Royal Commission presided over by the Honourable Mr Justice A. E. Woodward. </PARA>

It is intolerable that copies have been made available to the Press but not, according to normal custom, to members of this chamber.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose, Mr Speaker, to take the terms of reference of the Royal Commission in the form the Royal Commission dealt with them and address myself to the Commissioner's findings in each. Firstly I refer to the adequacy of administrative arrangements and procedures for the supervision of the handling of meat for export. The Commissioner's findings are that, whilst once seriously deficient, administrative procedures are now adequate for their purposes although still with room for improvement. Mr Speaker, the Government generally endorses the Commissioner's recommendations and will be pursuing them vigorously. In doing so I point out that many of the recommendations have been or are in the process of implementation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to point out, Mr Speaker, that on the central issue of a single inspection service, the Royal Commissioner has not made recommendations that went beyond what the Government is already doing. He has recognised the inherent nature of the problem arising from the need for the Commonwealth to be involved to protect export markets, and the traditional position which the States take in relation to what they regard as their sovereign responsibilities. Nevertheless, that matter also will be pursued with full vigour. I might point out, Mr Speaker, that in respect of the matters I have already referred to, the Commissioner acknowledges in paragraph 1.19 that:</PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the Department of Primary Industry itself, it is only fair to say that, under instructions from its Minister, it acted promptly and effectively when the meat substitution scandal erupted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner goes on in paragraph 1.21 to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Since then, and during the Commission's hearings, the Department has, for the most part, reacted promptly and appropriately to problems that have been brought to light. It has not, as it might have done, sat back to await the Commission's recommendations. Instead it has, while keeping the Commission appropriately informed, continued to carry out its proper functions of administering the service and forward planning. This has culminated in the proposals set out in the Department's final submissions, which reflect the determination of the Minister and the Department to resolve the problems which now stand revealed. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Commissioner has said is clearly reflected by the establishment in March 1982 in the Department of Primary Industry of the export inspection service which has been structured under a new legislative framework-the Export Control Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The new export inspection service was created with characteristics designed to overcome problems and inadequacies disclosed in the Commissioner's investigations. Features of the new inspection service are: A strong decentralised management system; a strong compliance program; and an investigations unit capable of pursuing allegations of malpractice in co- operation with the Federal Police and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Several further measures are being pursued to raise the calibre of inspection staff such as: New inspection procedures and standards; new award and employment conditions, better aligned to industry requirements; and new training programs. Innovations proposed to increase the general efficiency of the industry include: The introduction of Australia wide objective measurement and product descriptions for carcasses and meat; and the electronic transmission of all documentation and monitoring of product. </PARA>
<PARA> In order that the industry itself should become more involved in the inspection process and be more conscious of the costs of providing inspection services, the Department of Primary Industry has proposed arrangements to provide services as a tailor-made package to each establishment, under contract, on a fee for service basis and progressively to transfer responsibility for the preparation of hygiene, quality control and product description to the companies themselves. The full implementation of many of the above arrangements still requires the agreement of unions, State governments and the meat industry. The Department of Primary Industry is currently engaging several consultants on key aspects of the revised system. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I now wish to turn to the next of the terms of reference relevant to the Commonwealth-'Malpractices in Australian meat industry'. In reference to this, I would first like to quote paragraph 7.2 of the Commissioner's findings:</PARA>
<PARA> I should say at the outset that I have no doubt that the industry has never been more free of malpractices than it is today. All references, unless otherwise stated, are to the past-most of them applying particularly to the last two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, I quote paragraph 1.22 of the findings:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, in consequence of the strong reaction of the Minister and the Department, and the establishment of this Royal Commission, the current level of malpractice in the industry is lower than it has ever been. This desirable situation should be vigorously maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not much doubt, as evidenced in the Royal Commission hearings, that there have been malpractices in this industry. By the very nature of the industry and its widespread geographical locations, it may well be difficult to eradicate totally all instances of malpractice. However, it is to the full credit of the Minister for Primary Industry that the Commissioner considers the measures he has taken to have reduced the incidence of malpractice to an all- time historical low. Moreover, as the Commissioner points out in paragraph 8.15 the matter should be kept in some perspective, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> In order to help keep the whole question of export quality in perspective it is worth noting that, against an overall rejection rate in USA of 0.5% in recent years, Australia's rate has been 0.2%. This compares with Canada's experience of 0.8% and New Zealand's 0.3%. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that the measurement in question is over a period of recent years. As the Commissioner says in paragraph 8.17: 'The record seems quite reasonable'. Nevertheless the Commissioner does refer to certain areas of malpractice where greater attention needs to be given and recommendations relevant to them will be processed as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner dealt with the next three terms of reference in one section of his report and I will follow the same practice. These are: The handling of allegations of malpractices and whether they were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective or, on the other hand, whether any illegality or corruption occurred. Taking the last point first, I point out that in paragraph 1.66 the Commissioner concludes that, apart from the possibility-and he puts it no higher than that-of corruption relating to certain police officers and of a senior meat inspector and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence to suggest that there was any illegality or corruption on the part of any Minister of the Crown, or any official, in response to any allegation of malpractice in the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA>On the point of allegations made to departments the Commissioner has certain criticisms in relation to the Department of Primary Industry and the Federal Police. The deficiencies he points to will, I believe, be overcome by the new organisational procedures that I have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the question of ministerial responsibility. At the outset I want to define precisely what the Commissioner has actually said. The Commissioner, in paragraph 1.61, says:</PARA>
<PARA> Generally, such matters as were referred to Commonwealth Ministers were dealt with adequately and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 8.39 the Commissioner says:</PARA>
<PARA> Insofar as allegations were reported by the Department to Mr Nixon, I do not consider any criticism can be levelled at his handling of them. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 1.19 the Commissioner says:</PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the Department of Primary Industry itself, it is only fair to say that, under instructions from its Minister, it acted promptly and effectively when the meat substitution scandal erupted. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 1.22 he states:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, in consequence of the strong reaction of the Minister and the Department, and the establishment of this Royal Commission, the current level of malpractice in the industry is lower than it has ever been. </PARA>
<PARA>As far as the Kelly report is concerned-although the Commissioner does so in the context of a passage which is critical of action taken in relation to malpractices-the Commissioner makes the point in paragraph 8.48:</PARA>
<PARA> They--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Minister and his senior advisers-</PARA>
<PARA>seem to have given all their attention to the central issue dealt with by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Kelly Committee. That central issue was the question of a single meat inspection system. Evidence before the Commission clearly showed the strong and determined efforts made by the Minister to deal with these matters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If honourable members opposite contain their impatience I think they will find that most of the paragraphs about which they have been chirping will be mentioned in my references to the report. It will assist greatly in the House's analysis and in honourable members' comprehension if they leave their criticisms until I have concluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now examine in detail those areas where the Royal Commissioner has been critical of Mr Nixon. In paragraphs 1.62 to 1.64 the Royal Commissioner says, first, that Mr Nixon paid insufficient attention to the findings of Mr Kelly and Mr Buettel. According to the Royal Commissioner, the Minister, having heard from a responsible source that there had been cases of bribery and abuse of power in his Department, should have taken more adequate and effective steps to deal with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me again state unequivocally that the matters covered in these paragraphs had nothing whatsoever to do with meat substitution. If Mr Kelly had unearthed significant information about meat substitution, I am quite sure that he-himself a farmer-would have jumped up and down more than we ever saw him do in this House in relation to tariffs. He most certainly would have made very strong representations to the Minister, or if not to him then to me. He did not. In addition, he would not have sat on such information until his report was completed. He would have known the immense significance of such information, and he would have acted on it immediately. The fact is that Mr Kelly did not draw any such evidence to our attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusions drawn by the Royal Commission relate to different matters and the Commission's argument supporting its conclusions is to be found in paragraphs 8.39 to 8.45. This evidence boils down to two points. Firstly, in relation to certain statements in the Kelly report itself-pages 12, 13, 66-the Minister did not act adequately and effectively; and secondly, certain statements were made to the Minister in a meeting with Mr Kelly on 11 February 1980 and these were not adequately followed up. To examine the Royal Commissioner's conclusions we must turn back to the specific evidence on the statements that were alleged to have been made to the Minister on 11 February 1980 and to the specific information contained in the Kelly report. I shall deal with the 11 February meeting first. Let us be clear in dealing with this matter that we are dealing with the issues which the Kelly Committee itself regarded as secondary to the major conclusions of its report. This is evident from Mr Kelly' s own evidence to the Royal Commission. For example, on page 10264 of the transcript he says:</PARA>
<PARA> We were much more interested in the problems of administration and having inspectors available at the right time and at the right place than we were at that time about the bribery and corruption. That was a secondary matter to us. Getting the machinery to construct it to work well was our first requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 10267, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat it was a minor part of our duty that was laid on us when we were doing the report and I was much more interested in the welfare of AMIS than I was of the comparatively minor skullduggery that I knew about. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that those words should be taken to note: 'than I was of the comparatively minor skullduggery that I knew about'. In assessing the significance of his meeting with the Minister, it is important to note what Mr Kelly himself said about various aspects of it. In his primary evidence on page 10243 Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> The primary purpose of the meeting--</PARA>
<PARA>That is his evidence to the Royal Commission-</PARA>
<PARA>was to present the report, and any discussions had, in relation to areas outside the terms of reference of the Committee, would have been general and merely coincidental to the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>Then, in relation to the discussion itself, Mr Kelly referred to a minute prepared by Mr Landos-Mr Landos had been secretary to the Kelly Committee-which he said recorded that at the meeting with the Minister the Committee expressed strong views as to the sordid nature of the meat industry and meat inspection. However, later, Mr Kelly was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Is the position this in reality that you, apart from Mr Landos' minute or document that was referred to, have no independent recollection of precisely what was said at that meeting with the Minister on 11 February at all?</PARA>
<PARA>On page 10259 of the transcript, he responded:</PARA>
<PARA> That is right, no precise memory. </PARA>
<PARA>When he was then asked whether he was prepared to accept that what was in Mr Landos's document must be accurate he said:</PARA>
<PARA> No. I am not saying it must be accurate. I am prepared to say-I repeat, I was startled and gratified to find that I myself had refreshed my own memory. </PARA>
<PARA>As to the specifics discussed with the Minister, the question was put:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly, you were asked whether or not at the meeting with the Minister you provided the specific names of particular places where malpractices were said to have happened, and my recollection is that you said that you either did not or that you had no recollection of doing so; is that correct?</PARA>
<PARA>On page 10275 of the transcript, Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is right. </PARA>
<PARA>When asked why he had not reported his findings to the Commonwealth Police or to the Australian Federal Police, Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> Never even thought of it. It has nothing to do with me. My responsibility was to chair my Committee that had to examine this question of dual inspection problems. That was all I worried about. </PARA>
<PARA>That was recorded on page 10272 of the transcript. Mr Landos also gave evidence- page 10277A of the transcript-that:</PARA>
<PARA> By far the great majority, if not all, of the allegations received by the Committee were based on rumour or on second-hand evidence. The Committee found a great reluctance to-for any people to pass on first-hand experience. </PARA>
<PARA>He also stated, on page 10288 of the transcript, that the real purpose of the meeting was:</PARA>
<PARA> To present the report to the Minister and to stress to him the necessity of structural change with regard to the meat inspection arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Landos, when asked whether any examples of graft or misuse of inspector power were raised at the meeting, replied, on page 10282:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe any specific examples were raised with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>I should mention at this point that in the transcript of the Royal Commission evidence, and in paragraph 8.41 of the report, reference is made to notes prepared by Mr Landos during the Kelly inquiry and to a minute he wrote sometime after the meeting between Mr Kelly and the Minister. This minute was designed as Mr Landos's final overall impressions, apparently, of the Kelly inquiry. It was not a response to the meeting between Mr Kelly and the Minister. It was prepared for internal departmental use after a discussion with Mr Cleary. The Royal Commissioner said-paragraph 8.43-of the suggestions in this minute:</PARA>
<PARA> They never reached the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, Mr Landos's notes never reached either the Minister or the Secretary of the Department. Those are the notes which I earlier said would be tabled in an appropriate way. The evidence actually given by Mr Landos that no specific examples were raised with the Minister adds emphasis to the fact that the primary purpose of the Kelly Committee was to look into the structural change needed to make meat inspection arrangements effective. The Committee was concerned with the causes of any problems evident in meat inspection and regarded symptoms of malpractice as incidental to the primary purpose. This was further confirmed by Mr Gee in giving evidence before the Royal Commission. In responding to a question of whether many of his discussions with the Minister were directed to the AMIS recommendation for a single meat inspection service, he responded:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . yes, that is correct and it is important, I think, to get that completely in context. That was the absolutely overriding public and political issue, to find a solution to the meat inspection administration. </PARA>
<PARA>That is recorded on page 10338. Notwithstanding the fact that no specific information was given to the Minister, the evidence clearly shows that the Minister spoke with Mr Gee and asked whether there was anything that could be followed up. When Mr Gee was asked whether in fact he followed up problems of the kind raised by the Kelly Committee, he replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I did not follow it up with Mr Kelly, I went to Mr Landos-</PARA>
<PARA>Remember that he was the Secretary of the Committee and that he had been writing the notes of the Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>and inquired of him as to what evidence, what data they did have from their hearings and from their conversations and from the submissions they raised and John Landos related to me that there was nothing substantial, that there was nothing of what we would call hard evidence and I said, 'Are you sure?', to my recollection, 'are you sure there is nothing that would warrant us-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Department-</PARA>
<PARA>investigating further or going to the police?'</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he was of the opinion that there was not anything of that nature. On the basis of his advice I did not pursue it directly with Mr Kelly. </PARA>
<PARA>That is recorded on page 10339 of the transcript. Now I ask: How could the Minister, given no specific information, have taken any further action to deal with these allegations? I submit that on the basis of all the available evidence he could not have. Where is the substance on which the Minister could be blamed or condemned? There is another matter in the Royal Commission report which disturbs me. The report, on the top of page 259, quotes half of Mr Kelly's diary entry. I have confirmed that with Mr Kelly, whom I contacted on Sunday night, and it is confirmed in the full transcript of the evidence on page 10244. It is the half that is damaging to Mr Nixon, rather than the half that would offer support for his action. The quote contained in paragraph 8.40 is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I went to Melbourne for the day to present the meat report to the Minister, Peter Nixon. It was worth it because it gave me the chance to tell him a few of the notes that we could not put in the report, such as the bribery and blackmail which is so prevalent in the meat inspection game. Poor Peter is now to see what can be done. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the full entry also contains the following words immediately after the previous sentence:</PARA>
<PARA> We were gratified today to hear that the Victorian Minister of Agriculture has stated bluntly that the present position cannot be allowed to continue. I told Nixon that both of us, Buettel and I would be prepared to help him get something done. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly advised me on the telephone yesterday that it is almost certain that the statement referred to by the Victorian Minister would have related to problems of dual administration of the meat inspection service-the central thrust of what the Kelly Committee report was all about. Clearly, the full diary entry reinforces the priorities of the Committee. The Committee members were concerned with the overwhelming complexity of the major problems of fixing up the administration and of getting a single inspection service in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view the last reference in Mr Kelly's diary entry to helping get something done clearly related to the development and implementation of AMIS. Mr Kelly has repeated and repeated that that was his overriding concern. The preoccupation of the Kelly Committee with the AMIS proposals is confirmed by Mr Buettel's account of the meeting. In a telephone discussion with the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry on 19 September Mr Buettel confirmed that the bulk of the meeting was concerned with the Committee's recommendations of AMIS. The meeting, incidentally, lasted not more than 20 minutes. Mr Kelly spoke only in very general terms, according to Mr Buettel, about 'a lot of nonsense around the ridges'. Having regard to the fact that the Minister took even those broad, vague allegations, indeterminantly made, and subsidiary to the main elements of the report, sufficiently seriously to pass them on to Mr Gee and that Mr Gee consulted Mr Landos, the secretary of the Committee, who confirmed that there was nothing in the allegations that could be put to the police, I suggest that it is not possible to condemn the Minister on the grounds of failure to act. I suggest it is not possible to condemn him on the evidence of what was said at that meeting. I remind the House of Mr Landos's evidence, stated above, that the great majority of the evidence received by the Committee was based on rumour and secondhand evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the actual report itself. As the Royal Commissioner has put it in paragraph 8.46:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it may be that Mr Kelly did not hammer home his concern in any very emphatic way, but he obviously said something about the problems he saw and the report was there to be read; it was clear enough. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed the report was there to be read, but let us see whether it has been properly read and, indeed, whether it was clear enough. Presumably, the Royal Commissioner was referring to those paragraphs of the report which he himself quoted. The first quotation was taken from the top of page 12 of the Kelly report. This was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Complaints were received of excessive zeal at times stemming from a grievance, real or fancied, on the part of an inspector. It is a fact that production can be slowed by unwarranted stoppage of chains to the annoyance of employees; or condemnations, allegedly unwarranted, to the annoyance of management. </PARA>
<PARA>If the report had gone back a sentence or two it would also have included in this particular quotation:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognises the inspector's task to be a difficult one exposed to friction with both works' management and works' employees. </PARA>
<PARA>The first sentence from the paragraph that the report quoted is also omitted. That sentence reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Inspection is a matter of individual subjective judgment and opinion. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view those two sentences in conjunction with that part quoted by the Royal Commission give a quite different perspective to that first paragraph on page 12 . Without specific evidence what can a Minister do in relation to a sentence of that kind? The Royal Commissioner then quoted from the bottom of page 12 and on to page 13. The quotation reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an inspector, if he wants to be vindictive, can press the stop button on a killing chain. This puts meat inspectors in positions of considerable industrial power. That this power has not been used more often is a tribute to the sense of responsibility of most meat inspectors, but it has been used. </PARA>
<PARA> The fear that it may be used has encouraged some abattoirs' managers to give inspectors gifts of meat or to sell them meat at ridiculously low prices. It has been alleged that some managers have given inspectors this kind of inducement not only to ensure industrial peace but to induce inspectors to turn a blind eye to procedures that give considerable financial advantage to management. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to draw particular attention to one sentence in that quotation by the Royal Commissioner. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That this power has not been used more often is a tribute to the sense of responsibility of most meat inspectors, but it has been used. </PARA>
<PARA>Here the Kelly Committee would seem to be saying that problems posed by excessive use of such power were rare, especially against the background that all works strenuously denied that they indulged in such practices, as the next paragraph quoted by Commissioner Woodward makes plain. I do not believe, in the light of all the circumstances, in the light of the fact that the priorities in the Kelly report related to the establishment of AMIS and in the light of community concern at the existence of two meat inspection services rather than one, that the quotations on pages 12 and 13 amount to sufficient substance to require Mr Nixon to take more action than he did. This view is reinforced significantly by the treatment given to a certain paragraph taken from page 66 of Mr Kelly's report. As quoted by the Royal Commission, paragraph 8.42 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of the meat industry which should be tackled with firm resolution is the problem of some managers trying to buy the co-operation of inspectors by giving them meat at ridiculously low prices, or countenancing excessive overtime claims, or of meat inspectors demanding cheap meat backed by the implied threat of slowing the killing chain or forcing higher offal or other condemnations if management is not compliant. Legislation should include heavy punishments for administrators, VO's, meat inspectors and management. That this kind of practice has been too common in the past we know too well. It must be stopped in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree fully that, if we take the words as quoted in the Royal Commissioner's report, they seem to be saying in very plain terms that there is a certain matter that should be tackled immediately with firm resolution and that certain malpractices were mentioned. In fact that is not what the Kelly Committee said. That particular quotation does not accurately represent the findings of the Kelly Committee or the paragraph on page 66 of the Kelly report. There were two critical omissions from this quotation. They have the effect of very substantially modifying the meaning of that paragraph, especially when placed in the context of the paragraph that preceded it. I now quote the paragraph as it was actually written in the Kelly report, along with the preceding paragraph. Mr Kelly wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Starting a new system would give us the opportunity to turn over a new page. We know that the firmly held stances of the past will not be lightly abandoned but at least there is more chance of this happening in a new situation. </PARA>
<PARA>The following is the part cited in the Royal Commission report:</PARA>
<PARA> There is one aspect of the meat industry which should be tackled with firm resolution--</PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner's report left out the next words-</PARA>
<PARA>when the new page is turned, and that is the problem of some managers-</PARA>
<PARA>The report then continues as the Royal Commissioner originally cited. In addition, the reference before the word 'legislation', later in the paragraph, was also omitted. But, in the first place, the words 'when the new page is turned' were omitted from the Royal Commission report. It is worth noting that this significant and particular omission occurred not only in the Royal Commissioner's report but also in the primary evidence given by Mr Kelly and contained on page 10249 of the transcript. Without the omitted words, the injunction from the Kelly Committee would have been that the Minister should move immediately to tackle certain problems with firm resolution. With those words, the injunction is consistent with the whole thrust of everything Mr Kelly said in his own report and with much of what he said before the Royal Commission . That was that attention should first be given to creating a new system, AMIS, and then-indeed as a part of the new system-attention should be given to those instances of skulduggery, using Mr Kelly's word. Indeed there was some discussion in the Royal Commission itself about what these words meant. I refer the House to page 10266 of the transcript. </PARA>
<PARA> The other omission, which is in no way even indicated in the quotation in the Royal Commissioner's report, is that the Kelly report said 'AMIS legislation should include heavy punishments for administrators, VOs, meat inspectors and management, et cetera,' but the Royal Commissioner's quotation left out 'AMIS', implying simply that legislation introduced now should pursue that path. The fact that Mr Kelly said such punishments should be included in AMIS legislation again shows plainly that the thrust of the injunction from the Kelly Committee was that the creation of a new system was the first priority. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is reasonable to ask how it happened that Mr Kelly, in his primary evidence, and how it happened that the Royal Commission report, in two places, omitted words of such stark and significant importance, especially with the reputation of a Minister at stake. If all the omitted words had been included, they would have altered the balance of the evidence substantially in the Minister's favour. The fact that they were not included is a sad and unhappy omission, with a most unfortunate consequence. There can be no doubting that the Royal Commissioner acted in good faith in drawing the conclusions that he did. But on the basis of the evidence that I have outlined, I cannot accept that the one adverse finding against the Minister has been substantiated. I unequivocally reject it. The object of the Royal Commission's criticism of the Minister was that Mr Kelly had said certain things in the meeting of 11 February, or that the report itself said certain things, that were not adequately followed up. That, as the Royal Commissioner said, was the only point of criticism. I believe I have rebutted it adequately and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the report of the Royal Commission is a very positive and valuable document. The very conduct of the Commission and the response that it stimulated , have been of great benefit to the meat industry. Overwhelmingly, the Royal Commissioner's findings have been positive in character. Since the substitution incident, the actions of the Minister and his Department have been found to be appropriate and by and large effective. The Department's recommendations for further improving the service have also been favourably commented upon. The Royal Commissioner has rightly emphasised that there is further room for improvement and he has suggested avenues for the pursuit of this improvement. These avenues will be followed up vigorously. We are, of course, still left with the difficult and complex problem of dual inspection. That matter must be resolved. The Commissioner's comments will be drawn upon heavily in our efforts to resolve that matter with the States. We are indebted to the Royal Commissioner and his staff for their efforts. Let me stress again that I believe the Commission has been a productive one, notwithstanding my reservations in relation to one finding. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a broader consideration of which meat substitution was one symptom. It makes me very angry indeed to see people who have been treated well in this country, who are largely prosperous, and who are often in control of affluent businesses seeking for no other reason than greed to become even wealthier by means which are unethical and dishonest. Those people are undermining our whole system. In the case of those involved in meat substitution , they run the risk of destroying the livelihoods of many honourable people in the meat industry and in the farming and pastoral world, because these practices have the potential of destroying our markets. The Royal Commissioner has indicated that current penalties for those people are severe. I would not mind if they were very much more severe. The people who have been involved in meat substitution have exhibited the same corrupt attitude towards society as those who have sought to evade paying their taxes. This Government is determined to do everything it can to make these practices unprofitable for the participants. It would want to do whatever it can to eradicate these practices once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion there is one general point that I wish to make. We all know quite well that in the last decade or so there have been significant breakdowns and administrative failures in a number of areas of government administration. The Commonwealth Bureau of Narcotics and the Federal Police have been reorganised, and the recent issues concerning the Crown Solicitor's Office provide a further example. These are matters of serious concern to all Australians. There have obviously been considerable strains on the Public Service. I want to emphasise that I do not think the Public Service, with its traditional modes and manner of operation, can or should necessarily be blamed for these failures. Overwhelmingly, members of the Public Service do their jobs honourably and with a degree of dedication and commitment. That is not recognised as it should be in the broad community. </PARA>
<PARA> But I also believe that in recent years the Public Service has had to face new and difficult challenges, and it needs to be equipped to meet the changes that have occurred. The business ethics of a minority have deteriorated and it is quite clear that unethical people who wish to cheat on their obligations to others have left Ministers and the Public Service with a significant problem in attempting to catch up with, and overtake, their unethical practices. They have at times, as we have found in this report, found people who will assist them from within the Public Service, but I should emphasise that public servants like that are a small minority who will be condemned by the overall membership of the Service. But because there have been breakdowns and because there would seem to be elements in the community able to manipulate the increasingly complex and diverse business world, some significant changes may well be needed within the Service, to put it in a position of being ahead of rather than behind those who seek to despoil that system. That is important to all of us. That is a very broad proposition, but it is a matter which is receiving my own urgent and vigorous attention. I will be saying a good deal more about it shortly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, this country is currently witnessing one of the more pathetic political spectacles in its history. What precisely are the elements in this farce? They are as follows: We have, first of all, a government elected to power at the end of 1975 on a promise of providing competence in economic management and administration and stability in government. Secondly, we have that same government racked with scandal after scandal and incompetence in department after department. The Government and particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), knowing the truth of these matters, are desperately attempting to keep open the option of an election later this year, before the greater disasters of 1983 unfold in a politically irretrievable way. Let us note that if this course were followed it would bring about the fifth election, in the eight years from 1974, precipitated by the so-called forces of stable government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Within that situation of farce it is already crystal clear that, as usual, this miserable collection of incompetents, collectively identified as the Fraser Government, is in the process of looking for someone else or something other than its own inadequacy to blame for this current situation. There is absolutely no prize for guessing who will be the scapegoat. It is the workers of this country and the wages which they obtain. It was quite clear early in the Budget Speech, delivered in this place just over a month ago on 17 August, precisely what the approach of this Government would be. In one of the most amazing confessions of failure ever coming from the mouth of a Treasurer in delivering a Budget, on the evening of 17 August the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said:</PARA>
<PARA> The international recession is now hitting us hard. Our overseas markets have shrunk. Economic growth has faltered. Unemployment is rising. Inflation remains far too high. Interest rates are hurting many of us. </PARA>
<PARA>Never before has there been such a confession of failure in the history of this country. But what was it that this Government, through the mouth of the Treasurer, had to say in respect of this situation? This is what the Treasurer said in the third paragraph of his speech:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst much of this is due to the state of the world economy, the excessive growth of wages in Australia has made matters worse. </PARA>
<PARA>In an earlier speech to this House I dealt with the hypocrisy of this Government in seeking to excuse itself by a reference to what is happening overseas. I remind the House once again of what the Prime Minister said on 22 January 1975 on this question of blaming what is happening overseas. This is what the Prime Minister said on 22 January when talking to the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science:</PARA>
<PARA> When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped, it is part of the world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what this gentleman, who is now the Prime Minister, said about the first of the two excuses used by the Treasurer on 17 August. He said in 1975 : 'Do not blame what is happening overseas because if you attempt to blame what is happening overseas that is an expression of the futility of your own leadership'. So I put that to one side. But here, at the very outset of the Budget Speech, we see the beginning of the Government's attempt to divert attention from its own inadequacies by blaming the workers of this country and the wages they receive. I repeat what the Treasurer said in his Budget Speech:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the excessive growth of wages in Australia has made matters worse. </PARA>
<PARA>A little later in his speech, under the heading 'Economic Considerations', the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> These adverse international influences were compounded by a significant worsening on the . . . wages front. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said honourable members can see, in the elements of farce which is spreading out before us this calculated attempt by the Government, which started in the Treasurer's Budget Speech on 17 August, to try to say that the central feature of the explanation for the economic problems of this country is what is happening to wages-in other words, the greediness of the Australian workers in this regard. I want to examine now, in the context of this attempt by the Government to engage in this diversionary exercise, the facts of the situation. In that respect I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of table 8 which appeared in Budget Paper No. 1. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the House. This table was taken from page 28 of Budget Paper No. 1. It is headed: 'Indexes of Average Real Labour Costs, Productivity and Real Unit Labour Costs for the Non-Farm Sector'. I suggest seriously to this House that if anyone in this country is concerned with a sensible, objective analysis of what has happened in respect of wages and wage movements and how they are to be analysed in terms of the charges that are now made by this Government in its pathetic attempt to divert attention from itself, the starting point of that analysis is table 8 in Budget Paper No. 1. The table is made up of three columns covering the period 1972-73 to 1981-82. The first column refers to what has been happening to average real labour costs, the second column refers to average labour productivity and the third column relates what has happened in the first two columns to real unit labour costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If honourable members look at this table they will see that, in the period from 1975-76 to 1979-80, the situation was that there was very little movement in average real labour costs at all. These costs moved from an indexed figure of 127 in 1975-76 to a figure of 132 in 1979-80 which, as honourable members will realise, is an increase in average real labour costs of only 1 per cent per annum. While average real labour costs moved so relatively slowly in that period , average labour productivity increased at a higher rate. The index moved from 118 in 1975-76 to 126 in 1979-80, which produced the obvious result that real unit labour costs declined. In other words, productivity increased at a faster rate than did average real labour costs. By definition, with the conjunction of circumstances, real unit labour costs declined as they did from a figure of 108 in 1975-76 to 105 in 1979-80. In respect of four years of that period-that is, 1976-77, 1977-78, 1978-79 and 1979-80-there was this reduction in real unit labour costs. Of course, we now see that the movement changed in 1981-82. Average real labour costs jumped from 132 in 1979-80 to 136 in 1980-81. In the following year, 1981-82, average real labour costs were up to 141. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it quite clear and I want people in this country to understand that in relation to the source and the reason for what happened in the movement upwards in wages in the last two years in the way that is shown in table 8, there are two simple explanations. In respect of each of those explanations honourable members will find that it was the deliberate action of this Government, calculatedly taken according to its perception of its electoral interests and the interests of its own supporters, which will explain the movement in wages that has taken place. In the short time available to me, I want to analyse the responsibility of the Government for what has happpened in the area of wages. On behalf of the Opposition, let me make it quite clear in respect of what has happened to wages that we are not saying that the trade union movement is to be blamed in this context for the action that it has taken. This Government created the philosophical framework in which the trade union movement of this country had no alternative other than to take the action which it took. I will proceed to establish that quite clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will see from the table that the upwards movement in wages, as I have pointed out, started in 1980-81-starting, of course, from 1 July 1980. Honourable members will recall that, immediately we went into that period-1980- 81-we were moving into the election situation of 1980. What was the environment that was created as we moved to that election? The Prime Minister of this country and a range of Ministers deliberately created an environment in which we were supposedly on the verge of a massive boom and a massive explosion in the utilisation of our resources which was to create the environment in which all people would be entitled to take action to get their share of the great, new wealth which was going to be created. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole range of quotes to which I could refer, but I content myself with reminding honourable members what the Prime Minister said in this House on this point on 26 August in terms of creating the environment in this country which led to the wages explosion after that time. In speaking to this House on 26 August, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> These developments will add greatly to our national product, to incomes and to wealth, and all Australians stand to benefit from being members of a wealthier society. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The investment of many billions of dollars in resource based development will stimulate economic growth and employment. This investment, the growth of great new industries and the expansion of others will mean increased incomes and higher living standards for all Australians. This exciting prospect has relevance for all of us; we all stand to participate in it. </PARA>
<PARA>As the Prime Minister was deliberately fuelling the climate for an election at the end of 1980, saying that a massive investment boom was going to take place which would create the opportunity for rising real incomes for everyone, not a word was said to the trade union movement to the effect: 'We expect you, in these circumstances, not to take action to get for your members their share of these rising real incomes which I am telling you, in this pre-election situation , you should have at the forefront of your mind'. At the time warnings were available to him from within his own sources of advice that he was clearly overstating what was likely to happen, but for electoral purposes he deliberately created expectation in the minds of all Australians, including those in the organised trade union movement, that they should be there to get their share of the action confronting this country-action the dimension of which it was almost impossible to paint. That is the first thing the Government did at the beginning of the financial year 1980-81 and the lead up to the election at the end of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the second thing that happened in this period? After that election-on 30 April 1981-the razor gang speech was delivered in this House. I have had cause to refer to it before. Let me sum it up very briefly. The Prime Minister said to this House in the razor gang speech of 30 April that small government was good government, that it was for government to get out of what happened in the forces operating in the economy. He abolished the Prices Justification Tribunal and emasculated the Trade Practices Commission on the basis of giving effect to the express philosophy of his Government that those with power in the market should exercise their power in terms of determining where resources would be invested and what would be the prices of commodities which came out of the economic process. As I said at the time, it was inevitable in those circumstances-the Prime Minister of this country standing up in this House and abolishing the Prices Justification Tribunal, emasculating the Trade Practices Commission and saying that it was the Government's philosophy that those outside with power should exercise it and let prices be determined accordingly-that members of the Australian trade union movement would say: 'If that is the philosophy of this Government, of this Prime Minister, then we will act accordingly'. That is precisely what they did. In the circumstances of that situation the Prime Minister threw up his hands, as honourable members will recall, on the weekend of 20 July during the transport workers' dispute and said : 'Okay, let the settlement be what it will'. Just a few days later-on 31 July- the Commission, inevitably in that context, abandoned indexation. It is in that context that wages have exploded. We now have the hypocrisy of this Government, having created the environment in which these things were inevitable, saying: 'A plague upon your house'. Wages are, of course, relevant. What is required is a policy within which government will exercise surveillance in regard to all claims upon our resources. We should not have this hypocrisy of the Government, having set the forces loose and having set the fires going, donning the fireman' s helmet with this sense of responsibility. The Government has created the situation and it is answerable for it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The extracts which the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) quoted from the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) are indeed an accurate description of the economy, and he knows it. Indeed, he has said similar things inside and outside this Parliament concerning the external factors applying to this country 's economy at present. Also he and a number of union leaders have made observations which indicated that there has been an excessive growth in wages which has only aggravated the situation. I recall that the honourable member, when he was President of the Australian Labor Party and President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, acknowledged on a Monday Conference program- I recollect it being in about 1976-that there had been a massive wages explosion in 1973 and 1974. He was one of the first leaders of the Labor movement to acknowledge that that was so. It is interesting, therefore, to look at the table which he has incorporated in Hansard from this year's Budget Papers. The figures of real unit labour costs for 1975-76 are, indeed, the same on that index as they are in the second half of 1981-82. But what the honourable member omitted to say is that in 1972-73-you, Mr Speaker, were the Treasurer for the first part of that financial year-the real unit labour cost index was 101 as opposed to 108 in 1975-76.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the honourable member for Wills, and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in his speech on the Budget, seem to regard as respectable is the wages explosion of 1973-74 which took the real unit labour cost figure to that height. In the intervening period the Government has worked very hard, as the table demonstrates, to bring that figure down. It is the resultant wages explosion to which the honourable member referred which has brought it back to that situation . The Leader of the opposition expressed some satisfaction with that situation in his speech on the Budget but the honourable member for Wills, quite skilfully I thought, steered away from expressing that satisfaction, which shows a degree of intellectual integrity. Most of the matters to which the honourable member referred were irrelevant to the real management of the economy. The Prices Justification Tribunal had reached a stage where it was justifying prices which the market could not bear and which would have aggravated inflation had the market been able to bear them. We have, in fact, strengthened the Trade Practices Commission and it has a prices surveillance role, albeit not what the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Labor Party would have. Let us look at what the ACTU and the ALP would do. Again, it is interesting that not a word has been said by the honourable member for Wills in this debate, or other debates, about what Labor would do were it in government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must confess that the honourable member for Wills said something in his speech on the Budget but he has not said anything in his speeches on matters of public importance. He has attacked the Government, glossing over the need for some constructive alternative to be put. I think I must say that in fairness to members of the public who are trying to make sense of this debate. On the face of it, the statements that the member for Wills made in his speech on the Budget and the ACTU-ALP prices and incomes so-called agreement in principle would appear to commit the ALP to supporting full indexation of wages for consumer price index movements. The honourable member has indicated in other statements that there is at this stage in our economy a need for some restraint and for partial indexation. I would like to hear a little more from him on that point. When it comes to attributing blame for the situation let us go to the authority itself, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. When the Full Bench of the Commission abandoned indexation on 27 June 1979 it stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For reasons which will become clear, we do not propose to follow the usual course of detailing the claims and attitudes of the various parties as a background to our decision . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Instead, we will set out the circumstances which have taken us to the brink of announcing today the abandonment of indexation. Shortly put, the actions and attitudes of various participants in the system are incompatible with its effective operation . . . There are a number of interacting factors which have contributed to the present crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU, some other peak councils and individual unions have authorised campaigns for increases which are clearly outside the guidelines. Past partial indexation decisions and the move to six monthly hearings are said to have contributed to an increase in industrial unrest. </PARA>
<PARA> Individual unions have accompanied claims for wage increases with costly and protracted strikes, bans or limitations aimed at softening up the employers in negotiation and the Commission in arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA>A number of other points were made by the Commission. A little further in its decision, the Full Bench of the Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Many employers have insufficiently resisted claims outside indexation. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 4 of its judgment, the Full Bench of the Commission continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It will be apparent that no one group can be held responsible for the present crisis and any attempt to apportion blame would be fruitless. Experience has demonstrated that any action which may be regarded as a sign of weakened commitment will give encouragement to other actions inconsistent with the effective operation of the package. </PARA>
<PARA>The views of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission are a far cry from the oration and the so-called analysis which we have heard today from the honourable member for Wills. It is ironic that when the Opposition examines the present state of the economy it should regard the wages explosion which occurred in 1973 -74 and again in 1974-75 as being an appropriate starting point and an appropriate situation. An examination of figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics reveals that in 1974-75 average weekly earnings increased by 25.4 per cent on top of an increase of 16.2 per cent in the previous financial year. Quite clearly, that outcome can be attributed to the economic policy of the government of the time and also to its industrial relations policy. Is that the situation which the Opposition would have us go back to as a starting point for an adequate relationship between wages and other indicators in the economy? The wages and conditions within the area of Commonwealth employment were used as a pace setter. We have done the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us recall what the strategy of this Government has been in this area. We urged the Remuneration Tribunal to bring in a recommendation to this Parliament which was considerably less than-ultimately, it was about half-the amount it might have fixed on ordinary salary fixing consideratons. Instead, it decided that a salary rise of 7 per cent was the appropriate figure for the people within its jurisdiction. Subsequently, a similar percentage was recommended by the Academic Salaries Tribunal and then the private sector responded with a similar approach to private sector salaries. In fact, the Government wrote to leaders of the private sector urging them to follow its example. So far, the responses that we have received indicate that the private sector is doing precisely that. By that action we have not sought to make scapegoats of the trade union movement or the workers of this country, as the honourable member for Wills said. We have said that the lid was kept on but the contents exploded and without attributing blame-the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been at great pains to take that approach-we now urge everyone to accept restraint as a sensible approach. It is one thing which we can influence in our domestic economy. So many of the factors that influence our economy are external and beyond our influence. </PARA>
<PARA> We have done more than simply ask the wage fixing tribunals to follow the Remuneration Tribunal's example. I am pleased to say that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission last Friday decided to follow that example in respect of the Public Service case. But we have done more than that in this Budget. As I and other honourable members have pointed out many times, we have listened to what the ACTU said it needed by way of budgetary measures to improve the real disposable income of its members, the workers of Australia, to whom the honourable member for Wills has referred. We then set out to meet those requests . As has been said by several speakers, the standard fitter, who has been a yardstick so many times in the national wage cases advanced by the honourable member for Wills in his previous capacity, has now received what amounts to a increase in the order of $40. He would need to get from a tribunal an increase of about $40 to give him in real disposable terms what he will receive in this Budget through tax reductions, the lifting of the tax threshold and, of course, increases in the family allowance. We have attended to the things that we were asked to attend to and now we are entitled to expect that the trade union movement will show some restraint and will, in fact, take those things into account. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that when the ACTU finally studied the Budget and finally made a genuine response to the Budget it took into account the fact that those taxation requests had been met and that we had, in fact, gone a long way towards improving the real disposable income of its members. The ACTU made three main points. I remind the House of them. It said that the personal income tax measures illustrated the way in which a government can contribute to industrial relations stability. Is that what the Leader of the Opposition or the honourable member for Wills said? No, it is not. It is what an ACTU resolution said with respect to the Budget. The ACTU went on to say that these measures satisfy ACTU demands this year for tax indexation and an equitable redistribution of the income tax burden away from lower income earners and families. As such, they alleviate the need for unions to build income tax increases into claims for cost of living adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this Government which has taken massive strides in finding out what the ACTU wants and, in the Budget, meeting the ACTU request to help in the fight against inflation by asking that wages move as little as possible in the next 12 months in order to play a part in helping our economic recovery. The fact is that the real unit labour costs now are the same as they were in 1975-76. That is not only unacceptable to us as an outcome but also it is a measure of how easily in the wages explosion, to which the honourable member for Wills referred , the hard fought gains in the first few years of this Government have been squandered. We hope that people will follow the example of a number of ACTU leaders in some of the statements that they made prior to the Budget and also Mr Wran, the New South Wales Premier and President of the ALP, who has made similar statements and introduced similar legislation into the New South Wales Parliament adopting the approach taken by this Government in its submission to the Remuneration Tribunal, and the Remuneration Tribunal's response. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no way that anyone in this chamber should be taking any comfort from the massive increase in real wages that occurred between 1973 and 1975. That ought not to be a satisfactory bench-mark. The Government takes the view very strongly that when there is an identifiable area within our economy which we can influence-in this case wages and salaries-we should do our best to influence it. We are satisfied that this Budget goes as far as economic circumstances permit in meeting the living standard requirements of people. We believe that the taxation reductions and concessions and the welfare measures contained in this Budget must be taken into account by the ACTU and that the best possible wages outcome for us is to have the least possible increase in wages and salaries in the next 12 months. We call upon not only the trade union leaders and the tribunals but also the employers of this country to think very carefully about any kind of deals which they might be tempted to do with certain trade unions. Those deals can be only at the expense of jobs. There is no comfort to anyone in finding those who are in a job getting more while more people lose a job as a result of that. There is no substance to this matter of public importance. It is most important that the examples set by the Government be followed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate my wholehearted and unqualified support for the raising of the matter of public importance by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's impetus to uncontrolled wage movements and its attempt now to blame such movements for its own abject failure in the management of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee), who has just spoken, suggested that the Government is not looking for scapegoats in making the claim that the level of real wages is important to all of the economic deficiencies being experienced at present. That assertion simply is not correct. This Government has been looking for scapegoats for its own inadequacies and deficiencies in relation to economic matters since 1975 when it first came into government. Let us examine some of those people and groups within the community that have been blamed by this Government consecutively over that period for its inadequacies. The Government has blamed the education system in general and school teachers in particular. It has blamed the unemployed themselves. It has blamed the trade unions. It has blamed industrial disputes. It has blamed State government expenditure and State government borrowing. It has blamed changes in technology. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in his state of the nation speech in March of this year, finally decided, after all those other interests had been blamed, that it was the community's expectations which were too high. If the community were prepared to bring down its expectations all would be well. The Treasurer (Mr Howard), not to be outdone, decided to blame pessimism within the media. In April this year on Channel 9's Today program the Treasurer referred to 'the danger of the nation being talked into a deeper recession'. What we had then was a whole range of things on to which this Government has attempted to sheet blame for its own inadequacies. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of this scattergun approach this government has decided to home in on two particular causes: Firstly, overseas developments and secondly, the level of incomes, especially wages. The honourable member for Wills has admirably outlined the background to the second of those factors. It is becoming increasingly difficult for the Government to blame overseas developments because Australia's performance is worse than that in comparable countries in all of the critical economic indicators. Our unemployment is higher; our inflation is higher; our interest rates are higher; our investment is lower; and our economic growth is lower than all those countries with which we might compare Australia. Let us have a look at the other cause-sheeting the blame home to the level of real wages or real incomes. Let me dispose now of the simplistic nonsense being peddled by this Government that the level of earnings lies at the basis of our economic troubles. If the Government is correct in this assertion then when real incomes are falling unemployment will be falling, inflation will be falling and real gross domestic product will be growing. During the first period of this Government, from 1975-76 to 1979-80, the real value of average weekly earnings fell by 8.5 per cent. If this Government's assertions had been correct unemployment should have fallen, inflation should have fallen and real gross domestic product should have grown. What happened? During that period when the real value of average weekly earnings was declining unemployment grew, from 4.6 per cent in August 1975 to 5.9 per cent in August 1980. Inflation increased again in the latter part of that period, from 8.2 per cent in 1978-79 to 10.7 per cent in 1979-80. From 1975-76 to 1979-80 real economic growth averaged only 2.5 per cent. So the assertion of this Government is shown by evidence taken from that period to be without substance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at what happened after that. In 1979-80 average weekly earnings rose by 12 per cent against a consumer price index increase of 10.7 per cent-that is, real incomes rose. According to this Government unemployment levels then should have increased, inflation should have increased and real GDP should have fallen as a result of that increase in the real value of average weekly earnings. Let us have a look at what actually happened. Consumer spending increased. Private fixed capital investment increased. Unemployment fell from 6. 2 per cent in August 1978 to 5.9 per cent in August 1980. The rate of inflation fell from 10.7 per cent in 1979-80 to 9.4 per cent in 1980-81. Non-farm sector GDP increased by 4 per cent in real terms in 1980-81 compared with the average that I referred to of 2.5 per cent over the previous four years. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that all one has to do to improve economic performance is to take steps to increase the real value of incomes, it would be absurd for me to say that. It is equally absurd for this Government to persist with this simplistic nonsense about the level of economic performance in Australia being determined and directly influenced by the level of real wages. As the honourable member for Wills has indicated, the Government has attempted to make the trade union movement and the expectations of trade unionists in Australia about their material welfare the scapegoats for the Government's own inadequacy. I assure the House that neither the Opposition nor the Australian people will allow the Government to get away with that. A number of such statements have been made by the Treasurer in his Budget speeches. The most recent statement, of course, the one to which the honourable member for Wills referred, introduced the Budget this year. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> These adverse international influences--</PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to note the words 'international influences'-</PARA>
<PARA>were compounded, by a significant worsening on the domestic wages front. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to note the words, 'domestic wages'. The Treasurer continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The need for maximum wage restraint has therefore been much in the Government's mind in framing this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>At present there is one centre of responsibility, and one centre of responsibility alone, which has caused the present economic circumstances. It is this Government's incoherent and obsessive persistence with monetarist nonsense that has found expression in Budget after Budget. This Government and the nation know that the Budget for the year 1981-82 locked the country into minimal economic growth, and minimal economic growth occurred. The Budget for this year has locked the nation into zero growth, and zero growth will occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I gave figures on unemployment in my speech on the Budget which have not yet been refuted. I said that unemployment by June of next year will go through the roof. Do not let it be said that the Government is not creating employment. As a result of this year's Budget the Government is creating employment for about 270 ,000 people. I will qualify that statement by saying that everyone of these 270, 000 jobs will be created overseas. I will prove it. </PARA>
<PARA> The overseas deficit of this country is almost $2,000m and because of the domestic surplus Australian workers will be thrown out of jobs. The Government's payments overseas for goods and services will exceed its receipts from overseas by almost $2,000m. If the expenditure multiplier for the Government overseas deficit is two, this deficit will be converted to total overseas expenditure generation of $4,000m. If average incomes amongst our chief suppliers are $15, 000 a year then this Government's overseas deficit will generate 270,000 jobs for people in overseas countries. Let us not have any further nonsense from spokesmen from the Government side in connection with what lies at the base of our problems at present. It is the crazy, obsessive pursuit on the part of the Government in relation to economic measures that has been responsible for that situation. As I have said neither the Opposition nor the Australian people will allow the Government to wriggle from underneath that fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence I point out that when I was responding to the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) on his point about the breakdown of indexation I quoted from a judgment of June 1979 and, I think, described it as being the case in which indexation broke down.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understood it all perfectly and I intend to demonstrate that by reducing the speech to its rather simple elements. The honourable member for Wills would have us believe that this Government can no longer blame, as it would apparently, world factors for our indifferent economic performance at this time nor can it blame wage earners, presumably, for any adverse effect that this Government might allege they are having on our economic performance. As I understood him the honourable member then attempted to suggest that the unions' claims and presumably the claims of wage earners were as a result of two factors . One fact was the expectations that wage earners were led to believe were theirs as a result of a speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and numbers of other speeches by Government spokesmen. The second factor was the approach of the Government when it was elected on the last occasion to cutting costs and the consequential abolition of the Prices Justification Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have made those points in two minutes, but that was the substance of the speech of the honourable member for Wills. He came to the conclusion that of course wages are relevant to our present economic difficulties but that what is needed is a policy. But in the time available, which I thought could have been used very constructively, he failed to give us that policy. The honourable member had a number 2 speaker. If this were a schoolboy debate, which it is not, one obviously would have listened to the second speaker's speech in conjunction with that of the honourable member for Wills. The honourable member for Hunter ( Mr Robert Brown) picked up only one of the points of the honourable member for Wills. That point was in relation to world factors. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member would like to tell me that he picked the point up adequately. On this occasion the number 2 speaker, who had the opportunity to spell out what the Opposition had in mind to deal with our economic circumstances, failed dismally. I wanted to hear from either of these Opposition spokesmen an alternative approach. Most people understand that we are going through difficult economic times. Most people understand that overseas markets are dropping and rural products will lose their gloss-because of drought there will not be products available to sell-and other countries are able to market their products in our country more cheaply than we can make them ourselves, notwithstanding our significant tariff protection and other restrictions which are involved. Most people understand that it is very hard to have lower interest rates in Australia when interest rates are high abroad. Most people understand very clearly that Australia relies for a significant part of its income, its export earnings, on mined products and that those markets abroad are very important. We cannot expect to sell coal and iron to other countries if they are not manufacturing steel in increasing quantities. If there is an internationsl downturn, of course, that will have consequences in Australia. I do not need a set of statistics to be able to prove that. I do not need to quote that chapter and verse: It is obvious for all to see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we couple that with very significant wage increases in Australia we see further that the country is losing its competitive edge, its markets and its ability to be able to manufacture products for those areas in which we have been able to market successfully before this time. Real wage increases in the present economic circumstances are a very real difficulty. We know that and the Australian Labor Party knows it. The honourable member for Wills in his concluding remarks admitted that. We know this fact because of our own experience. In the years 1973-75 we had a very rapid increase in wages in this country. It had the consequential effect of causing very high levels of unemployment. As a result of that wage explosion, as it was called, we saw an increase in wages in the order of 25 per cent on top of the 16 per cent increase for the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party recognised that that had dreadful ramifications. I think it was a previous Labor Minister, the Honourable Clyde Cameron, who said that 'one man's pay rise is another man's job'. Of course, we know that one of the significant reasons for the wage explosion at that time was the pacesetter policy pursued by the Commonwealth Government in the public sector. Of course, after a short time it reined in on that. But it was too late; the damage had been done. Later the present Government came to office and, through its arguments before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, indexation operated very successfully. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that indexation was sabotaged not by the Government but by elements of the trade union movement which consistently went outside indexation and argued for significant reductions in working hours and for increased and over-award payments. In many cases, they were able to bargain successfully for those claims outside the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Which commission could go on honourably fixing wage increases across the board when significant numbers of parties arguing before it were going outside it and working out a separate deal? It could not go on like that. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission recognised that and, for course, we saw the abandonment of indexation. It is unfortunate because I believe there ought to be a capacity for a body such as the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to distribute the benefits of productivity increases evenly throughout the community. But it cannot be done when there are in the community selfish groups which want to argue outside that system and which want to take a great deal more for themselves; it only has the very harmful effects that we have seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the post-indexation period, this Government has endeavoured, particularly through the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee), who is at the table, to put into place discussions to bring about an agreed result and an improvement in industrial relations and to achieve a worthwhile advance through co-operation. The Minister gave a very admirable speech last Friday to the Employers' Federation of New South Wales at its industrial relations conference, which was headed 'The Industrial Malaise-What is the Cure?' The Minister opened the conference and dealt with the problems of labour costs which , as I have mentioned, are very significant. I believe the honourable member for Wills also has acknowledged this. The Minister spoke about the Government's wage policy and the way in which the Government was putting it in place. He gave further details of the tripartite discussions which he had initiated and emphasised their importance. </PARA>
<PARA> In that speech he quoted some statements made by people in the trade union movement who recognised the difficult economic circumstances we are in and their responsibility to operate co-operatively in this area. He spoke of the importance of wage restraint; he reiterated those points in his speech today. He spoke of the Government's approach to the Remuneration Tribunal and the acceptance by that Tribunal of the Government's arguments that there was a need for wage restraint generally, and of the pursuit before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission of the wider case in relation to the Commonwealth Public Service. Although the Minister did not mention it, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission accepted the Governments's case in that instance. He mentioned the Government's approach to a large number of major corporations and State governments and its argument before them of the need of wage restraint and of their acceptance of it. The Minister also mentioned-I think it needs to be said over and over again-the Government's positive response to the request from the Australian trade union movement for a number of Budget initiatives. The cuts in personal income tax from November 1982 arose directly out of the Government's discussions with the unions and were a very important part of the Government's co-operative approach. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of RAAF Base, Derby, WA, stage 1. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal is for the establishment of a forward defence air base at Derby to allow operation by all types of Royal Australian Air Force aircraft deployed there from time to time. The proposal comprises: A runway, a taxiway system, four aircraft parking aprons, ordnance loading facilities, flight line facilities, a living area for RAAF personnel and associated engineering services . </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee endorsed the need for a military airfield in the north-west of Australia and found the site at Derby South to be satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also reported that the extent of the proposed stage 1 development of RAAF Derby is adequate for current defence requirements subject to a reassessment, by the Department of Defence, of its use by B52 aircraft. Consideration has been given to providing for B52s at Derby. It has been concluded that, if facilities are required for B52s, at an airfield other than Darwin, they could be provided more economically at Learmonth. The estimated cost of the work is $50.7m at April 1982 prices. The Committee has recommended construction of the work in the reference. If the House agrees to support this motion, planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following elements of the work known as the redevelopment of Brisbane International Airport, remainder of works of phase 1, which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) main aircraft apron;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) buildings and facilities including control tower, administrative area, fire stations, maintenance depot, electricity, water supply and sewerage;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) general aviation runway and apron pavements, and a general aviation maintenance area, and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) access roads, carparks and landscaping. </PARA>
<PARA>These elements, which are estimated to cost $115.7m at January 1982 prices, comprise only a part of the work referred to the Committee. The full work referred to the Committee was estimated to cost $164.6m at January 1982 prices, as it also included a common user domestic passenger terminal complex and a hangar for Department of Aviation aircraft maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> In reporting to Parliament the Committee has made a number of recommendations relating to both the timing and the scope of the work referred to it. In regard to timing the Committee has reported in conclusions 1 and 2 that it adheres to its earlier conclusion that the provision of new facilities by 1986 will be premature. The Committee has recommended that the work be reprogrammed so that completion is delayed until 1990, in such a way that the greater part of the expenditure is not committed until the 1986-87 to 1988-89 financial years. After consideration of the Committee's report the Government has decided not to defer the targeted opening date of the airport by four years. The circumstances have not changed sufficiently since the original hearing by the Committee in 1979 to warrant such a major delay in the project. However in view of the levels of Commonwealth expenditure on a considerable number of other aviation projects, particularly in Queensland, and also because of the need to resolve issues of terminal operation with the major airlines it is now likely that Brisbane Airport redevelopment works will be commissioned during 1987 rather than in 1986 . </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusions 3 and 6 the Committee has reported that the proposal for the domestic terminal should be further examined when the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) and his Department have concluded the re-examination of the preferable terminal type. It has also reported that it was not satisfied with the need for or the design of the proposed Department of Aviation hangar. The Committee has indicated it will further examine both the domestic terminal and the aviation hangar and make a further report. The Government does not object to such action and further evidence will be provided to the Committee as soon as possible. In conclusions 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 the Committee has indicated that it is satisfied with the design and siting of the various other elements of the work referred to it, including the proposal to relocate the Kingsford-Smith Memorial, and has recommended the carrying out of these elements, subject to its views on timing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already advised the House that the Government does not accept delay until 1990. There are a number of other observations in the body of the report on which I believe the House would wish to have the Government's response. In paragraphs 28 to 31 the Committee has expressed the opinion that, based on all the evidence submitted to it and on its own considerations, it was not prepared to accept that a balanced examination had been made of the full range of possible solutions that could be adopted which would permit continued operation of the present domestic terminal complex until the 1990s. The Committee was also not prepared to accept the view put to it on the adequacy of the present terminal facility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Aviation in its evidence to the Committee sought to identify the problems in the existing domestic terminal area which already exist and will worsen with time. Improvements and changes to the patterns of aircraft parking, road traffic and car parking have been made during the last few years which have fully utilised the available ground space. With the commitment to the Queensland Government for the Gateway Bridge northern approach roads this area is being further reduced. Further development of the existing airport facilities to make them suitable for use until 1990 would involve high capital and operating costs that would not be justified for the relatively short period of use involved. The Government considers that the facility is already at capacity and no acceptable alternatives exist to extend its life to 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> In paragraph 34 the Committee indicated that it remains critical of the failure to develop a national priority evaluation of airport development needs. I would like to advise the House that the aerodrome capital works program results from consideration of submissions received mainly from the aviation industry and the operational and planning areas within the Department of Aviation. However, from time to time the Government, on its own initiative, proposes items which it considers to be in the public interest. As a result the priority of airport development programs is continually under review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was also concerned about and critical of the fact that the differing views on the selection of a common user type or a joint user type of terminal that have been put forward were not resolved before the proposal was referred to it. The proposal referred to the Committee was in accordance with Government policy and therefore it was appropriate that the Department of Aviation proceed with the referral even though the agreement of Ansett Airlines of Australia could not be obtained to the common user principle of operation by the time that the hearing was held. The Department of Aviation is actively pursuing this issue with the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee expressed the view at paragraph 63 that there is an obligation on all parties to ensure that effective consultation takes place before a proposal is presented at a public hearing. The Committee further stated that, while many organisations were contacted on this proposal, questions were debated before the Committee which should have been resolved beforehand. The Government agrees with the need for effective consultation on proposals before presentation at a public hearing. Such consultations were carried out in this instance but did not always achieve agreement. The proposals put forward represented what appeared to be a satisfactory compromise. One of the purposes of the public hearing is to allow dissenting views to be canvassed in a public forum. What occurred in this case was an example of the canvassing of such dissenting views. I seek the agreement of the House for the elements of the work contained in the motion to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst welcoming the motion moved by the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt), I wish to point out a few relevant facts to the Minister so that he may consider them in respect of the further report that will come from the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works with regard to Brisbane International Airport. I feel that the Minister's delaying of work until 1987 is not warranted. I would have preferred the Minister to continue as he has with his Department so that the work would be finished by the end of 1986. That deadline should be met. The Department of Transport and Construction has always been on schedule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I feel that this delay is not really due to a lack of finance or anything else other than a lack of consultation by the Department of Aviation. A letter that the Department received from the Brisbane air traffic controllers stated that they are still at odds with practically all the operational aspects of the new airport, that that was evident from their attitude at the Public Works Committee hearing and that they would appreciate discussion on as wide a basis as possible . I point out to the Minister that at the public hearing in Brisbane it was discovered that there was a lack of consultation with all the people involved. All the people who gave evidence, including departmental representatives, said that they had not had enough consultation with the Department of Aviation. I feel that that is a very relevant point. We had public servants and members of parliament coming to Brisbane from all over Australia to attend a public hearing and when we got there we found out that we could not deal fully with the items before the Committee because of what a high official of Ansett Airlines of Australia had said to the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife). He had said that Ansett was not happy with certain aspects of the common user facilities provided at the airport, and we found that we could not deal with that aspect of the inquiry. At page 3 the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not object to such action and further evidence will be provided to the Committee as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I urge the Minister to have that evidence before the Committee urgently so that it can be dealt with by the Committee as soon as possible; otherwise we will find that completion of the Brisbane international and domestic terminals will probably be delayed until 1990 because it will take quite a deal of time for Ansett and Trans Australia Airlines to make up their minds. As I said before, we have had all this consultation and yet they are not satisfied with the design of the terminal which the Department of Aviation had put to them. I think it is very important that that evidence should come before the Committee as soon as possible so that we can deal with it and get on with the completion of the terminal that is so urgently needed and deserved at the Brisbane International Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which people have to be attended to at the international and domestic terminals is a disgrace. I am glad that the Department has seen the chaos that exists today. Whilst we know that Ansett and TAA have spent a considerable sum of money on their domestic terminals, as far as I am concerned that does not prove that it is urgent that we get on with the job of building the new domestic and international terminals. I urge the Minister to get that evidence before the Committee as soon as possible so that we can deal with it and get on with the job of building the airport. I know the Minister has been very kind to the domestic users, and his Department is to be congratulated for the way in which it has handled the Brisbane international terminal design. It is a great engineering feat and it is a great step forward for the Department. I urge the Minister to ask the Minister for Aviation to get that evidence before the Committee so that the Queensland people can have the airport that they justly deserve. Any further delay in that evidence coming to the Committee will mean that Ansett and TAA will get their way and will push this matter aside, and it will probably be 1990 before we get the airport we deserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Asian Development Fund Bill authorises a further contribution by Australia to the Asian Development Bank for the purposes of the Asian Development Fund. The Bill replenishes the Fund for the third time. The amount that Australia will contribute to the Fund will not exceed $212,332,030. The Fund is a very important one. We played a leading role in the establishment of it in 1974. It was first replenished in 1976. It operates in the Asian-Pacific regions in a similar fashion to the World Bank's soft lending affiliate, and provides help to Third World, poorer countries. Some idea of the value of the work it does can be ascertained from the fact that the Bank has lent about $US10 billion for projects involving transport, communications, industry and electric power as well as agriculture, education, water supply and urban development. In recent years an increasing proportion has been devoted to agricultural development and to social development, for example in health, population and water supply projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a matter for concern that the United States has been unable to maintain its contribution to this Fund. Therefore, the target for the Fund has had to be reduced, and that is a very retrogressive operation. The Fund hoped to achieve a target of about $US4.1 billion but it has had to be reduced to $US3.2 billion. Australia, though, has had to increase its share from 5.14 per cent to 7.2 per cent. This represents no real increase in our contribution as the total target has been decreased but the replenishment is in line with Australia's share in the Bank's capital stock. It is worthy of note that when the Fund makes what it calls procurement decisions to implement projects, Australia's share of the contract disbursements has been much less than its proportional contribution, which, some have said, is due to the fact that Australia is less competitive. But I very much doubt that statement when we look at the type of projects the Bank engages in-irrigation and matters of that type. In my view Australia is a world leader. I have had discussions with representatives of the Bank in Manila. It was felt that we did not have enough consultancy expertise in Manila. I think that is a matter we certainly should be able to remedy quickly. It is rather sad to have to make this comment, but the head of the World Bank, Mr McNamara, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> For the first time in 50 years the US is saying that it cannot afford to continue increasing its aid program . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that statement is altogether valid. I am mindful of the fact that General Haig said that there was some need for long term and generous concessional aid to the very poorest countries. I think we would all agree with that, but we would hardly agree with the fact that it is important, according to the present Administration of the United States, that the Third World should rely mainly on private capital and market forces to overcome the problems of development. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerns the Opposition is the exploitation of cheap labour, often removing people from their villages and home environment, to work in very difficult conditions on the basis that they would be better off economically. All these people do is make a blouse or a pair of jeans and their pay is minimal . They do not even get the benefit of the product. In our own nation I think there is the rather short sighted attitude that we are helping the poor in these countries by putting them on a concrete floor. They work for 12 hours a day for as little as $1. That is deemed to be economic progress. I think it is important that we consider what this Bank is all about. Health, hygiene, education, transport, housing and matters such as that are much more important for the Third World. The countries which qualify for assistance do not have a large gross national product. It has to be under $US200 at 1976 levels. The people are virtually on a starvation diet. It is counterproductive to have people in a number of areas importing food when, with a bit of intelligence and aid, our farmers and experts could intruct them in what is called dry land farming, water conservation and, particularly, irrigation, together with rice cropping methods that we are able to develop here. It would be of much greater advantage to these people if they could produce their own food without having to work in a factory and not earn enough to live on. </PARA>
<PARA> Another serious matter concerns Vietnam and the attempts being made to isolate it. I know that Vietnam is a former enemy of the United States and Australia, but peace has come about. If we are to maintain it it is important to give aid that is of value to the people of Vietnam. We are talking about people, not administration. The Asian Development Bank has rejected applications from Vietnam because the United States has objected. Vietnam joined the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, and it clearly qualifies for assistance but it does not get it. No loan has been made to Vietnam since 1975. The directors have denied funds for new projects to Vietnam alone of all the Bank's 21 borrowers. Vietnam is certainly creditworthy because a report of the International Monetary Fund of October 1977 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The long run economic prospects appear favourable. Vietnam is rich in natural resources, and has a disciplined and educated work force. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no good complaining, as we are prone to do, that Vietnam is taking aid from the Soviet Union. It has nowhere else to go. If the idea of the Development Fund is to foster economic growth and co-operation in the Asian region then Vietnam qualifies. Denying it funds is obviously trying to maintain the view that we can keep Vietnam poor and bring it to its knees. On the contrary; we are just driving it into the arms of the Soviet Union. One can see the problems that would arise if another super-power decided to establish a number of bases there. It certainly would not be of any advantage to China and it does nothing for peace and stability in the region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They will get out of Cambodia if China stops supporting Pol Pot . I am delighted that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) will not recognise Pol Pot. I have been in the camps in Kampuchea. One of the persons the people in the camps are the most frightened of is Pol Pot-this genocidal maniac who has destroyed three million people. I have spoken to Nguyen co Thach, the Vietnamese Foreign Minister. It might do us a world of good to invite him to Australia. He will tell us that Vietnam will get out of Kampuchea if Pol Pot is disarmed. But Vietnam will not leave itself in a position where it could have a surgical strike by China from the north and a simultaneous action by Pol Pot from the west. I spoke recently to an Italian Roman Catholic aid worker from Kampuchea who said that the people have never seen things so improved since Pol Pot has been pushed back. Unfortunately it has been suggested that Thailand is harbouring Pol Pot. If we have that sort of difficulty we are really looking for further danger. The Minister should not make interjections like that again unless he wants to be helpful. I have been to Vietnam. We had a paltry dairy project there. We cancelled that project as some sort of retribution. The Catholic Bishop of Hanoi is pleading for aid. He does not want aid for any armament purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude with this question: How counterproductive is it to see one of the Lebanese leaders deploring the fact that the Palestinians have been massacred by bombs and bullets all made in the United States of America?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Experience has clearly shown that one of the most effective ways of assisting the world's developing countries-we are now concerned with a number of the world's developing countries-towards growth and modernisation has been through the international development banks which have been established around the world. These banks are created not merely to lend money but also to provide other forms of assistance, advice and guidance to these countries. Of course, we are now dealing with one of those banks-the Asian Development Bank. I think it is fair to say that this is one of the most successful of these insitutions. It is very good to see that by way of the Asian Development Fund Bill the Government is providing a substantial amount of money to that Bank to enable it to continue its valuable work. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) mentioned, the purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution by Australia of an amount of some $212m towards the third replenishment of the Asian Development Fund. This Fund is administered by the Asian Development Bank, which was established in 1966 to assist the economic development of member countries and to foster economic and social growth and co- operation in the general Asian and Pacific regions. It is pleasing that the Government has decided to continue its support of the Bank and its work by providing, as I have said, this very substantial additional sum of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bank has always approached its task with vigour and common sense, especially during recent times. We have had difficult economic times which have affected most countries throughout the world. They certainly have affected the problems faced by that Bank in doing its valuable work. I believe that the bank has approached its task very well over that period. As has already been mentioned, its range of activities is very broad. It has lent some $10,000m for projects covering all the major sectors of economic development, with special emphasis on transport, communications industry and electric power as well as special projects for agriculture, education, water supply and urban development. In recent times the Bank has tended to devote a very substantial part of its work and the funds available to it to agricultural development and to improving the quality of life of the people in the developing nations of Asia and the Pacific countries especially by promoting good health and, in particular, providing funds for new water supply projects. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is appropriate to congratulate the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) on the leading role Australia continues to play in the development of this important Fund and in the operations of the Asian Development Bank. Australia contributed $A97m or 5.14 per cent to the last replenishment target of $US2,150m to cover concessional lending for the period 1979-82.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I want to make some points during this debate concerning Australia's relationship with countries in Asia and the Pacific region. I believe that the remarks are related very directly to the general import of the legislation that we are now debating. Australians must now realise that we are not an outpost of Europe. In many respects we have been forgotten by Europe. Perhaps it is also fair to say that we have forgotten Europe. This is only natural because, in a physical sense, we are so far removed from Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is important in this day and age for us to realise just where we are as a country. We must realise our identity and where we are situated in the world. Australia should recognise that it is close to both Asia and the Pacific nations. We must do all we can to develop the closest possible relationship with all of the nations in our region. If we develop closer links with our friends in Asia and the Pacific we must not only say the right things but also act in the right way. This means that we must make a real contribution to the poorer nations of the region but, at the same time, show an appreciation of the significance and the importance of these nations, no matter how small or how poor they may be. A close relationship can also benefit Australia. We may be able to learn a great deal from these nations in terms of their culture and their lifestyle. It is not a one-way thing. They may be able also to learn from us but we can also learn from them. </PARA>
<PARA> As evidenced by this Bill and the sum of money we are providing by way of the Bill, we can and should make a material contribution to these nations. In my view we should not seek immediate, tangible benefits in return for any assistance that we may give. Part of the reason why our standing is so high in Asia and the Pacific region is that we have given aid freely, without strings being attached; without giving with one hand and taking away with the other. I think some other nations have fallen down in this respect. Whenever they have given money they have expected something immediately in return. I honestly believe that our standing is very high in this region. </PARA>
<PARA> Genuine friendship, whether personal or international, should not be selfish or a matter of convenience. That is not the way in which we should approach relations in Asia and the Pacific region. Nevertheless, our own national interests cannot be ignored. If our taxpayers are willing-as I believe they are- to give large sums of money as assistance to these poorer nations it is only fair that our industries should have an opportunity to sell in the market places of these countries. Again, this is a two-way thing. Those countries should also, over time, have a chance to sell in Australia. But such moves should always be gradual; they should not be sudden. The moves should be sensible, bearing in mind that at this time Australia is not free of economic problems, especially unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of being close to Asia and the Pacific involves opening our doors to allow reasonable numbers of people from the region to settle permanently in this country. I am pleased to say that our immigration policies are no longer racially based. I think that is only right and proper. It is moral; it is also practical and sensible. For some years now consecutive Australian governments have seen the dangers of allowing Australia to appear to be a white outpost of Europe. I believe that if we had remained a white outpost of Europe it would have spelt disaster in the longer term. I am always sorry to hear the remarks made by people such as Mr Ruxton and others which may appear to be racially based; they certainly seem to be racially based. I think those kind of remarks and those people are on the wrong tram. I think those people have to grow up and realise the sort of country we are now and the sorts of people we now have here. I believe very strongly that our existing policies are sensible. I think the Government is doing a good job. I think the present Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges) is also doing a very good job. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people say that we are part of Asia or part of the Pacific. I do not agree : Australia is Australia. It is as simple as that. We are different in many respects from the nations of Asia and also from the small Pacific nations. But as I have said, we must do all we can to develop closer ties with the countries in this general region. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs knows, I am concerned about our relationship with countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations. The five ASEAN nations-Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand-are among the participants in the Asian Development Fund about which we are now talking. I do not believe that our relationship with ASEAN is as close as it might be. Certainly I acknowledge that Australia has repeatedly stressed its strong support for ASEAN. As ASEAN has moved to adopt common foreign policy approaches it has become increasingly important for Australia to have a continuous process of frank consultation with these countries. The consultative structure established in 1978 enables important areas to be dealt with effectively at senior officer level. I think the ASEAN- Australian forum also plays a very important role. It meets annually, and that is helping to develop good relations between our country and the country members of ASEAN. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be acknowleged that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is making every effort to develop warm and friendly relations with his counterparts in Asia and particularly in the ASEAN countries, as did his predecessor. I congratulate them for their work. The officers in the Department of Foreign Affairs-the ambassadors, the high commissioners and others-are also making every effort to seek to cement closer ties in South East Asia. I make the point that they should and must do so. If one looks at all of the issues in which we are involved in relation to the foreign relations and foreign affairs of Australia, I believe it can be seen that none of the issues is of greater significance than our relations with South East Asia. These countries form an umbrella immediately to our north. They are heavily populated countries and they are gaining in strength in many respects-economically and in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members need only to look at the population of some of these countries. Indonesia has a population of 157,595,000 people; Malaysia 14,661,000 ; the Philippines 51,574,000; Singapore 2,472,000 people; and Thailand 49,823, 000. So there are many people living in these countries. As I have said, good relations with these countries should be our number one priority in social, economic and defence terms. But I am very concerned, as I have said to the Minister before, that we appear to be on the outside. Relations are said to be warm and friendly. I do not believe that they are as warm as they should be. These countries still see us as being quite different from them and having different interests and different ambitions. While this attitude continues our relationship will be polite but it will be only lukewarm. I see strategic dangers in the strengthening of ASEAN but with Australia excluded. At the moment that area is quite stable in a political or military sense and it is also strongly anti-communist. But what will happen if ASEAN, at some future time, falls into the wrong hands? What protection will there be for Australia? I think this is a very important issue. This is why we must ensure that we have the closest possible relations with these countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel also that there are dangers that we will miss out on the tremendous economic development that is now taking place in the ASEAN region. This is the area of great economic growth at the moment. Its economic growth is probably more than it is in any other area of the world. These nations are becoming quite powerful and quite wealthy-certainly when compared with former days-and their standards of living are rising at a rapid rate. If we can develop much closer ties we can participate in this economic development of South East Asia and gain significant benefits from it. As I have said, I do not underrate the efforts that have been made by the Department of Foreign Affairs and others. I know that there has been much contact in various ways There have been bilateral projects and a whole range of different kinds of contacts. However, I believe that more can and should be done to make our relationship with ASEAN genuinely warm and friendly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Asian Development Fund also applies to the Pacific region. Many countries gain benefit from it. The Pacific region is important to Australia and we are also important to it. We can play a leading role in the Pacific region, especially in helping those nations to develop democratic systems of government and strong economies. But I want to make an important point: I do not think we should seek to dominate this region in any sense. That would be the wrong move. We should not try to make this area our own sphere of influence. It is a matter of Australia being one among equals, on an equal basis with these other nations. Although we may have a stronger economy and a larger population we should see ourselves as equals and the other countries should see us as being equal with them. </PARA>
<PARA> Having travelled to a number of Pacific countries over recent years I am satisfied that Australia's standing in the Pacific area is very high at this time. Our Foreign Ministers-the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, our previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), and others-have made a conscientious effort to develop excellent relations with Foreign Ministers representing the island nations. I know a number of honourable members have also made an effort. It is terribly important that when members of parliament go to these countries they can really improve contact and good relations between our Parliament and the parliaments of these various countries. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as providing substantial additional funds for the Asian Development Bank we are now providing greatly increased sums of money for the economic and social development of the Pacific islands. I know that the island nations certainly appreciate very much that increased assistance. I believe that they will put it to very good use. But we must not become isolated. I see this great danger that we might eventually become isolated. We have ASEAN, this great umbrella to the north, which seems to think that we are something different. We have a lot of contact with ASEAN countries. We have this large Pacific area containing very many small nations with small populations. These nations may see themselves as being very different from us. I think some people still see us as British. Some people still see us as part of Europe almost. We must develop these close ties so that we can join in, virtually as a family, with the nations to our north and the nations of the Pacific region. We must not become isolated; we cannot afford to become isolated. </PARA>
<PARA> We must concentrate our efforts on bodies and organisations which are directly relevant to our region. We are in all sorts of organisations and bodies around the world. But I believe that we have to concentrate our efforts on those international organisations and bodies such as the Asian Development Fund and the Asian Development Bank which are directly relevant to our region and to this environment. There needs to be an emphasis in our foreign affairs on Asia and on the Pacific. We need to spend less time in Europe, especially in London, and more time concentrating on Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, the Philippines and all the other nations of Asia. I am just picking a few. We need to concentrate more on Fiji, Western Samoa-where I went and had a very enjoyable time not so long ago-the Cook Islands and the many of her important nations in the Pacific. This is essential to our economic development and to our long term security. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put a couple of suggestions to the Government and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I do not have very much time left. One matter I raise concerns student exchanges. I have put this matter to the Minister before. I wish to emphasise it again. A lot of our student exchanges are with North American and European countries; some are with Asian countries. There have been a lot of exchanges in the tertiary area. A lot of Asian students have come here to study at our tertiary institutions, universities and so on. I believe that younger students, especially secondary students, should be travelling to Asia. There should be more exchanges with Asia. Children from Asia should be coming to Australia. This would enable us to get to know one another in a closer, warmer way. I refer also to political visits. I know that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has made this point and that the Minister supports it. Politicians should spend more time in Asia and the Pacific. Again, we tend to go to Europe and North America a little too often. </PARA>

Politicians should not just be spending a day or two in South East Asia; they should be spending a bit of time there. More time than that is required. I believe that our political leaders particularly should spend more time in such areas, not just a day or two. It is hard for busy people to spend a lot of time away, but they should endeavour to spend a week or two in these countries. If political leaders from Asia and the Pacific come here and spend a week or two, I think we will develop much closer relations and will understand each other at a personal level. If we can understand one another at a personal level we will begin to understand one another's politics and the problems that are facing the various countries. Honourable members should not underrate the value of personal contact. I believe that it is terribly important.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Hodgman) pointed out in his second reading speech, the purpose of this legislation is to extend the period of application of the $80 per tonne subsidy currently payable to certain users of liquefied petroleum gas. This subsidy was originally introduced in March 1980 for household and domestic consumers and later extended to include some industrial and commercial users. At that time, the arrangements were to operate for a period of only three years, expiring in March 1983, but, after reviewing the scheme, the Government has now decided to extend its operation for a further 12 months. This decision has the full support of the Opposition, as liquefied petroleum gas has become an important energy source in many parts of rural and provincial Australia. Any attempt to remove the subsidy abruptly without notification and without adequate phasing out provisions would not receive the support of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not believe the consumers who receive the subsidy should be significantly disadvantaged in terms of energy costs relative to consumers in cities. It was the disadvantaged position that these consumers were in that led to the introduction of the subsidy in the first place. During 1979 and 1980, traditional LPG users suffered from rapidly escalating prices brought about by the second oil shock of 1979. Under the Government's policy at the time, the policy of export parity pricing for LPG was established and its price trebled in only 12 months. The Government was forced to take remedial action-action, I might add, that became necessary only because of the inadequacy of Government policy at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Initially, the subsidy arrangements were introduced to assist consumers. When this failed to provide adequate relief, the Government introduced a new pricing policy for domestically consumed LPG. Under this policy, the price was set at $ 205 per tonne for all but petrochemical consumption. Since then, the weakness of the international market for oil and LPG has brought about relative stability in the domestic price. For instance, the present wholesale price is only $220.09 per tonne, compared with $205 per tonne which was the price which prevailed in April 1980. Because of this price stability, some have argued that the rationale for the subsidy is no longer applicable and the arrangements should be terminated. Although the position of traditional consumers is not as disadvantageous as it was, it is I think, important to remember that these consumers still suffer an economic handicap with respect to energy costs relative to consumers in the major cities and some provincial centres. Even with the subsidy arrangements, LPG is still more expensive than electricity and particularly natural gas or methane by pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA> Areas connected to natural gas pipeline enjoy a major advantage over those which have to rely on bottled or reticulated liquefied petroleum gas. That is, of course, reticulated through municipal gas authorities in provincial areas. It is worthwhile comparing the price differential between these two fuels. Figures produced by the Australian Gas Association show that the price of natural gas for space heating in Sydney is 0.50c a megajoule; Melbourne, 0.28c; Albury, 0. 35c; and Wagga, 0.55c a megajoule. In comparison, LPG in Griffith is 1c a megajoule; in Grafton 1.2c; and in Mount Isa in Queensland 1.7c. This is after taking the $80 per tonne subsidy into account. So the price is significantly higher in those areas. Melbourne at 0.28c is the lowest for natural gas and in Mount Isa a cost of 1.7c is the lowest price for LPG. It is about five to six times the price for natural gas. It is easy to see from these figures that the price of LPG is roughly double that of natural gas in most places. Removal of the subsidy would disadvantage consumers in these areas much more so than it would if it had been taken away in respect of city supplies. </PARA>
<PARA> In current economic circumstances it is also worth considering the position of decentralised industries that are dependent on LPG. Many companies are already facing difficulties because of the depressed state of the economy. The additional burden of increased energy costs which would come from removal of the subsidy could result in the failure of some of these industries and small businesses. Given the regional significance of some of these industries, this could severely depress the economies of the towns involved. The Opposition would like to see reticulated natural gas available to all major provincial centres. We have already seen a commitment to extend natural gas laterals to the towns of Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow in New South Wales. We have made that commitment as a party. When I talk about reticulated natural gas, I am not talking about reticulated LPG, I am talking about reticulated methane or pipeline gas. In Victoria this comes from Bass Strait, in New South Wales from the Cooper Basin, in Queensland from the Surat Basin and in Western Australia from Dongara and soon from the North West Shelf. However, the size of many towns makes the supply of natural gas to them uneconomic. It is only fair that the people in these areas receive some assistance to narrow the gap between their costs and the costs which their city counterparts bear when it comes to the price of energy in this form. </PARA>
<PARA> The other fuel which is available to these consumers is electricity. The Government's intention at the time of the introduction of the subsidy on LPG was to give consumers adequate time to convert to available alternatives, especially electricity. However, the applicability of this strategy must now be brought into question, given the problems associated with electricity generating capacity in the eastern States. The additional demand which could come from too rapid a rate of conversion would place considerable strain on an already over- burdened position in respect of our east coast electricity grid. The Opposition would still prefer conversion out of LPG in traditional markets because of the potential it has as an automotive fuel, but recognises that the urgency of the situation has lessened with a diminishing of te world price which, of course, affects our local price. Electricity also is no longer the low cost readily available energy source it once was. The economies of adding generating capacity have changed and the time lags associated with building additional capacity are also substantial. Another reason why the need to convert has lessened is the changing demand and supply picture for Australian produced LPG. Australia currently produces about 2.1 million tonnes annually, most of which is exported. Production from the Cooper Basin will add another 250,000 tonnes per year by about 1984 and a further 640,000 tonnes will come from the North West Shelf several years later. Two years ago it was believed that demand growth would be such that all Australian production would be consumed domestically by late this decade. This is no longer the case. Demand growth has not been anywhere near the forecast figure. There has not been a great leap forward in the conversion of motor vehicles and the demand for petrochemical feedstocks has fallen due to the cancellation or deferral of some major petrochemical projects. We have a fairly substantial supply, well in excess of demand. As I indicated, most of it is sold to Japan and some to other places. We are using only about 20 per cent of our production domestically. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not think that the balancing of demand and supply is likely before the end of the decade. It will not take place until the 1990s, if then. This gives greater scope for continued or even expanded use of LPG in traditional markets without leading to excess demand. The need to discourage traditional usage has certainly been ameliorated. This is not to deny the need to continue to encourage increased usage in non-traditional markets, such as the automotive market. LPG is an already available economic substitute for petrol, at least for fleet owners, particularly those returning to a common bowser or supply source. Given our declining level of self-sufficiency in oil, encouraging substitution out of oil and into LPG must remain a major priority in LPG policy formulation. The other major use of LPG when it can substitute for petroleum products is as a feedstock for petrochemicals. It is a pity that demand in these two areas has fallen, particularly given the widening price gap we have experienced over the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one aspect of the automotive use of LPG which I think we should consider and that is the question of safety. A week or so ago I noticed that an LPG tank exploded in a car in Hobart. Luckily the driver escaped unhurt, but incidents like this do more to set back the rate of automotive conversion than do changes in government policy. People are legitimately afraid of the damage which can be caused to them by an explosion. I think it is imperative that government, suppliers of LPG and conversion equipment and the users of LPG develop adequate safety standards and act to improve the safety record of the industry. Although explosions such as this are rare, maximum use of this fuel will not occur until the record of the industry improves and potential users are confident of a high standard of safety. Not only must governments develop adequate standards but also they must be enforced. The discrepancies between States should be overcome and a standard code adopted for all. After all, a standard code has operated in Japan for many years. Any visitor to Tokyo or other major Japanese cities will notice that all the taxis and buses and some other vehicles, particularly those which return to a single depot, operate on LPG. In fact, most of the Tokyo taxicabs operate on Australian LPG. The Japanese have achieved quite a high level of safety by establishing a high quality uniform code. This is what we should do here. The importance of standardising and improving the safety performance cannot be overstressed if confidence in LPG as an automotive fuel is to be restored. </PARA>
<PARA> I return briefly to the question of the subsidy for traditional users. I again reiterate the Opposition's view that the arrangements should not be terminated at present, given current economic circumstances. We would also prefer, when the decision is made to terminate the arrangements, that the subsidy be phased out over time rather than removed in one measure. Consumers should be given time to adjust to the additional costs that will be imposed. This certainly would be the approach the Opposition would take. It is worth underlining the fact that LPG became a popular fuel and replaced coal gas in gas reticulation by municipal authorities in the 1960s and 1970s because it was the throw-away product from Bass Strait. It was the sawdust in the system. It was not until after the Iranian revolution in 1979 that the oil majors, particularly the Middle East producers, saw an opportunity to give LPG a price status which it never had before. It is a wonderful fuel. No one would deny that. When Iranian production fell away and there was panic buying of oil in the spot market, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries jumped in, gave a new status to LPG and lifted its price. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we have always had the problem of encouraging Esso Australia Ltd and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd in particular to sell into the Australian market. They have always found that it has been as lucrative selling to export, particularly given the fact that the export price has risen so markedly. We have encouraged people to move into the use of LPG-people in provincial centres around Australia have taken that decision and municipal gas authorities have moved away from coal gasification-only to find now that they are hooked up to what has become an expensive fuel. So I think the subsidy is appropriate. We certainly have a breathing space. While OPEC is running at half production we will see a substantial glut of oil in the world and, therefore, the sense of urgency about supplies is simply being obliterated. We have seen the real price of oil actually fall, as the price has remained static in the face of inflationary increases. All the other petroleum products, such as LPG, which are by-products of oil production have experienced the same trough in prices as a result of the falling demand from the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> With the subsidy, people in country towns will be given some years of adjustment so that the real impact of fuel prices will not hurt them as severely as we might have thought. It gives us some time for adjustment but it also underlines the requirement to get the gas laterals built and to get as many provincial centres as possible hooked up to the main trunk gas pipelines. This country is literally rotten with gas. There is gas everywhere in Australia. We are a gas prone continent; we are not an oil prone continent. Our problem is with the eastern to south-eastern portion of the continent. The city of Adelaide is short of gas and backup supplies are needed for Sydney. If we can find about one trillion cubic feet of gas in the next three or four years, or even half a trillion cubic feet, in the Cooper Basin area South Australia will no longer have problems and there will be an improvement in New South Wales. In Western Australia there is gas everywhere. It has the problem of an over-supply of gas. Victoria is being adequately accommodated by Bass Strait. The sensible thing is to give Australians the benefit of this very important and clean-burning fuel by , where possible, linking them up to these pipeline grids. It is the policy of the Opposition to build, where possible, as many of these laterals as are economic to build and to continue with a subsidy scheme so that over time, given the flatness in prices of LPG at the moment consumers will have a fairly substantial period of adjustment from the relatively low prices for LPG to the ones which are now prevailing. In the event of the removal of the subsidy this would be done over a period, again to lessen any economic impact upon industrial and private consumers of LPG in rural and provincial centres. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Incidentally, LPG does not stand for low premium grannies that we might be sending up to Brisbane. I do not want to get involved in the apple debate before I start on liquefied petroleum gas. I am pleased to support this Bill. It amends the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Act of 1980 to extend the present arrangement under which a subsidy of $80 a tonne is paid on LPG used by certain consumers for a further 12 months until 28 March 1984. Provisions have been included in the Bill also to impose limitations on the amounts of subsidised gas available to industrial consumers after 1 October this year. The LPG subsidy was introduced for three years in March 1980 with the objective of providing sufficient time for household users to adjust to rapidly rising LPG prices. The extension of the subsidy is largely to help the many thousands of householders, small businessmen and other consumers who depend on LPG to cope through a period of uncertainty in world LPG prices which are expected to rise in the next year or two. On the other hand, the Government does not intend that the subsidy encourage new large industrial use of LPG. This policy was clearly stated in 1980 when the subsidy was available to industrial and commercial users in areas where natural gas was not readily available. Over the last two years the competitiveness of LPG as an industrial fuel has created a situation where large, industrial consumers with heavy reliance on fuel oil could be encouraged to convert to LPG. The Government does not wish to encourage such conversions for a number of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make this opening statement to explain what the Bill is all about. I intend to mention specifically the use of LPG as a fuel. Firstly, the resultant large increase in subsidy payments cannot be justified. Secondly, and most importantly , LPG is a valuable transport fuel and petrochemical feed stock. I agree with the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) about the use of LPG. There was an accident last week in Hobart. This accident puts LPG behind a lot. We have read of the accident that occurred in Hobart. There was an ignition and, consequently, the driver of the taxi was burnt. We found, subsequently, that there was a leaking tank. The honourable member for Blaxland mentioned controls. It is important also that LPG be a viable alternative to petrol. Motor cars and other vehicles can and do run successfully on LPG. There are many claims that these vehicles are easier to start. </PARA>
<PARA> I know a little about LPG. It is good to talk about it. I came in today with a nice chap. I said to him: 'Is your vehicle on LPG or petrol?' He said: 'It is on petrol'. He said: 'I can't stand the smell of LPG all day'. Those sorts of statements are not well founded. The Japanese, who import most of our LPG, run their taxis and their other motor vehicles efficiently and economically on LPG. The Japanese standards are up to such a level that they do not have the worries and the rumours that occur within Australia because LPG is the alternative fuel. I ask honourable members to remember that the price of LPG is only 50 per cent of the price of premium fuel at the moment. There are many claims about LPG. It is claimed that vehicles are easier to start; that there are fewer oil changes; that there is longer engine life; that less mechanical attention is required to engines; that the pollutants in the air are greatly lowered; and it is one grade of fuel. Admittedly, LPG has disabilities. Of course, it is fair to mention those disabilities. There are limited filling stations. That is an important point. Datsun manufactured a vehicle to run specifically on LPG. It was a fizzer . Datsun did all the work on it. It did all the sophisticated modifications for changing the vehicle to run on LPG. One important thing that Datsun forgot to ask was: What would persons living in the country or in a town in Australia do if they ran out of LPG? They would have to have that car towed to the next filling station. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Denison, of course. People should come to realise that LPG could be a viable alternative to petrol. It is 50 per cent of the price of petrol. We then require manufacturers to tune into that thrust. I think that would be a successful way to selling LPG. The unfortunate thing about it is that 80 per cent of the LPG produced in Australia is exported because of storage facilities and other factors. I think we need to do more about LPG in the long term. Every mile driven while on LPG in Australia represents a saving in energy and in the purchase of petrol from overseas. It means savings in currency, employment of Australians and less dependence on foreign prices. I say to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) that I am being blamed for the price of petrol in Hobart. People are saying that over the seven years that I have been a member of parliament I have done a heck of a lot of talking on the price of petrol yet the price seems to go up all the time. People like to blame somebody in this world. I am afraid that they are directing their criticism at me. I say quite sincerely that I am probably the only one who has talked consistently about the price of petrol. The oil companies are coming out of this nice and lily-white. They are the ones who should get the blame in Hobart, not me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I get back to the matter of LPG. I do not want to lose the thread. The honourable member for Calare wants to start talking in a minute. Many taxis in Australia run on LPG at the moment. As a matter of fact, the taxi drivers swear by it for economy and reliability. I believe that governments, manufacturers and distributors have a part to play in the conservation of the precious commodity, oil. On current retail fuel costs most taxi operators would expect fuel savings. It is difficult to estimate them. The price of LPG is roughly 50 per cent of the price of petrol. Therefore, over a period of years, people know that they can cut their costs down by half. That is a great saving. It is a saving not only to drivers but also in economising on oil. That is the important thing. If we are to save oil we will have to tell other people in the community that they need to use an alternative. I think that the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen), a kindly Minister, wants me to stop. I know I have had my 10 minutes. I want to give the honourable member for Calare a few minutes. As long as he does not get on to LPG as an alternative to apples I think we ought to give him those few minutes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) for providing a little time. I wish to mention a couple of points regarding the liquefied petroleum gas subsidy. The largest file that I have in my office, consisting of numerous letters, petitions and representations from existing gas users, local government councils and the like, concerns the pressure exerted to introduce a subsidy on LPG way back in, I think, 1980. I welcomed that subsidy because it provided some relief from the wildly fluctuating and increasing prices of LPG at that time. That subsidy is now to be extended for a further 12 months. Again I welcome that initiative because there is still the problem of many areas of non-metropolitan Australia which do not have access to cheap natural gas being reliant on LPG as a primary source of fuel. Many householders, small businesses and other consumers such as public institutions would have great difficulty, certainly in areas of my electorate where it is extremely cold, in providing adequate heating for facilities if it were not for the $80 a tonne subsidy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While on the subject of my electorate, I note that the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) mentioned the construction of laterals to provincial centres in various parts of Australia, including the proposed lateral to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow. It is still my understanding that the Australian Pipeline Authority is ready, able and willing to construct those laterals if there is a request and conditions of contract are met. I imagine the difficulty now is that the economics of the project are becoming more doubtful. The Australian Gas Light Co., which will be the distributing authority, has undertaken considerable potential user investigations. There are considerable doubts as to whether it would be a viable project. The project is largely dependent on a small number of major gas users being the key to the economic viability of the project. At this stage it is still in the offing. If there is a request for that lateral pipeline to be constructed the Pipeline Authority will be able to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Franklin mentioned, LPG is indeed valuable as a feedstock for petrochemical uses and as a transport fuel. While we are to some extent luxuriating in a surplus of liquid fuels at the moment one only has to look at the situation in the Middle East to realise how vulnerable we are to a major disruption to supply in that area. From memory the Strait of Hormuz, through which 80 per cent to 85 per cent of the world's tradeable oil passes, through which there are, I think, 80 to 100 tanker movements a day, is only 5 kilometres wide. With the uncertain situation in Iran and Iraq and also perhaps the infiltration of fundamentalist Moslem groups into Saudi Arabia, we could not in any way be assured of regular and continuing access through those Straits. I believe we must persevere with the use of LPG as a transport and automotive fuel . </PARA>
<PARA> I also agree with the honourable member for Franklin that we should look at additional incentives-perhaps to convert to use of LPG. Perhaps we need to do more than simply exempt LPG sales from road taxes-perhaps more than ensure that such road taxes would not be imposed before April 1985. The day will surely come when we will be very glad to have the substantial reserves of LPG in this country to use as a major substitute for our liquid fuel supplies. In conclusion , I too welcome the Government's decision to extend the subsidy. I believe some people will be unhappy with the limitation of 1,000 tonnes per annum equivalent for industry. It is my understanding that the existing industries that may have been established on the basis of LPG being available, subsidised and cheap will continue. I welcome the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'this House censures the Prime Minister for his inability to maintain ministerial responsibility in his Government, thereby causing widespread malpractice and corruption'. </PARA>
<PARA>I move the motion not solely because we have before us the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry or because that report, amongst other things, is a searing indictment of the Government and a grave revelation of the impropriety and incompetence of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon); rather because it is the latest in a long succession of reports which expose the incompetences of the Government and its failure to establish accountability and responsibility according to the proper functions of a Minister in the parliamentary system. I do not go as far as the extraordinary definitions which have been given by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) from time to time to illustrate what ministerial responsibility is. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that very simply the principle is that if a Minister is to administer his department he should know about those important responsibilities which are discharged within it. The test should be: Firstly, did he know, and secondly, ought he to have known? It is quite clear in this case that the Minister not only ought to have known but also did know. He has been searingly condemned by the Royal Commission report. He stands not alone in this respect. It is to the disgrace of the Government that it seeks to perpetuate its functioning on the sorts of crude standards that we have seen in the past- standards which exemplify, by their persistent excusing, the most defective and undesirable levels of incompetences in the administration of the affairs of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are discussing today and what has been raised in the course of the Prime Minister's statement on the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry is, I repeat, only one of a long and devastating set of incidents which have happened since the Fraser Government came to office. It has established political turpitude as the norm for the conduct of the affairs of the nation. It was today, by any measure, an extraordinary performance by the Prime Minister. There was at all times the anxious, agonised quality of desperation. Instead of attending in detail to the matters addressed by the Royal Commission's report the Prime Minister undertook two things. Through an aggressive assault against the Royal Commission and Mr Justice Woodward and a former colleague Mr Bert Kelly, he sought to establish by selective and confused quoting and prejudiced presentation and, when it suited him, downright dishonesty-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not delay. I think this extraordinary variability in the way in which you interpret the Standing Orders, Mr Speaker, is something we should discuss. But we can save that for later. The aim of the Government is to get the Minister for Primary Industry off the hook. Why does the Government want to get the Minister for Primary Industry off the hook? For one simple reason: If he goes, if his resignation is accepted, then the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) should go. The last thing the Government wants is to confess that the resignation which the Minister for Primary Industry tendered represented a proper course of conduct which should have been adopted by both the Treasurer and the Attorney-General. The proper course of conduct should have been to accept the resignation proffered by the Minister for Primary Industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the former member of this House, Bert Kelly, and the Royal Commission have established is the Minister's culpable neglect. Having established that, the Prime Minister comes into this House with the result today that he finds both of them guilty. He condemns Kelly and he condemns the Royal Commission for having established serious deficiencies in the administration of the Minister for Primary Industry. A consequence of this, I mention in passing, is that the behaviour of the Prime Minister today destroys the tradition of independent service on royal commissions. Any person of intellectual independence and professional self-respect from the legal profession will not serve on a royal commission in the future. Only lap dogs will be available. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the people who have been found guilty-all sorts of people: Business, meat inspectors, police, public servants, that royal commission and Bert Kelly. Some of them in some cases to a limited or greater extent have been found guilty with justification, but a long list of them was found guilty by the Prime Minister. But no Minister was found guilty. Never is a Minister of the Fraser Government established as being guilty of inappropriate or deficient conduct in the discharge of his duty. It does not matter whether thousands of millions of dollars have been ripped off the public purse by tax evasion. We still find the same Treasurer here. We still find the same people in charge of the Australian Taxation Office. It does not matter that the overwhelming avalanche of legal opinion is that existing law could have been applied to bring properly to account people evading their tax-a criminal offence. The Attorney- General is still there. The heads of his Department are still there. Presumably people are perpetually innocent in the Fraser ministry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's speech today was a canter through a minefield of dishonest quotes and malicious misrepresentation. In the final result, it was a desperate effort to stand plain English on its head and to make it mean things it could not possibly say. He works on the principle that a fool is born every other minute. From his conduct today, he believes that Australia is peopled by a population that was born every other minute. That is gratuitously offensive. It is an unnecessary insult to the intelligence of this nation. Let us put this into some sort of focus. Let us commence with what the Prime Minister discussed today. On page 1 of his statement he declared that the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry was 'a royal commission of high standing and repute'. From about page 2 almost to the end of what he had to say, which took more than an hour, however, he seemed to have forgotten that because he set about in a quite malicious and mendacious way to destroy the respect and the credibility of the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the House some of the illustrations. On page 5 of the statement that he circulated subsequent to his speech he quoted paragraph 2.75 of the report of the Royal Commissioner, which in part states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . on the basis of the evidence then available, I would have reported that malpractice in the industry was rare, and felt compelled to recommend that, in the light of that finding, many of the present security measures were unnecessary and that no fundamental change in administrative arrangements was required to prevent or detect malpractices. </PARA>
<PARA>He makes much of that particular point, inferring that there could not have been much behind the malpractices finally established by the Royal Commission. It is a shame that he did not quote the last sentence of that paragraph because, in demolishing the argument he misleadingly and wilfully sought to set up, it says:</PARA>
<PARA> Such a report would have been totally misleading. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Prime Minister engaged in a misleading exercise so far as the Parliament was concerned. On page 7 of his statement, again referring to the post-scandal period, he quoted paragraph 1.19:</PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the Department of Primary Industry itself, it is only fair to say that, under instructions from its Minister, it acted promptly and effectively when the meat substitution scandal erupted. </PARA>
<PARA>He then quoted paragraphs 1.21 which, from the way in which he quoted both those paragraphs, seemed to be an approving comment from the Royal Commission concerning the functioning of the Department of Primary Industry. In turn, the implication is clear: The administration under the Minister for Primary Industry could not have been all that defective. Why did he not quote the following sections from the report? I refer to paragraph 1.8 which provides:</PARA>
<PARA> Another major deficiency of the export meat arrangements before August 1981 was that the DPI and the Australian Federal Police paid too little attention to those malpractices which did come to their notice. Those which the Department handled were often dealt with in a weak and indecisive fashion. On most occasions when police were called in, their work was ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA>Why did he not quote paragrah 1.15? In part that paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Federal Police must also bear a share of the blame for those missed opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>The 'missed opportunities' refer to deficiencies in the inspection service and its poor performance. Why did he not quote paragraph 1.16? In part that paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Not enough cases were passed to the police for action, and those that were handed over were not conveyed with any sense of urgency, importance, or great interest in their outcome. </PARA>
<PARA>Why did he not quote paragraph 1.17? That paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand it must be said that the Department had little to show for those occasions when matters were referred to police. There were no grounds for confidence that police inquiries would achieve worthwhile results. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the argument that the Prime Minister was seeking to establish by implication. The implication was that, if we approach this in the way in which he was seeking to persuade us we should, we would see that there had been some minor peccadilloes which were excusable in all the circumstances because we must weigh up the performance of the bureaucracy under the Minister for Primary Industry which was not too bad. It was damnable. It was damnable on the Department of Primary Industry and it was damnable on the Australian Federal Police to the extent that they have been involved in these matters. On page 9 of his speech he quoted paragraph 1.61, which in part states:</PARA>
<PARA> Generally, such matters as were referred to Commonwealth Ministers were dealt with adequately and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>I think we should go beyond that and look at the range of matters considered by this report. They are dealt with in paragraphs 1.62, 1.63 and 1.64. Paragraph 1. 62 states:</PARA>
<PARA> However, I do consider that the findings by the Honourable. C. R. Kelly and Mr W. Buettel about the state of the industry and the DPI inspection service, in their Report of their inquiry into meat inspection services in 1978-80, received insufficient attention from the Minister, the Hon. P. J. Nixon. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite contrary to the impression the Prime Minister was seeking to convey. The next paragraph says in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Although they did not give specific details to the Minister, when making their report, they described conduct amounting to bribery of, and blackmail by, inspectors which in my view--</PARA>
<PARA>Says Mr Justice Woodward, and I put his credibility, his integrity and his capacity to weigh these things up fairly and objectively well ahead of those of the Prime Minister--</PARA>
<PARA>should have been the subject of a much more vigorous response from the Minister and his Department than in fact occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> But I believe that the Minister, having heard from a responsible source that there had been cases of bribery and abuse of power in his Department, should have taken positive steps to investigate the matter. In my view he did not deal with this allegation in a manner that was adequate and effective. </PARA>
<PARA>He was inadequate, ineffective and totally incompetent. They are matters that I want to come back to. On page 9 of his statement, the Prime Minister refers to paragraph 8.89 which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Insofar as allegations were reported by the Department to Mr Nixon, I do not consider any criticism can be levelled at his handling of them. </PARA>
<PARA>They are specific allegations. They are post the exposure of the meat substitution scandal. They do not relate to serious allegations of bribery and corruption which were extensively evident-I will produce the evidence a little later-within his administration. The conclusion of Mr Justice Woodward is that the man was gravely and culpably irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister quotes paragraph 8.39 when he could have quoted other paragraphs from the same report. Paragraph 8.44 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who had assumed previously that, by and large, Commonwealth meat inspection was functioning well, ought to have been jolted out of complacency by what the Kelly Committee had to say. </PARA>
<PARA>This Minister did very little in response to it. Mr Justice Woodward continues:</PARA>
<PARA> It is pertinent to observe that what the Kelly Committee said on this subject was, in due course, fully substantiated at the hearings of this Royal Commission . </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on in paragraph 8.45 to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I have carefully considered the Minister's role in this matter, having due regard to the responsibility attributable to senior departmental officers, the heavy workload which Ministers accept and the potential unfairness of looking at one issue in isolation. In spite of these considerations, I am bound to record my view that the Minister did not deal with these allegations adequately and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>Again we have a searing condemnation. In paragraph 8.46, Mr Justice Woodward says:</PARA>
<PARA> He says that he can recall Mr Kelly saying that it was a pretty 'shonky' industry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister said he recalled that it was pretty shonky, but it was not shonky enough to cause him any concern. Paragraph 8.47 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The possibilities of such action should have been fully investigated. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the following up of Kelly's report. Paragraph 8.48 contains a particularly damaging finding by Mr Justice Woodward. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . neither the Minister nor his senior advisors took any substantial steps to look into the questions which had been raised by the Kelly Committee. They seem to have given all their attention to the central issue dealt with by the Committee-the question of a single inspection system-and hoped that any problems of corruption or abuse of power would right themselves in due course. In the event, of course, they did not. </PARA>
<PARA>Can there be any more telling censure of a Minister than that sort of quotation from an independent tribunal? In those circumstances, I will refrain from stating that the Prime Minister was wilfully dishonest when he came into this House and gave selective coloured and downright dishonest quotations and say that he embarked on a concocted version of what this Royal Commission was all about. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 9, he quotes paragraph 8.48 of the Royal Commission report. It is very important that we have readily available what is actually said in the report so that we can compare the two. If anyone wants to argue that this is not dishonest , I would like to hear his or her definition of what is dishonest, because it would be an extraordinarily liberal indulgence not to declare that. This is how the Prime Minister quotes paragraph 8.48:</PARA>
<PARA> They--</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister and his senior advisers:</PARA>
<PARA>seem to have given all their attention to the central issue dealt with by the--</PARA>
<PARA>Kelly:</PARA>
<PARA>Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>What he is trying to do is to discount the significance of Kelly. He is trying to establish a case that Kelly is obsessive and preoccupied, that he has looked only at a very limited area, that he did not really know what he was about and finally that there was not much in it. We will come to that in a second. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister quotes Mr Justice Woodward as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> They seem to have given all their attention to the central issue dealt with by the Kelly Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Woodward did not say that. That is more than selective quoting; that is cutting up the report with scissors as it suits one. </PARA>

<PARA> Thus neither the Minister nor his senior advisers took any substantial steps to look into the questions which had been raised by the Kelly Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Then we come to the part quoted by the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA> They seem to have given all their attention to the central issue dealt with by the Committee-the question of a single inspection system-and hoped that any problems of corruption or abuse of power would right themselves in due course.</PARA>
<PARA>Why did the Prime Minister not quote that part of the paragraph? The answer is fairly obvious. I ask why he did not quote this concluding sentence:</PARA>
<PARA> In the event, of course, they did not. </PARA>
<PARA>This report is devastating for the Government. I do not believe that the Minister can continue to function in this House with any claim to integrity or self respect before the Parliament let alone the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 10, the Prime Minister reverts again to an attack upon the Royal Commission report, quoting in a precise fashion paragraphs 8.39 to 8.45 as stating firstly that the Minister did not act adequately and effectively and, secondly, that Kelly's complaints were not adequately followed up. In fact, those paragraphs say much more than that. I invite the attention of the House to the reports. Having already quoted the paragraphs in full, I do not intend to go over them but honourable members will note as they attend to them at their leisure that they are devastating analyses, conclusions and condemnations of the functioning of the Minister for Primary Industry. He is unfitted for the high office that he occupies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is trying to demolish Kelly. The pitch of what the Prime Minister is saying is simply this: 'Kelly did not tell the police about this corruption; therefore, you cannot take him seriously. Kelly did not do anything about it himself anyway; therefore, you will have to take him even less seriously'. I will tell the House precisely what Mr Justice Woodward said about these matters. Paragraph 8.40 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, one purpose of that visit--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, by Kelly:</PARA>
<PARA>so far as Mr Kelly was concerned, was to provide the Minister with information the Committee had gleaned about the DPI inspection service which was not strictly relevant to the report and would not be fully spelt out in it. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly's diary record goes on. The reference by Mr Justice Woodward is to matters which were not relevant to Kelly's report, matters not strictly his responsibility within the definition of his terms of reference. The Prime Minister tries to destroy Kelly's credibility by this quite cowardly attack upon the man's integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of what the Prime Minister is about, especially on pages 10 and 11 of his statement, is to try to diminish the significance of what Kelly had to say. It is suggested that, in Kelly's view, the offence was only minor. ' Minor skulduggery' is the term that the Prime Minister has been playing upon as being a quotation from Kelly. He is, I repeat, seeking to establish Kelly in the public mind, by his wilfully distorted and wilfully malicious and damaging misrepresentation of what Kelly is about, as an obsessive person who is narrowly fixated, who does not have much evidence and who cannot be taken seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me quote from the report to indicate what Kelly was about in his diary notation. Kelly's diary reads:</PARA>
<PARA> I went to Melbourne for the day to present meat report to the Minister, Peter Nixon. It was worth it because it gave me the chance to tell him a few of the notes that we could not put in the report, such as the bribery and blackmail which is so prevalent in the meat inspection game. Poor Peter is now to see what can be done. </PARA>
<PARA>Poor old Peter is half blind. But by the record of Kelly's diary note the bribery and blackmail were not just, as I mentioned earlier, an insignificant peccadillo, a minor aberration, an indiscretion that was momentary and could be excused; it was prevalent. To establish that point further I will quote the source that the Prime Minister used this afternoon. What I am pointing out is that the Prime Minister, by his contrivance this afternoon, by this nasty concoction that he brought in, misrepresented what the Royal Commissioner was about and what Kelly was genuinely concerned about. Those of us here who served with Kelly-to the extent that we may have had some differences with him about his approach to economic policy-always respected the man's inegrity and consistency. In one hour this afternoon the Prime Minister tried to destroy more than two decades of that man's work to establish that respect. The point is that the Prime Minister was once one of his friends, which shows what friendship does for one in the Liberal Party. By this selective quoting and misrepresentation the Prime Minister has embarked on an exercise designed to damage the Royal Commission and to try to destroy Kelly with one purpose in mind-that is, to preserve a simple-minded National Country Party Minister who just does not understand what his responsibilities are. </PARA>
<PARA> I said a few seconds ago that I would quote the Prime Minister back at him to demolish his argument in relation to the assertion that what Kelly is about is very narrowly based and shallow, that there is not much there. What he is really saying is: 'Look, this is a rather insignificant thing, a minor skulduggery', or whatever the word was. On that basis he is trying to write off the matter, forgetting that there is some literacy over here even if there is none in the National Country Party. We are capable of reading the Royal Commission's report and finding the embarrassing sentences that he left out because they condemn the Minister for Primary Industry. Here he is trying to establish a case, but there is not much in it. Poor old Bert is a nice, entertaining old eccentric but one cannot take him seriously! Let me give the quote that the Prime Minister used from Kelly's report. Page 17 of the circulated copy of the Prime Minister's speech states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . AMIS legislation should include heavy punishments for administrators, VOs, meat inspectors and management et cetera who try to extract improper advantages out of the system in this manner. </PARA>
<PARA>Bear this in mind. The Kelly report states:</PARA>
<PARA> That this kind of practice has been too common in the past we know too well. It must be stopped in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>There you are-blackmail and bribery within the meat inspection system. It had been too common in the past. We knew that well. It had to be stopped in the future. The Prime Minister writes it off as a minor indiscretion that might have cropped up here and there. By his own efforts and by his own words he has demolished himself. Kelly may not have been specific in the terms in which the Prime Minister has defined that nature. Maybe he did not report the matter to the police. Perhaps he can be presented as single-minded on this matter. Perhaps the Prime Minister feels that, if he can establish these matters and fabricate an assertion that Kelly's allegations were minor, he can get away with it. Perhaps those things could be mobilised if-but it is a very big 'if'-there were not available the Royal Commission report, which demolishes all that falsification and, with it, the Prime Minister. There are a couple of devastating quotes in this report that deserve to be mentioned. They are respectively paragraphs 1.55 and 1.56. Woodward states:</PARA>
<PARA> I am asked to say whether such allegations were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective, or on the other hand, whether any illegality or corruption occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 1.64 states:</PARA>
<PARA> But I believe that the Minister, having heard from a responsible source that there had been cases of bribery and abuse of power in his Department, should have taken positive steps to investigate the matter. In my view he did not deal with this allegation in a manner that was adequate and effective. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a telling statement because he declared that he was asked to establish whether such allegations were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective; if not, on the other hand, whether any illegality or corruption occurred. He stated that the operation was not adequate or effective. Therefore he is saying, by an extension of that definition of his obligations, that the Minister presided over illegality and corruption, and he presided over it knowingly and tolerated it through his own incompetence. That is the gravamen of what the Royal Commission report is about. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no novelty for the Minister for Primary Industry to find himself in the midst of this sort of scandal. Let us look at his record. There is the Murray- Goulburn butter levy dispute in which the Murray-Goulburn Co-op Co. Ltd conspired to defraud the Government of butter levy properly paid to the Australian community for the benefit of the industry. The Minister presided over that and wrote off any action against that organisation. The Australian Dairy Corporation breached the guidelines in relation to the use of government guaranteed Reserve Bank funds. Nothing happened in respect of that matter. Again , the National Country Party-the Minister-interceded. In the case of the disposal of the Indo-Milk Corporation the Australian taxpayers lost $5.5m on the sale by the direction of the Minister. What sort of record of competence is that ? There is the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd scandal, which has still to be concluded in this Parliament. Let us look at the outstanding points. The police report is yet to be tabled. The sum of $3m in a Singapore account of the ADC has disappeared down some sink of iniquity. The ADC breached the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade minimum pricing arrangements in 1976 and 1977. What did his predecessor know about that? There were possible breaches of the law in the Philippines and Singapore. Has there been any collaboration with the Government authorities there? Departmental records of possible GATT breaches regarding milk sales to Mexico are missing. Records are not clear about possible GATT breaches in respect of milk sales to Thailand. Is it not handy to have records that disappear or are incomprehensive when one is in trouble?</PARA>
<PARA> After nearly a year the Department of Primary Industry has not yet produced a report on guidelines for the operation of statutory marketing authorities. I think it ought to be put on record because he is in the House, although the level of consciousness at this point has yet to be established, that the little Caesar of the Australian Federal Police, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), is singed by all of this. He is singed by the poor performance of the Australian Federal Police and by the identification of clear corruption infecting the ranks of that police force which he administers. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, this matter does not begin or end here. It did not just happen in relation to this issue. There is a long history of this sort of matter concerning the Fraser Government. I shall not go over all of the examples, but the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs investigated the Narcotics Bureau, an extraordinarily important law enforcement agency in this country. The report of that Royal Commission searingly tore apart th Narcotics Bureau and its administration; it was totally corrupt. The Government sat on that report for several months. The Minister responsible is still a Minister of the Crown. In the period when the Government sat on the report, when it was quite evident that the Narcotics Bureau was not an authority for which it was desirable to enlarge its powers of intervention through telephonic means of interception, he took legislation through this Parliament that did exactly that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have currently before the Parliament the depressing diversion of a multi- million dollar health fraud by the medical profession presided over by the Government. I need scarcely refer to the tax scandal which has been blighting and distracting this nation for the last several weeks. It boils down to this: All the responsible Ministers are still in the Parliament. They are, by the Fraser Government's standards, still 'respectable' Ministers of the Crown. What is ministerial responsibility under the Fraser Government? I find it hard to fathom exactly what it is. Many declarations are made but no practices are followed persistently. Principles, it seems, are buckled quite simply. Perhaps we can get an insight into the matter from the comments of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in his, appropriately, gutterside interview outside Parliament House this morning. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Are National Party Ministers getting preferential treatment? Senator Withers was criticised by a Royal Commission and he went. Mr Nixon is criticised and he stays. </PARA>
<PARA>The Deputy Prime Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, you know I think there is some justification in an argument being made around the point. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA> I think there is some slight difference in that Mr Nixon immediately allowed his position to be in the hands of the Prime Minister for a thorough investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> What I recollect of Senator Withers there was some contesting of the situation.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he adds:</PARA>
<PARA> But, I suppose we can all learn from a bit of hindsight. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course the Minister for Primary Industry would say that he was putting his ministerial welfare in the hands of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister would not dare to dismiss him no matter how outrageous-as it is incontestably outrageous-his behaviour because he knows that too many other Ministers would have to go. But what is the principle? If a Minister goes along and confesses all and says, 'I confess. Please give me absolution and I will be better after it is all over', he is all right. If he fights back he is in trouble. That is when he goes. But the principle does not stand up because the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) and the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) did not seek to fight back. They sought to behave properly and they went out on their ears. What is the principle in relation to independent royal commissions of inquiry that conclusively condemn the performance of a Minister, establishing either his culpable neglect or his culpable impropriety-both of which apply to the Minister for Primary Industry. On the occasion of the less than celebrated dismissal of Senator Withers from the Ministry the Prime Minister, in a Press statement of 8 August 1978, said of the Royal Commission report of Mr Justice McGregor:</PARA>
<PARA> We were of the view that Mr Justice McGregor's report had to be accepted and accepting it had inevitable consequences in respect of the finding of impropriety. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the principle. If the Government sets up an independent judicial inquiry then, very properly, if impropriety is established-as it was then and as it is now-the Government has no choice in the matter. There must be a dismissal of the person who is identified as being guilty. So Withers from the Liberal Party goes but Nixon from the National Country Party hangs on. What was the position of the Minister for Primary Industry anyway when his colleague and friend from the Cabinet room, Senator Withers, went? I quote from page 124 of a document appropriately entitled War Without Blood, Malcolm Fraser in Power by Russell Schneider. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Peter Nixon also wandered in--</PARA>
<PARA>The way in which this Government runs this country must be a great operation-</PARA>
<PARA>But made it clear he had no intention of supporting Withers. In his view Withers should have had no contact with Pearson on the name change whatever. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not argue with that. But on that basis the Minister for Primary Industry is even more culpable because his offences are even more grave. If he does not accept our description of the level of gravity he should have listened to what the Prime Minister said this morning outside the House and again this afternoon when he declared that these offences in their nature were even more serious than the tax evasion offences, and he regarded them as particularly serious. Where does the Prime Minister stand in all this? What is the principle? In 1975 we had this declaration of ministerial responsibility:</PARA>
<PARA> We will re-establish a properly functioning and responsible Cabinet government.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister was going to rewrite all the books on Cabinet government for the political science department. It is a bit like the Stalinist era when history was re-written month by month and photographs were turned to the wall. The Prime Minister in his electorate broadcast of 24 November 1974 said:</PARA>
<PARA> If there are rules and principles for action they must apply in all cases. Governments above all must apply rules equally to all sections of the community. If they make one rule for one group and another for another group government becomes arbitrary, unfair, and unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA>But of course the National Country Party is more equal than other people when the calculus is done. In March 1978 electoral broadcast the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> One of my Government's first promises when we were elected just over two years ago was to restore--</PARA>
<PARA>How he uses words quaintly and eloquently-</PARA>
<PARA>The integrity and honesty of government. </PARA>
<PARA>What a shame it escaped everyone else's observations. But I am sure he will keep trying. He then goes on--</PARA>

<PARA> Without integrity-without the appearance and reality of integrity-no government can hope to have the confidence of the people, or the trust of the people. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not give honourable members any more. It is too close to the suspension of the sitting for dinner. In 1972 the Prime Minister established the principle by which he has been inspired ever since but which he has totally ignored. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly true that Ministers cannot be aware of everything that occurs in their departments. They ought to be aware of all the major matters and therefore can be clearly and directly responsible for them. But if a major blunder occurred in a department, of real importance to Australia, and if the Minister were unaware of it, that Minister should accept responsibility for the mistakes of his Department and offer to resign. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not novel. We have quoted it many times. Here it is, six pages of grandiloquence, the great principles. What is it worth? I will show honourable members what it is worth. I will show honourable members where it deserves to be filed. It deserves to go into the trash bucket of Parliament House with all the declarations of principles and integrity by the Prime Minister. Let us look at the Liberal Party patrimony, the ministerial records that it can live on and the sort of heritage for the future. We have attempted bribery, dubious property deals, electoral impropriety, multi millions of dollars disappearing down some sink of inequity in South East Asia, a rotten meat scandal and so it goes on. As I said, these are not minor failures but very serious things. Let us look at the Camelot court-the brightest and the best that is offered to Australia. Fraser's Camelot court is comprised of an Attorney-General who does not know his law; a Treasurer who will not enforce the law; two ex-Ministers caught running a small scale smuggling operation; a former Minister for Primary Industry whose only claim to fame in this Parliament is that of a handwriting expert; the present Minister for Primary Industry who luxuriates in the reputation of being the bovver boy of the national parliament and who is incapable of thinking his way through his ministerial responsibilities; a former Customs Minister who conducted a narcotics bureau as crooked as its quarry; and a series of Health Ministers from this conservative Government dedicated to preserving the sanctity of the doctor-cash register-relationship. Honourable members should have a look at the Prime Minister's face. It looks like he has been weaned on a pickle. Also there is the Taxation Office that clobbers the poor invalid pensioner in a wheelchair over the equivalent of morning tea money while Horgan's heroes ride into the West scot-free with their booty of millions of dollars. All the open, empty spaces in this country are not in the outback. A lot of them are between the ears of Ministers of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> All that this Government has established in its seven years of office is a record of disgraceful turpitude. It has established the public sector under its administration as a huge, open, smelly sewer. It has resorted to scapegoatism, trying to establish the Public Service as the fall guy, the sacrificial offering in all of this. It is nonsense and it will delude no one. Public Service standards certainly are a cause of concern in a number of areas but they have deteriorated because of the way in which the Government administers its responsibilities. What this House is considering is an extraordinary litany of culpable negligence, gross incompetence and unbelievable slothfulness in ministerial administration by the Fraser Government. It just did not happen this month, last month or even this year. It has been going on unrelieved for seven dreadful years. It is just that, as time goes by, the incidents happen more frequently and on more numerous occasions with far worse implications. The Prime Minister pouts and postures about responsibility, integrity, ethics and decent values-all of the worthwhile things essential to a well conducted society. In practice he shatters them like a political hoodlum smashing plate glass windows.</PARA>
<PARA> We are not talking about trivial issues or unfortunate and excusable digressions from high standards. We are talking about a persistent pattern of behaviour which has about it the stench of a sewer. Australians are a decent upright citizenry. We may at times be rather direct and perhaps even clumsy in the directness of our expressions. For that we can justifiably excuse ourselves as members of a young and vigorous country that is still developing in so many important ways. But there is one thing we have always been proud of-that there is a fundamental decency and honesty about Australians and a deeply ingrained sense of fair play. The standards of the Fraser Government are in direct conflict with those fundamental standards of decency that go to make up the Australian character. Australians are sick and tired of the rottenness, of the smelly taints, of the tolerance of malpractice and corruption that the Fraser Government has presided over and of the bevy of incompetent Ministers the nation has had inflicted on it. </PARA>
<PARA> I say one thing to the Fraser Government: Take your filthy feet off the neck of the Australian nation and scourge your incompetent and failed Ministers from office, as propriety would demand. If the Government is not prepared to do that it will be scourged from office by decent, upright Australian citizens at the first opportunity given them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendment. The issue in this debate, which will continue for a little longer after the suspension of the sitting for dinner, is ministerial responsibility in a government. The incredible record of this Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is that in the period in which he has been Prime Minister 22 Ministers have either resigned or been sacked. We could add at least another six Ministers to that total if we could only get justice done. The point highlighted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) is that it is not only a matter of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) being found guilty by the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry. The issue now is: Why is the Prime Minister not prepared to accept the finding?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why is it that the Minister for Primary Industry appears to be in a select group of about three Ministers-whom we could regard as the untouchables in the Government-who will be preserved from being either asked to resign or sacked? Other Ministers who are now on the back bench, were thrown out because the matter involved was deemed to be of some significance to what is called responsible government. Senator Withers said: 'It is the little things in life that bring you down'. All we can say about the Minister for Primary Industry is that the matter must be a bit bigger than a little thing. It is, from looking at this report. What an extraordinary defence it is for the Prime Minister to suggest that because the Royal Commissioner left out some words-'when the new page'-is turned, one has to exempt the Minister from the accusations made. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us make this very clear. We all knew Bert Kelly; he is honest. He did not know much about industry but he is honest. From his position he made a report to the Minister in February 1980 saying: 'Poor Peter, it is left to you'. What was left to poor Peter? It was blackmail, criminal activity and corruption. That was what poor Peter inherited in 1980. The indictment is about the new page. When was this new page going to be turned? The only time the new page could have been turned was when the Government brought in some legislation that might have covered some of the ineptitudes of the Department of Primary industry. But no legislation was brought in until the following year-in October 1981. What caused that legislation to be brought in? It had nothing to do with a new page. It had nothing to do with anything the Minister had done. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a significant point to which the Prime Minister ought to address his mind: On 27 July 1981 a food inspector in San Diego, California, became suspicious of three frozen blocks of Australian meat. They looked darker and stringier than beef. Samples of the meat were sent to a laboratory for testing. The tests indicated that the meat was horse meat. That came to light only in July 1981. That was well after Bert Kelly had told the Minister. What did Bert Kelly tell the Minister? Honourable members should look at this report. He said that it could be said that the system was potentially explosive. It exploded in July 1981. Only after that was any legislation brought in. So the Prime Minister should not come into this House and say that, of course, he is going to turn a new page. No new page was turned until the crook meat came up in San Diego. It is as simple as that. Then all hell broke loose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, prior to the suspension of the sitting I was supporting the case for the Opposition which has censured the Prime Minister for his failure to guarantee ministerial responsibility thereby bringing about widespread malpractice and corruption. There is no better evidence of that than the report of the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry which has been tabled today. I was making the point that, despite the best intentions of the Minister for Primary Industry and despite the fact that he was alerted by what is known as the Kelly Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems, the report of which had a potentially explosive area relating to the meat inspection, the only time the issue became known to the Australian people was when a food inspector in California was able to identify meat that had been sold as good quality beef but which was, in fact, horse meat. In that simple expression we see that all the explanations made by the Prime Minister or the Minister or predecessors fall to the ground; there is something wrong with ministerial control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ministerial control does not apply in the terms of the Durack test: The Minister has to be found to be guilty of a personal failure himself. It is a much higher control. The Minister is responsible for the Department. He is bound by the mistakes of that Department. He is supposed to give instructions and guidelines to guarantee that when Kelly was able to alert him in February 1980 that there was something dramatically wrong with the Department something would be done about it. It is not, as the Prime Minister says, that there was to be a waiting for the turning over of a new leaf. I make the point that the first person to find out about the substitution was a food inspector in San Diego. Does that not make the Government look ridiculous?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the sort of publicity we got in the Washington Post which carried the headlines: 'Let them eat Roo'; and 'How exports to the United States of kangaroo as beef has led to Australia's Slaughtergate'. Then we come to the question of the Washington Post using something that possibly no one wants to say should be a fair summation of the situation, but I think it is. 'The resulting publicity and scandals have done Australia immeasurable harm', reported a critic. We now 'have the reputation of some third rate banana republic run by a bunch of hucksters out to con everybody we can'. What has that done for Australia? These are the issues that the Prime Minister knows have been brought home. I want to make the point that not just the Minister for Primary Industry is involved. I have in front of me a letter written by his predecessor, Mr Sinclair, when he was Minister for Primary Industry, to a Mr Alexander. It is dated 21 November 1977. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Alexander,</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has passed your letter of 21 October 1977, concerning allegations of export of offal from an unregistered establishment and its possible contamination with salmonella organisms, for direct reply on his behalf . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a complaint to the Prime Minister. Mr Alexander lives in Richmond, Victoria. Apparently he is a member of a council and was apparently inspecting a meatworks there. He was able to see this position. He gives evidence by letter to the Prime Minister. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Animal Health, which is responsible for the export inspection of meat and meat products, is aware of your correspondence with Colonel McArthur of the Australian Meat Board on this matter and has passed this information on to the Commonwealth Police. I am grateful for your offer to make yourself available during any investigations and the Commonwealth Police will be advised accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I would like to thank you for your interest and assure you that my Department, with the Commonwealth Police, will take appropriate action to substantiate or otherwise, the allegations you have made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us now turn to the findings of the Royal Commission. Paragraph 1.64 on page 14 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I believe that the Minister, having heard from a responsible source that there had been cases of bribery and abuse of power in his Department, should have taken positive steps to investigate the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the finding. If honourable members have a look at the other paragraphs they will see all sorts of extraordinary findings. Another finding states that the police officers assigned to investigate most of these inquiries seem to have pursued them with little sign of keenness or ability. That is an indictment of the police force. The Commissioner says that one reason for this was that they were getting free meat. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner has reference to the files of the Department. When one looks at the report it becomes clear that many of the files of the Bureau of Animal Health, including some of particular interest, were in a very poor state; folios were missing. We have the classic phrase: 'The apparent deficiencies can be explained.' The report states that it is clear from the evidence of officers who worked on the files over the weekend of 5 or 6 September that they were in a bad state before the alleged shredding occurred. What are we about? Here is a department, as Kelly said, in a very shonky condition. There are files all over the place. When the police are sent out all they seem to collect is fresh meat- no other evidence. We have the position now where the Minister has been found wanting in his ministerial responsibilities. It is no good trying to turn the issue from that. This is the finding. It states at page 261:</PARA>
<PARA> I have carefully considered the Minister's role in this matter, having due regard to the responsibility attributable to senior departmental officers, the heavy workload which Ministers accept and the potential unfairness of looking at one issue in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of these considerations, I am bound to record my view that the Minister did not deal with these allegations adequately and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the indictment. Once that happens the Minister has got to go. In fairness to him he said 'I will leave it to the Prime Minister.' He must have been sure that nothing would happen with the Prime Minister. It is about time the Prime Minister went. When honourable members have a look at the issues that we are dealing with and see that we have many Ministers and departments in trouble is it any wonder that everybody is wondering when the next censure motion will come up?</PARA>
<PARA> I will revert to the present Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) and talk about the control of Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd. A total of $3m has gone into a bank account in Singapore. Nobody knows what has happened to it. The Auditor-General says 'Well it has disappeared'. A total of $3m has disappeared. We then come to the question of Mr Garland. Mr Garland is on record as having given $500 to some Senate candidate in the Australian Capital Territory. The police have got the $500. That was an interesting escapade. Mr Garland lost his title for a little while, came back to the Ministry and has now been promoted to the United Kingdom. If there are all these arrangements-it seems to me that the Ministers do not have to worry-is it any wonder that crime and corruption is proliferating? Let us take a look at the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The Treasurer made a statement on this matter. He said: 'Look, in what is deemed to be the Perth case, the matter finished on about 3 May 1979 because there was insufficient evidence to prosecute'. If honourable members look at the Costigan report they will see that that matter did not finish. Costigan says that Mr Todman, who is from the Taxation Office, wrote an 18 page critique of what was wrong. We never heard of that matter from the Treasurer. Again, the Treasurer tells us that he was convinced that the legal advice he got was right because it was unanimous. That is a very doubtful way of judging legal advice. Admittedly he only got it from within his Department and a few other departments . </PARA>
<PARA> Let us again look at the Costigan report. The legal advice he was referring to was not unanimous. Following Todman's critique of the failure to prosecute, the Commissioner says that in the meantime there had been an investigation of the position in law by legal officers of the Taxation Office who generally could not understand why the existing law was not being used to redress the situation. How was it unanimous when nothing took place? We have the admission of the Treasurer that for the first time after some years he decides to get second opinion, and he gets it from the Solicitor-General. He is not a bad person to get it from because he is the second legal officer in the Commonwealth. Bearing in mind that the first officer is the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) nobody would have any reason to stick with him; they would want to go past that advice pretty rapidly. When the Treasurer went to the Solicitor-General in July of this year for the first time he is told that he could have been prosecuting under the existing law . Does the Treasurer make any reference to the McCabe-LaFranchi report about which he expressed surprise? The interesting thing about these commissions and all these investigations is that small groups of people, whether they be in San Diego or Victoria, can find all the things wrong with this Government, all the things wrong with the Ministers and, all the shonky arrangements and the massive fraud that has taken place in this case. Surely the Treasurer would have known that there was a Supreme Court action in Victoria which involved McCabe and LaFranchi? It was taken to protect one of the promoters called Commercial Securities (Vic) Pty Ltd. That is the group which was anxious to send everything to the bottom of the harbour without paying any tax. It was game enough to go to the Supreme Court in Victoria in June 1979. I would have thought that the Treasurer would have had some knowledge of that. Perhaps he would have liked to intervene in the case. Mr Justice Jenkinson in his judgment in June 1979 referred to the tax avoidance activities of Commercial Securities (Vic) Pty Ltd. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . one of the inspectors gave evidence that the attention of officers of the Income Tax Department had been directed, at the Inspector's suggestion, by an officer of the Corporate Affairs Office to a very large pile of documents then standing in an enclosed but uncovered yard. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that the documents were:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . removed from the yard by officers of the Income Tax Department. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that the Treasurer would have had some knowledge of that. Has there been any investigation of any of these companies? There has not. When McCabe and Lafranchi decided to investigate Mr Maher, he refused to be interviewed and the prosecution lapsed. I suggest that none of the guilty is being investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> All this adds up to a group of Ministers who are completely incompetent. They do not understand what they have to do. In our view they ought to get out of office. They cannot continue in office. The Prime Minister is responsible. He certainly looks after Country Party Ministers-the untouchable three. God help the Liberal back benchers. It is about time that the Government back bench had a bit of gumption, held a party meeting, had a complete spill and appointed a new ministry for the few weeks that it has left. </PARA>

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said-this needs nailing right from the start-that the discovery of horse meat in San Diego in July last year is something I should have been aware of as a result of Mr Kelly's observations. I make the point, because it is important, that Mr Kelly did not mention anything about substitution to me, nor is it mentioned in his report. The Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry found in paragraph 7.6 of its report that there was no evidence of species substitution occurring in the export trade before late 1979.

He did not find impropriety as alleged by the Leader of the Opposition. He did not find me guilty of anything, as alleged by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. There are two aspects to this matter. One concerns the Kelly Committee report, certain statements and my action with regard to those statements. The other relates to the meeting I had in Melbourne with Mr Kelly, Mr Buettel and Mr Landos on 11 February 1980, at which Mr Kelly presented me with his report, and the conversation that took place at that meeting. The Kelly report was presented to me on 11 February 1980. It was tabled by me in the parliament just 16 days later on 27 February 1980. The whole Kelly Committee report had widespread exposure allowing for anybody to bring forward comments and observations about any aspect of it. The Kelly report in its entirety and the question of meat inspection services, as a direct follow-on from the Kelly report, was discussed by Ministers at the Australian Agricultural Council on 4 August 1980, 9 February 1981, 3 August 1981, 4 September 1981, 8 February 1982 and 26 July 1982. The chronology and history of events proves beyond any doubt whatsoever that I acted promptly and properly on the Kelly report. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect that needs to be completely understood is the lack of emphasis that the Kelly Committee put on the general allegations of malpractice that it reported. In short, from any reading of the Kelly report it is abundantly clear that the Committee belived that the major and fundamental necessity was the establishment of the Australian Meat Inspection Service. On page 66 of the report, the Kelly Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Starting a new system would give us the opportunity to turn over a new page . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is one aspect of the meat industry which should be tackled with firm resolution when the new page is turned, and that is the problem of some managers trying to buy the co-operation of inspectors by giving them meat at ridiculously low prices, or countenancing excessive overtime claims, or of meat inspectors demanding cheap meat backed by the implied threat of slowing the killing chain or forcing higher offal or other condemnations if management is not complaint. AMIS legislation should include heavy punishments for administrators, VOs, meat inspectors and management who try to extract improper advantages out of the system in this manner. That this kind of practice has been too common in the past we know too well. It must be stopped in the future. We think that this exhortation applies even more to meat industry management than to the men. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the Kelly Committee has seen the need for change but all the emphasis is on the future, when the new page is turned. In other words, it recommends getting the Australian Meat Inspection Service legislation in place first. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly, in his evidence before the Royal Commission, made reference to this part of his Committee's report. However, his reference excluded the phrase 'when the new page is turned'. I have to ask why that phrase was excluded. The omission places an entirely different emphasis on the paragraph. I think it is unfortunate that the Royal Commission in its references to this paragraph has also not made any reference to the sentiment about when the new page is turned. The use of those words demonstrates beyond doubt that, whatever knowledge the Kelly Committee may have had, it felt no sense of urgency. It is clear from the Kelly report that the Committee realised that the new page could not be turned immediately. On page 81 of that report, the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that our recommendations bristle with initial problems of implementation. Nevertheless, they do present some hope that when established and settled down, (the latter may take some time) they will lead to an elimination of the mess that at present exists . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was what the Kelly Committee had to say about its own report. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the meeting I had with Mr Kelly, Mr Buettel and Mr Landos in Melbourne on 11 February 1980. The Royal Commissioner found, even though he concedes in paragraph 1.63 that Mr Kelly and Mr Buettel when giving me their report 'did not give any specific details to the Minister when making their report' that I did not deal with allegations of cases of bribery and abuse of power in my Department in a manner that was adequate and effective. During my meeting on 11 February 1980, which lasted about 20 minutes, Mr Kelly concentrated the large bulk of his comments to me on his Australian Meat Inspection Service concept. Mr Buettel, the other Committee member, was not called to give evidence. However, I am advised that he also confirms that the meeting took about 20 minutes and dealt largely with the AMIS recommendation. He recalls that Mr Kelly also spoke in very general terms about 'a lot of nonsense around the ridges'. Certainly Mr Kelly did not make any specific allegations to me about bribery or corruption in the Commonwealth Meat Inspection Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly, under examination before the Royal Commission, admitted time and again that he had no recollection as to the precise detail of the 11 February 1980 conversation. I want to go into this aspect in some detail because this is the fundamental point in the Royal Commission argument. Mr Kelly, now a journalist and author, presented to the Royal Commission a 4 1/2-page typewritten proof of evidence. He admitted that he was assisted in the preparation of that proof of evidence by a member of the staff of the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission appears to have attached considerable importance to Mr Kelly's diary note relating to the 11 February 1980 meeting. I quote from the written proof of evidence that Mr Kelly tendered to the Commission. The note states:</PARA>
<PARA> 11 February 1980: I went to Melbourne for the day to present Meat Report to the Minister, Peter Nixon. It was worth it because it gave me the chance to tell him a few of the notes that we could not put in the Report, such as the bribery and blackmail which is so prevalent in the meat inspection game. Poor Peter is now to see what can be done. We were gratified today to hear that the Victorian Minister of Agriculture has stated bluntly that the present situation cannot be allowed to continue. I told Nixon that both of us, Buettel and I, would be prepared to help him get something done. </PARA>
<PARA>There are some points that need to be made about that diary entry. Firstly, I cannot understand what Mr Kelly means when he says that the meeting gave him an opportunity to tell me 'a few of the notes that we could not put in the report'. The report mentions in broad and unspecific terms certain malpractices that the Committee found were occurring in the meat industry. If Mr Kelly had further specific information, it should have been written into his report, or he should have given me a separate detailed report-even if on a confidential basis-in writing. However, he did not go into further detail in his report, and he certainly never produced additional information for me or anyone else that I am aware of, until he appeared before the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is his reference to the Victorian Minister of Agriculture having stated bluntly that the present situation cannot be allowed to continue. It could be interpreted that the Victorian Minister was referring to bribery and corruption that could not be allowed to continue. In fact, the Victorian Minister was referring to the problems connected with the dual meat inspection system that could not be allowed to continue. Mr Kelly also advised the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) by telephone yesterday that it is almost certain that the statement referred to by the Victorian Minister would have related to problems of dual administration of the meat inspection service. The Kelly note then states:</PARA>
<PARA> I told Mr Nixon that both of us, Buettel and I, would be prepared to help him get something done. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a reference to helping me get something done about the establishment of an Australian meat inspection service, which was the prime recommendations of the Kelly report and the prime topic for discussion at the meeting. Those points need to be made clearly and understood when considering the Kelly diary note. What needs to be clearly understood also is that Mr Kelly's evidence to the Royal Commission, when taken in its entirety, casts very serious doubt as to the accuracy of his diary note. At the very least his diary note puts a very much stronger view of what he believes he told me on 11 February 1980 and what he admitted to the Royal Commission that he actually did tell me. The Kelly evidence needs to be considered in its entirety; the diary note has to be considered in context with the rest of Mr Kelly's evidence. It then becomes abundantly clear that there is considerable conflict between what Mr Kelly recorded in the diary note and what he actually said at the 11 February 1980 meeting. For example, Mr Kelly stated in evidence before the Royal Commission that he had no precise memory of what was said at the 11 February 1980 meeting. This appears on page 10259 of the evidence. He said that by far the most important object of the exercise-the 11 February meeting:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . was to explain the AMIS system . . . that was the first thing and then secondly how it hung together and what the problems were in instituting it. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that he did not during the Committee's hearings come across any reports or incidents of what he thought was an abuse of the use of the 'Australia Approved' stamp. He said the he was 'much more interested in the welfare of AMIS than I was of the comparatively minor skulduggery that I knew about'. He said that he did not suggest to me either at the 11 February 1980 meeting or since any definitive action beyond AMIS to overcome malpractices. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if I had been asked I doubt whether I would have been able to give the specific details that a Minister would be hungry for. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that he did not report his findings to the police because he 'never even thought of it'. He said that he never, in his experience over the years, ever got very strong rumours that pet meat was being substituted for beef in the local and export chain. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly also confirmed in evidence that the rumours of skulduggery he had heard when conducting his inquiry were nothing like the rumours that were around on 7 September 1981 when he did an interview for the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program National Farm Report. In that interview, Mr Kelly was asked whether he was surprised at the magnitude of the revelations that had been made on the meat substitution issue. He replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, I have been surprised. We were seriously conscious when doing the work that we had rumours of skulduggery and corruption but nowhere near as big as it now appears. </PARA>
<PARA>The overwhelming evidence is that Mr Kelly did not pass on any specific information to me. There are further examples in Mr Kelly's evidence before the Commission to back up this contention. Mr Zucker, representing the Meat Inspectors Association, asked Mr Kelly whether he thought that it would have been appropriate for the Kelly Committee to have checked allegations against inspectors. Mr Kelly replied no, and went on to explain why. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> What is said to the Minister is another matter, but that was the kind of talk that if I had known specific examples, which I did not, but if I had done, that would have been the proper place to talk to him privately. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat that. Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if I had known specific examples, which I did not, but if I had done, that would have been the proper place to talk to him privately. </PARA>
<PARA>Also, in his prepared statement to the Commission, in the paragraph preceding the quote from his diary, Mr Kelly stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The primary purpose of the meeting was to present the report, and any discussions held in relation to areas outside the Terms of Reference of the Committee would have been general and merely coincidental to the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McPhee, counsel assisting the Royal Commission, asked Mr Kelly:</PARA>
<PARA> You were asked whether or not at the meeting with the Minister you provided the specific names of particular places where malpractices were said to have happened and my recollection is that you said that you either did not, or that you had no recollection of doing so. Is that correct?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is right. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McPhee asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Were you ever subequently asked by anybody from the Department for particulars of that nature?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Not as far as I know. I had a discussion with some of the Departmental people and they have asked me whether I can remember. I cannot and I-it is the kind of thing I would have expected, would have thought, I would remember. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hayne, who was assisting Mr McPhee, asked Mr John Landos, the Executive Officer to the Kelly Committee who took notes during its inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you recall whether examples of graft or misuse of inspector power were raised at the meeting?</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the meeting with the Minister on 11 February 1980. Mr Landos stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe any specific examples were raised with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>I should emphasise here that Mr Landos was present at the meeting on 11 February 1980. Mr Stanley, representing me as the Minister for Primary Industry, asked Mr Landos:</PARA>
<PARA> Are you able to recall whether any specific instances of malpractice were actually mentioned by Mr Kelly to the Minister on that day?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Landos replied:</PARA>
<PARA> No, I do not believe any specific instances were mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me turn now to another aspect of Mr Kelly's written submission to the Commission in which he said, according to a diary note dated 23 October 1979, that an operator from a meat establishment had told him of 'some hair-raising stories about the corruption and maladministration in DPI in Canberra as well as in the States'. At that point of his evidence, Mr McPhee interrupted Mr Kelly and asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA> When you speak about corruption and maladministration in the DPI, first of all, what is the nature of the corruption you had in mind?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly answered:</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot remember specifically. This is the advantage of writing it down soon after it happens, but the disadvantage of not doing it fully. I have got a hazy recollection, it is nothing more than that, that there was something to do with the standards of building requirements that the DPI in Canberra were insisting upon, that that is what it was to do with. It was not so much much the meat inspection side of it, it was the control which the DPI correctly have in the standards of building. It was more to do with that than anything else, but I cannot be specific about what it was. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr McPhee asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Have you any recollection of what you were referring to when you spoke about production in that context?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> No. </PARA>
<PARA>So that is Mr Kelly's explanation of hair raising stories-to use his words-of corruption and maladministration in the DPI in Canberra and the States. Mr Kelly , again in his written statement to the Commission, said that he would have expected 'as a result of comments made to us to Mr Nixon at the meeting of 11 February 1980, that he would have got going and straightened things out'. I will come to that matter in a minute. Mr Kelly continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In particular, I would have expected that the first measure he would have taken would have been to ensure security of 'Australia Approved' stamps. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have already indicated Mr Kelly conceded that he did not know of any abuse of the 'Australia Approved' stamp. Mr McPhee asked Mr Kelly whether he had come across any reports or incidence of what he thought was an abuse of the ' Australia Approved' stamp. Mr Kelly replied no. Given all these examples I find it hard to understand how the Commission could make the statement it has made. It seems to me that the Commission has placed immense importance on the totality of the Kelly diary notes, which were not available to me. At the same time I do not believe due consideration has been given to the totality of the evidence tendered by Mr Kelly. It also appears that the Royal Commission relied quite heavily on two other aspects in reaching its conclusion. First, was the question of my action with regard to the 11 February 1980 meeting and second, the so- called Landos notes which Mr Landos accumulated during the course of the Kelly Committee inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> On the first point I have already stated, as I did before the Royal Commission, that I was concerned at Mr Kelly's allegations, broad though they were, when he spoke to me on 11 February 1980. I instructed the Director of the Bureau of Animal Health at a meeting I had with him in my office in Canberra on 18 February 1980 to contact Mr Kelly to see what other information, in particular what specific information, Mr Kelly could provide to enable further investigation to be carried out. In other words, I acted on Mr Kelly's advice just seven days after he had spoken to me. I had several meetings with Mr Gee on meat inspection in the ensuing weeks. Mr Gee told me that the Kelly allegations were too broad to be referred to the police for further investigation. That was Mr Gee's consistent advice to me and I had no reason to question that he, as the director of the Bureau of Animal Health, was advising me correctly. Despite the lack of specific information Mr Gee assured me verbally that action to safeguard against the sorts of broad allegations raised by Mr Kelly was in hand. </PARA>
<PARA> These assurances were supported in a written minute from Mr Gee to myself dated 15 September 1981 which I hereby table. The minute was in response to an article by Mr Alan Reid in the Bulletin dated 22 September 1981 which referred to the allegations contained in the Kelly report. It can be seen from this minute that Mr Gee did institute a number of administrative changes aimed at preventing the sorts of problems to which Mr Kelly had referred. Since that time of course the whole administrative arrangements of the meat industry have been further tightened. The point is that I did tell the Director of the Bureau of Animal Health of Mr Kelly's concerns about malpractice as he expressed them to me. I told the Director to follow them up, to contact Mr Kelly and to find out whether there was any additional information that could be useful and to get the matter fixed. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the second point, that is to say the Landos notes. I had never heard of these notes prior to their being referred to at the Royal Commission hearing on 13 July 1982. I never knew of their existence; they were not referred to me. They are notes taken by Mr Landos in his capacity as Executive Officer to the Kelly Committee. They were taken on an in confidence basis. It is also interesting to note from the evidence of the Commission that Mr Kelly, the Chairman of the committee, also claimed that he did not know of their existence. This raises an extremely important point. I will go through it carefully. Mr Kelly in his proof of evidence to the Commission stated on page 10243 of the transcript:</PARA>
<PARA> During the course of the Inquiry, members of the Committee visited meat establishments throughout Australia and numerous discussions were had with persons involved in the meat industry. During those discussions, Mr Landos made notes of any relevant material to the Commission, which notes were for a period after the report was presented recorded as confidential to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>This is further supported on page 10244 when Mr Kelly said:</PARA>
<PARA> No record of the particular examples of graft, etc. during the inquiry would have been recorded by myself, but by Mr Landos. </PARA>
<PARA>Again on page 10244 Mr Kelly in his diary reference to the 11 February 1980 meeting with me stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It was worth it because it gave me the chance to tell him--</PARA>
<PARA>That is me-</PARA>
<PARA> A few of the notes that we could not put in the report. </PARA>
<PARA>Those notes must mean the Landos notes which Mr Kelly says were taken on a confidential basis. The fact is that Mr Kelly never referred to those notes at all. I will now refer to page 10267 of the Commission transcript. Mr Kelly was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> I take it the only notes that were taken, apart from your diary, of the Committee's proceedings, were those taken by Mr Landos?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I guess so, unless Mr Buettel took some. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> You did not direct that those notes be forwarded to the Minister, did you?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly answered:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Landos' notes or mine?</PARA>
<PARA>The question was:</PARA>
<PARA> No, Mr Landos'. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly's reply is very important. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> No, I did not even know they were written until the other day. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly Mr Kelly had contradicted himself on his evidence. On the one hand he said he knew of Landos taking notes as the Committee went about its inquiries; on the other hand, he said he did not even know of their existence. I have, in fact, been advised that Mr Landos sent his notes to Mr Kelly on a regular basis during the period of the inquiry. Therefore, Mr Kelly did have the notes. But at my meeting of 11 February he could have either informed me of their existence or given me a set of them on a confidential basis. But he did not do so. Another inconsistency on Mr Kelly's part is also worthy of mention at this point. On page 10244 of the transcript Mr Kelly stated:</PARA>
<PARA> However, I find that I have recorded in my diary the following comments which would have been the basis of my own observations to Mr Nixon in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>Page 10267 of the transcript shows that Mr Kelly was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> At the time you saw the Minister in February did you have your diary with you?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly replied:</PARA>
<PARA> No, that is not the kind I hasten to carry around with me; I might lose it. </PARA>
<PARA>While he said that his diary 'would have been the basis of my observations to Mr Nixon', in fact it was not. Mr Kelly did not have his diary with him when he met me. The evidence clearly shows that no information of the type contained in the diary was ever given to me. I turn now to the so-called Landos notes. The Royal Commission has clearly placed considerable importance on the Landos notes. For example, Mr Justice Woodward stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Senior officers of the Department had available to them a good deal of detailed information which was not passed on to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Landos had taken summary notes which included references to particular allegations of malpractices including the manipulation of overtime, stealing, the provision of cheap and free meat, and the obtaining of concessions by inspectors by the enforcement of ridiculous standards. </PARA>
<PARA>He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Information concerning the specific instances upon which the Committee had formed its general impression was available to anyone wishing to seek it out. </PARA>
<PARA>The point must be made and I will repeat it: The information was not available to me. I did not even know of the existence of the Landos notes. Mr Landos, in his evidence before the Commission on 13 July 1982, stated that the Committee, of which he was a part, regarded this information as confidential. He also told the Commission that he did make the information available to departmental officers 'at a later stage', which was 'two or three months after the Committee reported'. The fact is, however, that the Landos notes never reached my desk. I could not act upon them because I did not know of their existence. </PARA>
<PARA> Given all this, the question arises: On what basis could I refer anything to the Australian Federal Police or to any other authority for greater investigation? The only course open to me was the one that I followed, namely, to call in the Director of the Bureau of Animal Health, tell him what Mr Kelly had told me and direct him to follow the matter up. That is what I did. As it transpires Mr Gee did not contact Mr Kelly directly. He chose instead to speak to Mr Landos. Mr Gee stated in evidence before the Commission:</PARA>
<PARA> I went to Mr Landos and inquired of him as to what evidence, what data, they did have from their hearings, and from their conversations and from the submissions they raised and John Landos related to me that there was nothing substantial, that there was nothing of what we would call hard evidence, and I said 'Are you sure there is nothing that would warrant us investigating further or going to the police?' and he was of the opinion that there was not anything of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, Mr Hayne, for counsel assisting the Commission suggested to Mr Gee:</PARA>
<PARA> It was clear that the Committee itself had made fairly strong statements in its report on a number of specific practices, had they not?</PARA>
<PARA>To that Mr Gee answered:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in fact in its report made very few references to administrative practices. In fact, in a roughly 100 page report there are two or three paragraphs that only relate to issues of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Landos produced a minute, dated 21 February 1980, which was not referred to me, and in which he stated that the Committee members, in their meeting with me on 11 February 1980, expressed strong views as to the 'sordid' nature of the meat inspection service. As I have said, Mr Gee followed up my request for further information on the state of the meat inspection service by discussing it with Mr Landos. Mr Gee was questioned about this at the Royal Commission. He denied that Mr Landos had expressed any strong views about the so-called sordid nature of the meat inspection service. Mr Gee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Landos did not support an attitude of strong views in later discussions with me. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gee also told the Commission:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the view, even now, that they (Buettel and Kelly) expressed strong views (at the 11 February 1980 meeting) and I did not have the view then that they expressed strong views. If they had expressed really strong views, I am sure they would have been taken more notice of. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Landos also seems to support this view because when referring to the credibility of the information contained in the notes he had gathered, he told the Royal Commission:</PARA>
<PARA> By far the great majority, if not all of the allegations received by the Committee, were based on rumour or on secondhand evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>I now return to the Royal Commission's findings. It has stated that I did not deal with the allegation that there had been cases of bribery and abuse of power in my Department in a manner that was adequate and effective. The point about this statement is that at no time was any such allegation put before me in such direct and forthright terms. Indeed, I was not told of any allegation that even nears that situation or interpretation. I therefore must question paragraph 1.64 of the report, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> But I believe that the Minister, having heard from a responsible source that there had been cases of bribery and abuse of power in his Department, should have taken positive steps to investigate the matter. In my view he did not deal with this allegation in a manner that was adequate and effective. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have stated, both here and before the Royal Commission, and as has been conformed in evidence before the Commission by Mr Kelly, Mr Landos and Mr Gee, I was provided with no specific information. And Mr Justice Woodward himself found in his report, in paragraph 2.34, that much of the information supplied initially on malpractice was 'little better than rumour'. Furthermore, Mr Justice Woodward himself has pointed to the difficulty of getting concrete information about malpractice in the meat industry. In his paragraph 2.75, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> If this Report had been written in April of this year instead of September, on the basis of evidence then available, I would have reported that malpractice in the industry was rare, and felt compelled to recommend that, in the light of that finding, many of the present security measures were unnecessary and that no fundamental change in administrative arrangements was required to prevent or detect malpractices. </PARA>
<PARA>(Extension of time granted). This is one of the things that the Leader of the Opposition accused the Prime Minister of selectively quoting. As the Leader of the Opposition put it, the words that followed-'Such a report would have been totally misleading'-were not added. I accuse the Leader of the Opposition of selective quoting. The words 'Such a report would have been totally misleading' refer to the totality of that page, because the later evidence that came out after April demonstrated that the conclusion he would have reached in April would have been unsatisfactory. So it is not the Prime Minister who selectively quoted; it is the Leader of the Opposition who selectively quoted. Let us be clear on that. The Royal Commission had sat, full time, from the time of its appointment until April-a period of seven months-before it began to see the light of day as to what was really going on with this industry. That is a significant fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to aspects of the Royal Commissioner's report dealing with the meat substitution issue of August last year, and the subsequent Government action. The first point to make is to repeat the Royal Commissioner's finding in paragraph 1.19:</PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the Department of Primary Industry, it is only fair to say that, under instructions from its Minister, it acted promptly and effectively when the meat substitution scandal erupted. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a major finding of the Royal Commission. And, in paragraph 1.20, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The steps taken were drastic, but appropriate to the situation . . . the Department did succeed in restoring the confidence of the USDA in a comparatively short time and without excessive disruption or cost to the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>And, in paragraph 1.22, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, in consequence of the strong reaction of the Minister and the Department, and the establishment of this Royal Commission, the current level of malpractice in the meat industry is lower than it ever has been. This desirable situation should be vigorously maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>Those findings by the Royal Commissioner put the lie to the Opposition's claims that the Government, or I as Minister, was slow to act on the meat substitution issue. Let me cite another example. Paragraph 7.2 of the Commissioner's report states:</PARA>
<PARA> I should say at the outset that I have no doubt that the industry has never been more free of malpractices than it is today. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commissioner also says in paragraph 1.61:</PARA>
<PARA> Generally, such matters as were referred to Commonwealth Ministers were dealt with adequately and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>And, in paragraph 8.39, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> Insofar as allegations were reported by the Department to Mr Nixon, I do not consider any criticism can be levelled at his handling of them. </PARA>
<PARA>The only point of criticism that the Royal Commission has stated of me is in paragraph 8.39, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The only possible criticism of his handling of his responsibilities in this area relates to his reaction to the Report of the Kelly Committee of Inquiry in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>I have dealt with that statement. However, notwithstanding its inaccuracy, I considered that such a statement coming from a royal commission was a serious matter. The Commission had reflected on my handling not of the meat substitution issue, but of one aspect of the Kelly report. I received a copy of the Royal Commission report at 2.45 on Friday afternoon. After reading it I immediately contacted the Prime Minister and offered my resignation. I confirmed my intention to him in a letter which I delivered personally to the Prime Minister on Sunday afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night, after considering all the facts of the report, the Prime Minister decided not to accept my resignation. I thank him for that. I do not believe that I have in any way neglected my responsibilities in the handling of any matters raised by Mr Justice Woodward. I should point out that I was prepared to accept whatever decision the Prime Minister reached and continue to serve the Government and the Prime Minister with total and undivided loyalty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anyone listening to this debate tonight would think that the only issue is whether the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) should have accepted the sham offer to resign of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon)-or should I say in respect of this Government, the almost refreshing offer to resign. Anyone listening to the debate would think that Australia's livestock and meat industries had not been put in jeopardy by this Government, that a trade of over $1 billion a year had not been put at risk and that indeed there had been no meat substitution. Anyone would think that the whole debate is about poor old Bert Kelly. The last book he wrote was entitled One More Nail, and we have seen all the nails thudding in tonight. The public must be rather mystified. This report is about meat substitution. The Opposition is censuring the Prime Minister because it is he who is setting inconsistent, improper standards of ministerial responsibility for his Ministers. Twenty-two Ministers have either been sacked or have resigned and a different standard applies to National Country Party Ministers. The public, the primary producers and the parliamentarians want to know when a Minister is ever responsible for what happens in departments under his control. It is not only the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) who is involved in this case; there is also the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's speech earlier today was an apologia for the Minister for Primary Industry. It was a concoction, a Clarence Darrow defence of the indefensible, a contrived legalistic defence involving the bucketing of all concerned in the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry. The Prime Minister was trying to show, as was the Minister for Primary Industry, that we can have smoke but no fire. It shows that the offered resignation of the Minister for Primary Industry was a sham. Obviously when he went to the Prime Minister or discussions were held they said: 'Here is the problem; what is the best way to get out of it?' The Prime Minister is desperately searching for scapegoats because of his Government's hopeless management of the economy. This report shows that he, his Government and his Ministers are not only bad economic managers but also incompetent administrators . The debate today has boiled down to a case of Nixon versus Kelly and Woodward. I have a sense of deja vu. It is like the debate about a report by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, the Sinclair versus Rae committee. In both cases the Government has argued that the findings, in one case those of a Senate Committee and in this case those of the Royal Commissioner, are wrong. That is what it is arguing. The Prime Minister engaged in selective quoting, and we have now heard from the Minister for Primary Industry that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) also engaged in selective quoting. When we have a report this big there is no way in which people cannot engage in selective quoting. In no time at all the debate boils down to a slanging match point for point and each person leaves out the paragraph he wants to leave out. I am not going to read all the relevant paragraphs; I simply say that the guts of the matter in terms of the Minister are in paragraphs 1.63, 1. 64, 8.45, 8.46, 8.47 and 8.48. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to talk about the fact that the Government is not treating the delivery of this report in the same spirit that it exhibited when it set up the Royal Commission. This report is not all about Bert Kelly and Mr Landos's notes. The Government has not addressed itself to the positive recommendations of the Royal Commission. It has not addressed itself to the allegations. Let us just look at some of the malpractices. Let us for a moment just get back to the meat industry . The Commissioner said that all the malpractices were done for financial gain. Local meat was being sent into the export trade; pet meat was being put into meat for human consumption. Some did not follow health regulations, some did. There were false descriptions in terms of age and quality. In terms of the el- Hal slaughter there has been bribery and forgery of certificates. The Royal Commissioner says that the reputation of the Australian meat industry was well below that of New Zealand. There were the allegations of robbing the pack; taking out the best cuts but not saying so. Australian approved stamps were lost and there was no attempt to find them; slaughter dates were wrong, boxes were relidded to change the date; transfer certificates were forged and meat was moved from one store to the other; and export documentation was not obtained. This is what Mr Justice Woodward is finding. This Government is saying that no- one, certainly not a Minister, is responsible for this. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a quite impossible situation. The debate is not about poor old Bert Kelly; it is about the meat industry. I do not have the time to read into Hansard the recommendations but again I refer honourable members to the full list in Chapter 9. There are over 17 pages of recommendations. I would have thought that the Prime Minister or the Minister for Primary Industry, who allegedly exhibit some responsibility or interest in this area, would have at least mentioned that. The Prime Minister apparently regards the cattle industry as being incidental to the findings of the Royal Commission. As I have said before, the Royal Commission was set up to investigate the crisis in which this Government's hopeless administration had placed the cattle and meat industries. The National Country Party Ministers in charge of primary industry in this country had jeopardised our entire meat industry's export trade. </PARA>
<PARA> So today the Prime Minister came in to give the reasons why he had saved the head of the Minister for Primary Industry and engaged in some selective quoting. Let us put that aside and look at the people he bucketed in turn. He bucketed the Department of Primary Industry, the Commonwealth meat inspectors, the Bureau of Animal Health and the Australian Federal Police. The Minister for Administrative Services has not offered to resign over the matter involving the Australian Federal Police but he is a Liberal Party member so he is not game; it would be accepted. Then there has been Mr Kelly and finally there is Mr Justice Woodward himself. All these groups and individuals got a bucketing. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Prime Minister has the gall to say that the Public Service is sometimes maligned when it should not be. That is rather strange, coming from the Liberals . When it suited him today the Prime Minister praised some parts of the Public Service, but on balance his speech was a litany of contrivances, smears, abuse and innuendo relating to public servants. I think it is rather obvious that Bert Kelly was stood over but would not budge. It is the same thing that happened to the now Mr Justice Ellicott in 1975, except that Bert did not budge. The Prime Minister has now said that there is to be an inquiry into the Public Service. This is just a silly diversion. Surely the Royal Commission into Australian Government Administration provided enough of that. I hope that Mr Kelly will stand up for himself in this matter and not take the drubbing that he has taken here today. I understand that he has just appeared on Nationwide and said that the Minister took no notice of the charges of malpractice that Mr Kelly relayed to him. Mr Kelly did not give book, chapter and verse of the allegations; he conducted an investigation into the dual meat inspection service that necessarily entailed his looking at the meat industry in this country. Kelly came across many allegations of bribery, corruption and malpractices and he reported these to the Minister. Mr Justice Woodward has said that the Minister did not act on those things effectively or adequately. This Government has engaged in nonsense. It has set up a Commission, and because it does not like a handful of paragraphs in the report and the report does not suit it politically it rubbishes it. Of course the report does not suit this Prime Minister. Goodness gracious me, when his Treasurer, his Attorney-General and his Minister for Defence are all under a shadow and then his Minister for Primary Industry also comes under a shadow, of course he has to duck for cover. But if this is the way in which we are to treat royal commissions it brings the whole rationale for setting them up into great doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> This Royal Commission met for almost a year. The Royal Commissioner is a distinguished judge. He was head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. That gave him good experience even to understand the National Country Party and its deviousness. But the Prime Minister has examined this report over the weekend and come into the House with an exercise of not looking at the report or the cattle and the meat industries, but at ways and means of protecting this Minister. That, of course, is symptomatic of this rotten, corrupt Government. The central issue is ministerial responsibility and the failure of this Prime Minister to live up to his high-minded words on that concept. I do not suppose one can say that the Kelly versus Nixon thing is a footnote but it is not central to this issue other than in purely political terms, in terms of the day to day discourse in the Parliament. We have to look at some of the more long term things-the cattle industry, the meat industry and ministerial responsibility. Let us just take some of these high minded quotations. The Leader of the Opposition has quoted the classic one from the Prime Minister, which is now shown to be absolute humbug. Let us take the statements of the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) when he was Minister for Primary Industry. Here is a quotation from him:</PARA>
<PARA> From my point of view a principal consideration is that the ADI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation and as such I am directly responsible for its activities to the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made by the Minister for Defence when he was Minister for Primary Industry. It was contained in a letter to the Australian Dairy Corporation Chairman, Mr Webster, on 20 April 1979, which appears in the report of the Auditor-General's first inquiry into the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong ) Ltd. He was saying that he lived up to some idea of his ministerial responsibility in that regard. But this Minister will not live up to his. This has been a massive scandal. It has been worse than the ADI one in a way, although I am finding it hard to work out which is the worst. There was international tax evasion, and a breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and poor old Bill Pyle was made a scapegoat because he disconnected his speedo. Well, it is not Pyle who is the scapegoat this time; it is poor old Bert Kelly. The Government has not acted in a responsible way to protect Australia's billion dollar cattle industry. That was the whole problem at the outset. When the scandal broke this Government did not know which way to go. First of all, half of the Ministry thought their mates were involved and the other half did not know whom to phone to find out what the issue was all about. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a lot of statements by the Prime Minister today to the effect that nothing was known-he quoted paragraph 7.6 of the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry-about meat substitution before late 1979. I put it to honourable members that the allegations go back to 1975. Put aside Bert Kelly's allegations and report to the Minister. There have been widespread allegations, over a prolonged period, about malpractice in the Australian meat industry involving the domestic and export markets. I will not take an extreme position. I acknowledge it would be impossible for a government to respond to all the isolated allegations which are made and which, on the whole, are difficult to prove. Responding to all such allegations would result in a government chasing a large number of non-events; but, even so, there have been allegations of malpractice in the meat industry. These can be documented over six years. The allegations come from a wide variety of sources and relate to nearly all aspects of the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that these allegations reached the Government from the time of the first publicly documented complaint in 1975. Following the only successful prosecution-in fact the only prosecution-of a company involved in malpractice relating to export meat shipments in January 1980 the Cattle Council of Australia pressed three times for the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation to request that the Department of Primary Industry impose stricter penalties on companies found guilty of malpractice. No action was taken by the AMLC. Why not? The Government should have been aware of the Cattle Council's call for stricter penalties, at least through its representative on the AMLC, but why did it take no action? In view of the persistence of the allegation of malpractice, the successful prosecution of one company and industry calls for stricter penalties, the Government's continued stand of ignoring the allegation moved from misjudgment to criminal negligence, given the seriousness of the charges in terms of potential consequences for Australia's multimillion dollar meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite six years of warning that something was the matter in the Australian meat industry, when the story of the discovery of horseflesh in the United States finally broke, the Government had no plan of action. The Government even failed to act earlier on a report it had commissioned into meat inspection in Australia. That is the Kelly report; and I will not go into that. But with glaring loopholes in Australia's meat inspection service and with evidence of malpractice in all areas of the meat trade unfolding day by day, when the United States discovery was reported, the Government sat looking silly until the United States Department of Agriculture took the initiative. Why could not the Australian Government have taken the lead then? It was already late in the day but perhaps it was not too late. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to refer to the various aspects of the way this story developed, but I can refer to some of the events and set the chronology for honourable members. In 1975 a complaint was made to the Victorian Department of Agriculture that meat for local consumption was being falsely labelled as export quality and shipped to the United States. The information was passed to the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry. The Commonwealth Police investigated the matter and its findings were submitted to the Department of Primary Industry. The evidence was deemed to be insufficient and prosecutions were not launched. In 1977, just prior to the elections, Senator Primmer told the then Minister of allegations about improper practices. The result was no action. In December 1977 the Victorian Attorney-General told of allegations that meat being slaughtered for local consumption was being illegally transferred to cold stores and shipped overseas. The allegations were passed to the Commonwealth Police. In January 1978, Richmond Councillor Alexander wrote to the Prime Minister to express concern at the allegations. He was advised that the Commonwealth Police were investigating the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1978 Senator Primmer made a statement to the Senate detailing certain allegations. These allegations are reported at page 404 of Hansard of 7 March 1978. Nothing has happened. (Extension of time granted). In March 1978 Senator Primmer made a statement detailing allegations to the Senate. He named names. Nothing happened. Nobody from the Commonwealth Police, the Government or the Department of Primary Industry ever approached him for further information. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) now claims that he knew nothing of the Primmer statement. We have to ask: Where was he? In June 1979 the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union newsletter detailed allegations of corrupt abattoir operators and meat inspectors passing sub-standard meat for export. Again nothing happened, other than the AMIEU being advised to keep its mouth shut or the jobs of its members would be affected. In November 1979 Mr Williams, a Liberal Member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Doncaster-I would not put much faith in his evidence-alleged that meat prepared for local consumption had been illegally transferred for export. The police actually investigated the matter but no charges were laid. </PARA>
<PARA> In January 1980, after an 18-month delay, before the Department of Primary Industry granted permission to the Australian Federal Police to prosecute, W. Pope &amp; Co. Pty Ltd was convicted of falsely labelling diced mutton as diced beef in shipments to the Middle East. The fine was $100. In late 1980 there was a meeting between Australian Federal Police and three of Australia's major meat exporters concerned at the breakdown in the fragmented meat inspection system, the replacement of export by local products, and the substitution of horseflesh for beef. There was no action. In July 1981 horseflesh was found in a shipment of Australian beef to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to have the time to relate the whole sorry story to the House about what happened from then on. The point I am making is that the statement of the Prime Minister, in which he quoted from paragraph 7.6, saying that there was no evidence of substitution before late 1979, cannot be substantiated. The Opposition quite plainly disagrees with the finding in that paragraph. There was plenty of smoke and there was plenty of fire about all of these matters. Perhaps I could refer to what happened at that time and how this Minister let down the Government and the beef industry. This matter first attracted wide publicity when the meat was detected in the United States in July last. In the Age newspaper of 9 July last year it was stated that the State authorities in Victoria planned to close loopholes allowing substitution of kangaroo meat in fast foods on the domestic market. What was the response from this Government? There was none. On 13 August the National Farm Report stated that Federal Police were called in to investigate claims by the United States that horsemeat had been found-600 lb of it. An export ban was placed on Profreeze and seven other companies. The Government's response was that there was still some doubt about where the horsemeat came from-Australia or the United States-but after a few days it imposed an export ban on Profreeze. On 14 August there was a claim by the New South Wales Livestock and Grain Producers Association Secretary, Mr Brown, that beef exports were being deliberately discredited by the United States. What was the reaction from the Government? There was none. </PARA>
<PARA> I can continue to refer to the events including Wally Curran's Mafia claims. Dr Bill Gee of the Bureau of Animal Health pointed out on 15 August that it was almost certain that the bogus beef came from Australia and substitution took place in Australia. The Department of Primary Industry attempted to talk to a man named Hammond. I can continue to relate these actions day by day as the sorry story unfolded. The Minister did nothing until 26 August when the United States Department of Agriculture set the new standards for Australian beef. The Minister had not acted from some time in July until 26 August. That is why the Opposition, in a censure motion at that time, said that the Government was acting in a very dilatory fashion on such a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know who wrote today's script. The Leader of the Opposition terms the Government's front bench as 'Horgan's heros'. But I think this matter reminds me more of Yes Minister. Both those shows are comedies. But we are not talking about a comedy; we are talking about a farce-a tragedy. This matter is symptomatic of what is going on in this rotten, scandal-ridden government. The Government cannot act when it is faced by a crisis because its administration of its key departments is so shocking that it does not know what to do. We are not looking only at the Minister for Primary Industry in this censure motion but also at all the Ministers who have resigned, have been forced to resign or have been sacked. We are looking particularly at this time at the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) both of whom are involved in a lack of ministerial duty as far as the problem of tax evasion is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, I believe that any fair-minded person listening to what has been put here today will back the Opposition and censure the Prime Minister for his inability to maintain ministerial responsibility in his Government, thereby causing this widespread malpractice and corruption. This Government is composed of Ministers who are not only bad economic managers but also bad administrators. This Government was responsible for putting Australia's meat export trade, which is worth over $1 billion, at risk. The meat substitution scandal did occur. The Government cannot say to the people, the Australia meat industry and to the cattle producers that no one is to blame, least of all the Minister for Primary Industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be a travesty of justice to condemn the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) on what we have heard today. This censure motion, which is really against the Minister for Primary Industry, has no substance whatsoever. It is extraordinary that it should ever have been contemplated, and it should be rejected. I understand that I am the last speaker on the Government side in this debate and I think it is appropriate that I try to put things into perspective and sum up exactly what the arguments are. That will have the attraction, whilst not going over all the same ground, of enabling us to take a bird's eye view of the matter and see exactly where we are, what are the allegations against the Minister and what is the response. The first point that should be made is that it would be a travesty of justice to condemn the Minister for Primary Industry on what has been put against him today in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset, I think there are several basic points that I should make and we should understand. The first is that, or my part and the part of everyone on the Government side, there is certainly no intention to pass any personal criticism on either Mr Justice Woodward or the Honourable C. R. Kelly, a former member of this House. That should be clearly understood because of certain remarks made about Government speakers today. There has been no attempt or intention to pass any personal criticism on either of those gentlemen. The second point is equally important; that is, that a royal commission report is not a judgment on individuals, but it is regarded, apparently, by some people these days as exactly that, as a judgment on individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is to be regarded as a judgment on individuals and if people are to be condemned on the basis of a royal commission report then we, in defence, are entitled to do two things. The first thing we are entitled to do is to analyse the evidence and see whether the evidence comes up to scratch and whether it justifies the conculusions reached by the Royal Commissioner. The second thing we are entitled to do is to analyse the Royal Commissioner's report and submit it to very close scrutiny indeed to see whether his conclusions come up to scratch. I believe that one can do that without making any personal criticisms of the Royal Commissioner or the witnesses who appeared before him. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what we have to do here. We have to analyse the evidence and see whether it justifies condemning or censuring the Minister and to analyse the report of the Royal Ccmmission into the Australian Meat Industry and see whether those conclusions which are adverse to the Minister are justified. The Government says that if one analyses the evidence fairly one would not condemn or censure the Minister for Primary Industry and that if one analyses the Royal Commissioner's report one is entitled to say, as the Government does with great vehemence, that it does not justify criticism, condemnation or censure of the Minister. Without going over all the detail-I promised that I would not do that- I say in generality that one can look at this matter and the allegations about the Minister in two ways. The first way is to accept everything that was said in the Royal Commissioner's report at face value and reach conclusions on that. The second way one can approach it is to look at all the evidence and see what conclusions one reaches oneself. No matter which way one approaches the matter, the Minister should not be condemned or censured. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the first way. Let us assume for the purposes of the present argument that everything that is said in the Royal Commissioner's report should be taken at face value and is accurate in every way, without making any criticisms of the report and without using the evidence at all. What do we find then? We find in the first place that the allegations that the Minister was supposed to have investigated-I emphasise that this is not arguing about the evidence; it is taking it on face value-were themselves unsubstantiated and were allegations of the most general nature without names or places, that they were not specific. The second thing we find is that the importance attached to them can be seen by the way the Kelly Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems treated the allegations. They were clearly a minor part of the Kelly report and were not the reason for the Committee conducting its inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing we can conclude very readily, again without arguing about the evidence but taking it all at face value, taking all of the statements in the Royal Commissioner's report as gospel truth, is that it is clear from the evidence upon which the Royal Commissioner relied that the allegations were pursued by the Minister. I do not think, in fairness, that that point has been made with anything like the clarity that it should have been made in this debate today. When one reads the evidence one cannot but conclude that the Minister did examine these allegations. That is the situation taking the first approach of accepting the Royal Commissioner's report at face value. </PARA>
<PARA> Accepting all that the Royal Commissioner said, the case against the Minister can be summed up in this way: He did not deal adequately with some allegations- some general and vague allegations, unsubstantiated and with no detail as to who should be investigated, and allegations on matters that the Committee was not even investigating. In any event-I come back to the basic point-it is clear from the report that the allegations were pursued. Before I go on from that point, I wish to make the fundamental point that from beginning to end there was not a single allegation of time, place or person which was put to the Minister and which it could be said could have been examined or pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the way we put it on the first basis. If one accepts the Royal Commissioner's report at face value, if one makes no criticisms of the report and if one does not point to evidence that he overlooked, one comes to the conclusion that, on the basis of what the Royal Commissioner said, the Minister for Primary Industry should not be censured or condemned. I turn now to the second way of approaching the matter. I believe, in defence of the Minister, that the case is much stronger when one looks at the facts and the whole of the evidence. When the whole of the evidence is examined the Minister is indeed in a much stronger position. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the complete picture, which unfortunately is not revealed in the report. The full picture is seen only when the evidence is examined. The report of a royal commission, as I said before, is wrongly regarded these days as something of a judgment-in this case a judgment on the Minister and his conduct. But this judgment-if that is the way we are going to refer to it-in the first place omits all reference to the evidence of two witnesses who were concerned in the Minister's trial, if that is the way it is going to be regarded, because the judgment omits reference to the Minister's own evidence and the details of what he did to follow up these allegations and it omits the evidence of Mr Gee, who took a major part in these proceedings. It not only ignores and fails to make any reference to Mr Gee's evidence and gives inadequate reference to the Minister's evidence-I might say evidence on oath-but also makes some very grave errors in reproducing the evidence, because the erroneous extracts from the Kelly report and the evidence, I believe, are used to justify a conclusion that is adverse to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> No reference is made to the evidence of those witnesses and no reference was made to that evidence which could be used in defence of the Minister. That is why I believe it is so subject to criticism. It is bad enough for a royal commission to make errors in evidence and to set out wrongly extracts from a report-this is the basis for the attempt to condemn the Minister-but it is doubly bad when that is the very case which is put against him. Also-this makes it even worse-if one sets out the evidence word for word as it really was in the Kelly report, one finds that the Minister has a very good defence indeed. That is why I believe it is subject to criticism. What were the facts? Mr Kelly presented his report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Leader of the House says, that was never put to him. I come to the facts. Mr Kelly presented his report. He had a conversation with the Minister when he presented his report. Honourable members should not forget, if we are using the court room analogy, that Mr Kelly in fact is the main witness against the Minister. When Mr Kelly was giving his evidence he was asked what the conversation was about. He was asked for details. What did he say? I do not think this has been mentioned in the debate. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am under oath so I do not know what I said. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition is asking us to condemn the Minister for Primary Industry on the basis of Mr Kelly putting to the Minister at a meeting allegations of bribery and corruption. What happened when the main witness was asked what the details of the allegations were? He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am under oath so I do not know what I said. </PARA>
<PARA>But when he gets down to some detail he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We had rumours of skullduggery and corruption but nowhere near as big as it now appears. </PARA>
<PARA>If there were any thought that Mr Kelly regarded these rumours as being of any substance or constituting anything that should be investigated, surely that is put at rest by his evidence. He was asked what sort of details he had. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . I doubt whether I would have been able to give the specific details that a Minister would be hungry for. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only does Mr Kelly not remember what he said but also, even if he had been asked about the details of the allegations, he would have to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I doubt whether I would have been able to give the specific details that a Minister would be hungry for. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 10275 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is right. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that in answer to a question suggesting that he did not really provide specific names of places where malpractices were said to have happened. It is said by the Opposition-let there be no doubt that this is the basis of the case against the Minister-that it is on the very basis of what Mr Kelly said to the Minister at the meeting in February 1980 that the Minister should have investigated these allegations. But when we come to the main witness the Opposition produces in support of those allegations we find that the witness cannot remember what he said. He did not give any specific allegations. The most he can say is that there were rumours of skulduggery and such like. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the basic point I made at the beginning of my remarks. It would be a travesty of justice to censure or condemn the Minister on that sort of evidence. Not only is that bad enough but also, I venture to say-I repeat that I make no criticisms of the Royal Commissioner in person-that if the Opposition is going to censure or condemn a Minister and if a report is going to be presented, as the Royal Commissioner did, is it too much to ask that the Royal Commissioner accurately quote from the Kelly report, as he places so much of his case against the Minister on the Kelly report? But there are substantial and serious omissions in those parts of the Kelly report which the Royal Commissioner sets out in his report. It would be a travesty to condemn or censure the Minister when that is the treatment given to evidence against him. The Kelly report did not say that legislation should include heavy punishments for this sort of misconduct. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> AMIS-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Australian Meat Inspection Service-</PARA>
<PARA>legislation should include heavy punishments . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is plain, when one reads the Kelly report, that what Mr Kelly and his Committee were saying to the Minister in that report was not that there were malpractices which the Minister should investigate. The Kelly Committee said that there was a need for a new inspection service and that when the new inspection service was set up by legislation heavy penalties should be imposed for this sort of malpractice. Frankly, it would be very unfair indeed-a travesty -to censure or condemn the Minister on the basis of that material. I would have thought that it was not too much to expect that a royal commission about its task would quote accurately from the Kelly report, if it is the Kelly report which is used as the basis for criticising the Minister's performance of his ministerial functions. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the outset that one can approach this matter in two ways. One can accept the report at face value and see what conclusions come from that. If one does that, without even looking at the evidence-simply accepting what the Royal Commissioner says-the conclusion that the Minister should be censured is not justified. Alternatively, one can approach the matter in what I would say is the way royal commission reports have to be approached these days-that is, regard it as a judgment. If one regards it as a judgment one should look at the evidence to see whether justice can be done. One should look at the evidence to see whether conclusions are reached. On either basis, the Minister should not be censured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, when I last spoke in this debate on Wednesday night I mentioned the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, and the inability of that inquiry to probe properly and give correct estimates of what might have been lost through tax avoidance. There were many estimates of what was lost through tax avoidance and evasion. The report itself, which is unpublished, has not named the people who would be caught under the provisions of the anti- avoidance legislation that is already enacted, in the natural course of assessment. Some of the names in the Costigan report would be those of years ago , before the 1980 legislation took place. Some, I believe, would refer back to the Australian Labor Party's term in office, before anti-avoidance legislation was in force. A little-made observation in the whole Costigan affair is that Mr Costigan was appointed by a conservative Federal Government and a conservative Victorian State Government and had his terms of reference widened to look at the whole tax avoidance question. If there is to be a question on this, it certainly cannot be as to our Government's integrity in wanting to bring everything to the surface. Without a doubt they are the actions of a government that is determined to come to grips with not only the tactics of the Painters and Dockers Union but also the whole tax avoidance industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I defy the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) to substantiate the figures he so carelessly broadcast in the hope that they would fall on fertile imaginations . One claim that he has not been able to substantiate was in relation to the three knights in Queensland whom he has not named. In fact, he has reneged on this. This only indicates the shallowness of his comments and his allegations. In fact no one, not even Mr Costigan, can quote the total figure that has been lost or disputed through tax avoidance or tax evasion. If the work of the Special Prosecutor that this Government has now appointed, armed with the present and proposed legislation of the Treasurer (Mr Howard), is to be rewarded I suggest that the eventual cost in tax avoidance will be shown to be absolutely minimal and only a fraction of the figure mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to tax evasion, that is another matter altogether. This matter is being confused by the claims of the Opposition, which are not specific. I have claimed in the past that there is a significant area of tax loss through tax evasion. This involves wages, salaries and allowances that are undeclared, interest that is unrecorded, income from sales that is not recorded and, of course, the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. This is tax evasion. It should not be confused at all with tax avoidance. The tax evasion question has been deliberately interlocked by Labor with tax avoidance to associate the whole lot with the wealthy and the companies of Australia. But the major portion of the loss is caused by the significant number of Australians who are abusing the taxation system-high and low income earners alike. The accusations, the rhetoric and the false assumptions made by the Opposition leave the Opposition floundering in its own cesspool of guilt. That is fair enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The underground economy has distorted all the economic calculations we use today on the employed, the unemployed, the gross national product, the revenue forgone, the productivity of Australia and even our standards of living. How can one ascertain a living standard when a lot of the income that is derived in Australia has gone underground and is not recorded? All such statistics, in comparison with 10 years ago, are virtually worthless because of the effect of this cash or underground economy. In some instances those who defraud the tax collectors are, in a way, defrauding the welfare and service system. They include those who draw unemployment relief and have a job under another name and those who receive health and education grants or rebates when they earn undisclosed and untaxed income. The position undoubtedly is getting worse and is of tremendous concern, or should be, to every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate of Dawson people claim that there are instances of one person using up to six names in trying to get established identification for the receipt of goods. This indicates that one person might be holding various jobs under different names and/or drawing unemployment relief or other grants in more than one name. Only two weeks ago, in Sydney, following a person dying at a rather young age, it was disclosed that he had 15 aliases and had been collecting 15 unemployment cheques. This is the type of abuse that is going on. There are instances of seasonal workers insisting on cash in hand amd payments under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme being made on false declarations of income from the parents. There are those who seek universal health and hospital cover at public expense while being able to earn money. They live very comfortably on those who pay their legitimate taxes and their health insurance and for their children's further education. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard of an instance recently in which 64 persons who were registered for employment were written to by an office of the Commonwealth Employment Service in preparation for jobs that would become available. Only 12 of those 64 people responded. One half had other employment or were out of town and only three were available for work-5 per cent of the total. That is an appalling result. As I understand the present system, the Department of Social Security runs its own relief program and there is little or no liaison with the Commonwealth Employment Service. The system now involves two departments with separate inspectoral staff, one trying to maintain a register of unemployment and the other paying funds to the unemployed. It is a further receipe for defrauding the welfare system and providing few checks on the registered unemployed. It is an encouragement for staff of both offices to bend before the pressure and go the path of least resistance and pay out unnecessarily and not insist on proper work test conditions. As I see it, the welfare bill is rising because of fraud. Unemployment is overstated, not understated as the Opposition so gloriously declares, again pulling figures from the sky. Proper tax is not being paid by a significant portion of Australian income earners. It is the completely intolerable and worsening fraud in the financial system that the Government must address itself to, not tax evasion alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States of America, the bastion of free enterprise and expression and custodian of the liberties of the individual, uses an identification card. What we need in Australia to fight effectively all forms of abuse is just that-a proper identification of each Australian with a number, photograph and even a fingerprint. This will readily identify each of those who are on the employment register or the taxation records, or those who are social security recipients and receiving health and education subsidies or any form of government assistance. This common reference between all government agencies would curb all current abuses. If it is good enough for the USA it is certainly good enough for us in Australia when we are faced with the same problem. We are not in government to protect the guilty. We are not elected to encourage people to get greater handouts, to be more dependent on government and to make the innocent pay while the guilty are rewarded for corrupting the accepted forms of democratic governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The last 10 years has seen great changes in people's attitudes brought about by the generousness of governments seeking to retain power and the extravagant promises of Opposition seeking that power. This has led to the very costly illusion that all wants, not needs, will be satisfied by governments and that few care who take illegally from the public purse. Unchecked, the position can only worsen. Tax collections will deteriorate and our official unemployment figures will worsen. We have to take a stronger stand, not only on tax evasion but also on the total evasion and fraudulant problems that exist at the moment. Government policies over the last decade have given birth to the problem. The same governments should seek redress by the compulsory and ready identification of every Australian and every visitor through an identification card. We need a policeman to safeguard the public purse. A plastic policeman would be the most effective in preventing this form of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has referred to other problems in the Budget including cost pressures, rising unemployment, inflation, and lack of competitiveness which has build up protectionism-these are all related to the industrial situation. The Budget is very strong on the aspect that relief in personal income should be set against extravagant wage demands that have been going on in this country over the last few years. A recent visitor to the USA told me that the American unions lack political power and do not seek such power. Unionism is not compulsory and agreements when reached are observed. In all respects Australia is the very opposite of the fundamental precepts that make the US one of the most competitive, effective and free marketeers in the world. One might well ask: Where did this nation go wrong in its own approach to industrial matters? The same visitor said that workers in a business comparable to his own in the US were paid a basic $4 an hour for the first 40 hours of the week they worked. Only after that did overtime rates apply. There were few penalty rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I can imagine just how our own tourist, travel and accommodation industries in Australia would respond if offered the same conditions of employment as exist in the US. In that country annual leave is one week after the completion of two years continuous service and two weeks for each succeeding year. There is no 17 1/2 per cent loading, none of the four weeks annual leave that Australians get, none of the permanency given within Australia's Public Service or the permanency offered in private enterprise where the threat of strike retaliation is so often held at the employer's head. No buffer is offered to those out of work as is provided in Australia by an almost unlimited unemployment benefit with no real effective application of the means test. Even Blind Billy-perhaps I should refer to him as Mr Hayden-must see the result of this chaotic industrial position for Australia. Wage demands can lead only to higher costs, more protection, more unemployed and reducing markets internationally. Yet the Labor Opposition says that it will press for a shorter working week at the same pay. It will reintroduce wage indexation; it will suffer the increased number of unemployed people to maintain the gains of the past; it will introduce a $900m scheme to give the unemployed jobs, a re-run of the Regional Employment Development Scheme . Who will tell Opposition members that the games of the past were not productive games? They have left in their wake an entirely unbalanced economy, bankrupt and liquidated businesses and a growing number of unemployed. Industrial peace on the Australian Council of Trade Unions terms is bankruptcy for the economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again we have a contractionary Budget brought down by a Liberal-National Country party coalition Government which is determined to pursue outdated monetarist policies which have become discredited all over the world. These policies are causing stagnation in our economy and resulting in untold hardship to the millions of Australians who are on low incomes or who are disadvantaged as a result of unemployment, sickness or disability. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) admitted that his economic policies have failed when, in his Budget Speech, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our overseas markets have shrunk. Economic growth has faltered. Unemployment is rising. Inflation remains far too high. Interest rates are hurting many of us. </PARA>
<PARA>What about all the promises this Government has made over the past seven years? Let me catalogue some of them. The Government said: 'We will expand our overseas trade; we will provide the conditions for economic growth; we will reduce unemployment; we will beat inflation; we will reduce interest rates'. I am not quoting from the speeches of Government Ministers because I do not need to do so . The people of Australia know that those promises were made and that they were broken. At last, however, the Treasurer has admitted the truth. Let me quote again from his Budget Speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore unrealistic to expect a major recovery in the Australian economy to occur in the near future. There are no quick, easy solutions to our present problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Treasurer has his two favourite scapegoats-the state of the world economy and what he calls the excessive growth of wages. The Australian people will not be fooled by such deception. Let me quote from a speech the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made to the forty-sixth ANZAAS congress in January 1975. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> National leaders look to parallels, they search for excuses when they should look simply to their own failures-failure to adapt, to perceive, to understand. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is another quote from the same speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped, it is part of a world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership when if they were men of real stature they would be saying 'we can overcome'. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have it. The Treasurer and the Government stand condemned by the words of their own leader, the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser. Now I turn to the other favourite scapegoat, excessive wage demands. According to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister the sole reason for inflation in this country is excessive wage demands. Apart from the fact that they concentrate on the large wage increases won by the more strongly and efficiently organised workers, such as the metal trades, and neglect the more modest increases won by other workers, wages alone do not contribute to inflation. Excessive interest rates, high profits and capital and speculative gains all contribute to inflation but the Government chooses to ignore those aspects because its capitalist friends in the big business world benefit from non-wage incomes. Unlike the person who works for wages, these financiers do not earn their incomes. Their wealth and their army of accountants and solicitors accumulate it for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have no more of the nonsense that wage increases are the sole cause of inflation. Instead, I want to have a realistic look at the wages situation. An examination of the real wages share of the national income shows that there has been a drastic decline in the goods and services available to the wage earner. Real wages include not only the wages paid to wage and salary earners but also the value of the social wage, that is the value of the health, education, housing and welfare services provided by governments. From 1975-76 to 1981-82, the real wages share of the national income has dropped by a massive 8 per cent representing the cuts which the Federal Government has made in the funding provided for health, education, housing and welfare services. When wage and salary earners find that their income is eaten away by ever increasing taxes and that they must pay for services previously provided by government, of course they demand higher wages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party will not permit this rip-off to continue. When we win government at the next Federal elections-they will be very soon-we will introduce a wages and incomes policy which will ensure a most equitable distribution of income, wealth and economic power. We will restore the social wage, but not overnight, because the rip-off of the past seven years cannot be redressed quickly without causing a severe dislocation to the economy. The Australian people are increasingly beginning to realise that, for a Labor government to operate effectively, it must have an uninterrupted period of at least two three-year terms with a Senate which is supportive of ALP policies. The 1973-75 Whitlam Labor Government did not hold real parliamentary power because of a hostile Senate. Three elections in three years frustrated its policies. Of course, it can be asked: Where are the funds coming from to include the areas of health, education, housing and welfare? We do not need to look very far when it is appreciated that the estimates are that over $15,000m has been lost in tax avoidance and evasion over the past seven years. Not only is this Government deceptive and dishonest; it is also protective of its crooked friends . The Government's attempts to slander the whole trade union movement by revealing thuggery in the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia has backfired on it because it has revealed something far worse. It has revealed that senior officials in the Public Service have connived and aided tax avoiders in the business world-let us call it by its correct name, the white collar crime world. These people are being shielded by Ministers and a government which believes that the only crime that the tax dodgers have committed is being found out. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer huffs and puffs about tax avoidance in 1975 but at that time tax avoidance was but a shadow of the present massive pillage of some thousands of millions of dollars each year. This was one of the reasons why the Labor Government lost office in 1975. The financial world realised that, if the Labor Party remained in office, financiers would be unable to continue their robbery of the public purse. Members on the Government side cannot deny that it was the previous Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia who said that taxpayers had the right to arrange their financial affairs in such a manner as to minimise their tax liabilities. This was the top legal authority in the country in effect saying to potential tax dodgers: 'Go ahead with your tax avoidance. It is your right. We won't prosecute you.'</PARA>
<PARA> Make no mistake about it: The Treasurer is as guilty of encouraging the growth of this industry as is the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). They stood by and did nothing until their hands were forced by mounting public pressure and discontent and the revelations of the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the report of the Costigan Royal Commission into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The estimate of $15,000m lost in tax avoidance and evasion could be conservative when it is appreciated that the Taxpayers Association has estimated that losses because of tax avoidance and evasion have reached a staggering $7,000m a year. This means that the average Australian household must pay an extra $35 a week to subsidise the tax dodgers. Little wonder that wage and salary earners are seeking substantial pay rises when the share of total personal income tax paid by them was 83 per cent last year compared with 76 per cent in 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA> Having set a realistic background to the economic climate in which this Budget has been generated, I turn now to the Budget itself which under analysis indicates more deception and more dishonesty. Once again I quote from the Treasurer's Budget Speech in which he referred to the impact of the Budget on a family comprising a sole bread winner on $15,600 a year with a dependent spouse and two dependent children. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the net weekly benefits for this family of this Budget would be about $16. 84 per week. </PARA>
<PARA>But, as the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has pointed out, this is just not true. In the first place, the Budget provisions apply for only eight months of the 1982-83 financial year. Secondly, and even more importantly, the Treasurer completely ignores the fact that the Government has broken its promise that it would introduce tax indexation. The so-called tax cuts will be eaten away by the inflated taxes which the sole breadwinner will pay. The result of substituting honest figures for the dishonest figures used by the Treasurer is that the family will not be $16.84 a week better off but only $3.86 a week better off. What is more, if the family rents or already owns its own home it will not qualify for the home loan rebate and will be only 48c a week better off . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. How much better off is Horgan, as the honourable member for Hotham asks? So much for the credibility of a Treasurer who, even when he is explaining to taxpayers the effect of his Budget, attempts to deceive them. If that is what he is doing in relation to the Australian public, what on earth is he doing with the finances of this country?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have already spoken in a grievance debate about the catastrophic effects of the economic policies of the Fraser Government on the young people in my electorate as a result of rapidly increasing unemployment and a lack of rental housing. The future for young school leavers is bleak indeed with total registered unemployment reaching 497,000 in July, including a 23 per cent increase during 1981-82 in long term unemployment. What is worse, nearly one- third of the unemployed has been out of work for more than six months. Appallingly, the Budget forecasts a continuation and an extension of the chronic unemployment situation and is an admission by the Treasurer of the complete irresponsibility of his Government in ignoring the calls of the Australian Labor Party for a manpower program embracing job creation schemes. The result of the Fraser Government's policies is that the living standards of Australians are rapidly dropping as witnessed by the fact that, although in 1955 there were only four countries with higher living standards than Australia, by 1979 there were 10 countries with higher living standards than Australia, including most of the west European countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the inequalities in the living standards between Australians on high incomes and those on low incomes have increased over the last seven years to the considerable disadvantage of the low income earners. This growing inequality has resulted from salary gains by high income earners, changes in the taxation system, interest rate increases and cuts in spending on government services. The taxation system has played an important role in financing government programs. That is why Opposition members have been concentrating on the gross irresponsibility of the Treasurer in not pursuing tax avoiders. As a result of changes between 1976 and 1981, the bottom 10 per cent of wage earners are paying 19 per cent more of their income in tax; the bottom 30 per cent are paying 4.5 per cent more; the top 20 per cent of wage earners are paying 0.7 per cent less; and the top one per cent is paying 9.4 per cent less. Taxes which hurt the rich, such as gift duty and probate tax, have been abolished. There is no justice or fairness in a taxation system where the tax burden falls most heavily on the poorest members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to health care which has reached a crisis situation in the eastern region of Melbourne. This is not surprising when the health section of Budget Paper No. 7 is analysed. Last year the States received $1,151m as identified in health grants. This year the total is to fall to $1,011m-a reduction of $140m or 12 per cent of last year's grants. But the figures in the Budget are based on an expected 11 per cent cost escalation for 1982-83 so that the reduction in real terms is 23 per cent. This reduction follows a reduction in real terms of 16 per cent in 1981-82 so that over the past two-year period there has been a total reduction of 39 per cent in identified health grants to the States. This is the last year when Commonwealth funds for hospitals and community health centres will be identified in the Budget. In future, the Commonwealth will make no provision for hospital and community health services. It will absorb health grants into the tax sharing grants. The allocation of the funds will then be entirely up to the States Government with no guarantee that those funds will be used for health care. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, Victoria had to find $24m extra to maintain the health services provided by hospitals, community health and the school dental service. For this financial year, the position will be much worse. The identified health grant for Victoria will be $301m-a reduction of $20m instead of the additional $32m required to match inflation. The resultant shortfall represents an 18 per cent cut in Commonwealth funding which, together with State funding, means that the State Government has to provide another $93m more than last year just to keep the existing health services in operation. It must be borne in mind that the State Government is now paying 63 per cent of net operating costs as opposed to 56 per cent last year and 50 per cent for the previous years under the cost sharing agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. The striking contrast to the cuts in the public health sector is the generous treatment handed out to the private health sector. The Budget allocates an increase of $466m, representing 16 per cent above last year, for the private health sector with 83 per cent of these funds provided for medical practitioners, pharmacists and nursing homes. The private illness professions now receive 70 per cent of the total health budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget demonstrates quite clearly the Fraser Government's commitment to the private sector in the field of health at the expense of the public sector. It is a continuation of the Government's policy of abandoning its responsiblities for the public hospitals of our country. Nowhere is this irresponsible policy more evident than in the public hospitals which service my electorate. The eastern suburbs association of hospitals has recently made a joint submission to local parliamentarians drawing attention to the crisis situation in hospital services in the eastern region of Melbourne. The rapid growth in population and the overall aging of the population have contributed to this crisis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have said, the rapid growth in population and the overall aging of the population contributed to the crisis, but the cuts in the public health funding by the Federal Government, which I outlined earlier in my speech, are the basic cause. The new State Labor Government is virtually powerless to overcome the health care crisis because it has resulted from the fact that total Commonwealth payments to the States have fallen by 8 per cent in real terms since 1975. The consequences of this irresponsible squeeze mean that the State Government can only rob Peter to pay Paul. However, any attempt to divert funds from other much needed areas of State responsibilities, such as education, welfare, housing and transport, would be grossly unfair and would not be acceptable to the Victorian people. We are therefore left with a health care crisis which the Federal Budget should have redressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Medical services in the eastern region of Melbourne are at an appallingly low level. Cardiac, renal and investigational medicine services have to be provided in the central Melbourne area, involving long journeys by public and private transport for seriously ill patients. In the case of the Box Hill Hospital, 50 per cent of all admissions are emergencies and accidents, which means that the beds available for specialist elective medicine and surgery are very limited indeed. The general services funds which are available for the rehabilitation or maintenance of aged and handicapped people in the community are so meagre that it is a community at risk in health terms. In addition, hospital administrators have drawn attention on a number of occasions to the aging of the eastern region population, which means that unless a new geriatric centre is built in the area as a matter of urgency the health system for the aged will break down.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the William Angliss Hospital in Upper Ferntree Gully the temporary casualty section is totally inadequate. For example, it is quite common for 100 patients to be admitted in one day to the casualty section, which was designed to deal with fewer than 50 casualties a day. This hospital is the only public hospital in the Sherbrooke area, and it is vital that the Federal Government recognise that the hospital must be given special support, particularly because it is very difficult for frail and acutely ill patients to travel long distances, often by inadequate public transport, to the public hospitals of central Melbourne. Finally, I do not want to overlook the acute lack of nursing staff in the Knox region of my electorate which has been drawn to my attention by the Royal District Nursing Association. With the range and number of services provided by district nurses in the Knox region rapidly increasing, the staffing situation has remained static. It should be appreciated that home medical care is immeasurably cheaper than hospital care, yet both State and Federal Liberal governments have failed to provide support for this vital nursing service. With the Federal Government's user pays philosophy, there is no doubt that it will continue to ignore the appalling state of health in the eastern region of Melbourne. However, one thing is assured; that is, that the electors of the Federal seats of Casey, Deakin and Diamond Valley will not ignore the situation. All three Liberal held seats are vulnerable and the electors know that only a change to a Federal Australian Labor Party Government will assure them of a change to more positive and responsible health care policies.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the services provided in the Budget for disabled and handicapped people. For these people the 1982-83 Budget is a profound disappointment. The opportunity has been missed to provide funding for services which will give handicapped and disabled people the opportunity to become a part of the community where they live. Specifically, there is an urgent need for attendant care allowances for people with disabilities. The Government has announced that $100,000 will be provided for a pilot study for alternatives to attendant care being presently provided in institutions. Research has already indicated the need for those alternatives and a pilot scheme is not necessary. Direct payment should be made to disabled people to enable them to employ the attendant of their choice. Disabled people and their families in my electorate are calling to the Government to provide an attendant care scheme as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA> The program of aids to disabled people has been increased from $2.4m for 1981- 82 to $3.6m for 1982-83. The funding is grossly inadequate and should be increased to $10m to have any appreciable impact on the number of disabled people requiring aids and renovations to their home. Unfortunately, I have not time in this debate to deal with the inadequate provisions in this Budget for aged income security, children's services, education and housing. I hope to deal with these matters in later debates in this House. In my view it is important to expose the dishonesty and deceptiveness of the Treasurer in both the presentation and the framing of the 1982-83 Budget. It is important for Australians to realise that the Liberal-National Country Party Government is quite unscrupulous in its determination to protect the wealthy and the powerful. The recent debates in this House on ministerial responsibility show quite clearly how facts can be distorted and tax avoiders and evaders protected when the Government perceives that its financial supporters are under attack.</PARA>
<PARA> This Budget was framed for an early November election but the publication of the reports of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry with the revelations of Government neglect in failing to prevent white collar crime, bribery and corruption has torpedoed the Government's chances of winning an election. While the Budget appears to provide some benefits to low income families, it has been shown quite clearly how inflation and the continuing neglect of the health and welfare of Australian families will eat away the benefits. For seven years the Liberal-National Country Party Government has rifled the pockets of the people and now, by producing some tax concessions out of the hat, it thinks it can fool voters once again. We need a comprehensive program of policies which will generate economic activity and lead Australia back to prosperity but only the Labor Party has the will and the ability to produce a creative and well planned Budget which could achieve those aims.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the attention of the House tonight to a report I have received from one of my constituents of a visit from a person who identified himself as an immigration officer and whose mission was to crack down on illegal workers. The scene was a bike shop in Fyshwick, which is an industrial suburb in my electorate. It was last Wednesday. A man walked into the shop, stated that he was from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and said: 'I guess you blokes know why I am around'. He stated that he was looking for noggies. Noggies, I understand, is a derogatory term for Asians. He then asked how many workers were employed there and what nationality they were. When assured that all the workers were Australians he left, but not before stating that he was also looking for Dapto dogs and offered a warning for anyone who fitted that description.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was appalled by this account. There is very little sympathy in this community for illegal workers, it is true, but no one can condone the attitude or behaviour of that immigration officer. Our ethnic communities are an important and valuable part of our Australian community and no immigrant-indeed, no individual-deserves that derogatory name calling. The fact that it allegedly comes from an official from the Department casts serious doubts over the Government's guidelines for the crackdown on illegal immigrants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my view, the administrative process is not working properly. Certainly it is not working the way the vast majority of Australian people want it to. It seems to me that government administration is breaking down because of the rigid discipline of the party system and the fierce ambition for power by political leaders. That means that political expediency and point scoring override all other considerations. No thought is given to the effect on public administration. Leaders will use every opportunity to score a point or ' tip a bucket' on their opponents. Perhaps that satisfies their egos. Perhaps they think it wins them public favour or support from their followers. One thing is certain. While politicians concentrate their attention on political expediency and point scoring the administration of government will get worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that above all else the Australian people expect their governments to be good, effective and efficient administrators and also that the affairs of government will be conducted honestly and with high integrity and principles. It is about time politicians in this country started to respond to what the people want rather than what they themselves try to impose on the people. Naturally, while this point scoring battle is taking place the process of public administration is left to public servants. Knowing that their jobs are protected by permanency the public servants are not concerned about efficiency or giving service to the public but are much more concerned with promotion up the ladder. The constant losers are the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Revelations by the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the Williams Royal Commission, inquiries into the Health Department, the Australian Dairy Corporation and the meat substitution scandal, all show clear evidence of how government administration is breaking down and the effect it is having on the country. The Australian people want politicians to co-operate more on a bipartisan basis so as to improve our public administration. If a good idea is put forward by the Opposition it should be looked at objectively. Equally if there is a problem with administration all parties should be more concerned to make improvements rather than simply score political points. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that our present system is not working properly is self-evident. The system needs to be improved so that we can go forward into the twenty-first century with confidence. Our present system has a long history of tradition and hard-won experience. The good features should be retained while improving the administrative processes to take account of the modern computer age. The Parliament is made up of two Houses and both Houses have a vital role to play in both legislation and administration. Essentially, governments are made in the House of Representatives while the Senate is a House of review. That is good. Let us keep those basic features. But we can still make improvements. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate are dominated by party allegiances, so that the attitudes adopted in the Lower House will be duplicated in the Upper House. That is not good. If governments are made in the House of Representatives that House should be entirely responsible for forming the government and establishing government policy. That means that all Ministers should come from the House and no Ministers from the Senate. The Senate should be responsible to review government legislation and to keep a close eye on how efficiently and effectively those policies are working. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now look more closely at the re-structuring of both Houses. Assume firstly that all Ministers are members of the House of Representatives. We must also keep in mind the expectations that the public have for their elected members and elected governments and the demands of modern administration. The public expect that their elected member will have some impact on public administration, regardless of the member's party affiliation. The Opposition of the day must be given a more constructive role in the administrative processes. If that is not done and the governmnent of the day treats the Opposition as a bunch of fools, approximately 45 per cent of the people of Australia will always be disenfranchised. </PARA>
<PARA> The other factor that must be considered is that one man as Minister cannot possibly oversee all that is happening in his Department. I suggest therefore that the party that wins the most seats in the House of Representatives have the right to form a government and appoint Ministers. There should also be a series of committees formed that parallel the ministerial portfolios. Membership of the committees should be drawn from all parties with the Government having the majority. The committee chairman should also act as an assistant to the Minister . The role of the committees should be to assist the Minister and the Government in the development of policies and legislation. The committees could also visit the far flung areas of the country to see situations first hand, accept submissions and talk to a wide range of people with an interest in a problem. The committee should work in conjunction with the Minister, not independent of him. When Cabinet is required to make a decision--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to report to the House the breaking of 21-year drought of football premierships by the Swan Districts Football Club. Last Saturday with a fierce determination and strong team play which has become the hallmark of the Swans' game they dispatched Claremont by a margin of 18.19 (127) to 11.12 (78) after leading all the way. As a result the team's 20 players brought joy and satisfaction to their many loyal supporters in my electorate. No coach could want a better combination than Keith Narkle, Phil Narkle, Graham Melrose, Don Langsford, Peter Kenny, Ron Boucher, Allan Sidebottom, Alan Cransberg, Murray Rance, Ross Fitzgerald, Tom Mullooly, Jeff Davidson, Bill Skwirowski, Stan Nowotny, Jon Fogarty, Tony Solin, Leon Baker, Don Holmes, Michael Richardson and Bradley Shine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, on a day of team triumph there are always great individual efforts as well. Graham Melrose, captain and veteran of more than 320 league games, capped a year of great leadership by winning the Simpson Medal for best player on the ground. John Todd, coach, experienced years of hard work and disappointment as he moulded a talented team into tough final round contestants. The victory on Saturday is thus yet another mighty achievement for one of the great of Western Australian football. This year he has been a master of team psychology off the field as well as on, creating a genuine club solidarity at Bassendean. On Saturday Swans' vice-captain, Phil Narkle, played his hundredth league game in the form which made him this year's Sandover medallist. From all players there were acts of individual courage too numerous to cite in detail. One merits particular attention. Ruckman Ron Boucher played on a badly strained ankle, turned during the previous evening's training. He played in pain despite massive pain killing injections disabling enough in themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps no person deserves more praise than retiring Swans President John Cooper. John Cooper completes this year seven years of service in that position. In that time he has dragged together a club too used to defeat despite the great strengths of its membership and players. He was a key figure in the appointment of John Todd as coach. He brought to the presidency the vast experience of a player, colts coach, club secretary, treasurer and vice-president. His retirement from the presidency-a retirement he enters as a life member of the club-is regretted by the many who wish him well in it. The House may be assured that even though Saturday's result is the pinnacle of Swan's achievement over the last 21 years it will be only one peak in a mountain range of victories over the next decade and beyond. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House a most magnificent win of the Wynnum-Manly Rugby League team in my electorate in the Brisbane rugby league grand final last Sunday afternoon. After being in the Brisbane rugby league competition for some 32 years the team finally got up with a magnificent win. I sincerely extend my congratulations to the Morris brothers, Rod and Des, for the tremendous job that they did. Certainly, none of us has ever seen such a spectacular win in Brisbane from a team that came from behind early in the season and went through to the premiership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight I wish also to speak about the next great sporting event that is to happen in Brisbane just next week. That, of course, is the XII Commonwealth Games. Brisbane is ready and willing to go ahead with the staging of those Games , which certainly promise to be the most spectacular on record. Tonight I wish to put on record in this Parliament tributes to a great number of people who have worked very hard indeed in bringing the Games to fruition in Brisbane. There are many thousands of them and obviously not all can be mentioned in a speech such as this but I think special consideration should be given to the former Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Clem Jones, who was a member of the Australian Labor Party. I sincerely pay tribute to him for the tremendous vision that he had so many years ago in making those initial bids to get the Commonwealth Games into Brisbane. I wish also to pay a special tribute to the Federal Government for its tremendous financial contribution and to the Queensland State Government and the Brisbane City Council for their financial contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> Brisbane at the moment is a picture and, indeed, the Games venue sites promise to be some of the best that have ever been offered to international competition. I think that all levels of government and those people who have been involved in the staging of the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane should be sincerely congratulated for all the hard work that they have done. Literally an army of volunteer workers have been slaving their hearts out for the last two years in preparation for the Games. I think we should pay tribute not only to the people of the Commonwealth Games Foundation in Brisbane who have worked very hard but also to those volunteers who have come forward of their own volition to offer themselves for anything from being car park attendant to offering billets for international visitors, and to those of the medical profession who have offered their services free to make sure that the infrastructure and the backup services to be provided to both athletes and visitors alike will be second to none. It is a most exciting time for Brisbane. Everything is in readiness and we have tremendous facilities. Indeed, the XII Commonwealth Games that will begin at the beginning of next week promise to be the greatest Commonwealth Games ever staged . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to raise a very serious problem that has been brought to me by a constituent. It involves a lady whose daughter sought, but failed to gain, admission to a faculty of medicine at a university in New South Wales. The young lady subsequently went overseas to obtain admission to a university in Europe, where she entered the third year of a medicine course. She became pregnant. The mother approached me, trying to get this young woman a supporting mother's benefit. She was an Australian citizen, she was pregnant and she developed a heart condition which meant that she could not return to Australia. In addition the cost of the air fare was $1,800 or more. I was naturally extremely sympathetic for the plight of this young girl. I approached the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and was appalled to find no assistance at all was available to this young woman. She was a young Australian abandoned in Europe with a pregnancy and with a heart condition. Although age pensions are portable-all sorts of other pensions can be paid in Europe-this Australian citizen was totally alone, totally deserted and totally isolated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am raising this matter tonight because I really believe that if this Minister had any sympathy at all for Australians in difficulty overseas he would do whatever he possibly could to pay some sort of special benefit to an Australian in the circumstances that I have outlined to the House tonight. The Minister instead sent me a pamphlet which I was to send to this young lady with a covering letter explaining to her why she could not get any assistance and why she just had to fend for herself in Europe. If ever there was an incentive for a young woman to undertake the appalling crime of an abortion, it is this situation. We have a Government which has instituted many debates in this House on the issue of abortion, which funds abortions throughout the nation but which will give no aid whatsoever to Australian women, young girls, who happen to fall pregnant overseas. It is the inexperienced women who fall pregnant. These are people in very difficult circumstances. Instead of the sympathy and support of this Government going out to help young women overseas, it does nothing. It refuses to help. </PARA>
<PARA> One third of the constituents in my electorate were born overseas. Many Australians, many young people, travel. They go overseas for work experience, to visit families and to stay with relations. In this case this young woman has become pregnant and has obtained no help at all from this Government. Her mother has had to go to Europe at great expense to care for her and to be with her. Anyone in this country should be entitled to some form of payment when he or she is distressed, when he or she has no support at all. Here we have a government which talks about being fair and charitable and thinking of the underdog. It is a hollow sham when it comes to Australian girls who are overseas, who are in difficulty and who need help. I hope that this appalling situation obtains some publicity in the various journals in this country so that people can note that this Government, which talks a great deal about assisting Australians in difficulty, would do nothing at all to assist this young woman from my constituency who had to leave her university course and was abandoned in Europe without any assistance, without any finances. She had gone to Europe to try to obtain her medical degree and now she is a woman in great difficulty. I have been very distressed by the circumstances of this matter and I raise it tonight so that honourable members can note with concern the hypocrisy of this so-called Liberal Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) just came into the House. As a former chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety, he would be interested in the matter I am about to raise. Every day 10 people die on the roads in Australia. We all know the reasons. We have discussed and debated the issues on many occasions in this House. I have had brought to my attention the problem relating to straying animals on the roads in Australia and the protection that is given to owners of those animals, sometimes to the detriment of the motorists. On three occasions over the last three months constituents have seen me about this problem, one in real difficulty as a result of a collision with a horse on the road. He explored every possible avenue to get compensation. He has expended a heck of a lot of money, lost his car in the incident and lost his job as a result of it. I am afraid that the law protects these animals on the road and there is no protection for the motorist. I wish to quote from a letter that my constituent received from his solicitor. After lengthy discussion with his solicitor it was decided not to proceed with the case. I shall read the letter without mentioning names. It states, in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However the difficulty in suing either of these people-</PARA>
<PARA>The people who owned the horse-</PARA>
<PARA>is the fact that they have been given virtual immunity by the rule in the High Court case of SGIO v. Trigwell (1979) 26 Australian Law Reports 67. In that case a majority of the High Court decided that the owner or occupier of a property adjoining the highway is under no legal obligation to users of it so to keep and maintain his hedges, fences and gates as to prevent animals from straying onto it, and that he is not under any duty as between himself and users of it to take reasonable care to prevent any of his animals, not known to be dangerous, from straying onto it. The only exception to this rule as indicated is in circumstances where a particular animal had, to the knowledge of the owner or occupier, special vicious or mischievous propensity against which there is a duty to guard; a mere tendency to stray was not enough. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The statement of Commonwealth and State responsibilities, endorsed by the Commonwealth Government in 1967, was a codification of the broad division of responsibilities that had stood essentially unchanged since the 1950s; the arrangements were, for example, referred to in the Minister for the Interior's statement on 29 September 1959 in the House of Representatives. The broad division of responsibilities remains applicable given the recognition that State and Commonwealth counter-disaster capabilities provide the practical basis for civil defence in present and foreseeable strategic circumstances. That recognition was implicit in the establishment of the Natural Disasters Organisation in 1974 and explicit in the 1976 Defence White Paper. For the information of honourable members, the Commonwealth's responsibilities are provided in the answer to Part 3 and the State responsibilities are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA> State responsibilities are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Establishing and operating a State Civil Defence Organisation including Voluntary Civil Defence Services.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Co-ordination of State and Local Government Services and other services in Civil Defence activities.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Civil Defence planning and preparations in conjunction with the Commonwealth and other States.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Preparation of legislation required for Civil Defence purposes within areas of State jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The publication and dissemination of information, advice and instructions on Civil Defence.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Supply to the Commonwealth of scientific and technical information on Civil Defence matters resulting from investigations by State Departments or Authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Liaison and co-operation with neighbouring States or Commonwealth Territories on all Civil Defence matters of common interest.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Commonwealth responsibilities and their implementation are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. 'Provide the States with information on the strategic situation and on possible forms and scales of attack, and give national guidance on Civil Defence policy'.</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation: Major statements in recent years where the Government and the Department of Defence have given assessments of Australia's strategic situation and, in the absence of identifiable threat, provided the basis for civil defence policy are, the 1972 Australian Defence Review, the 1976 Defence White Paper, the Minister for Defence's statements in a budgetary context on 22 September 1977, 24 October 1978, and on 29 March 1979, the Prime Minister's statement of 19 February 1980 relating to Afghanistan, the Minister for Defence's statements on 25 March 1980, 26 August 1980, 5 May 1981 and 29 April 1982-the last in particular providing a global assessment. The Department has also provided, through its annual Defence Reports and through its series of capital city seminars in 1980 and 1981, substantial detail on strategic assessments and basis for planning.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. 'Organise Civil Defence in Commonwealth Territories'.</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation: The Australian Capital Territory has its own Emergency Service. The Department of Home Affairs and Environment is responsible for civil defence in Australia's island territories and in consultation with NDO has developed counter-disaster plans.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. 'Arrange such co-operation between Commonwealth and States as is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of Civil Defence planning and preparations and provide assistance in the implementation thereof as agreed with the States'.</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation: The Commonwealth arranges regular meetings with and between the State Emergency Services. It organises conferences, training and national disaster plans involving the wide range of organisations that would be concerned in an emergency. It provides financial assistance for equipment and a number of other support programs. Information on these matters appears annually in the Defence Report.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. 'Provide advanced training facilities for selected students in consultation with the States'.</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation: The Charter of the Australian Counter-Disaster College states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The role of the Australian Counter Disaster College is to contribute to the development of an efficient Australian counter-disaster capacity by training selected personnel in counter-disaster and civil defence requirements, by fostering understanding and co-operation between appropriate elements of the community, and by undertaking research into selected aspects of disaster'.</PARA>
<PARA> In meeting its aim of training those who will train others, the College conducts courses on counter-disaster planning, management, and team leadership. Special seminars held in recent years have addressed, inter alia, the problems of dealing with mass burns, port disasters, and exotic animal diseases.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. 'Provide, in consultation with the States, manuals and other documents for Civil Defence Training and the information of the public'.</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation: Counter-Disaster manuals and pamphlets made available over the years and progressively being updated, are:</PARA>
<PARA> Training Manuals</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Counter Disaster Handbook.</PARA>
<PARA> Rescue.</PARA>
<PARA> Welfare.</PARA>
<PARA> Radiological defence manual.</PARA>
<PARA> Local Headquarters.</PARA>
<PARA> Communications Handbooks, including Field Cable.</PARA>
<PARA> Public Information Pamphlets</PARA>
<PARA> Domestic Fallout Shelter Guide.</PARA>
<PARA> Survival from nuclear attack.</PARA>
<PARA> Radiation fallout on plants and animals.</PARA>
<PARA> Protective measures against radiation from fallout.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. 'Supply to the States scientific and technical information on Civil Defence matters'.</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation: The Natural Disasters Organisation provides:</PARA>
<PARA> a central library service for books and film managed by the Australian Counter Disaster College;</PARA>
<PARA> through the College, distribution of information received from Emergency Management and Civil Defence authorities overseas;</PARA>
<PARA> assistance through a fallout shelter survey which has identified some 3 million shelter spaces in capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. 'Arrange for co-operation by Commonwealth Departments and Authorities and the Armed Forces with State Civil Defence organisations'.</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation: There are no specifically and solely State Civil Defence organisations. There are State Counter Disaster and Emergency Service organisations with the function of countering natural disasters and providing a basis for civil defence, as was recognised in the Minister for Defence's statement on 27 June 1974, and in the 1976 Defence White Paper. The Natural Disasters Organisation acts as the national co-ordination agency in providing Commonwealth physical assistance including Defence Force resources to these organisations in dealing with major disasters. The Defence Force also regularly provides physical assistance to these organisations in dealing with emergency life saving situations such as search and rescue, aero medical evacuation and the supply of stores and equipment. The Defence Force assists with training support to State organisations including the provision of helicopters for familiarisation, rescue winching and personnel transport on exercises.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. 'Arrange for Interstate and Commonwealth assistance as necessary in an emergency'.</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation: Commonwealth arrangements to assist the States in emergencies have been demonstrated frequently, for example, in the 1974 Brisbane floods, in Cyclone Tracy, and in the 1976 and 1982 Tasmanian bush-fires. Plans exist for dealing with the effect of cyclones, and the impact of events such as earthquakes that may occur without warning. A national plan to deal with an outbreak of exotic animal disease has been prepared in conjunction with the Bureau of Animal Health. The National Emergency Operations Centre has been established to co-ordinate national efforts in a disaster.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. 'Prepare Commonwealth Civil Defence legislation as may be required'.</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation: State powers exist, and in some cases legislation. Commonwealth legislation is not presently seen as necessary, nor, even were a threat to occur , would any necessarily be required.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr Sinclair</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Natural Disasters Organisation's responsibility for civil defence is to support the development of a core civil defence structure in the various States and Territories by guidance and support of State/Territory Emergency Service organisations. Civil defence capabilities and planning appropriate to Australia' s strategic circumstances are being developed in close liaison with State/ Territory authorities responsible for counter disaster and civil defence planning and operations. NDO provides a range of physical and financial support programs to States/Territories to assist with the development of their respective counter disaster and core civil defence capabilities. NDO has provided State/Territory authorities with technical information to assist them in the identification of suitable public fallout shelter accommodation in major population centres. The Organisation also provides public information material on nuclear protection appropriate to the Australian situation, through the State /Territory Emergency Services.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government's assessment, which has been provided to the public over the past decade is that there is a very low likelihood of any hostilities on Australian territory and that nuclear war, and hence nuclear attack upon Australia, is also unlikely. If nuclear war between the superpowers were to occur it could not be discounted that Australia, along with a lot of other countries might become a target. Government policy thus continues to be directed towards helping to ensure that global war is deterred. The contingencies that are emphasised in defence planning are those involving low level harassment and small scale raids. While these are not considered likely to occur they are less improbable than a major assault without prior warning.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) to (5) I refer the honourable member to my answer to Question No. 4686, in which I provided details on the broad responsibilities for civil defence accepted over the past 20 years by State and Commonwealth Governments. In view of the Commonwealth's assessment that the threat of any attack against Australia is low, the judgement on whether resources should be committed now to the steps referred to in the honourable member's question would properly lie within the responsibilities of the relevant State or Territory Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) On 16 June I announced that the Government would contribute $250,000 to a national appeal to assist families of British servicemen who suffered in the Falkland Islands dispute and Falkland Islanders placed in severe hardship as a result of the dispute. The appeal was organised by the RSL to which the Government made its contribution on 20 August 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government already provides assistance to veterans through a Repatriation system which includes comprehensive pensions and medical treatment. In addition, the Government provides special counselling and treatment for Vietnam veterans. In the current financial year it is expected that payments in pensions, benefits and allowances to Vietnam veterans will amount to over $7.5m. This sum does not include expenditure on hospital and medical treatment (over $1 .5m), on counselling services, or on the program of studies into the effects of service in Vietnam.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Security of Australian Service personnel in Uganda is the responsibility of the Commander, Commonwealth Military Training Team Uganda (a British Army Colonel) and the Ugandan Army.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member may rest assured that the security situation in Uganda is under constant review by the Government which has available continuing reports from both the team itself and our High Commissioner to Uganda who is resident in Nairobi. The Australian commander has orders that in an emergency he may order such withdrawals of Australian personnel as he sees fit, consulting as practicable with the Commander CMTTU and the Australian High Commissioner. If Government considers the security situation at any time to be unacceptable, then the Government will of course very quickly review our commitment.</PARA>
