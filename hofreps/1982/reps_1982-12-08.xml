<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Commonwealth Government called yesterday's special Premiers Conference to achieve concerted action by all governments in Australia to address the deteriorating employment situation. The Commonwealth put to the Premiers and the Chief Minister a set of proposals around which it hoped to achieve agreement, the central thrust of which was to put in place the widest and most effective pause possible in wages for the next twelve months throughout the Australian economy, as a means of saving jobs. Full agreement was not reached on the proposals put by the Commonwealth. That fact, however, should not obscure the great measure of agreement which was achieved, and its significance. The Conference produced an unprecedented agreement among eight governments to effect a pause in wages in the public sector and through concerted action before tribunals and by other means to achieve a similar pause in the private sector. I shall enumerate the points of agreement in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth was seeking agreement on a twelve months pause in wages. The Premiers of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory will be fully supporting the Commonwealth Government in this respect. The Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia will be seeking a six months pause in wages. I do not rule out that, depending on the state of the Australian economy during the next year, the Premiers of the latter three States may well extend the action that they are taking to twelve months. That is for the future, however. What must not be overlooked is that all eight governments have agreed on effective action to secure a pause in wages throughout the economy of at least six months duration. That is the unprecedented central aspect of the agreement reached yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the governments represented at the meeting here in Canberra yesterday reached such an historic agreement is a reflection of the seriousness of the economic situation we are now facing. I think we have all been surprised at the suddenness with which the international recession finally impacted on Australia. It may have been late in coming to Australia, but there is no doubting now that our domestic economic performance is being affected by reduced demand for our exports, rock-bottom commodity prices which not only are affecting the profitability of our resources sector but also have contributed to the drying up of new resource investment plans, and increased import competition as overseas suppliers search for market opportunities wherever they can find them. All of this, of course, is being exacerbated by the worst drought in memory. In those circumstances it will become increasingly a matter of absolute survival for our business communities to maintain and improve their competitive position. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, as we all know only too well, domestic wage developments have been working in the opposite direction. Over the year to the September quarter average weekly ordinary time earnings rose by about 17 per cent, and this does not take into account reductions in standard hours. Real wages rose by about 5 per cent, while productivity was virtually unchanged. With domestic demand weak, the world economy in recession and an increasingly difficult world trading environment, many Australian businesses have not been able to pass on these increases in wage costs. As a result, profits have fallen by about 13 per cent over the last year and retrenchments have multiplied. In short, excessive wage increases have worsened our economic problems, weakened our competitiveness, contributed directly to unemployment and weakened demand. They have meant an increase in the real incomes of those in employment, while their less fortunate fellows have lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> It was against that background that all those present at the Conference yesterday approached the discussions in a constructive and co-operative spirit. Each had his own perspective on the problems, but each was seeking constructively to find a consensus on urgent and effective measures to deal with the worsening employment situation. Specifically, this is what was agreed:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government will legislate for a 12-months pause in wages and in reductions in standard working hours in its own employment. There should be no catch-up at the end of the wages pause to recoup wages which might have been forgone in the course of the pause. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland, Western Australian, Tasmanian and Northern Territory governments will effect a similar 12-months pause in wages and in reductions in standard working hours in their own employment, by legislation as necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian governments will effect a six-months pause in wages and in reductions in standard working hours in their own employment. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve the widest and most effective pause in wages throughout the private sector, the Commonwealth, Queensland, Western Australian, Northern Territory and Tasmanian governments will approach the arbitral tribunals seeking a 12-months pause in award wages and in standard working hours in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian governments are expected to intervene alongside the other five governments by supporting a six-months pause. The Commonwealth Government will be seeking the support of the peak councils for a 12-months pause in wages. The Government will be meeting the Confederation of Australian Industry later today and has sought an urgent meeting with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The wages pause is to take effect as soon as possible, with exceptions restricted to the processing of applications for those few groups not yet in receipt of a wage increase in the most recent community wage round. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation to give effect to the wages pause will be introduced as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Resumption of wage increases after the end of the pause would depend on restoration of capacity to pay, which would be determined by appropriate Commonwealth and State tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> All governments will urge a pause in over-award payments. </PARA>
<PARA> Professional incomes funded from the Commonwealth Budget will be included in the pause by legislation where necessary. The States are expected to take similar action, where professional incomes are funded from their Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> All governments will seek commitments from professional bodies for a pause in professional fees. </PARA>
<PARA> All governments will urge maximum restraint in other non-wage incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to all legislation to effect the wages pause and achieve the necessary savings being passed, the savings to the Commonwealth Budget achieved through the wages pause, expected to be some $300m, would be expended on employment- related projects of the Commonwealth's nomination throughout Australia, projects of high labour content and high Australian content, capable of being implemented quickly. Special consideration will be given to projects in areas of high unemployment within States. The Commonwealth will be consulting with all the States and the Northern Territory to identify such projects. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that State governments participate in the wages pause there would be some savings to their Budgets which they might use in similar activities. Alternatively, they would be relieved of the need to increase taxes or charges or to reduce services. </PARA>
<PARA> Semi-government and local authorities are to use their savings from a wages pause in additional employment-related activities or, as appropriate, to defer increases in charges or reduce borrowings. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government will be taking a range of other measures to help Australian businesses to weather the present economic difficulties, and to maintain their employment. These measures include a Buy Australian campaign, reintroduction of preference for Australian goods in Government purchasing, together with increased availability of finance through the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Australian Industry Development Corporation and acceleration of payments to businesses under various existing assistance schemes . We are also acting to ensure that Australian businesses have effective recourse to anti-dumping action against unfairly priced imports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also considered the proposals being advanced to divert some of the funds spent on unemployment benefits to enable the unemployed to work on projects of value to local communities. Apart from questions of cost and effectiveness, such proposals may simply replace jobs. They therefore require careful consideration. Because of the seriousness of the unemployment problem, the Commonwealth has indicated to the Premiers that it will introduce a community projects program for a trial period of 12 months. Letters will be sent to State governments shortly, outlining specific guidelines for the trial and inviting their nomination of projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth would provide grants through the States for local bodies to undertake specific additional projects using part time labour recruited from the longer term unemployed. These grants would cover employment at casual award rates for a period necessary to earn an equivalent of benefit plus $35 a week. Each project could run for up to 12 months and employ up to 50 people. As a guide the Commonwealth would be willing to provide funds equal to the benefit rates involved plus an amount of $2m to cover the $35 a week supplement. This would enable trial projects involving about 1,000 people. The Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, will elaborate on this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures I have just outlined constitute a vigorous response to the serious employment problems facing the Australian community. They are not a total cure and we still have a difficult job ahead of us. But the unprecedented nature of the agreement struck among the eight governments represented at yesterday's meeting shows how seriously the problems are viewed by governments. The mood among ordinary Australians throughout the community is equally realistic. There is a strong sense throughout the country that those who have jobs should now make some sacrifice to help their fellows who do not have jobs or whose jobs are at risk. It is now up to all of us to join in this consensus and give our strongest support to making the program work. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Oxley-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Opposition welcomes a statement on this topic from the Government. One must confess that last night it seemed that nothing but confusion prevailed in all quarters involved in discussions on this matter. Even within the Cabinet there seemed to be conflict and confusion as to exactly what the Government was intending with its proposed wages freeze. One was not helped a great deal this morning by the newspaper coverage of the conclusions from the Premiers Conference of yesterday. Therefore , we welcome some sort of statement on this matter from the Government. I must say, however, that many issues are raised in the statement which need much further fleshing out before we will be clear on exactly what is involved. In those circumstances the Opposition does not find itself in a position in which it can respond in a definitive way to this proposal. Accordingly, it prefers to reserve its response in detail until the debate which will follow the introduction of the legislation which relates to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, one can say some things immediately about this proposal. I believe that the first thing I should say on behalf of the Opposition is that we reaffirm our objection in principle to the proposition that a wages freeze is a solution to the economic problems of this country. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, it is unfair. If one considers the proposal that the Government has presented to the Parliament-indeed, to the nation-one notices that there is exclusive concentration on the wages sector of the economy but absolutely no attention at all given to the prices sector. I do not believe that introducing a prices freeze concurrently would work either. It did not work in 1977 when the Government tried it. It would not work now. But we acknowledge that moderation on both prices and incomes is essential. However, there is a different way to approach this matter and I will come to that in a few minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the rampant unfairness of a proposal which concentrates exclusively on wages and ignores prices. I also draw attention to that part of the statement of the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) where he refers to non-wage income. His proposal is to urge restraint. The point about the non-wage income sector of the economy is that this is where all the rip-offs have been going on, where all the tax-free speculative gains have been plundered and where all the tax avoidance and evasion has been taking place. Therein lies the genesis of much of the resentment in the community today by ordinary decent Australian households. They see a small, influential, privileged and very wealthy sector of the community getting more influential, more privileged and more wealthy by evading its responsibilities and they see little done. Wage earners are excluded from this; their families and households are denied this sort of opportunity. One would presume that they would not want it; they would want a more morally obliged society, fulfilling its commitments. But they see the unfairness of these double standards. Today the Acting Prime Minister in the Parliament has rubbed salt into the wounds, proposing fierce draconian restraints on the living standards of ordinary Australian households by legislative action but urging restraint on a section of the economy which has been a haven to some people who have been quite outrageous in their moral irresponsibility and in avoiding their commitments to this society. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to professional incomes the Acting Prime Minister said that the Government will seek commitments from those people who, very largely, are able to set their fees. It is nonsense to project market force theory on the fixing of prices for goods and services into the professional arena, especially in relation to medical services. These people are able to adjust their rates according to the volume of the market they have. If their market goes down because there are more doctors their prices go up, and it completely confutes the principles of market force economics. All the Government proposes here-this is in line with all the co-operation that is extended from the States-is to seek commitments. I do not think many people in the community believe that there will be wholesale or even large scale commitment to restraint in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> What about speculative gains? There is absolutely no attention to this matter. They remain tax free, denying people the benefits that should be coming back through proper revenue processes being fed into the system to provide better services and, most of all, more job opportunities in the community. It is little wonder that out there in the community there is a cynicism about the whole process of government because these double standards prevail. An influential and privileged few are able to rip off uninhibitedly, while for the vast mass of ordinary Australian households there is nothing but prohibition, embargo and obstruction. Let me cite some of the figures. If the Government is concerned about the movement in wages, as the Opposition is-I will come to that in a minute; there is no denying it-it must realise that wages have two functions to fulfil in the economy. One provides a living standard for families and the other a price input for employers, manufacturers and the suppliers of goods and services. We have to weigh up these two influences provided by wages in the economy. The Opposition is concerned at movements in wages in recent times. I repeat that I will come to that. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment I want to stick to the unfairness of what the Government is doing . Certainly, wages and salaries increased by more than 16 per cent in the 12 months to the September quarter this year, but non-wage income increased by well over 17 per cent. If the Government is worried about wage movement why is it not worried about non-wage movement? Why is it not doing something effective there? Rather vaguely the Government refers to taking steps to control incomes of professional people where those incomes are provided for in some unspecified way through Budget mechanisms. That is one of the reasons we want to see the legislation. What does it portray in practice? Will it mean that members of the medical profession in this country, who this year will get more than $1,000m in medical benefits from Australian taxpayers, will, by some magical process, have salary or income restraints imposed on them? If so, what are the specifics of this measure? What steps do the States undertake to ensure that that is done, because my understanding is that the Federal Government cannot effectively do so under the Constitution. Can anyone here contemplate, even for the novelty value, for more than a minute that the Premier of Queensland would move in that direction? That is just one example. </PARA>
<PARA> Chemists will receive more than $520m this year through pharmaceutical benefits . What sorts of controls is the Government proposing there? I am not recommending any there or anywhere else at this point. I am merely raising questions to illustrate how totally deficient and unsatisfactory this statement is in terms of allowing a more considered debate to proceed at this point in relation to the wages freeze proposal. What about income from commissions and from money lending? With interest rates high, many people at present are making quite hefty incomes through money lending as individual entrepreneurs, apart from organisations. What about self-employed contractors and sub-contractors entering this area to get into the black economy, in many cases? What this will do, in fact, is guarantee an explosion in the black economy. The Government will have no control over that. Already $15,000m a year of income liable to tax remains tax free because it is in the black economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also unfair because it is regressive. This I find the most disquieting aspect of the proposal. There is, through its effect, an invisible tax to be applied to income earners. It is regressive in its impact. Let me illustrate that. What will happen over the 12-month period that the Government is proposing is that, because inflation will go up effectively by about 10 per cent, real wages in their purchasing power will come down by about 10 per cent. In money terms that has the same effect as an increase in income tax-a rather fierce fiscal measure designed to contract the economy. When one takes that sort of income and spending power out of the economy, one contracts consumer activity, reduces economic activity and aggravates the recession that we have. There will be more unemployment. That is the effect. It is an invisible tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the regressiveness, the unfairness, of this proposal. Someone who is on 75 per cent of average weekly earnings-that is, $240 or $250 a week, a very modest amount of income-will, in fact, through this measure if it is fully effective, experience an increase in his or her income tax-this sort of conceptual form of invisible income tax that I am putting forward-of 52 per cent . But someone on three times average weekly earnings-that is, nearly $1,000 a week-will face an increase of only 24 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I illustrate the unfairness of this proposal with these examples. The fettler out on the Nullarbor Plain working for the Australian National Railways is expected proportionately to make a greater sacrifice through this system, to pay for whatever exercise the Government is keen to embark on, than the chief design engineer or someone of that ilk who has all of the pleasantries of working in an air conditioned office and having much more stimulating, uplifting and creative work in the same organisation. It means that the nurse working in the Tasmanian hospital on a similarly low income will have to make a greater sacrifice for what the Government has in mind than the head of the Department of Health responsible for the administration of the health services. The postman doing the rounds in the suburbs, in all of the inclement weather that he experiences, will make a greater proportional sacrifice than the people who are running Australia Post. In Telecom Australia, the linesman will have to make a greater sacrifice than the chief executives in the organisation. That is grossly unfair. It is a blatant abuse of the innocence of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> I point to those examples and ask honourable members in this Parliament, who have all the privileges that parliamentarians have and the very generous salaries that parliamentarians have, to stop for a second to consider the situation of not just ordinary workers but the families they support on that sort of modest income. I ask honourable members to contemplate all of the liabilities that they have, the cost of which will continue to grow as their incomes shrink in real terms. I find that situation outrageous in its discrimination. It is a clear reflection of class prejudice on the part of the Government. I ask again: What does the Government expect to achieve in terms of an impact on inflation when it freezes public sector wage increases, for example , for a Fourth Division clerk in the Department of Social Security? His wage increases do not feed in any apparent way into the consumer price index. We have no quantification of the level to which inflation will be reduced as a consequence of these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> I state now that I am absolutely convinced that the Government has not thought its way through this proposal properly. That is why there was still conflict between Ministers, to the embarrassment of Premiers at the Premiers Conference, as to what the Government was trying to achieve. I say that the plan will not work. The Government is fortunate that the public is prepared to give it a try. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention the poll in this morning's Bulletin. To the extent that they are a reliable reflection, I do not recommend them all. I must say that some of the polls have been very good lately-in the Bulletin. Let me make this point. If one looks at that poll in relation to the Government's proposal, one finds that 52 per cent of the public is prepared to approve a 12-month freeze. In a rather superficial way, the poll shows in a perplexing way that the public however overwhelmingly does not believe-that is, 57 per cent-that it will have any effect in reducing unemployment. A much greater proportion does not believe that it will reduce inflation than believe it will. I think there is only one way to interpret that finding, that is, that the Australian public has put the Government on notice. The public is prepared to give the proposal a try because it is desperate as a result of the mess the economy is in. But the public is making it pretty clear to the Government that it has doubts as to whether the proposal will work, and the Government had better make sure that it does. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the Sydney Morning Herald had to say about this proposal, in case honourable members are uncharitable enough to think that it is merely a political point of view that is being put here. What I am putting forward is a carefully, technically assessed view of the deficiencies of this proposal. Today 's Sydney Morning Herald states:</PARA>
<PARA> If any further proof was needed that the wage freeze is more about politics than economics-more about appearance than reality-now we have it . . . What started as gimmickry has now become farce. </PARA>
<PARA>The newspaper goes on to point out the very serious deficiencies in this proposal. I remind honourable members that it is similar to the proposal which was tried in 1977 and jettisoned. It is, as we see it, in all its elements a stunt. Because of the economic conditions of the moment the rate of increase in wages is going down. It has been going down for several quarters. The proposal is an empty gesture for the east coast States. Neither New South Wales and Victoria nor Queensland would be contemplating any noticeable wage adjustment settlements in the course of the next six months. It is all over for New South Wales and Victoria in that respect. On Monday Queensland made sure that it did not get caught in the trap. An Industrial Court decision there provided for a 5. 9 per cent increase in State awards. The Premier of that State declared this morning that, although he has committed himself to a 12-month freeze, at the end of six months he will review his position. Whatever way we look at the proposition, it seems to be on somewhat shaky foundations. In that sense we find ourselves unable to explore confidently and assert thereafter what our position is in relation to the proposition until we see the legislation before the House.</PARA>
<PARA> The Premiers, in their various ways, do not seem to reflect the enthusiasm of the Government. The Premier of Victoria described the proposal as a dog's breakfast. It was something entered into because of the stand and deliver tactics of the Government. No other options were provided. The Premier of New South Wales likened it to trying to treat a cancer patient with aspirin. The Premier of South Australia went away and said that he had agreed to nothing as far as he was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Another deficiency in this arrangement is that, although it is aimed at freezing award rates, it does nothing effectively about over-award rates. Therein lies another cause of concern for us. Although the Government says that it will urge restraint in that area, this will mean very simply that where those industrial organisations which represent people in particular industries have clout they will be able to extract wage increases while others will miss out. The inevitable consequence of that will be a redistribution and reallocation of the proportions of wages within the total wage sector between groups which draw on that sector. It will mean that those less well off will find over time a diversion of real spending power from them to the more powerful groups within the economy. As one deeply committed to equity in our system, acknowledging nonetheless the case for differentials on the basis of skill, nature of work and so on, I find this a very unattractive proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the elements of what the Government finally says it is trying to pull together in all this. It reckons it will create 10,000 jobs in the course of a year. In that year unemployment will be between 550,000 and 600,000 at its peak. To what extent will the Government assert now, with conviction if it has so much commitment to this policy, that unemployment will be reduced by these proposals? Ten thousand is a piddling number in terms of the level of unemployment and the collapse in the economy which is currently under way. The amount the Government is talking of allocating to the States through the processes which will be related to this policy is $300m. It says the total savings on the wages bill of State and Federal instrumentalities, semi- government authorities and so on, will be $700m. Let us focus on that $700m. There will be lost revenue because that will not be provided in wages. That $ 700m represents a loss of $250m to the Commonwealth Government in tax revenue. The Government will provide $300m for jobs. There will be a net addition to the economy of only $50m as a consequence of this proposal. That, I believe, exposes the hollowness, in economic terms, of what the Government is proposing to do. When one contrasts the sorts of jobs which would have been in existence, sustained by spending from a public sector wage package before this proposal, against the jobs which will be destroyed by this change-the jobs which will be created-my hunch is that there will be very little net effect. If there is any net effect it will be marginal. I suspect that there will be none at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge the Government to provide us with the calculations to establish beyond any doubt that there are substantial benefits for the community, so substantial that in terms of the jobs they generate in addition to those existing at the moment they will help to overcome unemployment and generate economic growth so that the policy itself in quantifiable terms will bring down inflation and overall the economy will be in a better condition and avoid the contraction which would otherwise take place with this sort of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I have mentioned that we acknowledge that there is a case for wage moderation. It would be useless to deny it. The case for wage moderation is unassailable. We have been saying that regularly. In 1982-83 profits in national accounts terms fell to 12 per cent of national product. According to the Department of the Treasury in a more normal situation they should be 17 per cent . Wages had gone up to 67.6 per cent as against a more normal situation of 63 per cent. There are several things to be said about that. Some of that contraction of profits, of course, can be accounted for due to the contractionary state of the economy, but not all of it. Not all the movement in wages can be explained in that sense either. It is quite clear that in the last two years there has been a quite marked real increase in wages allowing for productivity as well as the cost of living. It would be foolish to try to deny that this has had a destabilising effect on the economy. It would stand in the way of sensible and more successful economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> I ought to put on the record parenthetically, before I move on, that many enterprises in this country are enjoying extraordinary levels of profitability. In the debate that will follow I will be enumerating scores of them. These rates of profitability must almost be records. In that sense we see again the glaring unfairness of the policies of the Government. In that sense there should be in place policies in relation to wage moderation which are also related to prices, profits, non-wage incomes and people who are living off speculative gains tax free. These policies should refer to the social wage and a range of related matters. They certainly should refer to reform in the income tax system. They should preside over or monitor movements in these various sectors of the economy so that they are held in restraint within guidelines which have been agreed upon through a system of consensual collaboration. No prices and incomes policy will work in any other way. These are matters to which we want to relate in more detail in the debate on the legislation when it comes to the Parliament next week. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make on this matter is simply this: Wages freezes and prices freezes have not worked elsewhere. They failed in this country in 1977. They are in their nature more a stunt than anything else. They will not be a resolution of the major economic problems confronting this country. The worst aspect of them is that the community will be encouraged to expect much more than will be achieved if indeed anything is to be achieved. When they fail to achieve those grand goals which have been outlined the community will be very seriously disaffected, disabused and angry because of it. More than that, these sorts of things make no provision for moderating the movements in those various sectors of the economy I mentioned a few minutes ago in the event of economic recovery. In the last seven years, on each occasion when government policies have generated additional economic growth, this country has seen with a lagged effect an upsurge in wage demand. </PARA>
<PARA> Assuming that the Government were to be successful with this sort of policy in some sort of way-I have made clear my views on that-there would be a period at the end of it when there would be an explosion in demand for wages. So the whole policy would be self-defeating. It would mean that real economic recovery of the sort that we must work for to bring down unemployment and get the economy moving again would be unachievable as the present Government's approach now stands. In those circumstances we argue-we will be arguing in more detail next week when the debate takes place in Parliament-that the more appropriate measure in this country at the present time is a prices and incomes policy embodying a comprehensive series of proposals which is seen to be fair, which has consensual support in the community and which will successfully regulate and moderate the various forces at work in the economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to his reported admission yesterday that the Budget deficit this year is likely to be about $4000m, or some $2300m more than estimated at Budget time. Will the Treasurer inform the House what components of the Budget are responsible for the deficit blowout to this all-time record high level? Can the Tresurer assure the House that this latest revision to the deficit forecast will be his final figure, or does he envisage the possibility that the deficit will blow out even further than he has so far admitted? Finally , what increase in the deficit would occur as the result of an effective freeze on wages? Has that increase been taken into account in the $4 billion deficit estimate?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3065" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BENNELONG" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did say at the Premiers Conference yesterday that the deficit figure for this financial year could approach $4,000m. I am able to inform the honourable gentleman that the current estimate from the Treasury and the Department of Finance of the Budget deficit for this financial year is about $3, 750m. That is made up of an estimated increase in outlays of $1,343m over the Budget estimate and lower receipts to the tune of about $708m. I can oblige the honourable gentleman by giving him the main elements. Unemployment benefits are estimated at this stage to add $603m to the Budget forecast. That represents an increase in forecast unemployment beneficiaries from 395,000 to 525,000. As I have explained earlier, that is significantly due to there being a larger component of beneficiaries. Drought assistance is estimated at this stage to be $356m. Natural disaster relief is estimated at $52m extra, and that represents a further response to approaches from the States as a result of the drought. It is also estimated at this stage that there will be an additional $93m to cover public debt charges because it is necessary to finance through the sale of additional government securities, which is the non-inflationary way of financing the deficit. It is therefore necessary to sell more government bonds. They are the major elements of the outlays side of the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is anticipated that gross pay-as-you-earn collections will be about $323m less than estimated at the time of the Budget. We have already revised downwards from 12 per cent to 11 1/2 per cent the average weekly earnings estimate contained in the Budget. If the pause is fully effective it is my advice from Treasury that there will be a further reduction to about 10 1/2 per cent in the AWE outcome for 1982-83. We have already chalked up, through increases in the pipeline, about 8 per cent or 9 per cent of the AWE forecast contained in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> Employment is now anticipated to decline by about one per cent rather than the constant estimate made at the time of the Budget. As to personal tax collections in the provisional area, largely due to the drought, we anticipate a larger number of farmers than expected will self assess and this will result in a further $123m decrease. It is anticipated that collections under the recoupment legislation will be in the order of $100m this year although that figure is subject to more than the usual margin of difficulty. Because of the atypical nature of the legislation that figure may prove to be on the pessimistic side. Because of the generally lower level of economic activity than we forecast at the time of the Budget there are effects in the indirect tax area. Because of reduced consumer purchases sales tax is expected to be down by $84m, excise duties down by about $170m and customs duty on imports down by about $100m. On the other side it is anticipated that collections from the crude oil levy will be about $240m greater than the collections forecast at the time of the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> I say to the honourable gentleman that if $4,000m were the outcome, that would represent about 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Therefore the honourable gentleman is not correct in describing the figure as an all-time high. In 1975- 76 the deficit represented 4.9 per cent of gross domestic product. I want to say to the House that I draw no comfort from that particular comparison. As far as I and the Government are concerned the fact that our fiscal position is now weaker than anticipated at the time of the Budget, because of the prolonged effect of the drought and because of a much weaker economy due almost entirely to the effect of the overseas recession, it will be necessary for us to place a much greater weight on monetary policy and it will be necessary to sell more government securities in order to finance that deficit. As a consequence monetary policy will need to carry a much greater weight than previously expected. That underlines the real value, in economic terms, of the pause that was obtained yesterday.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to remarks attributed to the American Treasury Secretary Mr Regan reportedly calling for a new international economic conference similar to the one held at Bretton Woods towards the end of World War II. I have had some inquiries made about the comments and it would appear that the reports are a little overblown against the comments that were actually made by Mr Regan. He indicated that he would want to talk to the finance Ministers of the major industrial countries about this issue. He criticised some of what he described as the ad hoc financing practices that had gone on in recent months, although he also said in responding to a question that he did not believe that the world was yet ready for a new conference of that kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to the honourable gentleman that, of course, if any conferences of that kind were convened, naturally Australia would be interested in participating and contributing. I take the opportunity of saying that those who imagine that the world's economic problems-certainly the world's monetary management problems-can be solved by large international economic conferences and that in some way those large economic conferences are an alternative to sound domestic economic policies will in the end be proved wrong. Ultimately the strength, in an international monetary sense, of the world economy can be achieved only through the total effect of strong domestic economies. That would generally be our approach at those meetings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health will be aware of the strong opposition of chemists to the new statutory declaration requirement for concessional pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3068" SPEAKER="Carlton The Hon J.J." NAMEID="DF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="MACKELLAR" MINISTERIAL="HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I advised the House in answer to a question a few weeks ago that with the introduction of the new three-tier pharmaceutical benefits scheme I was taking the opportunity to tighten up a very loose administrative system in line with my general concern about protecting the taxpayers' dollar. That scheme gives additional benefit to over one million Australians on low incomes or in receipt of sickness benefits and to elderly people who have pensions but who do not have pensioner health benefit cards. Instead of the prescriber-that is, the doctor-writing a number on the prescription form, it will be necessary for the person claiming the benefit to write the number from his or her pension card, or whichever card it is, on the back of the prescription form. It is not a requirement of the chemist. The chemist does not take the legal responsibility for this although, of course, if the form is not properly completed the benefit is not payable from taxpayers' funds. It does not have to happen with all prescriptions, of course. It happens only with those prescriptions where there is a special benefit of $4 to a pensioner with a PHB card or $2 to a holder of a health care card, a sickness beneficiary, or as I said earlier, a pensioner without a PHB card.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The actual form to be introduced on 1 January is to my mind rather too complicated. I have agreed with the chemists that it looks too complicated. I am trying to find a better form consistent with advice from the Attorney-General's Department that the declaration is legally binding on the claimant. I think that is an important requirement. I have written to every registered pharmacist in Australia explaining what I am doing and explaining my concern about the complicated nature of the form. I have asked my Department, in conjunction with form design experts-I am picking out ones to whom officers of the Department can talk-together with representatives of the Attorney-General's Department, to work out a much simpler form and to have the proposals with me this week so that I can go back to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia with those proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make two things quite clear. One is that there is no going back on the requirement for the declaration by the recipient. That is something that I cannot go back on. I am under very strong pressure from this House to tighten up on the systems in a number of areas of government benefits-in the medical area and elsewhere. I agree with the general consensus of this House that these systems are too loose. Bit by bit I am going to tighten them up. It is just unfortunate that the chemists have to be involved in the first bit of that tightening up. I am asking the chemists to bear with me on this. I am not going back on that requirement. Secondly, I am very concerned indeed about attempts by certain people to frighten pensioners over this whole matter. A statement put out by Senator Grimes attempted to do this and some pharmacists-not the guild- are trying to frighten pensioners on this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague the Minister for Transport and Construction is extremely concerned-I and the rest of the Government share his concern-about the apparent breach of faith by the unions concerned. The Australian National Line in fact took action in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to have the main classification in dispute in the demarcation removed from the coverage of the Merchant Service Guild of Australia-the seagoing shipwrights classification. That has resulted, I am informed, in a lifting of those bans and in the River Boyne actually sailing back to Gladstone, I hope to return to its normal bauxite carrying duties. The President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has called a meeting on the demarcation dispute for Friday of this week. The Government believes, as does the ACTU, that is the best way in which the matter ought to be resolved. If it is not resolved by the ACTU on Friday the Minister for Transport and Construction and I will have a further discussion and give further advice to ANL regarding the proceedings on which it has embarked and other options open to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since Michael Friedrich arrived in Australia some months ago he has made several attempts to change his status from visitor to resident. When he arrived as a visitor he signed, along with all other visitors, an undertaking that he would not seek to settle in this country-that is, he would not seek to change his status from visitor to resident, he would not work and also he would not undertake study. As I have said, since his arrival he has made several attempts to change his status. Subsequently, he applied for refugee status. In the normal course of events his application was referred to the Committee on the Determination of Refugee Status, to which the honourable member for Wentworth has referred. For the benefit of honourable members I advise the House that that Committee draws representatives from my Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Attorney-General's Department. Also, of course, it has as an advisory member from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. He is a non-voting advisory member. I wish to advise the House that the DORS Committee has considered and rejected Mr Friedrich's application for refugee status. The Committee is a recommendatory body and I have accepted that recommendation. I am not aware of the up to date position in relation to Mr Friedrich's case. However , I understand that he may have initiated some action through the courts. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Health, relates to the declaration which pharmaceutical beneficiaries will be required to complete on the back of a prescription form. I preface the question by reference to the fact that that declaration will involve either the beneficiary or the agent of the beneficiary making two responses to four separate questions and also making declarations concerning the period of the validity of the concessional arrangement which relates to them. They will also be required to make declarations concerning the actual number of the concession form. On the bottom of that declaration it is stated quite specificially that incorrect or misleading statements can cause the person making that declaration to be subjected to a $1,000 fine and/or six months in prison. It is also apparent that only children under the age of 12 years could not act as an agent for the beneficiary in the making of that declaration. In the light of that I ask the Minister for Health whether pensioners and disadvantaged people have any cause to be concerned about the possible application of those penalties. Is it anticipated that any children between the ages of, say, 12 and 18 years who may act as an agent for a beneficiary and complete the form but make mistakes in its completion are likely to be subject to a fine of $1,000 and/or six months in prison?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would be very concerned if some of the dire outcomes of mistakes of the kind mentioned by the honourable member for Hunter were to eventuate. I will certainly check out with advisers from the Attorney-General's Department in what respect this declaration might differ from declarations made in all forms of government benefit, of which the honourable member would be aware there are many. As far as I know, there is no specific legal provision distinguishing this declaration from declarations for a whole range of other benefits but I will certainly have that aspect checked out and will advise the honourable member.

I am double checking the advice from the Attorney-General's Department because, unlike honourable members opposite, I do not believe that an extension of government intervention is always a good thing, but I do believe that, where the Government does intervene on behalf of beneficiaries, there is a need to protect the taxpayers' dollar. All I can say is that as I examine a number of these procedures, many of which go back to the period in which honourable members opposite were in government, I find some very loose systems that I believe ought to be tightened up.

I am not aware of the circumstances that led to the result. In fact, I am at a loss to understand why the New South Wales Government was not able to find some way of giving assistance to her. The Federal Government has examined the facts and circumstances surrounding this matter and has given serious consideration to a request from Mrs Mackay that some assistance should be given to her for the purpose of those inquest proceedings. The Government has decided that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to make an ex gratia payment to enable her to have proper representation before the inquest. We believe that this decision is right. We believe it is certainly a humane gesture and that, considering all the circumstances, it is a very significant contribution by the Federal Government to ascertaining the facts surrounding the disappearance of Mr Mackay.

If the honourable gentleman is referring to that, I say to the honourable gentleman and to the House that the Government has not been involved in any way in taxation by stealth.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this case I am not waiting for another Public Accounts Committee inquiry to tell me the extent of the fraud in this area. I am merely looking at the actual systems themselves. When I find that nobody is held responsible for a claim there is a prima facie case that people are able to indulge in fraud. That is one of the loose parts of the system I intend to tighten up. Let me explain to the House, as I explained the other day, that at present the doctor, the prescriber, is asked-he is not required to do so-to write the pension number on the prescription form. There is no legal or constitutional power on the part of the Commonwealth to require a doctor to write down that number. But we can require the person who is the beneficiary, that is the person who receives the $ 2 or $4 benefit, to sign the form. As I said earlier, I am trying to make that requirement as simple as I can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to understand that pensioners in the ordinary course of events give proof of entitlement day in and day out for all sorts of things. They do not always have to sign a form. Sometimes it is a matter of showing a pension card when getting on a bus, or for having cheaper entry to a picture theatre, or when getting a perm in a private hairdresser's establishment or in other areas. There are various ways and means in which pensioners indicate entitlement for a benefit. I think people are exaggerating in advance of the event what difficulties might be encountered in this matter. Not all pensioners are in a state of great infirmity. Many health care beneficiaries and various other people-in fact three million Australians-come under these kinds of provisions. All I am asking is that they sign something to show that they are entitled to an additional benefit of $2 or $4 every time they receive it. The total cost of pharmaceutical benefits is about $470m, about half of which is made up of concessional benefits. I do not have to sit around and wait for a Public Accounts Committee inquiry into fraud in pharmaceutical benefits before I take steps to tighten up the system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I feel that that is part of what I am doing, I will have to bow to your wisdom, Mr Speaker. However, I do wish to say that the misrepresentation was compounded by other statements as the whole question was discussed further today. I will briefly run through the facts. I have not used any scare tactics. In fact, the President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Queensland, Mr Bob Ellicott, brought to me the format and explained his concern at the fact that pensioners coming into his shop would be humiliated by filling in and signing the form in the presence of people who were in the shop and that pharmacists would be required, if not legally, practically, to be with those customers and to supervise the form as they are filling it in. That is of concern to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Beyond that, I would like to establish the credibility of the Minister in order to establish the credibility of his attack on me. In response to the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) the Minister has shown great concern at the complexity of the form. He now says that he will look into changing the form. I have a letter in my possession and a telex from the Pharmacy Guild (Queensland Branch) which shows that for months before this form came in information and advice was given to the Minister suggesting that the form was too complex but he insisted on going ahead with it. </PARA>
<PARA> After the chemists' representative came to see me, I held a meeting with consumer groups, the pensioners league and the Pharmaceutical Society and put the form before them to get feedback and information from them as to whether something should be changed. That feedback came from the three different groups. They requested me to launch a campaign to have this form withdrawn. I in no way scared any pensioners. I have gone around to groups. I showed them the form. They wish it to be simplified-and, in fact, withdrawn. I feel that it was a complete misrepresentation on behalf of the Minister and reflects his traumatic experience in trying to put forward a form over a number of months which people within the profession, as well as pensioners and consumers, do not wish to have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The House will be aware that nuclear powered warships of the United States Navy regularly visit Australian ports. Since the Government decided in 1976 to allow such visits about 50 port calls have been made by a variety of United States Navy nuclear powered surface ships and submarines to Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland and the Northern Territory. These port visits-like visits made by conventionally powered United States Navy warships-are valued by both the Australian and United States governments and are an important practical expression of naval co-operation in peacetime between close allies. This year's ANZUS Council communique recorded that the Council members:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>confirmed the high priority each partner placed upon a regular and comprehensive programme of naval visits to each other's ports, as well as to friendly ports in the Asia/Pacific region generally. They recognized the importance of access by United States naval ships to the ports of its Treaty partners as a critical factor in its efforts to maintain strategic deterrence and in order to carry out its responsibilities under the terms of the Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>In this regard, I would draw to the attention of the House the fact that the United States Navy now operates about 135 nuclear powered warships, and that more than 40 per cent of the major combatant units of the United States Navy are nuclear powered. All the nuclear powered warships visits that have taken place in the last six years have been arranged in accordance with the conditions of entry laid down by the Australian Government in 1976. These conditions of entry were incorporated in the document titled 'Environmental Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia' which was tabled in this place by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 4 June 1976. I now wish to inform the House that the Government has decided, following a review of the conditions of entry carried out by the Department of Defence in co-operation with other departments and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, that a number of changes should be made to those conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the conditions of entry laid down in 1976, the new conditions of entry are intended to apply to warships having reactors larger than 100 megawatts as well as to warships with reactors smaller than 100 megawatts. This change follows further assessment of information available on these vessels and the selection of berths such that any health hazards associated with the visits will be no greater than those accepted currently for warships with smaller reactors. The new conditions of entry will therefore enable visits to approved berths in Australia by the Nimitz class of aircraft carriers, subject only to appropriate arrangements being made to remove the vessel to a remote location in the unlikely event of an accident involving the nuclear propulsion plant. The other change of substance to the general conditions of entry concerns emergency towing arrangements. The 1976 conditions of entry stipulated that a tug must be available for emergency towing duties whenever a nuclear powered warship visited an Australian port. United States nuclear powered surface ships, however, have two or more reactors and could move under their own power even in the unlikely event of damage to one of those reactors. Except when visits are made by nuclear powered submarines, which have only one reactor, the requirement to remove a warship to a safe location may therefore be met by the warship itself rather than by separate towing vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> The new conditions of entry will apply to visits by nuclear powered warships of the United States Navy and-should visits be requested by it-to nuclear powered warships of the Royal Navy. They are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> A. visits will be for purposes such as crew rest and recreation and not for fuel handling or repair to reactor plant necessitating breach of reactor containment;</PARA>
<PARA> B. visits will be subject to satisfactory arrangements concerning liability and indemnity and to provision of adequate assurances relating to the operation and safety of the warships while they are in Australian waters;</PARA>
<PARA> C. movement of vessels must take place during daylight hours under conditions where visibility is not less than three quarters of a mile;</PARA>
<PARA> D. navigational controls on other shipping will be applied during the time that nuclear powered ships are entering or leaving ports;</PARA>
<PARA> E. there must be a capability to remove the vessel either under its own power or under tow, to a designated safe anchorage or to a designated distance to sea, within the time frame specified for the particular berth or anchorage and in any case within 24 hours, if an accident should occur; and</PARA>
<PARA> F. an operating safety organisation, competent to carry out a suitable radiation monitoring program and able to initiate actions and provide services necessary to safeguard the public in the event of a release of radioactivity following an accident, must exist for the port being visited. </PARA>
<PARA> I would emphasise to the House that the new conditions of entry are completely consistent with the very high standards of safety that have always been applied during visits by nuclear powered warships. It might be noted that, among the detailed precautions that are taken, these warships may use only those berths which have been individually assessed and cleared by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission as suitable for such use. Moreover, competent Australian personnel monitor carefully radiation levels in the vicinity of these warships throughout each visit, and a separate environmental monitoring program is conducted in co-operation with State authorities in each of the ports that are visited. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of these monitoring programs are published annually by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. No emissions of radioactivity have been detected by these programs from any of the nuclear powered warships that have visited Australia. Application of the new conditions of entry for nuclear powered warships will facilitate future visits to Australia by our United States ally's warships and at the same time will ensure that all the necessary precautions are taken to protect fully the interests of the Australian public in these visits. I commend them to the House. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) has brought in a new set of conditions under which nuclear powered vessels may enter Australian ports. He has not sought in any way to advise the House why it was necessary to change the existing arrangements, nor has he indicated who will pay the costs and whether the State governments, which in the main are responsible for State emergency services and other activities, have been consulted about these new arrangements. He has also not indicated why it was necessary to take out the detailed requirements for the various organisations involved in monitoring the safety of areas to which visits by nuclear powered vessels take place. From a reading of the 1976 agreement it is fairly obvious that a number of the requirements set down then, including those for public safety and the evacuation of members of the public in the event of a nuclear accident, have been totally neglected over the intervening six years. The safety zone requirements, if they have been implemented, have been the best kept secret from the population of those areas, probably a better kept secret than some of our defence plans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister indicated that, because of multiple reactors, tug stand-bys will no longer be required for surface ships. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the existence of multiple reactors does not guarantee that one of those reactors can be used in circumstances of disability. The reactors of all nuclear warships share coolant systems, and when the problem is a radiation leak in the coolant system, neither reactor can be used. Therefore, the requirement for tug stand-by exists just as much for a multiple reactor warship as it does for a single reactor warship. The fact is that multiple reactors can be rendered inactive, even though neither of the reactors is out of operation, by disabilities in the coolant system shared by the reactors. The new statement removes specific references to the acceptance of liabilities and to the United States Statement of Assurances. This has been totally dropped from the guidelines and has been replaced by a rather broad and sweeping general statement which may or may not mean something. The statement gives no detail. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other matters of concern. I mentioned previously the safety of local communities and the bodies which exist for the monitoring of nuclear visits. The new statement sets out no criteria, no conditions and no minimum requirements for such an operation. They were clearly spelt out in the previous statement, including safety requirements for the public. They have been removed. We now have faith, hope and trust. Given the example of the last six years when the provisions of the previous statement were totally ignored, we can fairly safely assume that those safety requirements which are not specifically spelt out but which are left to trust will be ignored by the Government. The Government is interested only in facilitating visits and is not interested in the security or safety of the Australian community, otherwise it would not have felt the need to remove those specific requirements which had not been a hindrance in the past and which should not be a hindrance now. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other matters of concern. I mentioned previously that the reimbursement of monitoring costs is not mentioned. If the Minister cares to look at the Notice Paper, he will find on it a question from my colleague the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) relating to a dispute existing with the Western Australian Government about large sums of money in respect of monitoring facilities which have never been paid. The new statement seems to me to be an indication that the Government wishes to have minimum specified requirements and is prepared to take risks with other people's lives. That is not acceptable to the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On 27 May this year, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle (Minister for Finance) tabled in the Senate interim report No. 2-Passports-of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. The Government has considered the report and I should like to outline to the House the Government's response to the report and the recommendations contained in it. The Government welcomes the report because we accept that false passports and false identities are tools of trade for drug traffickers and other international criminals; we share the concern expressed by a number of people including the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs and the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking about passport abuse; we acknowledge that the Government has a responsibility to do what it can to deter international criminal activities; and we are determined to take all possible steps to eliminate criminal activities, including passport abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's concern at these problems is evident from its action in appointing the Williams and Stewart royal commissions and the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The Government's attitude is also evident from the changes which have been introduced into the passport issue and control system by the Government and my Department since 1976. In that period my Department has taken the following initiatives: In 1976 passport records previously held in State offices were centralised-this allowed a ready check of current passport holders. In 1978 records previously held on card indexes were placed on computer. Since 1978 a number of improvements have been made to the computer-based information system. In 1979 significant amendments were made to the 1938 Passports Act. These amendments tightened procedures for the issue of passports, detailed the circumstances under which a passport could be either denied or withdrawn, and increased substantially the penalties for passport abuse. These were the first major changes to the Passports Act since the Department of External Affairs introduced the first Passports Act into Parliament in 1920. Since 1980 all passport-issuing offices in Australia have had on-line access to the central computer to prevent the issue of a second passport to a person of the same name and date of birth, and it allows an immediate check against those who are on various alert lists supplied to the Department of Foreign Affairs by authorities such as law enforcement agencies. In 1981 the lamination of the personal particulars page of passports was introduced to prevent the alteration of photograph or information about the holder. Earlier this year my Department gave approval for further improvements to be made to the passport in order to enhance its security. In January this year I announced the introduction of a system of checks against the identity of applicants. It should be noted that the improvements which I have just outlined were the first major changes made to the passport system in over 40 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Stewart Royal Commission report on passports raised a number of factors relating to the passport issue. In considering the Stewart report, the recommendations of the Williams Royal Commission were also given further attention. A number of other factors which would improve passport security were taken into account at the same time. In the five months since the report was tabled it has been the subject of intense study. My Department established a working party to examine the recommendations and their implications. A series of interdepartmental committees were established to discuss the various recommendations and other suggestions for improving the passport system. A survey was taken of the travel industry to assess the effect of the recommendations on that industry. Discussions were held with travel industry representatives. Discussions were also held by officers of my Department with State and Territory authorities. Passport applications submitted in 1981-82 were surveyed in order to obtain basic information on which the Government could then consider the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The main thrust of the Stewart Royal Commission report on passports relates to the problems of checking the identity of applicants. This is not a problem which is unique to the passports system. Those who watched the television program which set out to underline the weaknesses in the passport issue system will have noted that the program underlined the ease with which television staff obtained false birth certificates, driver's licences, gun licences, building society accounts, cheque accounts from banks and Bankcard credit facilities and enrolled on the electoral roll. </PARA>
<PARA> Establishing identity is vital in a number of important areas other than passports which are also of concern to Commonwealth and State governments and the private sector. Citizenship, checking illegal immigrants and banking are a few. It is also the key to receipt of a number of financial benefits from the Government. In Australia and those countries with similar political and judicial backgrounds such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand, there is absolutely no infallible method of establishing identity through a single identification system. The most effective method of establishing identity would, of course, be the establishment of a national identity system based on fingerprinting. The Government has considered this but is not prepared to institute such a system in relation to passports because of the implications that this would have on our traditional way of life. There would also be major administrative difficulties and additional costs. In the context of the passport issue and control system there is a limit to the inconvenience government can impose on honest Australians to stop fraudulent practices by a few-over half a million Australians obtain passports each year. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated, this problem is shared by other like countries and it is not practicable to introduce the system applied in some European countries which have a number of features which distinguish them from Australia. They are not migrant receiving countries, few are federal and they have a tradition of registering their citizens and monitoring the changes of address, marital status and so on throughout their lives. The Government, therefore, has examined alternative ways of tightening identity checks in respect of passport issue and control. The Government will retain the present multi-level checks on identity which will be further improved as a result of the Government's consideration of this report. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of recommendations in the report were already part of the passport issue system and others have since been implemented. The Government's response to each of the recommendations is outlined in the schedule which I now table. The more significant of the 40 recommendations in the report are those which are addressed to the need to require applicants to appear personally before a passport officer who is adequately trained and responsible to check identities. The report proposes the provision of more passport offices and the appointment of commissioners for passports to deal with applicants residing more than 100 kilometres from a passport office. While the Government accepts the need for personal interviews and agrees that this will require an appropriate infrastructure to cope with personal interviews, it does not propose to implement these changes in the form recommended by the report, for reasons which I will now explain. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey of passport applications which I mentioned earlier shows that there is insufficient work load to justify the establishment of regional offices on the scale proposed by the report. The Government also feels that there are a number of problems of control, security and servicing with the appointment of commissioners for passports and has some doubts that it would contribute to overcoming the problem of identifying applicants. The Government has therefore decided that, rather than establish regional offices and appoint commissioners for passports, official post offices will be used as agencies for passport offices. Senior postal clerks of about the same classification as interviewing staff in passport offices will, after thorough training, be authorised to accept applications for intending travellers, check the documentation against application details, certify the photographs and forward the passport application to passport offices for processing, at which stage further checks will be carried out before a passport is issued by the passport office. I emphasise that passports will not be issued by post offices. It is intended that passports, when issued, will be sent by certified mail to applicants' residential addresses or be available for collection at passport offices by the applicant. Further details of these arrangements will be announced in the near future but it should be noted that full implementation of these arrangements will be phased in over an 18-month period. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will maintain the present security requirements for a certificate regarding applicant, but following recommendations from the Williams Royal Commission and after consultation with State and Territory authorities, the categories of persons eligible to provide the certificates regarding applicants' identity will be restricted even further. In future the categories will be limited to the following: Members of Parliament-Federal and State; aldermen and councillors of municipal and shire councils; town clerks and secretaries; medical practitioners and dentists; judges, magistrates, clerks of petty sessions and clerks of court; school teachers of five years service; postmasters; police officers of the rank of sergeant and above and officers in charge of stations; officers of the armed services; ministers of religion designated as marriage celebrants; and Federal and State public servants of at least 10 years' permanent service. It will be some six months before this change is fully implemented. The security checks in our offices, which I announced in January of this year, will continue to be carried out by passport offices when the passport application is being processed. </PARA>
<PARA> A series of recommendations in the Royal Commission's report is designed to give passport officers access to adequate documentation and information to check identities and to improve the reliability of information held in passport offices. Passport offices already have access to electoral roll information and further examination is being made on the possibility of access to other information which could verify the identity of applicants. It is not possible or practicable to go to the extent envisaged in the report. Much of the information is held by the States and there would be a need for the States to computerise and integrate such information and make it available to the Commonwealth. Even if it were possible to do this, it is most doubtful that for passport purposes alone such effort would be warranted. Nevertheless, a number of the security measures designed to improve the range and integrity of information available will be discussed further with State and Territory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other recommendations canvassed issues which raise important fundamental principles and issues. These include restricting the entitlement of certain individuals to passports and restricting eligibility for a passport on conviction or suspicion of offences. These recommendations are to be referred to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) for consideration by the appropriate State and Territory authorities. The Government acknowledges that there has been inadequate consultation and co-ordination on passport related matters. A consultative committee to consider all aspects of passport security will be established. Its membership will comprise representatives of appropriate Commonwealth authorities. My Department will also maintain liaison with the State and Territory authorities and will discuss various aspects of passport security with those authorities on a regular basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In common law it is, of course, quite easy for people to change their names and the Royal Commission's report has pointed to the effect that this can have on controlling the number of passports held by one person. After discussions with State and Territory authorities and further consideration, I have decided that in future all passport applicants will be required to provide a full birth certificate showing the name of the person at birth and the full names of the mother and father. This information will then be recorded on the passport computer file and checks made to ensure that, whatever names a person may have acquired, a record will be made of the passport issue against the name at birth. The requirement for a full birth certificate will be implemented with the introduction in May next year of the new application forms. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed to introduce passport printers into passport offices in the next financial year. These printers will not only improve the quality and production techniques in the passport offices but also enhance the security in the passport offices themselves and lead the way to introduction of machine readable script in passports. This latter move is designed to speed the handling of passengers through points of entry in Australia. In January this year I announced that the Government had decided to consider the establishment of an independent consultancy review to examine the security aspects of the passport issue and control system. This was deferred pending receipt of the Stewart Royal Commission's report. The Government has decided to give further consideration to the establishment of this review when the new measures, which I have outlined, have been in operation for a period. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the changes which I have outlined will be implemented within the next six months but others require significant administrative preparation and will need to be phased in over a longer period. The decision to use Post Offices as lodgment centres, for example, will be phased in over an 18-month period to enable the new system to be explained to the public, administrative procedures to be established, training of postal clerks to be completed and the travel industry to adjust. The action which I have outlined reflects a general acceptance of the thrust of the recommendations of the Stewart Royal Commission report on passports, though some of the detail for the implementation of those recommendations differs from what was proposed by the Royal Commission for reasons already given. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier in this statement, the Government welcomes the Stewart Royal Commission's report on passports and the contribution it has made to tightening the passport issue and control system. This, however, is not the end of the matter. There is not, nor can there be, a perfect infallible system. The Government, through my Department, will keep the passport issue and control procedures under constant review and further changes will no doubt be made in the future. The efforts to deter and prevent criminal elements in our society from undermining the basis of this society must be constant and unremitting. We are determined to do what we can in what is regrettably an unending battle. Therefore, though there may be some inconvenience to those many thousands of honest Australians who apply each year for passports, I am confident that they will understand the reasons why these measures are necessary. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Opposition welcomes the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) in relation to the problems associated with passport abuse. I note that the Minister referred to the recommendations of interim report No. 2 of the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. I also note that the Minister did not refer to recommendation No. 38 which dealt with the proposal that the issue of passports be transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I do not want to dwell on that matter, but I am of the opinion that the Department of Foreign Affairs is anxious to preserve the capacity and the authority to issue passports, and there is some evidence to suggest that that should be so. There is no doubt there has been a lot of laxity and abuse. The Department of Foreign Affairs has a role to play in respect of passport and visa control, particularly relating to people coming to this country on a short term basis. It is recognised, of course, that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is the appropriate department to deal with the matter on the basis of the reunion of long term migrants and their families. But the whole nub of what the Minister said, and indeed of what the Royal Commissioner said, is the difficulty of establishing identity. I note that many problems are associated with identity because identity can certainly be manufactured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Stewart Royal Commission stated a number of matters to which I should like to advert in order to show the nature of the problem. Page one of the interim report deals with a person named Clark who was well known for criminal activity- in fact murder and heroin charges. The inquiry clearly indicated that there was an abuse of the passport system. Clark obtained a number of passports; he was not entitled to any. He had at least five, none of which was in the name of Clark. If we look at the problem we will see that the abuse was enormous. At the time of his arrest Clark had passports issued in the names of Kriss, Newton, Gorrie, Sinclaire and Perkins. Clark was a New Zealand citizen anyway. This shows that it is very easy for the criminal mind to find ways of getting around what were deemed to be adequate identification procedures. Page 41 of the report of the Royal Commission-I hope it has been noted-states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Foreign Affairs has stated it wishes to ensure that no false passports are issued but pleads that its resources are insufficient to implement the Williams Commission recommendations. This Commission has grave doubt as to whether the Department really appreciates how serious the present position is. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to describe a person who was found with a great deal of heroin, was charged and remanded and eventually did not appear. When the police carried out investigations they discovered that that person had been issued with a passport in another name altogether-in fact in the name of a Kevin William Harris who died at the age of 13 months. That shows the sort of arrangement that can enter the criminal mind. This person, who got away with that passport in the name of an infant, went through the exercise of producing a certificate of identity. The certificate of identity, as explained by the Royal Commissioner, was given by Mr William Victor Cook, J. P. A justice of the peace would be entitled to do that. When Mr Wilfred Vincent Cook was interviewed he said that he had never heard of William Victor Cook. In other words, the identification of the justice of the peace was also forged. It was not hard for the criminal mind to do that because all he had to do was look up the telephone directory and notice that Mr Cook had 'J.P.' after his name. </PARA>
<PARA> We now come to the value of birth certificates. Those of us who have been involved from time to time in litigation and evidence know that a birth certificate is prima facie evidence of birth, but the certificate could be a complete forgery. If we look through the report of the Royal Commission we will also note that the official birth certificate paper has in fact been stolen. The criminal has access to everything, so if he can get the official imprimatur of State documents he will readily type in a lot of particulars. He will readily produce all sorts of evidence. That is perhaps a matter we cannot always prevent . </PARA>
<PARA> I shall now comment in relation to all the difficulties. I note that the Minister is now saying that he wants a full birth certificate to be produced, a matter with which I fully agree. We come now to the question of identity and the natural revulsion by people in a democracy-and this is what the Royal Commissioner said-having to have some identification; this can infringe the right to privacy. He asked quite fairly to get a balance between criminal activity and the fact that one gets a benefit from one's country, and a passport is a benefit. So we must have a balance. Whilst one can maintain privacy, one cannot do that to the extent that one allows criminal conduct to flourish, as has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not at all critical of what the Minister has said. In fact, I say that it is a worthwhile contribution. I note that there will be various propositions which I think are helpful in that the people who can give identity will be restricted to a number of people of a certain class. That immediately leads me to say that there is an additional difficulty if one looks at the fact that these people's identities can also be forged-through a forged signature, for example-and, therefore, we need to have some proof of their identity. That sounds as though we could go on ad infinitum but I do not think we need to, as will be seen if honourable members listen to what I say a little later. I welcome the fact that judges, postmasters, police officers and everybody else of an appropriate title will be able to give identity. But one has to be careful that the criminal mind does not work also to forge that identity. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue is that the Minister says that a 'full birth certificate' can be produced; and that is right. But one has to be able to establish the identity of the person holding that birth certificate and I think this is the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Those who have been involved in earning an honest living in law have had to go through the exercise from time to time of convincing people that we can actually get this sort of evidence. The evidence would be something like this: A person would have to produce a full birth certificate. Attached to it would be an affidavit or a declaration by a member of the family or somebody close to the person concerned saying: 'Yes, you are the person referred to in the certificate' and that they have known the person for so many years. That person would have to sign the declaration. That would be one method. That does not get over the other fact that that person might also be a party to a forgery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For example, the Commonwealth Bank does this in respect of what are called probate applications. I remember them well. If one wants to withdraw the proceeds from an account of a deceased person, for the bank's purposes one has to have a full death certificate identified by a declaration before a justice of the peace or somebody the person may wish to nominate-usually a justice of the peace-saying that the person mentioned on the death certificate is one and the same as the person holding the bank account. The declaration would state that the person making the declaration knew the deceased person for a number of years and that that was the person who held the account. So, somebody would be qualified to identify that person. </PARA>
<PARA> One also would need to have somebody in the category identified by the Minister -he is now saying that a school teacher or a person of that nature is quite entitled to do this-identifying the person who was providing the original identification. So, one would need to have a double check. The bank went further and said in its terms that it wanted the signature of that identifying person identified by another bank. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may wish to look at precedent. Perhaps the Department can see plenty of precedents. Whilst it might be a little difficult, it is not too hard, acknowledging that the full birth certificate does not necessarily give the protection form forgery sought, to have identification by somebody who knew the person mentioned in the birth certificate. The criminal element, we know, will look at headstones in cemetries and make up certificates of birth. From the source, criminals work out when the person who is dead was born. Clark did that in what is called the McGuire case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It is called the jackal theory. In making a constructive observation, I say that there is a precedent for this method and it ought to be encouraged. I think that quite fairly the Minister has stumbled on something quite good in suggesting that post offices ought to be where these applications can be lodged. Considering the post office and the person who is lodging the application, I think it follows that the postman usually knows who lives in what house and how long they have lived there, because the mail goes there. If the application is not being made at that post office, at least one ought to be able to find out from the adjoining post office or wherever the application is lodged that there is some method of establishing that whoever is making the application is known to the postman. It would be a matter of a quick telephone call. I think we might have unconsciously stumbled on something well worth while.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is saying, quite fairly, that he did it deliberately. I gave him top IQ marks for that. The point I am making is that this question of identity can always be subverted by the criminal method of forgery and multiplication of the forgery by a number of different signatures of people, none of whom exists. To check the position, one has to go to some person whom one can identify.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise one final matter. I understand that a number of passports are lost when people are overseas. I understand also-this is not said in criticism-that, naturally, when an Australian has lost his passport he immediately goes to our embassy and asks for another one. He may need to get the passport as a matter of urgency. That system has a weakness. The passport has to be issued again on the basis of some form of identification. The identify of the person is checked by confirming that, in fact, a passport was issued. That practice does not really establish the identity. I think that in future the Minister might have to look at the need, when there is a claim that a passport has been lost, to put the person who has lost it to the difficulty of waiting to allow the embassy to contact Australia immediately in order to get a photostat of all the evidence that was furnished at the time when the original passport was granted so that the embassy may issue a new passport. At present the embassy is not able to do that when a matter of urgency is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, a passport which is reissued overseas on the basis of the original passport having been lost is issued for a five-year period whereas the lost passport might have had only about three or four months to run. In other words, the reissue overseas is granting a brand new passport for a further period without there being an opportunity to check the identity in detail. I think that ought to be a matter of some comment at some stage in relation to whether what I have suggested can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally speaking, I think that what the Minister is about is what we all want to see-an ability to prevent crime. Obviously passports have been abused and will continue to be abused because we cannot readily stop all the criminal tendencies. However, looking at the simplicity of the methods that have been used in the past to gain passports illegally, I think certainly it can be seen that better systems have been prevailing for some time. I am concerned about the declaration aspect and the need for identification of the birth certificate by somebody who can be readily found. In turn, the identity of the person giving the identification also has to be established. I suggest that some of these people whom the Minister is now suggesting as appropriate should also exercise the function in relation to people obtaining a passport. Generally speaking, the Opposition welcomes the efforts being made by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to inform the House of the Government's intentions regarding South West Tasmania. The Government reaffirms its wish that the Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks be inscribed on the World Heritage List along with the other nomination of Lord Howe Island. If these nominations are accepted by the World Heritage Committee, these areas will join Kakadu National Park, the Great Barrier Reef and the Willandra Lakes Region on the World Heritage List.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that the World Heritage Committee is meeting in Paris commencing 13 December. Professor Ralph Slatyer, the former Australian Ambassador to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation and the outgoing Chairman of the World Heritage Committee, will lead the Australian delegation. Professor Slatyer will be assisted by Dr D. F. McMichael, Secretary, Department of Home Affairs and Environment, Mr Max Bourke, Director of the Australian Heritage Commission and Mr Ernst Willheim of the Attorney-General's Department. Additionally, the Government in response to the request by the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Gray, has issued an invitation for the Tasmanian Government to be represented in the delegation subject to the conditions which normally apply to State representatives on Australian Government delegations. For the information of honourable members, it is the practice at meetings of the World Heritage Committee for the nominating country to respond only to questions put by the Committee. Notwithstanding this limitation on participation in the discussions on the nomination, I hope the invitation to Tasmania will be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has provided to the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee the additional information sought on the nomination of the Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks for inscription on the World Heritage List. I gave Professor Slatyer this morning, just before his departure for Paris, the Government's response which he will deliver to the Bureau prior to the meeting of the World Heritage Committee. In responding to the request the Government noted that the Bureau has recommended the inscription on the World Heritage List of the Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks. I should like to confirm to the House the Government's firm belief in the international importance of this area and its outstanding biological and cultural qualities which have been recognised by its inclusion on the Register of the National Estate. I make special reference to the archaeological sites, the huon pine habitat, the temperate rainforest and the other unique features of this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has co-operated with the Tasmanian Government over a number of years in documenting the natural resources of the area as a basis for future planning management. The Commonwealth looks to continuing this co- operative approach. Towards this end the Government stands by its commitment to provide financial and other assistance in the establishment and management of a national park of world significance which includes a substantial wilderness component. Nonetheless, the Government has to face facts. The Premier of Tasmania has stated firmly, and with the backing of legislation, that the proposed dam is to proceed. Accordingly, the Government has indicated to the World Heritage Committee that the Tasmanian Government is constructing a hydro- electric power scheme in the nominated area and that the Commonwealth has been and is discussing the scheme with the Tasmanian Government with a view to minimising the damage that the dam might cause. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not intend to intervene in the construction of the dam. The Government, in its discussion with the Tasmanian Government, will make it clear that it will back its concern for these features with money, manpower and technical resources. I am pleased to inform the House that the Tasmanian Government has agreed that the Commonwealth will be consulted in the development of the management plan for the area. The mechanism for consultation is to be the subject of discussions with the Tasmanian Government. Whilst Fraser Cave and other caves of archaeological significance will be flooded by the dam, let me assure the House that every endeavour will be made to preserve this important part of our heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> The House will understand that the position taken by the Government will be welcomed by parts of the community and opposed by others. The expressions of concern have been clear and widespread. Nevertheless, the Government has to strike a balance between competing intentions. Confrontation between the Commonwealth and the States and between individuals in the community is not the road to prosperity, development or conservation of our heritage. The Government believes, on balance, that its decision is the right one and seeks from the community support in its continuing discussions with the Tasmanian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I join the Premier of Tasmania in exhorting those that oppose the construction of the dam not to interfere physically with construction works. I abhor violence, as I am sure do all in this House. Nothing can be gained from violent confrontation. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today is a sad day for the environmental heritage of Australia. The Government has just announced that the nomination of South West Tasmania, which includes the Gordon-Franklin river system, for the World Heritage List under the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation Convention for the Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage will proceed. However, it announced simultaneously that it will not intervene to prevent the construction of the Gordon-Franklin dam. The nomination has been made by both the Federal Government and a State government of Tasmania. If the nomination is accepted and if the Federal Government fails to intercede and live up to its moral and international obligations, this country will not be fit to be a responsible signatory to that convention. That is the fact of the matter. Quite frankly, the Government has placed this country in the position of being no longer fit to be a party to that convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been speculation for a long time as to whether this Government would act in this way. In its usual cowardly fashion it postponed the decision until after the Flinders by-election last Saturday. There are many people in Australia , particularly on the mainland, who are not in favour of the construction of this dam. Between 15,000 and 20,000 people marched in Melbourne several weeks ago in protest about the construction of the dam. Forty-one per cent of those who voted last Saturday saw fit to write 'no dams' on their ballot papers. All of those people have been conned by the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) and this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I proceed with my reply to the Minister's statement, perhaps I should put on record that I hope and trust that those somewhat naive people in the environment lobby and conservation movement of Australia will no longer allow themselves to be conned by this Government, which allowed them to believe that perhaps some action would be taken. Certainly its candidate for Flinders gave credence to that belief. I trust that all of those confused people who believed its candidate for Flinders and who believed that this Minister might have some clout with the Government are now disabused for all time of the belief that this Government is a government which cares about the environment. It is not. As we move to an election, whenever it is, all of those people in Australia who are concerned about the environment will know the Minister for the environmental fraud that he has perpetrated and he will cop the electoral backlash of it. The people who are concerned for the environment in Australia may have been conned in relation to the Flinders by-election but they will not be conned twice. The Federal Government has capitulated to the pig-headed intransigence of the Tasmanian Government about constructing this dam, which is now to be constructed by the Government of Tasmania and the Hydro Electric Commission with the compliance of the Federal Government. Other people's money will be used in its construction; that is, money which the State certainly does not have will be used to construct a dam it does not need to produce power for industries which it does not have and which will not materialise. </PARA>
<PARA> This area is part of the National Estate. This Government has nominated it for the National Estate. It is a national issue. I have addressed many political gatherings in my time but I have never addressed meetings all round Australia of the size that this issue has drawn. The Federal Government has now joined forces with the Tasmanian Premier and those in Tasmania who say that this is a State issue and not a national issue. Does the Government say that about the Kakadu National Park, Ayers Rock or the Great Barrier Reef? Can we now assume that if the Bjelke-Petersen Government in Queensland decides to take the Commonwealth Government on and says that it is going to drill for oil along the coast of Queensland, inside the area covered by the Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act, the Commonwealth Government will not intervene? Obviously, that is what the Government is saying. The area of South West Tasmania should be on the World Heritage List right up there with the Kakadu National Park and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) who sits in the second row has marched with me at the head of demonstrations. You know that what I am saying is true. Yet you sit here behind the foolish honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) and behind the cowardly Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have the Minister saying that he understands the archaeological significance of the area that is going to be flooded but he assures us all that every endeavour will be made to preserve the cave. I refer honourable members to the conclusion of the report of the Senate Select Committee on South West Tasmania that was brought down in the Senate some weeks ago. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 11.15 The Committee heard evidence from Australian archaeologists and received copies of letters forwarded to the Prime Minister from eminent international archaeologists on the significance of the archaeological discoveries in an area near the Franklin River which would be inundated by the proposed Gordon-below- Franklin scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> 11.16 The Committee accepts the views of these experts that the archaeological discoveries near the Franklin River are of such international importance that they should not be inundated. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason the Committee said that is that these archaeologists told the Committee that Fraser Cave shows evidence of being the southernmost point on this planet ever reached by prehistoric man. The Aborigines were there in Fraser Cave 20,000 years ago-that is about 15,000 years before Cheops built the Great Pyramid. Fraser Cave is one of the great archaeological sites on this planet. Yet this mean-minded, mean-spirited Government, without any idea of what this site might mean to the world cultural and natural heritage, is willing to go along with a petty, parochial government like the Government of Tasmania that says to the Minister and the Government: 'You're only the Commonwealth. Keep your nose out of our affairs. We know better than you. We know that we need this dam for an economic purpose'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the lie then, having established the environmental case, to the economic case. There is no economic case whatsoever for the dam. It will cost up to $1 billion to produce 178 megawatts of power. That is what it will be because the Pieman River Scheme has already blown out to almost $800m. It started off in the early 1970s at $120m; now it is $800m. The HEC already consumes 30 per cent of the State's general purpose capital funds, 60 per cent of its total loan funds, 94 per cent of major semi-governmental borrowing and 95 per cent of the infrastructure borrowing program that has now been terminated. Now it has to borrow on national and international markets at ruling interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The recession is hitting Tasmania. We know that. But Tasmania is going to create power for industries that it does not have because hydro industrialisation has demonstrably failed. Tasmania has not attracted a new industry of any power consuming consequences for 10 years. Comalco Aluminium ( Bell Bay) Pty Ltd, Electrolytic Zinc of Australasia Ltd, Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd and Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Co. Pty Ltd have joined all those companies around Australia which are laying off labour. The Department of National Development and Energy has said that it will not need any new power in Tasmania until 2000 AD. Between August 1981 and August 1982 there was a 5.5 per cent fall in power consumption in Tasmania. The Senate Select Committee report said that the HEC had not convinced that Committee that it needed to start a major project like that now of such enormous cost and for which there is no demonstrable need for the power. The Committee recommended a moratorium of at least three years. The Committee knew that Tasmania could then go to either a scheme on the King River or the Arthur River to produce a combined 140 megawatts of power or, alternatively, a thermal power station. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Seven weeks ago, on 20 October, the Opposition brought before this House a matter of public importance alleging that the Government had falsified the Budget by understating certain expenditure and overstating taxation receipts, and so coming up with an artificially low deficit which the Government wanted for the purposes of a possible early election. When we put that to the Treasurer (Mr Howard), he vehemently denied those charges. He said that the figures had been presented in good faith, that they were the best estimates available and that the increased deficit, which he had admitted to at that time, was only small beer compared with the total level of government outlays; and so really what was all this carry on about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What do we see now, just seven weeks from that time? We see that the Treasurer has now admitted that the deficit is likely to be about $4,000m which is some $2 ,300m more than the original Budget estimate of about $1.7 billion, which figure , of course, is an extraordinary increase over the original Budget deficit estimate. In Question Time today the Treasurer said that his actual estimate was around $3,750m. But he seemed to suggest that there was likely to be a further extension of that estimate at least to the area of $4,000m. I think I can use that figure, particularly as that is the figure he also gave to the Premiers. What we have had, therefore, is an increase in the Budget deficit of 140 per cent in the course of the few months that have passed since the deficit was mentioned in this House. This is a quite stupendous blowout which will take the deficit to the highest level in money terms than it has ever been in our history . It may even go higher than the $4,000m. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as the Budget's financial parameters are going haywire the economy is clearly going downhill at an alarming rate. The economic situation now is far worse than was estimated by the Government in its Budget forecast. So on both fronts-on the financial front in regard to the Budget's financial estimates and on the economic front-the Budget is literally falling apart. The Budget strategy that was proclaimed in August is now totally irrelevant. Who could have any faith in a Budget which has a deficit blowing out at a rate of $ 135m a week, which is the rate at which this deficit is now blowing out. That is a quite extraordinary rate of blowout. This deficit is now blowing out at a rate of something like $19m a day. That figure of $4,000m is not the bottom line. The Treasurer, when asked by me in Question Time today to give a guarantee that it would not be any higher than that, did not do so. Clearly, it is quite possible that when Parliament resumes in the new year the Treasurer will say that the figure is now something well in excess of $4,000m. Certainly it will be if the economy continues to slide at its present rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is this enormous blowout occurring? In our view there are two basic reasons . It has resulted partly from the Government's deception in relation to the Budget-its deliberate falsification of the Budget which it dollied up for electoral purposes. I will quickly allude to several elements of that falsification. Firstly, there were the unemployment benefit payments. The Government estimated its level of unemployment benefit payments in the Budget on a basis of an average 395,000 registered unemployed. In fact, the actual numbers on the unemployment benefit at the time of the Budget were already 10,000 above the figure for the month of July, the first month of that financial year. So it is quite clear that the unemployment benefit figure was patently false. Of course it is now admitted to be so by the fact that the Treasurer is admitting an increase of some $600m or 38 per cent on the Budget estimate-an extraordinary increase in that amount. He now says that the number of unemployment benefit recipients is estimated to be something like 525,000-130,000 more than he estimated in the Budget only a little over three months ago. Interestingly, that figure is also 193,000 more than the figure for the last financial year. So it is quite clear that this figure was patently and totally false and must have been known by the Government to be false when it brought down this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, in respect of employment, the Government's estimate of no decline in the total number of wage and salary earners was nonsense. In the last financial year when we had a 2.3 per cent growth of non-farm product we had no growth in employment. This year, with a Budget forecast of no growth in gross non-farm product-that is, no growth in the production of non-farm goods and services-the Government has estimated that there will be the same employment position as last year; that is, just no growth. Clearly, if we have approximately 2 1/2 per cent growth in one year of goods and services associated with no growth in employment and then we have a year of no growth in output we will have a much worse employment situation. The Government knew that. But it still put forward its Budget forecast in regard to tax receipts on the basis of no change in the employment figure. Of course it was nonsense! It has now admitted that it will be down by at least one per cent. I confidently forecast that it will fall by considerably more than one per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government estimated that $255m would be gained from recoupment tax. Knowing that it had great trouble and would face pressure from opponents of the legislation within its own ranks both inside and outside this Parliament it believed that it may well have to make concessions. It eventually made those concessions. As a result, instead of getting $255m it will get $100m, which is $ 155m less than it said it would get in the course of this financial year mainly because of its backdowns in respect of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there was the drought. Two weeks after the Budget was brought down in this House the Government announced a package in respect of the drought which would add $356m to Budget outlays. It cannot possibly argue that, at the time of the Budget, it did not know that there was a drought going on in this country and that it had been going on in a very severe form for months if not years. It was quite clear that the Government must have had in mind a drought package. It kept it out of the Budget figures by delaying the announcement of that drought relief until two weeks after the Budget. That means that the outlays will be some $350m above the estimated level in the Budget for that reason alone. Indeed, there have been suggestions recently that that amount of $350m will be considerably higher. But in the figures given to us today by the Treasurer we see that he is sticking to his $356m figure. Even at that level it is a significant addition to outlays which should have been in the Budget figures and it should not just be put there as part of that whole process of falsification of that deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> This spectacular blowout of the deficit which is occurring is partly a reflection of the falsity of the original Budget estimates. Indeed, there are many other areas to which I could point but because of time restrictions and other reasons I will not go into them. However, this blowout of the deficit is also partly a reflection of the collapse of the Australian economy and the consequent increase in expenditure on unemployment benefit and the loss of tax revenue which that collapse entails. The estimates given by the Treasurer at Question Time today are a clear indication of this. Pay-as-you-earn tax is down $323m on the Budget estimates because of the reduced employment and some reduction in wage growth. Indirect tax is down $355m because of the recessed economy. People spend less on goods and services and so pay less in the way of indirect taxes. Unemployment benefits are up not just because of the original falsifications but also because of the much worse state of the Australian economy and the much greater levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> All this reflects falling employment, falling sales, falling production and growing unemployment which marks this economy at present. In every key respect the Budget estimates about the state of the Australian economy in 1982-83 are now exposed as utterly unrealistic. In every case the position is worse than the Budget estimates would have had us believe. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just quickly run through some of those key economic forecasts in the Budget. Let us see how out of touch they are with the current state of the economy as we know it. The Budget estimate was for a further decline in home building. In fact in the September quarter we saw that the growth of home building approvals fell spectacularly-it was 34 per cent less in the 12 months to September 1982 than in the 12 months to September 1981. That represents some further decline. It was estimated that the growth in real private consumption expenditure would slow to around 1 1/2 per cent in 1982-83. We now have declining retail sales in real terms. After one adjusts for inflation retail sales declined in the September quarter. The latest figures for motor vehicle registrations also show a decline in real terms in the September quarter. So the key areas of personal consumption are falling, not just declining, in their rate of growth. </PARA>
<PARA> It was forecast that real private business fixed investment would show some decline. In fact, we find in the September quarter it was 5 per cent lower than it was a year before. The Treasury, in its 'Round-up of Economic Statistics', stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the continuing deterioration in the tone of the economy since the July/August survey period it now appears that the fall in real business fixed capital expenditure will be greater than suggested at Budget time. </PARA>
<PARA>The fall in the expenditure sure is greater. We were told that the consumer price index would rise by 10.75 per cent. The latest figure is 12.3 per cent in the 12 months to September. That figure is double the level of our trading partners, which is around 6.6 per cent. It was said that there would be some decline in rural farm production. In fact, we find that the net value of rural production during this year, as estimated by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, will be about half that of last year and the lowest level since the mid-1950s. Nothing explicit was mentioned in the Budget on factory production but there was mention of non-farm product showing no fall. In fact, we find that in the year to September factory production has fallen by 10 per cent to below the level in 1976-77. The recent massive lay-offs in manufacturing show that output is falling even further. </PARA>
<PARA> We were told that there is unlikely to be any growth in employment. As I have already mentioned, there has already been a decline in employment. The Government has now, through the Treasurer, agreed it will be at least a one per cent decline. It was said that there will be a marked increase in recorded unemployment. There certainly has been a marked increase in recorded unemployment. The figure which we now have for the number of unemployed benefit recipients is 193,000 more than the figure we had last year, which is a spectacularly enormous increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Seasonally adjusted employment figures have grown by 113,500 during the four months from July to October. Quite clearly, there has been an enormous increase in unemployment. We are looking at a figure of about 700,000 unemployed people in the months of January and February. If the increase in unemployment is only the same in actual numbers between October and February this year as it was last year, there will be 653,000 unemployed people in February. Of course, it is going to be more than that with all the lay-offs. So we are looking at least at something of the order of 700,000 unemployed people, which will represent over 10 per cent unemployment by February. That is the unemployment situation which was described in the Budget as a 'marked increase' in unemployment. It is an horrendous increase in unemployment. Quite clearly, it is far worse than the Budget would have had us believe. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget estimate forecasts were for non-farm products to remain broadly unchanged in 1982-83 and with some decline in overall gross domestic products. The current situation is that in the September quarter gross non-farm product has already fallen by 0.3 per cent and GPD by 0.6 per cent. Given what has happened in the rest of the economy since that time, the fall has become greater since. So there will be a much worse situation in respect of national accounts than was indicated in the Budget. On the other hand, the balance of payments situation has not deteriorated. We have been affected by the international recession but, in fact, in the September quarter a major addition to growth came from exports. So the Government's suggestion that we have been suddenly damaged by the international recession does not fit with what was happening to the Australian economy because, in the September quarter, the exports kept things going. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is, therefore, that the Budget strategy has completely and utterly collapsed. Its forecasts in regard to financial parameters and the state of the economy are totally at odds with what is happening in the economy. The Budget should, therefore, be scrapped and a new Budget brought before this Parliament which addresses the real state of the nation and which seeks to treat the real cause of our economic problems at present, which is the collapse of demand resulting partly from the drought and poor export markets but, much more importantly, from contractionary budgetary and monetary policies. The Government 's tearing off with a wages freeze as the answer to our problems ignores the basic fact that our economic problems are primarily caused by this collapse of demand. It is budgetary and monetary policy which addresses that question. The budgetary and monetary strategy has to be changed to ensure there is an increase in demand in order that we can get some economic growth back in this country. The Treasurer should now bring forward a new Budget which has those elements in it to give the economy a chance to recover and not continue in a vast depression , which is its current state. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) for his concluding remarks. He gave the House some idea of the alternative Budget strategy which he believes should be adopted. In those concluding remarks, he said that domestic demand in Australia was collapsing because of a contractionary Budget strategy. I can only conclude from that statement that the honourable member for Gellibrand would be arguing for a substantially higher Budget deficit than the one towards which we are now heading. He argues that existing strategy is far too contractionary and that we have to do something about that strategy in order to pump up demand in the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman's speech was remarkable for one other feature. He made only one reference to the international influences on the Australian economy. If I may say so with respect, that was a slightly incorrect reference. It is true that our export performance in the September quarter has been better than we thought, but overwhelmingly the reason why our balance of payments was stronger in the September quarter has been the heavy purchasing of securities in Australia by overseas investment institutions, particularly from Japan; in fact, it has been the flow of capital into those investments in Australia more than a more buoyant export performance that has achieved that result. I would have hoped that the honourable member's definition or analysis would be more correct than I believe in fact it was. Apart from that reference he made no other reference to the international circumstances which are now affecting the Australian economy. I will come to that matter in just a moment.</PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary-if we are to understand our present dilemmas and find a way out of them-that we first understand why we are in the situation which is now facing the Australian economy. Before I do that, let me go back to the introductory remarks of the honourable member for Gellibrand and simply say, as I have said to him on earlier occasions, that I reject utterly, completely and without any qualification his claim that there was any deliberate falsification of figures by the Government in this Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Port Adelaide and any other honourable member can interject until he or she is blue in the face. But that will not alter the completely unambiguous and unequivocal nature of the denial that I give on behalf of the Government on that matter. The fact remains that the Australian economy has worsened very markedly since the Budget was brought down. It is true that the estimates of growth and activity on which the Budget was put together have turned out to be much more conservative in terms of the extent to which they estimated the worsening of the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also worth reflecting that at the time when the Budget was brought down some economic commentators in Australia said that the Treasury forecasts contained in the Budget were, in fact far too pessimistic. But what has happened is that economic activity has slowed down to a much greater extent than was then calculated. The drought has worsened. The international recession has continued and has not abated as some thought it might earlier on this year. Wage increases have continued to eat into our profitability. How remarkable it is that the alternative Treasurer in this country can make a speech for a quarter of an hour about our economic circumstances at present, when we are facing the highest unemployment in this country for forty years, and say absolutely nothing about the disastrous slump in the profitability of Australian companies which has happened over the last few months, and say absolutely nothing about the underlying reality that, over the last 18 months, profitability of Australian industry has been shot to pieces. As a consequence, the capacity of Australian industry to employ people has been crippled by the wage increases that have gone on over that period. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no accident that for almost 20 years we had a profit share of the national cake in this country of about 17 per cent or 18 per cent a year. While that remained, the unemployment level in this country was so low that it was the envy of the industrialised world. It is no accident that when the profit share- that is, the wherewithal for people to be employed-started to dissipate the unemployment level in this country begin to rise. It is no accident that there was a small improvement in the unemployment situation in 1980 when there was some recovery in the profitability of Australian business to about 15 per cent for a short period. But, affected as it was by the onset of wage demands beyond the capacity of the economy to afford, that profit share has now fallen back to the lowest level it has been at since 1974. The fall in that profit share has produced, of course, the high unemployment which is our common concern at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gellibrand made a speech about economic policy and, remarkably, said nothing about those circumstances. It is truly remarkable that the honourable member for Gellibrand can make a speech and not even mention them . Even his Labor colleagues at a State level are not quite as myopic as that. Even they are prepared to acknowledge-perhaps not to the extent that we and other people around the country have argued-that there is a link between profitability and employment, there is a link between the capacity of firms to make a living and therefore employ people. It is truly remarkable that the honourable member for Gellibrand can make a speech of the kind that he has made today and say absolutely nothing about those realities. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me return to the question of the Budget deficit. It does not please me in the slightest that the Budget deficit is now, according to the latest estimate, about $3,700m to $3,800m. I used the expression yesterday in this chamber at the Premiers Conference 'approaching $4,000m'. I have already indicated to the House the principal elements on the expenditure and revenue sides which have made up the additions. There is, of course, the increase in unemployment benefit. I have given to the House before and I shall repeat the reasons for that significantly higher estimate. The calculations that were made at the time of the Budget and presented to the Government at the time of the Budget were based upon assumptions as to the ratio of unemployment benefit recipients to the total number of unemployed, which had reflected the experience of a period of some 18 months or two years. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened since then and what has rendered those estimates deficient since the time of the Budget has been that there have been two eventualities. Firstly, there has been a sharper rise in the total number of unemployed people over and above what was estimated at the time of the Budget. Secondly, within that rise there has been an even sharper rise in the ratio of the number of people drawing benefits to the total number of people out of work. That has reflected the higher incidence of main breadwinners in families being thrown out of work. The experiences at centres such as Newcastle and Wollongong in New South Wales and Geelong and Whyalla in other parts of Australia provide some very unhappy examples. That is the explanation as to why the unemployment benefit figure has had to be revised. It is not some kind of three-card trick by the Government. To suggest that is not only to impugn the political members of the Government, which is part and parcel of the parliamentary process, whether it has foundation or not, but also to implicate apolitical Public Service advisers as though they were part of some giant overall conspiracy to confuse the country. That accounts for some $603m. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have drought assistance of $356m, natural disaster relief of $52m and, because of the projected increase in the deficit, the provision of a further $ 93m to service the additional borrowings that will be necessary to finance that higher deficit. There has also been a revision downwards in the estimated collections of revenue. Because of a higher level of unemployment and because of slower growth there has been a revision downwards in the projected collections of pay-as-you-earn tax of some $323m. We also expect to collect, largely but not entirely because of the drought-there has been a heavy fall in many professional and non-salary incomes earned by people other than farmers-about $123m less in the provisional tax area. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the revision downwards in the recoupment tax area. That is a very difficult figure to estimate with any precision. The revised estimate may well turn out to be on the conservative side. I do not know and the commissioner of Taxation has, quite properly, warned me that it is a very difficult figure to estimate. There will be, because of slower economic activity and reduced consumer spending, a shortfall in sales tax collections because fewer things are being bought. Some $84m has been allowed for that. Excise duty is down $170m, which is accounted for in part at least by a fall in the purchases of traditional excise items in the alcohol and tobacco areas. Customs duty collections will be down by $100m. On the other side, there will be some increases in the collection of the crude oil levy. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it also ought to be said that the Government is extremely unhappy about and derives no pleasure at all from the fact that we will have a higher deficit this year. The honourable member for Gellibrand said that it is the biggest deficit in history. Of course it is the higher deficit in money terms but we all know that that is a fairly inadequate and phoney basis of comparison. The real size and dimension of a deficit is its proportion of gross domestic product. Of course, in money terms a deficit now will be immensely bigger than what it was 10 years ago. It is 2.5 per cent of GDP. In 1975-76 the deficit was 4.9 per cent of GDP. It approaches 5 per cent in the United States, 5 1/2 per cent in Japan and 6 1/2 per cent in Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), who has been in the news lately, said just after the Budget was brought down that it was inadequate and that he wanted one that was the average for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. If the honourable member for Wills had his way we would have a deficit of $6,000m. Let not the honourable member for Gellibrand come into this House and say that what we are doing is inadequate. His colleague the honourable member for Wills wants the deficit to be $6,000m. I would be interested to know whether the honourable member for Gellibrand reckons that that would be a responsible figure, or whether it would be one that we ought to walk away from. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I draw no comfort at all from those sorts of comparisons-I do not want to be in that league-these factors ought to be born in mind. It also ought to be remembered that it has been the common experience of every industrialised country that in a time of recession one's revenues fall and one's outlays increase simply because there is less activity, less tax is collected and there are larger social security payments that have to be met on the expenditure side of the Budget. What is happening to the Australian economy at present is duplicating what is happening in other areas of the world economy. I do not pretend that the Australian economy is not going through very difficult circumstances at the moment. That is self-evident. I believe that, in concert with the State governments, we made a significant stride forward yesterday. It is regrettable that the only group at a political level in Australia that appears to want nothing at all to do with what happened yesterday is the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. Even its colleagues at the State level who are in government know darned well that what was done yesterday will make a valuable contribution to improving the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is about the enormous blowout that has occurred to the deficit-a deficit which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is now speaking of as likely to be in the order of $4 billion by the end of this financial year. I do not think that the argument of the Opposition was so much that it is all that frightening to have a deficit which is 2 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product-I certainly did not hear the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) suggest that. I think the criticism that the Opposition has of the Government in respect of the deficit is that it is a deficit that was not forecast in the Budget Papers. Certainly it is a deficit arrived at almost by accident. It is a deficit which may perhaps have been arrived at as a part of a kind of political accident because the Budget this year, insofar as it was devised-it would appear to be mostly patched together-was devised in a heavily political context, as every Budget of any Fraser Government has been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year the political context was that of the election. The Government put together a Budget which was going to produce a number of goodies to be delivered in the period before Christmas and within which time an election could be held. Frankly, the Government, the Treasurer and presumably senior levels of the Treasury were after a while perhaps not too concerned about much else. That is what they were dealing with. I think John Stone indicated some views he had about that. The Budget got under way but very quickly fell apart. What the Treasurer is trying to suggest to us is that it is a matter of no moment for a Budget, within three or four months, literally to fall apart. The economy, which was in a very serious situation earlier this year, since the Budget has been brought down is moving to a state of near collapse. The Treasurer would argue that it is a matter of no moment that the Budget that was devised had nothing to do with the central reality of Australian society today, which is that we are in a depression, with mass unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> It would seem to me that it would need an extraordinarily successful Treasurer to persuade the Parliament or the country that he knew what he was about when he devised the Budget in August this year-a year in which we are likely to see unemployment reach at least 700,000 people. There we are talking about official figures, not about the hidden unemployed on top of that. How can he say that he anticipated nothing of the dramatic nature of these consequences? That would be quite extraordinary. I think it is not extraordinary when we look at conservative governments and conservative treasurers. In this country Treasury, governments, and Treasurers have never been concerned about economic planning. They have never been seriously concerned about seeking to manage the economy, in perhaps the way that many governments within the European context might have been. They have always been much more susceptible to political interest. What this Budget was about was political interest, namely, the neck of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Now the country is having to live with the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is well to reinforce just how bad the situation is. I would have thought governments were about not simply addressing the statistics but addressing problems facing people within this country. What the statistics of the last 12 months and in prospect indicate is massive suffering for Australian people. The honourable member for Gellibrand referred to what had happened in relation to the housing industry, where home building approvals fell 34 per cent between September 1981 and September 1982 by a third. A fall of that scale and magnitude means that across Australia thousands of people who require housing are not getting it. If we put that fact alongside the fact that no government has ever been meaner than the Fraser Government in relation to public housing we have what adds up to a housing crisis within this country. That impacts upon thousands and thousands of families right across the country. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at real private consumption expenditure growth in this country it is estimated that that could slow to around 1 1/2 per cent in 1982-83. That is what the Budget suggested. The value of retail sales, seasonally adjusted for the September quarter, was only 0.8 per cent higher than for the June quarter. Since the consumer price index rose 3.5 per cent in the September quarter the real value of retail sales fell substantially. Again that is just a figure. What it amounts to is a dramatic decline in demand. Because goods and services are not selling through those retail outlets it means that the factories which produce these goods are in a situation of dramatic decline. The Treasurer may not have much feeling for this. However, I am sure honourable members have visited factories and seen people being put off and heard people saying that their factories are being used by the big retailers as warehouses and that, having been through periods of uncertainty, they are now faced with a situation of not knowing whether they will ever work again in those factories. That is not statistics. That is a result of terrible planning. It indicates the Government is not concerned about the level of demand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has been saying that it is crucial to keep up demand. When the Opposition says that it is not coming up with some kind of new idea because fundamental to economic policy throughout the postwar period has been the view that if we are concerned about employment levels of aggregate demand have to be maintained. If the Budget this year had been designed to do that-that was why we had a $4 billion deficit in prospect-perhaps one might be a bit sympathetic. There was nothing in the Budget strategy to suggest that what the Government was on about was boosting demand so that people would be placed back into employment . The crisis that this country faces is a crisis for people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer suggests that the Opposition is not interested in profits but is interested only in employment, something quite distinct from profit. If we look at what is happening to investment in this country we can recognise quite clearly that business is not investing and that this is resulting in the lack of new jobs. There has been a dramatic deterioration in investment. I do not think anyone would suggest that there is no relationship at all between profits and investment. Nor can we simply sustain the argument that we should somehow arrange a dramatic wage cut throughout the Australian economy. Indeed, that is what the Government is about. It is not about a pause or a freeze in wages but it is about a real wage cut. I very much doubt that as a result of that real wage cut there will be increased profits because there will also be a dramatic further decline in demand. That is what all the businesses tell me they are concerned about-not the wages paid. They are concerned about the lack of demand in the market place. Even assuming that paradoxically, as a result of reducing demand, somehow there will be some increase in profits, who is to say that that profit will be invested in a way that will get people back to work? That is nothing more than the rhetoric of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not in this exercise of so-called wage freeze or wage cut, as I would call it. It has no strategy designed to create employment. The Government simply is hoping that cutting back people's wages and theoretically increasing profits will somehow increase employment. If the Government really had been seriously concerned about employment it would have met the Premiers' request for increased loan funds to boost capital works and to develop a capital works program that was genuinely designed to lead to a reconstruction of the Australian economy. However, that would involve a plan, not an ad hoc gimmick devised in a few days for the purpose of seeking to win a by-election. That is a gimmick which will explode very quickly and about which I would imagine in the next few months we will hear very little more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate to show that the Australian Labor Party has demonstrated once again its ignorance of the economic situation and its inability to control or handle it. We can listen all day to the problems but it is the answers to those problems that we are seeking from this House and this Government. The Flinders by-election last weekend was a fair reflection of the fact that the people of Australia realise that the Labor Party has no economic policy. One of the decisions it has made since then is to increase the staff of its spokesman on Treasury matters to help him explain his policies. I think that in itself is an indictment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very important for us to realise that a Budget strategy is based on the best advice at the time of its presentation, with reasonable forecasts. If the Opposition were put in the same situation as the Government it would have to look at the reasons for the Budget blowout. I suggest to the Opposition and to the House that no aspect of that blowout in the Budget was at the discretion of this Government or of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). All the matters which have contributed to it-the drought, unemployment, international competition and the international economic situation-have worsened since the Budget. I would like to pick up a few comments from the Opposition. By its own admission its Budget strategy at the time of the presentation of the Government's Budget involved a deficit of some $4 billion. Other estimates have put its deficit at $5 billion or $6 billion based on the situation at that time. I ask the Opposition what its strategy would be. The answer can be seen from the response to the Budget by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) when he implied that the Labor Party would spend its way out of the problem; in other words, it would print more money and have no concern for the inflationary impact of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing that worries me is that the Opposition now says that it is not all that frightened by a large Budget deficit. This is where I feel it is very important to draw a distinction between Labor politics and our politics. It is very important that the deficit should be strictly controlled because if it expands beyond reasonable limits all we are doing is spending in our generation what future generations will have to pay back. That is a very critical point. I would hate to see any members opposite involved in company management and trying to run a business at a profit because they would be trying to spend their way out and would not be looking for reasonable options. I mentioned the drought. We should not forget the real and deep implications of that for the people of Australia. It is with some reluctance that I draw your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the fact that all members of the Opposition, except one, have retired from the chamber without staying to listen to the real facts and figures . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is their matter of public importance. With the exception of one member, they are not here to participate. The drought has had a large impact on the blowing out of the Budget. The figures presented suggest that over $300m has been spent in drought relief alone, with $50m being spent on natural disaster relief associated with it. The flow-on effect is a lower consumer demand from that sector for motor vehicles and housing, which show us how great and difficult the situation is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also want to talk about international competitiveness. Without doubt the people of Australia have realised at long last that we have priced ourselves out of international competition. I am very closely associated with many great industries in Queensland, including the mining, sugar, beef and dairying industries. They are all facing serious international competition in a market in which they cannot adjust their prices. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the tobacco industry. It must be realised that we can put our economy on a proper footing only by being competitive in an international market in which we must trade to survive. No government has done more in regard to international competition than this one. At the recent General Agreement on Tariff and Trade conference the Commonwealth of Australia pressed the point that we cannot trade in the open market if heavily subsidised European Economic Community products are to compete with us. This affects our main exports, particularly our grain and sugar and many of our other primary products. An inability to trade against fair competition will have of course an effect on the blowing out of the Budget figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another aspect of the change in Budget philosophy is the unemployment situation . I have said for many years that there is only one problem with Australians: We are living at a standard that the country cannot afford. At long last, with the impact and the influence of the drought, this is being realised and appreciated. The figures for the last quarter are very revealing. They point out the result of the drought by showing that gross farm product in the quarter to September fell by 5.1 per cent. I suggest that the worst of the impact of the drought was not shown in those figures; that is yet to come. Over 12 months the figure declined by one per cent. Another revealing factor in the quarter's figures was that gross non-farm product increased by 0.1 per cent. That is really no growth at all. The reason for that 0.1 per cent growth was that wages, salaries and allowances, which go to make up that figure, increased by 16.9 per cent while company profits-the surplus cash flow from companies-declined by 13.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia we have an economic pie. Over the last 12 months that pie has undoubtedly shrunk, and the situation cannot be tolerated in which one sector of the community feels it can get in real terms the same sized slice of that pie as previously without consideration for the rest of the community. That situation has meant that business cannot cope with declining profits and cannot employ. Basically, labour is pricing itself out of the market. That is why I applaud the positive attempt being made to bring about a wages pause. But a wages pause in itself is not an answer to all the problems that I see at the moment. It is significant that that wages pause in one form or another has been accepted by all State governments and, I understand, by the employer associations. It remains for the unions to declare their situation through the Australian Council of Trade Unions in further talks this week. But a pause has been accepted, whether it be for six months or 12 months. That pause will enable the people of Australia to come to grips with what we are trying to say. If we need an economic philosophy at this moment, it is that each Australian should take a little less and give a little more. If that philosophy were expounded throughout Australia there would be some hope for us to correct our internal situation in spite of world economic conditions and world competition. </PARA>
<PARA> The pause is just a start for something I would like to have looked at further and developed. If after the pause the base on which we pay wages and salaries is not corrected we will not have achieved anything. Recently I had the opportunity to go to America to see the industrial situation there. As an honourable member said earlier today, the Americans are confounded by the situation in Australia whereby people are paid more to go on holiday than to be kept in employment. In addition to that we grant our workers four weeks' paid leave in comparison with the maximum of two weeks which is granted in America. In Australia a 17 1/2 per cent holiday loading is payable and penalty rates apply after an eight-hour working day. That is one of the other problems. Australian workers do not need first to work 40 hours whereas overseas the overtime penalty rate applies only after a person has worked his 40 hours. Certainly if industry responds to the challenge that has been set to it now, employment numbers will come up as a result of the savings by the Commonwealth and the States in their Public Service wage bills. There will also be the opportunity for business, if we allow it to be more profitable, to employ in a like fashion. </PARA>

<TITLE>Proposed Student Loans Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the introduction of a comprehensive student loans scheme will:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Restrict Access to Education-People from poorer backgrounds will be deterred from studying by the prospect of incurring large debts. These people, if they enrol, will be forced to amass loan debts. Richer students do not face this handicap.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Undermine the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme-TEAS should cover the basic living costs of students. Currently the scheme only assists 38 per cent of full-time students and the maximum level of TEAS is a mere $49.67. Government statements indicate TEAS will be further downgraded if loans are introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Disadvantage Women-Women students would be disadvantaged by a loans scheme as they have a lesser ability to repay loan debts, because on average women earn less and have a higher unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Disadvantage Mature-Age Students-Usually mature age students forgo income to study and already have large financial commitments. They could not return to study if it meant incurring substantial debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Distort Educational Choices-Mounting loan debts would force students into studying shorter courses or not continuing with post-graduate study.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Result in Massive Attrition Rates-Students will attempt to undertake extensive part-time work or overload courses to minimise their loans, increased failure rates will result forcing students to 'drop-out' rather than continuing study and increase their debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Cause Administrative and Financial Difficulties-Overseas experience shows high default rates will occur on student loans. Government money will be channelled away from TEAS to paying off banks. The Government will also bear the administrative burden of pursuing defaulters.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the proposed student loans scheme will have disastrous effects on tertiary education, which we believe benefits the whole community, not just the individual student.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives will reject the introduction of a student loans scheme.</PARA>

<PARA> That the members of the Women's Services of the 1939-45 War not at present considered eligible for Defence Service Home Loans should qualify as '' Australian Soldiers'' under the Defence Service Homes Act. They volunteered for service with the Naval, Military and Air Forces, serving wherever they were sent in whatever capacity they were required and yet are refused Defence Service Home Loans.</PARA>
<PARA> They took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies which meant to fight His Majesty's enemies, and although not used in actual combat in war zones, they were available for that use and had a sufficiently grave need arisen would have been used, to serve with distinction as have women of other lands.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Acts and Regulations of the period, the women of the Military Forces had enlisted for service anywhere, some of the Naval women to sail in any waters, others with service on warships optional, while the women of the Airforce could have been sent to Papua New Guinea or other territories under the control or care of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Ex-servicemen of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force who volunteered in the 1939-45 War but were not sent to War Zones are granted home loans. Not to grant eligibility to all Ex- servicewomen of 1939-45 War is unjust and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you favourably consider amending the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) (b) (c) (d) of the Principal Act as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pensions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that some single supporting parents are unfairly disadvantaged in having chosen to care for children full-time during the formative years, believing such care was essential to their well-being; and that women without dependent children, and who are under 50 years of age are not eligible for a continuing pension. These women have devoted their whole lives to their families and do not have skills relevant to the present employment situation. Their future prospects, with increasing age and length of time out of the workforce are a deterrent to employers. Skilled workers find it difficult to obtain employment and unskilled workers find it even more difficult. Unemployment benefit was not designed for long term usage and the low rate of payment plus the work tests over a long period of time lead to a general decline in the physical and mental health, with the result that the women are being placed on sickness benefits. Sickness benefits, however, were also designed for short term usage and is unable to provide security for these women.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Amend the Social Services Act to reduce the age of eligibility for a Class B Widow pension from 50 to 40 years; and</PARA>

<TITLE>Tertiary Education Funding</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned students and staff of the James Cook University of North Queensland respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Failure to extend eligibility under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS) and increase the value of TEAS allowances to cover basic living costs will</PARA>
<PARA> (a) continue to deter thousands of Australians from entering tertiary institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) continue to force many of Australia's tertiary students to live in a state of dire poverty.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Introduction of a comprehensive student loans scheme will</PARA>
<PARA> (a) restrict access to education because people from poorer backgrounds will be deterred from studying by the prospect of incurring large debts.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) disadvantage women because on average they earn less and have a higher unemployment rate and disadvantage mature age students because they generally already have large financial commitments.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) undermine TEAS because government statements indicate TEAS will be further downgraded if loans are introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) distort educational choices because students will tend to choose shorter courses and will not go on with postgraduate study.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Introduction of fees for post graduate and second degree students will</PARA>
<PARA> (a) deter many tertiary students from undertaking of continuing such courses of study for purely financial reasons.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) result in the limiting of Australia's capacity to cope with change because fewer people will upgrade their degrees or broaden their fields of knowledge.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CJ4">Mr SHIPTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On 8 September 1981, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence passed a resolution referring to its Sub-Committee A, the Sub- committee on the Pacific Basin, the term of reference: Australian-United States relations. The Sub-Committee was chaired by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) and conducted a wide-ranging inquiry into all the major aspects of Australian-United States relations, including foreign policy, security and defence matters as well as economic and cultural relations. I thank those individuals and government departments who spent time and effort preparing written submissions and giving oral evidence before the Sub-committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The focus of this report is Australia's long standing security relationship with the United States, as embodied in the ANZUS treaty. This report has already been tabled in the Senate and I will not repeat the tabling statement to the House. ANZUS is an important part of a wider Australian-United States relationship which, during the last 30 years, has become increasingly more multifaceted and remains Australia's singlemost important external relationship. Chapter 1 of the report traces the history of the ANZUS pact. In chapter 2, the significance of ANZUS in the light of past events, including the Malaysian- Indonesian confrontation in the early 1960s, is discussed, as are also current Australian and American perceptions of ANZUS and its role, including the extent to which, realistically, Australia could expect assistance under the terms of the treaty should this country ever face a serious threat to its security. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that the mutual security provisions of the ANZUS treaty together represent a stronger assurance of military assistance in the event of an attack on Australian territory than a commitment merely to consult. At the same time, the Committee emphasises that official United States statements of its defence thinking in relation to the Asian Pacific region, as well as United States expectations of Australia's role within the framework of ANZUS, indicate that the United States view of its role in the region precludes direct military involvement except in an extreme situation. I think this position reflects the Guam doctrine. The Committee believes that the official Australian view of ANZUS acknowledges this. </PARA>
<PARA> In chapter 3, the Committee discusses the benefits and costs of ANZUS. There was Press comment on the report when it was tabled in the Senate about Australian-Indonesian relations. The report stresses that no major threat to Australia's security has emerged or is likely to emerge in the short term. On page 65, a paragraph concerning Indonesia states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> Indonesia is one local power well-placed to pose a potential threat . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We should amend that sentence to read 'geographically well placed' to explain the meaning of that paragraph. That paragraph reflects the evidence presented to the Sub-Committee. It discusses a purely hypothetical potential situation that could develop. It does not refer specifically to a potential direct threat from Indonesia but to the possibility that at some stage in the future a regional conflict could develop, such as the Malaysian-Indonesian confrontation in the 1960s, which in turn could affect Australia's interests. I think that has been interpreted out of context by the media. The threat has to be read in the context of the previous report of the Committee entitled 'Threats to Australia's Security'. </PARA>
<PARA> In chapter 3, the Committee concludes that the Australian-United States relationship is, and continues to be, mutually advantageous. It also points out that the United States should take seriously Australia's views on matters of mutual concern where we may have a separate national perspective. In this regard , the Committee endorses the assessment of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The United States adopts this position. In chapter 4, the Committee evaluated what is perhaps the most significant concern in relation to ANZUS that is, the future of the alliance. The report points out that the stability of Australia's own strategic environment is linked in no small measure to the effective involvement of United States interest and policies throughout the region. The Committee believes that differences between the United States and Australia will exist from time to time but that the management of these differences is likely to be conducted in an atmosphere which favours accommodation. That is certainly the history of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's conclusion is, therefore, that the ANZUS alliance remains both useful and necessary and that Australia should remain within its framework. The report emphasises that the security links between Australia and the United States spring from shared values, compatible institutions and objectives and continuing popular support within the Australian community for ANZUS and the wider Western alliance. I think that ANZUS and the relations with the United States are part of one relationship but the whole United States-Australian relationship, of which ANZUS is a part, is part of a wider set of relationships, and that is Australia as a committed member of the Western alliance. ANZUS arose out of the Australian-United States relationship. The relationship did not arise out of ANZUS. I think that is an important point to make. It is a flexible and changing relationship, and that is its strength. </PARA>
<PARA> The reference is a continuing one. The Committee will consider other aspects of the reference. One aspect I would wish to look at in future is Australia's relations with the United States Congress. The Australian Government enjoys excellent relations, based on mutual respect, with the United States President and Administration. But the United States does not have a Westminster system and the United States Government Administration is not formed from and does not arise out of the Congress; it is separate from it. The executive and legislative power are separate in that country. In our system, of course, they are not. This has led us basically to ignore the importance of the United States Congress in Australian-United States relations. I believe Australia has to work to improve future relations between the Australian Parliament and the United States Congress. The Congress will be receptive to the work that needs to be done. I recently spoke to our Ambassador in Washington, Sir Robert Cotton, and I think he understands the problem well. There needs to be a greater manpower effort put in on Capitol Hill by our embassy in Washington. A mechanism needs to be developed for a permanent and regular exchange of views between members of the Australian Senate and House of Representatives and their United States counterparts. This can only be in the interests of greater understanding between our two nations. In conclusion, I thank Dr Edvi-Illes and Mr Dan Barton of the Committee's secretariat for their assistance and hard work in the preparation of the report. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Without wishing to traverse the contents of the report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence concerning the ANZUS Alliance, I wish to add something to it. Just as important as the actual terms of the ANZUS treaty are the potential psychological factors of any changes which would have an effect, to my mind, on world peace which, currently, to a large extent is due to the balance of power between the two super powers. The greatest threat to peace would be a belief by the Soviet Union that it could win a quick war. Similarly, in the late 1930s-1938-39-Hitler thought we would not stand by Poland following the Munich agreement, the invasion of Czechoslovakia and the Hitler-Stalin pact. A decision by Australia to cancel ANZUS would be seen by the Soviet Union as a signal that its drive to the south, whether from Vietnam or through Iran, would not be opposed. In fact, such action by Australia and New Zealand could well persuade the United States population to become more isolationist and to allow the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to speed up its imperialist drive which has been going on ever since the last war. If this happened it would ultimately lead to war. It is, therefore, important that our signals to the Soviet Union are clear. This also applies to other allies of the United States such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the general debate on matters of neutralism, unilateral disarmament and alliances with the United States, I shall read into Hansard part of a speech made recently by James Callaghan, the last Labour Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. According to the London Times, on 18 November 1982, in an address to the Cardiff Fabian Society, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a Labour Government should retain Polaris, allow cruise, keep the American bases, and concentrate its attention on multilateral disarmament talks, comprehensive test-ban negotiations and the pursuit of non-proliferation. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Why should we unilaterally give away any bargaining counters whilst negotiations are in progress?' Mr Callaghan said. 'To do so would be to hand to the Soviet Union something valuable with no prospect of anything in exchange. The Soviet Union would say ''thank you'' and pocket it.'</PARA>
<PARA>According to the article, Mr Callaghan said that some say:</PARA>
<PARA> Abandon our nuclear weapons, close down our nuclear bases in this country, and send the Americans back home. If we do, goes the argument, we shall be safe from attack and, as a bonus, other countries will be so impressed that they will follow our lead. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Such a policy was attractive, but wrong, and Mr Callaghan questioned whether Britain could retain its self-respect, given such a policy, if it continued to rely on Nato nuclear protection. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Callaghan is reported as asking:</PARA>
<PARA> How could we escape attack in any future war, by any weapons the enemy might think necessary to reduce us?</PARA>
<PARA>He is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Unilateral disarmament does not offer a way out. The only real safety for British people is through collective security and multilateral agreement to disarm the nuclear and conventional arsenals of both sides. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> He also said that any unilateral action, which would be certain to damage Anglo -American friendship, might eventually lead to the 'unravelling of NATO on the mainland of Europe'. If America was provoked into isolationism, the alliance would be destabilised, and it would even be possible that West Germany might be forced to seek closer links with East Germany. </PARA>
<PARA> He said that everyone shared the unilateralists' horror of nuclear war. But he concluded: 'The task for a Labour Government is to secure a series of comprehensive multilateral agreements to achieve our ends. That way lies safety for the British people, and for the world.'</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, if we send the wrong signals to the world by changing our attitude to ANZUS-I am not suggesting that any significant proportion of the Australian population would want to do that-some of the weaker countries in our area might be prepared to do deals with the Soviet Union or the Soviet Union's satellite of Vietnam. I think it is terribly important to consider that matter of signals and the matter of making it quite clear that we stand by ANZUS. It is in our interests. It is in the interests of the United States. I think it is much more in our interests than it is in the interests of the United States. Most importantly, it is in the interests of the free world and people who want to continue to be able to make decisions as to their lifestyle freely, in the sort of democratic pattern which we are used to and which obviously is not applicable to the Soviet Union and its satellites. Therefore, it is terribly important for us to continue to emphasise our commitment to the ANZUS alliance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I must confess that I was away during the consideration by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence of the report on the ANZUS Alliance. First of all I want to associate myself with two items of the dissenting report. I agree with one of the statements in the introduction to the report which reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . Australia's basic objective is to fulfil its commitment to the Alliance, with due regard to our national interest and the maintenance of our national sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA>I note the presence in the chamber of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) who is again a member of the Ministry and who will recall some of the observations I have made over the years about the North West Cape agreement and the abject derogation of Australian sovereignty in that agreement, particularly in the exchange of letters between the United States Ambassador, Mr Battle, and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sir Garfield Barwick. So Australia has not always maintained this national interest and notion of sovereignty in our associations with the United States. We all remember the very demeaning slogan that was mouthed by one of our Prime Ministers about being 'All the way with LBJ '. </PARA>
<PARA> What I want to raise tonight is what I perceive as the tone of the report which gives an unreal expectation about the alliance. I believe that from the viewpoint of both sides of Parliament and of Australia this is dangerous. I quote United States Under-Secretary of State, Mr Averell Harriman who, in 1963, when the Australian Government of the day was discussing with the United States Administration the question of confrontation and what would be the impact of loss of life or confrontation between the Indonesians and Australians, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Defence agreements are not precise as to military movements or diplomatic activity. There is always a grey area. </PARA>
<PARA>I also recall the following words of President Nixon:</PARA>
<PARA> Our interests must shape our commitments rather than the other way around. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out to the House that we should not delude ourselves that ANZUS is a watertight commitment by the United States. I think it is only in the field of foreign affairs that we recognise that the United States will not assume responsibilities it does not see as being in its interests. The report details periods when Australia was concerned about the United States commitment. I need only to mention the confrontation involved in the Indonesians' claim to West Irian. I think we should look at those sections of the report very carefully, and should heed the experiences we went through in that period. Successive United States administrations have made it clear that possible commitments under ANZUS can arise only in the context of the central power balance. This follows from the Guam statements of President Nixon that United States allies are expected to handle in their own way regional disputes that are not associated with the central power balance. I want to raise a particular reservation in the report-unfortunately I was not in the discussions of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee to raise this-which appears on page 67. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not see any distortion of Australia's defence policy resulting from the ANZUS Alliance. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that if one examines Australia's role over the years one finds that Australia has been a junior partner and has supplied military aid to both the United Kingdom-Great Britain in those days-and the United States, where our force structure was in fact shaped by the alliance. We slotted in our units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to a larger command. They were reponsible for the command and also the logistics of our forces. I believe that if we are dealing with Australia as having a self-reliant defence force we have to make decisions that are outside any alliance that we may have. I think this is brought home to us in the sense that the United States expects us to do that. I fear that over the last couple of years there have been indications that the Government has moved away from this notion of self-reliance and is again taking the part of a junior partner in the alliance operations. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not happy about the sections of the report dealing with the Indian Ocean. We should keep in mind our interests in relation to the north-west Indian Ocean are essentially different, and can be different, from those of other countries because we are Australians. That is an area which is, in fact, closer to Europe than to Australia. I believe that in determining our own defence force structure we cannot commit ourselves outside our competence to carry out commitments. Our first function-I believe this is a function that the United States expects of us -is to be able to look after our own affairs in our area. I associate with these remarks the attitude of the present Secretary of the Department of Defence who has pointed out that we cannot undertake commitments well outside our direct area of influence. I think this is important to consider in terms of our commitment to ANZUS. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to repeal section 14 of that Act. Section 14 of the Act imposes an obligation on the Minister not to take action which is inconsistent with the obligations of Australia under international agreements relating to trade. The repeal of this section is principally designed to remove for practical purposes the grounds for any application to the Australian courts raising the issue of Australia's non- compliance with international agreements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade codes and any bilaterial agreements, relating to anti-dumping and countervailing duty action. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act enable the Government to take anti-dumping and contervailing duty action against imports. Both actions are designed to offset export prices which are not established on a fair commercial basis. Australia is a signatory to the GATT, and the related codes which establish rules of conduct for anti-dumping and countervailing actions. The codes, which elaborate on the relevant provisions of the GATT, were part of the outcome of the multilateral Trade Negotiations, Tokyo Round, concluded in 1979. Australia acceded to the Subsidies and Countervailing Duties Code on 21 September 1982 and to the Anti-Dumping Code on 21 October 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The codes require that signatories must take all necessary steps to ensure that their domestic legislation conforms with the provisions of the codes. The Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act was amended in 1981 so that it conforms with the codes. Anti-dumping or countervailing duties cannot be imposed unless it is determined by the relevant authority in the importing country that the goods in question have been dumped-that is, exported at less than normal prices in the country of export or subsidised and as a result an industry in the importing country has been injured or threatened with injury. The codes also limit the extent of countervailing or anti-dumping action to an amount equal to the amount of subsidy or of dumping or the extent to which injury is occurring, whichever is the less. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a preliminary affirmative finding of dumping or subsidisation is made by the Department of Industry and Commerce as the relevant authority and there is evidence of material injury or threat of material injury to the domestic industry, the GATT anti-dumping and subsidies and countervailing duties codes permit the taking of provisional action in the form of securities which in Australia are taken under the provisions of section 42 of the Customs Act. The Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act has facilitated proceedings for injunctive relief in these matters before the Federal Court of Australia. The related Customs Securities (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill which I will introduce shortly contains a provision to remove from the scope of that Act decisions to take securities under the Customs Act as provisional anti-dumping and countervailing measures. That provision will supersede the regulations with similar effect introduced on 24 November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> In the injunction proceedings before the Court exporters of goods to Australia have used the provisions of section 14 of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping Act) as the basis for arguing that the method by which the Department proceeds to the decision to require provisional anti-dumping and provisional countervailing measures is contrary to Australia's international obligations. Whilst the Department meets the requirements of the codes in principle these arguments have nevertheless enabled interim injunctions to be obtained. As a consequence, the Department has been prevented from taking provisional securities and this has operated to the detriment of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The world wide economic recession has led to a dramatic increase in the number of dumping and countervailing complaints in Australia. The Government is therefore concerned that there should be no impediment to taking quick and effective action to combat unfair trading practices which operate to the detriment of Australian industry. The repeal of section 14 of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act, as proposed by this Bill, will not affect Australia's adherence to the relevant international obligations. The Government's view is that issues concerning Australia's obligations under the international agreements relating to anti-dumping and countervailing duty action are more appropriately considered within the context of the dispute settlement provisions of the particular agreements rather than in the Australian courts. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is twofold. It amends the Customs Act to place beyond doubt that securities may be validly taken under section 42 of that Act for the purposes of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. It also amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act to remove from the scope of that Act decisions made under section 42 of the Customs Act to require and take securities in respect of duty that may be payable under the Customs Tariff (Anti -Dumping) Act. The Customs Tariff (Anti-dumping) Act is the legislation which enables the Government to take anti-dumping and countervailing duty action against imports. This action is designed to offset export prices which are not established on a fair commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a preliminary affirmative finding of dumping or subsidisation is made by the Department of Industry and Commerce and there is evidence of material injury or threat of material injury to the domestic industry, provisional action in the form of securities may be taken under the provisions of section 42 of the Customs Act. The securities are held in accordance with the time limits specified in the Customs Act until, after inquiry, a final decision is made as to whether dumping or countervailing duties are warranted. If the final decision is in the affirmative the securities held are adjusted to the amount of the duty to be imposed. If the decision is that dumping or countervailing duty is not warranted the securities are returned to depositors. </PARA>
<PARA> As a consequence of litigation in the Federal Court the Department has been restrained from taking provisional anti-dumping and countervailing securities in respect of the importation of certain goods into Australia. It has been argued in these proceedings that the terms of section 42 of the Customs Act do not authorise the taking of security for the purpose of protecting Australian industry. The amendments in Clause 4 of the Bill provide an express link between section 42 of the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. This is proposed to remove any doubt as to the validity of requiring securities under the Customs Act for the purposes of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In my second reading speech relating to the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982, I explained how exporters of goods to Australia have been able to use the existing law to prevent the Department from taking provisional securities. The provisions of clause 6 of the Bill are designed to minimise the opportunities to prevent the taking of such securities. Under this clause decisions relating to the taking of the securities will be exempted from the scope of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Regulations with similar effect to this clause became operative on 24 November 1982. The provisions in this bill will, however, supersede those regulations and it is the Government's intention that the regulations will be repealed after this Bill receives royal assent. The Government believes that the removal from judicial review of decisions on provisional securities is essential if anti- dumping and countervailing measures are to be efffective in combating unfair international trading practices which operate to the detriment of Australian industry. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

The Bill provides for the Commonwealth to subsidise the interest charged by banks on approved loans and for the Commonwealth to give guarantees to banks that it will repay outstanding debts on approved loans within prescribed limits. The Bill also covers the eligibility conditions applying to loans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tertiary Student Loans Scheme will enable full time tertiary students who are Australian citizens or permanent residents to borrow between $500 and $1,000 , per annum from banks to help pay for their education and living expenses while studying. Students will be able to borrow up to $8,000 over the total period of their study. </PARA>
<PARA> Many full time students will be eligible for approved loans by virtue of their entitlement to benefits under various Commonwealth student assistance schemes. These schemes are: The Commonwealth Postgraduate Awards Scheme, the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme known as TEAS, the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme and the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme. The Tertiary Student Loans Scheme will provide an additional source of support for eligible students receiving benefits under these schemes. Other full time students will qualify for loans providing they satisfy a simple means test, the details of which have already been announced in the Budget context. These details will be prescribed in regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has demonstrated its strong continuing support for student assistance schemes by its decision to increase substantially allowance levels and relax means tests for 1983. The loans scheme will provide another option for students. The interest rate to apply to loans will be the maximum rate permissible for advances by banks of less than $100,000-currently 14.5 per cent per annum-reduced by 5 percentage points by a Commonwealth subsidy. The Commonwealth will provide banks with guarantees amounting to $50m per annum on approved loans but the banks will be expected to take all reasonable steps to obtain repayments from defaulting borrowers before the Commonwealth honours guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme will be administered by the Commonwealth Department of Education in conjunction with the banks and tertiary institutions, and the detailed terms and conditions for approved loans will be prescribed in regulations. Funds to meet payments by the Commonwealth of interest subsidies and the repayments of any defaulted loans will be provided for through the general appropriation legislation. For this financial year the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1982-83 provides $150,000 for these purposes. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will recall that on the advice of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission the Government has required certain colleges of advanced education to enter into amalgamation arrangements aimed at bringing about larger consolidated institutions. Such institutions are better able to handle problems associated with change and can offer students a wider range of educational choice and a higher quality of educational program. Some economies of scale also exist, although such considerations were not the primary reasons behind the Government's decision to require amalgamations. Twenty-six of the 30 institutions concerned have now entered into acceptable arrangements. The Government believes that these amalgamations will be successful and that higher education will be strengthened in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> There are four colleges yet to finalise acceptable arrangements. These are the Armidale, Newcastle and Milperra colleges of advanced education and the Hawthorn Institute of Education. In respect of Armidale and Newcastle it is expected that the New South Wales Government will legislate for the amalgamation of each college of advanced education with the relevant local university following the passage of the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill through the Commonwealth Parliament. The nature of the final amalgamation arrangements has yet to be determined in respect of Milperra and Hawthorn. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recognised that for maximum effectiveness the precise arrangements for amalgamations should reflect local circumstances and are, therefore, best determined at the local level. The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill requires the Minister for Education to provide funds for the operation of institutions in 1983 only when he is satisfied that suitable amalgamation arrangements are in hand. Essentially, the amendment which I have moved enables a broader intepretation to be taken as to what constitutes a satisfactory amalgamation. In this respect it seeks to take account of the latest thinking of the State governments concerned as to how the Commonwealth's requirements may be met for the two remaining institutions. In summary, the amendment recognises that a suitable amalgamation might be affected by an institution assuming certain of the teaching responsibilities of another institution. Such an arrangement might well meet the Commonwealth's requirements in a way which had not been anticipated earlier in the process. The amendment, therefore, ensures that education rationale remains the central concern of the amalgamation exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> As foreshadowed by the Minister for Education, Senator Peter Baume, during the debate in another place on the Bill, the Government's decision on a wage pause for the next 12 months will, of course, contain any increases in the cost of running tertiary institutions. Under the Government's prospective cost adjustment arrangements, the sums of money specified in the Schedules to the Bill include an allowance for wage and salary increases in 1983 in accordance with earlier decisions. Following the Premiers Conference yesterday, there will now be savings flowing from the wages pause and the Government will, therefore, restrict the rate of advances under the Bill as from the beginning of 1983 to reflect this. A similar course of action will be taken in relation to grants for both government and non-government schools. These reductions in the rate of advances will be formalised by amending legislation during 1983. In the light of the outcome of yesterday's Premiers Conference the Government is giving consideration to spending the consequent savings available to the Commonwealth, including savings with respect to this matter, on worthwhile programs which employ labour. I commend the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution in relation to the duration of the House of Representatives, the holding of elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives and the appointment and termination of the appointment of Ministers of State. The Bill has already passed the Senate. It was the subject of an amendment in that chamber. It is a Bill that was proposed by Senator Gareth Evans, a member of the Australian Labor Party. I say at the outset that of course this is a Bill that has been proposed in the knowledge that we are in opposition. However, we hope that the Government of the day will agree to some constitutional amendments. Even though we are in opposition we hope that the proposal the Government will agree to in the Bill, a fixed term for the House of Representatives. It is a reasonable and rational proposal to be submitted to the people for approval, as it must be if there is to be a change. </PARA>
<PARA> When Labor becomes the Government of Australia it will offer a much wider package of constitutional reform. Our party for some time has been urging that the people of Australia have a chance to improve the Constitution. We urge the Government to bring it out of the horse and buggy days of the last century into the modern era in which we have to face national and international problems that were in no way envisaged at the time the Constitution was drafted-the 1890s. We hope to get not only the politicians involved in conventions and discussions as to the best way to improve our Constitution but also the rest of the people of Australia. They should be involved and asked as to how they see their charter being brought up to date. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a new Constitution ought to have a Bill of Rights in it. In any rational democracy the people are entitled to have rights as against a government. Those rights ought to be enshrined in the Constitution. Even though this is a first step it is a very excellent step. The Senate has approved of that idea in the form of the Bill that we are now to deal with. I was reminded by Senator Gareth Evans that the Government in the Senate opposed the Bill at all its stages. Nevertheless in the Senate, in the form in which it has now been received by us, it received very substantial cross-party support. The Labor Party was joined at the third reading not only by the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine but also by six members of the Liberal Party. Also the Bill at all its stages had strong and consistent support in newspapers and from respected people interested in constitutional reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has no political content in the sense that it might be of advantage or disadvantage to one side or the other. The real thrust of this legislation is to give some stability to the House of Representatives. Section 28 of the Constitution presently provides that the House of Representatives, the people's House, is entitled to remain for a period of three years. Of course, that has not happened. There has been the inevitability of having to deal with a hostile Senate. Prime Ministers, because of their own personal whims, might wish to cut short the normal life cycle of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of record that since the Second World War the average life of the House of Representatives has not been three years but two years four months. As one of those members left over from the Whitlam era I remind the House that when we were elected to Government in 1972 we faced continual threats of having to go back to the people simply because we had a hostile Senate. In fact we faced elections in 1974 and 1975. As Government members knew-we did not-the House of Representatives was dissolved early in 1977.The dissolution in 1977 was obviously related to the fact that the Opposition at the time was going to change its leadership or something of that nature, and it created dreadful problems for our society. It virtually destroyed the reputation of one man who held the office of Governor-General and, of course, it also affected the person who held the position of Chief Justice. Incredible damage was done not to those people as such but to the very society which we are trying to suggest to the people is strong, efficient and fair. We are very mindful of the fact that if the people elect a government according to the Constitution-for three years-that government ought to remain in office for three years and ought not to be removed by some political force, which is the normal political force of an Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate was originally conceived as a House that would not be in any way aligned, motivated or affected by party politics. That was an unreal and idealistic view. To their credit, everybody has a political position. Senators are now part and parcel of the professional political arena of the Parliament. They come to party meetings, they take part in party discussions and they abide by party deliberations. It is nonsensical to think that an Opposition in the House of Representatives would not exercise its political muscle and power in the Senate when it had the numbers there because the method of election and the timing of Senate elections are different. This Bill is proposed in the savage knowledge that what happened in 1974-75 should never be repeated. But it can be repeated, because the Bill deals only with a fixed term for the House of Representatives. The term envisaged by the Bill is three years and elections would be held on a fixed date, namely, the third Saturday in November. The life of a parliament would expire in the previous October. There have to be exceptions to that. So naturally and properly the Bill provides that if a government no longer has the confidence of the House it cannot remain in office, which no government would do. The Bill contains a provision for an election if a government loses the confidence of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot avoid the question of a double dissolution, nor should we. Section 57 of the Constitution provides that if there is a disagreement between the Houses, and the Government is adamant in that disagreement, there shall be an election to decide the issue. Under this Bill that can still happen. Of course, if under this proposed legislation that should happen, the Government and some senators would hold office for only the balance of the term available. In other words, if a government were elected for three years and after two years there were a double dissolution, under this proposal the terms of the Government and of the senators first elected would expire after 12 months. The Bill contains a provision for that acceleration of events and also provides a sanction whereby the Senate would not be so anxious to be difficult if it had to face up to the fact that its terms would not be for six years but would be the life of two terms of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> A memorandum has been circulated setting out what Senator Evans thinks the Government should address its mind to. He makes the point that the problems are related to the utter lack of stability and predictability in the Australian electoral cycle. We knew that. As a matter of record, we were elected in December 1972 and were under threat of not getting Supply in 1973. That was the year of our very first Budget. The supplementary Supply Bills of 1974 were also under threat, so we had to have a double dissolution. The Supply of 1974 was also under threat and, of course, the Supply of 1975 was not even conceded. We recall the tremendous tension that prevailed. </PARA>
<PARA> I think you would almost smile now, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you looked at the proposals of the then Senate which said that it could not give that Government life in political terms because of the rising unemployment at that time. When we consider that more than 560,000 people are unemployed now, we wonder whether the Senate might send the present Government out to the people on that basis. That was the pretext that was used on the previous occasions. Another was the dreadful inflation and yet another the suggestion that the deficit was getting a little out of hand. We are now looking at a deficit of $4 billion. We understand that government has to face the people but it should not be at the whim and the cavalier suggestion of a Senate with resolutions which have no bona fides at all . We still smile at those senators and former senators who said that they were judging us on our merits. We know that they participated in the party room discussion at which they were told: 'See whether you can get rid of that Government as soon as possible'. We know that they voted in accordance with political dictates. The concept of this legislation is to try to overcome this sort of cynicism. </PARA>
<PARA> I make another point. Why was an early election held in 1977? It was simply because the Australian Labor Party was likely to change its leader and the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) thought that it was so much easier to beat the leader we had in 1975 if he was still the leader in 1977. We should have gone through until 1978. But that was the real rationale. Speeches that were made in Queensland at the time readily identified that rationale. It has brought about a cynicism as to what we are all about in this place. The people are sick and tired of the number of elections. They just cannot understand how we can be making any progress by continually having elections, particularly in the present economic climate. They are looking for some national concepts. This is where Australia is so bereft at present. It has no national spirit; it is governed, or over-governed, by at least eight governments at present. The people are out of their minds and fed up to the neck because what we would call 'some administration' is costing the earth. They say that they are dreadfully over- governed, and they are right. We can never get them from this position to that of looking at a new constitution, which I think they would fairly draft on a non -political basis, with the following concept: 'We will elect the governments and they will remain for the period we determine'. As a matter of interest, I think public opinion would now be that a four-year term is better than a three-year term. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to have a Senate. Everybody agrees that we should have a Senate as a House of legitimate review, not a House of confrontation or a House of rejection , which it has become. If we adopted a new method of electing members of the Senate, namely, on a first-past-the-post basis rather than on the basis of proportional representation, we might get more political stability in this area; but we certainly would not get the genuine House of review or the genuine contribution that minority groups are entitled to have, which proportional representation guarantees. We need to wake up and be alert to the fact that we have a precious element called democracy. We can lose it if we go through the political mechanisms of the sheer, abrupt use of power or ambush in a Senate which is anxious always to send the House of Representatives back to the people but which would not dare to go to the people itself. That is still the unfortunate position in which we find ourselves. An effort was made in the original draft of this Bill to provide that, in terms of Supply, section 53 would not give the Senate the power which it now has to reject or not grant supply. We should bear in mind that in that context the word 'reject' does not appear in section 53. It appeared in the original draft of the Constitution and was deleted because the forefathers, in their wisdom, said that we cannot have two financial Houses, and that finance-in other words, tax-has to come from the House of the people. That was a legitimate and valid proposition. But because it did not say that the Senate shall not reject Supply, which it could have done because it assumed that by removal of the word 'reject' the Senate would not threaten Supply, during the period 1972-75 we had to face the fact that Supply was threatened and in fact not granted. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst this Bill set out to say that the Senate would not do that, the Senate would not let that provision remain in the Bill, and it has been deleted from it . So we still run the dreadful gauntlet of a hostile Senate not giving a government supply and may face continual elections, a situation which this Bill cannot correct. This matter has been discussed by various constitutional conventions. The great problem with those conventions, as I said, is that they are always attended by members of parliament, both Federal and State. Naturally, those people will fight to hold their present preserve. The people of Australia do not have any input at all. It was interesting at the Perth convention to note that we in the Labor Party were asking why we need to give the Senate the power to reject Supply. Democracy is destroyed if the Senate can continually reject Supply for a government which basically needs Supply every six months. The unfortunate situation could develop in which a government could continually be returned to the people and re-elected and the Senate may not do anything about it. That would be a nonsensical situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We proposed suggesting to the people of Australia, on a non-party basis, that the Senate not have those ridiculous powers. Sir Charles Court put a somewhat doubtful amendment. He said that if that were to happen there ought to be a double dissolution and that it would be a sanction on the Senate. Of course, a re-election might still give the same result because the method of election is different. Proportional representation allows for minorities in the Senate. It does not allow for that anywhere else. We could well find that the Senate would still be just as difficult and the nation would become ungovernable. If we were not to give finance to a government in the normal way it would not be able to govern. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 53 of the Constitution-I am speaking from memory-refers to the ordinary annual services of government. It does not refer to anything special; just annual services. It refers to the continuity of government. Why should a Senate be allowed to adopt the past practice of using all sorts of mechanisms to suggest that because the economy was not going right, because inflation and unemployment were too high, a government should not get the ordinary annual appropriation? That would mean that public servants could not be paid, no money could go to the States, every school would have to close, and hospitals could not function. In other words we would have anarchy. But that was the rationale at the time. The Court amendment was no solution because no State government would be able to function if this sort of position were deemed to be the way to play the political game in Australia. If upper houses, wherever they exist, have the power to refuse Supply we will get these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> This nation is bedevilled enough at present. I suggest, purely on the basis of sheer intelligence in support of the principle of democracy, that we ought to have some clear indication of that what we are about in this nation is protecting people's rights. When people exercise their right to elect a government we should not destroy it on the basis that perhaps they have changed their minds in the interim. It is difficult for a government always to maintain popularity during its term if it has to introduce taxation measures. The political climate can change within three years. If the Senate is always to seize on the fact that the gallup polls show that this is the right time to remove the government we will find that it will never get Supply. The government might be anxious to impose some additional tax which the Senate, out of sheer devilment, decides not to give it at that time and wants to see whether that government can win an election now because it might not be so popular. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally speaking the drafting satisfies the substantial point raised about the treatment of Australian Government Employment as an industry for purposes of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on, nevertheless to express some reservations about the amendment. My Department has replied to that letter. The gist of the reply is that we can see no reason to depart from what is in the amendment now proposed. I have shown the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) the latest correspondence, just as he has seen the earlier letters between the ACOA and me. I therefore commend the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> Bill (on motion by Mr Macphee)-by leave-read a third time.</PARA>
<PARA> All those judgments by the Senate would be political judgments. They would not be based on fairness, equity or democracy but on the continual struggle for power and supremacy. The fixed term parliament proposals give us some indirect solution. It is not the best solution. Senator Evans admits that. He said that the legislation is the second best solution. It does not involve talking about the past, the errors or the mistakes. It is trying to offer some reasonable alternative. We still face the overwhelming problem that the power of Supply can be destructively exercised. But the real issue is that the basic constitutional prohibition of premature elections would make the blocking of Supply perhaps pointless and politically counter-productive. To the extent that the basic prohibition could be avoided in a particular case-for example, by the existence at the time of the blocking of some deadlocked measure for which the double dissolution trigger was already cocked-the argument is that the rule that an incoming government could only serve out the term of the predecessor would operate as an overwhelming, practical disincentive to the Senate pursuing the matter. I think that is right.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for a basic fixed term and it amends section 28 of the Constitution. There are further amendments to indicate clearly that the Senate terms are equivalent to two House of Representatives terms. The conditions are created for Senate elections to be always held at the same time as House of Representatives elections. There are further amendments to the Constitution to ensure that the writs for House and Senate elections are issued at the proper time. I make the point that one could have the House of Representatives passing a no confidence motion. If that happened there would have to be an election for the House of Representatives but it would be only for the balance of the term.</PARA>
<PARA> One can think of situations which perhaps show gaps in this Bill on which we need not dwell because we are basically talking about the positive aspects. One could find extraordinary situations in which one might not have a Prime Minister or the Prime Minister resigns and, therefore, no advice could be given to a Governor-General. But those possibilities are so remote in practical terms that we had better not waste too much time on them. The point we are anxious to make is that there will always be opportunities to remove bad governments. The best way to do it is through the people in the normal course and not by a Senate trying to judge its views. Certainly, if there were a motion of no confidence in the House it would not mean that one has to go to an election if, in fact, one could reform a government within the context of the occupants of the House of Representatives. If they could get a vote of confidence there would be no need for the unnecessary election. I think that all Senator Evans is saying in these expressions is that he has a chance to indicate clearly that we might go along the track to solving the difficulties we have experienced.</PARA>
<PARA> As he has said, this Bill is a serious minded and realistic attempt to grapple with the questions of fundamental constitutional importance and of crucial importance to the future of our parliamentary system. It is a genuine attempt to find a possible middle-of-the-road solution, as Senator Evans calls it, to the major problems which have been weighing heavily on both sides. We want to ensure , in the interests of the Australian people, that democracy really means something and that it can work. We should leave it to the people to judge the question of when governments should be changed and not to the Senate. The subject matter, as Senator Evans says, is such that the temptation to score in political terms is obvious. But it is a temptation which has been resisted in the course of this debate. The only way constitutional reform on this or any other issue can be achieved is through consensus. I think that is clear.</PARA>
<PARA> If we can get the Australian nation to reach consensus-which I think can be done-on a new Constitution we will make enormous progress in this country. People would identify with the concept of one nation, one Australia. They do this in times of crisis. Unfortunately, the crises are usually wars. A better Australian spirit was never seen than when Australia was under attack and its very survival was at stake. Nobody worried what State he belonged to or where he was born; it was a question of Australia surviving. Our present world has shrunk but is very competitive. Distances are no guarantee of safety. There is competition for survival in other nations and in our own. If we are not able to make a go of democracy and a success of this nation, if we are too divided on the major issues, other nations will look at that as weakness. They are entitled to do so. Many of them, of course, do not practice democracy and are not likely to do so. We do not want democracy to be second best simply because words can be manipulated.</PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the intentions of the people who drafted the Constitution we find that they were anxious to create a strong and fair Australia in which all people had equal rights. A proper constitution is desperately needed. Knowing the conservative nature of the Government, we think that this is something that the Government might be prepared to offer the people. The only way it can do that is to pass the Bill we are now introducing. The Opposition makes the point that an opposition certainly ought to be able to bring down a government, but should only be able to do it in the House of Representatives. That is clearly the position. I make the point again that we are no longer urging the abolition of the Senate. We think it has a valuable role to play; one of an intelligent contribution towards legislation, not one of playing the gut politics of going for the jugular vein to prevent the lifeblood of Supply.</PARA>

It offers, as Senator Evans said, not the best but the second best solution. It is a good solution if in the use of the second best we can get the best, by what would be called custom or convention, in that the Senate will not continue to urge elections as it wants as opposed to what the people need. There could be no better time to discuss this matter than in the present world economic climate. It is not very healthy. The world is re-arming and is very anxious about energy resources. It is certainly going to need them. If we talk to the scientists of the world we find the world will be very short indeed of a number of necessary resources which Australia has. If Australia does not make a proper contribution to the stability of democracy it is endangering its very lifeblood. It is also perhaps guaranteeing that somebody else will take a very keen interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The political representation Australians have is not the best. It is not A- grade material; it is very much lower than C-grade. When one looks at the politics that have been played in the past one sees that it has been in what one would call the kindergarten or infantile stage. It has offered nothing by way of a solution to what we are about. The Evans Bill has done something. It has altered the people of Australia-those who think and want to discuss on a non- party calm basis what ought to be done-to the fact that we need something done about this Constitution. A small and a very valuable step is to guarantee that the House of Representatives can have a fixed term. I commend the Bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA>The proposal is for the provision of new and upgraded facilities at the Army Command and Staff College, Queenscliff. In recommending construction of the work in the reference the Committee concluded that existing facilities are inadequate for the present and future requirements of the staff college and recommended their replacement. The Committee concluded also that the scope and design of the proposed redevelopment is justified. The estimated cost of the work is $8.3m in September 1982 prices. The Committee has recommended construction of the work in the reference.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion for new works at Queenscliff. In the last couple of weeks the fort at Queensliff has been subject to centenary celebations. In recent times a great deal of restoration work has taken place there. It is a very important asset, I believe, in our historical annals. It is well worth preserving. Those people who have done work in that area of preservation-largely private work, nevertheless with considerable support-have done an extremely good job in restoring or maintaining one of our assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other side of Port Phillip Bay-as the by-election is over I can say this without anyone suggesting this is political-the Officer Cadet School at Portsea is to move, in the not too distant future, its operations to Duntroon because of the building of the Australian Defence Force Academy and the surplus capacity which will then come about. That area, for very different purposes, should also be the subject of very serious discussion-I know that the matter is under active consideration-as to the permanency of occupation of the Commonwealth in that area. On both sides of the bay there are historic military reasons why we should be there. There are good environmental reasons why the area on the Portsea side of the bay should not be allowed to be over-utilised or damaged. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise that matter because it is one of those that may get lost by change, cost cutting or some other factor in the not too distant future. If the area is ever subject to relaxed vigilance it will, in fact, disappear. This will include , very likely, substantial proportions of the coastline. That will change the whole environment of Port Phillip Bay and the surrounding areas. It is very welcome that the works at Queenscliff are to be commenced and completed. Fort Queenscliff is a very important part of our current military training. The senior Army staff college operates at Queenscliff. That area is not represented by me at the moment; it was when I was first elected. I welcome the works that are to be done. I congratulate those who in the very recent past have done an enormous job of restoration in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a cognate debate for the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 1982 and two consequential measures, the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1982 and the Television Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1982. We applaud the legislation so far as it goes but we do not think it really goes far enough. The policy of the Australian Labor Party is to get new services into regions and, as far as it can, encourage local inputs without going too far in the direction of parochialism. We are concerned that the local organisations, stations and outlets should not be swamped by networks. It is also important that stations have a fair prospect of viability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The intention of the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill is to get such services into the country. Although the Opposition will not oppose the second reading of the Bill, it thinks that the legislation proposed is incomplete. We would like to have seen a broader consideration of the broadcasting system as a whole. We take the view that, if new services cannot be obtained by the existing commercial configuration, perhaps there ought to be more opportunity for public or national broadcasting. It is long overdue for the Government to consider what it will do about a second Australian Broadcasting Commission regional network, for example, and to provide further outlets for community stations especially in those areas, some of them metropolitan areas, which are not presently serviced such as Melbourne's western suburbs about which I have spoken to the Minister for Communications (Mr N.A. Brown) on several occasions. The Bill introduces supplementary licences for television and amends existing provisions so far unused for radio. It increases the maximum size of the membership of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal from five to eight. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a different concept in this Bill from its parent Act. There is the provision for the licensing of services rather than the licensing of transmitters. In this legislation, a supplementary licence is one granted in the same area to an existing licensee. It is not subject to the normal ownership and control provisions, that is, it is seen as being one with the existing licence for certain purposes. The legislation does not apply to the five mainland State capitals. The question of supplementary licences does not arise for them. Under the legislation for radio, the supplementaries must be by frequency modulation transmission. For television ultra high frequency or very high frequency and radiated subscription services are permitted. Under the legislation, a total of 99 commercial FM services and 36 commercial TV services could be established. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the Bill creates licences for services as distinct from the existing system of licences for transmitters. If a service area requires several transmitters-that is, the main one and one or more translaters-one licence is to cover the lot. The procedure is this: An existing licensee applies to the Minister for a single supplementary licence. A consortium of licensees serving the same area may also apply. The Minister may accept the application and forward it to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal which may conduct an inquiry into the grant. Secondly, the Minister may reject it on planning or technical grounds. In response the Broadcasting Tribunal will either recommend to the Minister that invitations for an independent licence be issued or grant the supplementary licence for up to a five-year period. It should be noted that the position with respect to a potential independent who may initiate action for a licence is unaffected by the Bill. However, it could be affected by the establishment of a government policy on supplementary manifest by the Bill. At the moment if a person-that is, a natural person or a legal entity-wants a licence in an area he fills in an expression of interest form with the Department, which then asks him to complete a planning pro forma. The pro forma must then pass the test of whether it is within government policy. If it is, the Minister at that point makes a decision on whether he will invite an application . This existing procedure is unaffected by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Until now, with no settled policy on how commercial frequency modulation services are to be extended to the country, no application has passed the test of whether it is within government policy. Now that a policy has been settled it is theoretically possible for the Minister to invite applications. However, it seems likely that the Minister will never invite an application for an independent licence as a result of this process because to do so would be to declare that a particular independent is viable-something that otherwise would normally be a matter for determination by the Tribunal. A Minister would be in a somewhat embarrassing situation if, after holding an inquiry, the Broadcasting Tribunal knocked him back and cast doubt on his judgment because it did not think the application had viability. So presumably it is a right that would be exercised with some trepidation by a Minister-unless perhaps it was the Minister 's predecessor. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there is nothing about it in the Bill, it is understood that when the Minister makes a statement on the scheme after the Bill's passage he will announce the date by which applications must be in from existing licensees. Otherwise he will say that he will call for independent licensees to make their applications. But this is considered a hollow threat. The reality of the situation is that all licensees will apply to forestall independence. There will be a long queue for processing. I do not know whether the mills of the ABT grind exceedingly small but they certainly grind very slowly. The fact that it is chronically short of staff and there are many-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not when it does not deliver the goods. That is the test of efficiency. In holding its inquiry the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is required to determine whether an independent commercial licence would be viable and, if so, whether it would be in the public interest to invite applications. There is simply no specification of what the onus of proof of viability is and where it lies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill says that the Broadcasting Tribunal is to have regard only to the following public interest criteria: Firstly, the nature of the community to be served; secondly, the diversity of the interests of the community; and, thirdly, the nature of the broadcasting and television services of which satisfactory reception is being obtained by the community. Honourable members should note that there is no reference to any criteria such as media concentration of Press and other electronic media holdings because of that word 'only'. The ABT cannot take them into account. Honourable members should note also that there are no public interest criteria whatsoever for the granting of a supplementary licence. In other words, an existing licensee can argue against an independent applicant on two broad grounds-that is to say, non-viability and that the public interest criteria are not satisfied. By contrast, a potential independent applicant cannot argue against a supplementary licence on public interest grounds, presumably because the Bill specifies grounds to be noted for an independent applicant but not for a supplementary licence that precludes general grounds or grounds arising elsewhere in the Act in considering a supplementary licence. It therefore seems that potential independents will not be treated equally with the incumbents. It is not known what the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal criteria of viability will be but presumably consistent criteria would have to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> After eight years of operation, special renewal procedures take effect. At that stage the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal must determine whether an independent licence would be viable and, if so, whether it would be in the public interest to invite applications. If the ABT determines that an independent licence is viable, it then renews the supplementary licence for up to two years and recommends the Minister to invite applications for an independent service to begin three years later. There is then a procedure whereby the licensee can give up one of his two licences and transfer it; that is, he can sell it and only if he cannot sell it does a hearing take place for the independents. The effect of this, of course, is that the licensee is in a position where he selects his successor and gets the market value of the station. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of it, if the licensee has scope under the ownership and control of provisions-that is, if he has not got a prescribed interest in the permitted maximum number of licences-he could transfer the licence to a company controlled by himself. He would then be in a position to own two independent licences in the one area. However, by virtue of clause 2 of the Bill, existing section 89A ( 1D) (c) (ii) of the act will apply to the transfer of a supplementary licence. This provides that the Broadcasting Tribunal shall have regard to 'the need to avoid undue concentration of influence' on the transferee, where a country licence is being transferred. This could presumably allow the Broadcasting Tribunal to refuse consent to a transfer even within the ownership and control limits. It should be noted that the Government has deliberately made a point of trying to prevent undue concentration in this case. Therefore, it may be argued that it admits the principle and it should be applied to the granting of supplementary licences in some way. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach adopted by the Opposition is: Firstly, we agree that a principle should be adopted and that some way has to be found for country areas to get new services; secondly, we believe that new services should, if possible, be independent of existing ones to provide for a greater range of choice; thirdly, we agree that if independent services could not possibly be viable, then supplementary licences should be issued; and, fourthly, we insist on avoiding undue concentration of influence across all media, which we believe is not only in the public interest but also even in the interests of advertisers. Therefore, we will propose some amendments giving guidence to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; for example, by directing it to adopt a liberal attitude to the question of viability. </PARA>
<PARA> If, for instance, a station which is automated is doing, say, the 'beautiful music' format which is common on some frequency modulation stations using syndicated news services it may well be that it could be profitable on a much lower budget than is conventionally regarded as necessary in the industry. There is very little in the way of overheads and hardly anything in labour costs. If one station in the area is local, there is also the possibility that program regulations could be adjusted to relax localism requirements for an FM commercial station. There is also the philosophical point about the degree to which governments should guarantee a market in such an industry. At the moment that is the Government's problem. The fact is that neither the Department nor the Broadcasting Tribunal has the resources, nor I think the critical attitude necessary to develop and to establish an appropriate viability level. Both will be heavily influenced by the existing industry in whose interests it will be to set the level as high as possible. The only real way to tell would be to let some independent operators try it out and then observe the results. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Committee stage I will move an amendment to ensure that a potential independent has the same facility to initiate an inquiry as an incumbent; secondly, an amendment to create a presumption of viability of an independent; and, thirdly, an amendment requiring the Broadcasting Tribunal to have regard to concentration of influence in granting a supplementary licence. Obviously the very act of granting a supplementary licence may be in itself-that is a supplementary licence to an already existing licencee-a concentrating of service . So the test would not apply to that. The granting is regarded as a last resort if there is no possibility of independent viability being established. But there remains the problem of concentration across other media. It is not a theoretical problem. In Tasmania, for instance, the Rouse interests own all television stations, Launceston and Hobart radio and the Press. As the Bill stands there is nothing preventing them gaining an extra television station and an extra radio station in both Launceston and Hobart. That would surely, even to this libertarian Government, be excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department's rationale is to say: 'But if one denies them supplementaries on the ground of concentration then you deny the people of Tasmania, or wherever , services. Therefore you have to give it to the existing interests. It is too bad but there it is'. This argument stands up only if there is no other way in which these commercial services can be provided. There are at least two other recourses and the procedure would go like this: Firstly, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal would look at viability and then apply a public interest test on concentration, taking regard to media concentration generally, factors of ownership and also general geographical factors. If a case fails the concentration test-that is, where there is undue concentration such as in the Rouse case-then clearly the viability test could be more liberal insofar as it affects the incumbent. In other words, in business terms, because the incumbent owns radio, Press and television he would be less seriously affected by a forced sharing of, for example, the radio market with a newspaper, with a newcomer, than if he were simply a radio operator and nothing else because he is able to spread his general business risk. Different viability criteria apply. His own viability would not be seriously threatened if he had a competitor in the field. Thus we could argue that the viability test be removed altogether in that case or in the general case of an incumbent who has extensive support elsewhere in the media. For example, take the case of Rupert Murdoch. Or at least there could be a heavy onus on the incumbent to prove why a newcomer would actually damage the services to the area, quite apart from the question of whether he would damage his own profits. In other words, it would be on the newcomer's head to make a go of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, alternatively as a competitive proposition to be put to the Tribunal, there could be aggregation of service areas for purposes of providing independent services where single service areas are found to be non-viable but where the incumbent fails the concentration test. In general there must be economies in running a networking situation over several service areas. Therefore there must be an aggregation of service areas so that the aggregation is viable. Although a lack of localism may be advanced as an argument against this there are undoubtedly areas which have very strong regional features such as the Central West and North Coast of New South Wales or Gippsland. Each area encompasses several local service areas and they are identifiably regions in economic and other terms, such as sport. There is of course, a long-standing case for the promotion of regional radio and television. </PARA>
<PARA> The third factor is that although more politically difficult it would be possible to permit the granting of a supplementary licence to an incumbent radio or television station only if that licence were divested from any concentrated pan-media grouping. Such a provision would need to be accompanied by a way of ensuring that a potential independent could initiate an inquiry. But if there was no right to initiate an inquiry the incumbent would just sit tight. There could be a provision saying that if the incumbent refused to divest, as he would of course, then an independent would be allowed to proceed with his application as a matter of course. While admitting that here would be areas where the only recourse would be supplementary licences, it is highly likely that the existing industry greatly overstates the viability issue because it is in its obvious direct interest to do so. Furthermore, given eight years of incumbency it is highly unlikely that a station would ever be divested. The industry would prevail on a Liberal-National Party Government, if such a government were in office, to change the Act if that ever looked like happening. There are plenty of precedents for that. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier in my opening remarks, the other two pieces of legislation are merely consequential. The Television Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill and the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill simply provide for the licencees to be paid for supplementary licences. In conclusion I point out to the House that at the Committee stage we will be raising a number of matters by way of amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broadcasting Television Amendment Bill, in terms of listeners to radio stations and viewers of television stations in country areas of Australia, is probably one of the most significant pieces of legislation to come before this Parliament in more than 20 years. It is part of the overall long term Government project of extending to those people in remote and rural areas the best available programming that can be provided through existing television and radio services. This is yet another step by this Government to try to bring to them that range of services which obviously in the past they have so sorely missed. In fact, it is an opportunity for some 99 commercial FM radio services and 36 new television services to be considered for these rural and remote areas of Australia. That in itself is rather a significant move. I do not really think that any honourable member in this House would deny that the choice of programs available to many of these rural listeners and viewers has in the past been most restricted indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the other interesting aspects of this Bill is the fact that it is directed, in the case of radio, primarily to the FM mode. That is important too. I suppose in many respects it was almost by mistake that Australia was introduced to FM radio which potentially is the best broadcasting medium that we can possibly provide in this country. If we take our minds back through history we will see that under the terms of the old Wireless Telegraphy Act FM radio was initially introduced into Australia. This legislation helps in providing a more professional use of FM radio and, most importantly, a professional use of FM radio in these regional and remote areas of Australia. It is an opportunity for existing country stations to test the markets and to see whether they can provide alternative programming through this particular mode. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to listen tonight to the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) and some of his arguments that he put. Honourable members will excuse me I am sure if I am wrong in saying that I think there was almost an assumption in his speech that most of the existing country radio operators were almost sitting on a bed of roses in terms of their profitability. I do not really think that is the case. In actual fact an analysis of the incomes and profit margins of many regional operators in Australia would show that their viability is very much at stake. I would also see this legislation as providing them with an opportunity to try to make their present situation more viable for very little outlay. Certainly there are opportunities within the proposed legislation for a market to be tested to see whether so many of these regional centres may in their own right be entitled to an additional independent service. Importantly too I think we have to give that opportunity to back up many of these regional operators so they can continue to provide not only their AM service but also these alternative services as well. Of course, one would hope that they would take great advantage of their opportunity to enter this particular mode-the FM mode- especially to provide all that is best in terms of the technical quality in the broadcasting services. That really is what FM radio is all about. One would hope that any operator of these particular licences would move to use that medium to the very best advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> With the capital city stations-certainly this legislation does not apply to them-we have seen a very great acceptance of FM by listeners. A look at recent radio services around Australia would certainly indicate that the general public is adapting to such stations very quickly indeed. Surveys would indicate a very great increase in the number of listeners to FM radio services in capital cities . That has especially been so in cities such as Perth-as shown in recent surveys -and Brisbane and Sydney as well. We could see that as indicating that perhaps Australians are quicker than most people in other countries to adapt to new forms of communications and to new services that might be available. In that respect, the legislation should be welcome. It is a very real opportunity for Australians to have even greater diversity in their radio information and entertainment. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned a little earlier that this is just part of a total package of this Government to expand the whole area of communications on a much grander scale than we have known in the past. It provides an opportunity for Australians in country and remote areas to receive full services and an opportunity for people in the cities over the next few years to have on their hands almost a revolution in communications. Whilst we speak tonight of the supplementary licences for FM radio and for rural television interests, it is only a few years down the track when Australia will be benefiting from the services that the communication satellite can bring and from the even more exciting prospects of the introduction of radiated subscription television or cable television. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the legislation before the House tonight will not give the electronics industry such a tremendous chance to increase its participation in the manufacturing areas of the industry, I guess that it is a start. The Australian industry has caught on to FM radio, and one wonders what the true potential of the whole area of communications will be over the next five years. At a time when we are looking for employment and when the Australian electronics industry is going through severe periods of hardship, legislation such as this can in itself create a lot of the much needed employment in Australia. One hopes that this Government will be forward-looking enough in its very near future to make some very real statements about the future of the new communications media, especially cable television. We have already had in this House over the last few years some debates about the communications capabilities of cable television. One would think it was almost time for the Government to start really making some recommendations about the possible introduction of cable television, perhaps even more than RSTV, for the future expansion of the electronics industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be most happy if the Government would make a commitment for the almost immediate introduction of cable television services in Australia. I say that bearing in mind that we have to make some rather hard decisions about the regulations that might govern the future of cable television in Australia. If we look at the cold, hard facts, we see that Australians have proved themselves to be amongst world leaders in accepting new technology. That was evident with the introduction of colour television into Australia. Within a matter of months of the introduction of colour television, something like 62 per cent of homes in this country were saturated with it. Australia has the greatest acceptance of any country in the world of home videotape recorders. The saturation level is something like 32 per cent already. With the early introduction of cable television services, which would cover not only entertainment but also all sorts of information services, that record would be improved upon even more. </PARA>
<PARA> The most exciting part of the introduction of cable television is not the services that it can bring but the employment opportunities that it can provide at a time such as this. On my estimations even the announcement of the initial plans to go ahead with cable television could start in the employment area such a revolution that, by the time it was introduced, at least 20,000 jobs would have been created in the electronics industry. The introduction of cable television here would mean a very high usage of labour. It would mean also a very high usage of capital, and at a time such as this that is probably what we need more than anything else. There is no denying that cable television would be restricted initially to the capital cities only. But that is well and good because that is where it will be viable and easily introduced and that is where there is already an expectation of the new technology which is just around the corner. If we introduce 20,000 jobs into the electronics industry, we can also look at the entertainment and information aspects of cable to see what sort of employment they will generate too. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience in the United States of America is that cable television services are great consumers of television programs of all types, not only in the entertainment area but also in the information area. Already a fledgling industry in Australia is providing some entertainment services to cable television stations in the United States. I am sure that most members of this House have already heard of the acceptance, for example, of Australian Rules football in the Los Angeles area. I guess it was a case of providing some fill- in programs but it certainly opened a whole new market for the Australian football business on the West Coast of the United States. A gentleman I know from my home city of Brisbane who has been producing a travel series for Australian television services has just sold his programs to an American cable concern. His return on the cost of that production has been about three times his outlay. Already he is making plans for the expansion of that service throughout other areas of the United States. I suppose that is an indication of the potential for Australia if we get into that mode early enough. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an opportunity in the general information areas and the educational areas for Australians to take advantage of this whole new technology. If we can get in early enough we can provide not only a home market but also a whole new export market. I hope that within the coming months we will look very seriously indeed at getting down to the job and making sure that we have our own regulations correct in terms of the things that should govern the introduction of cable television. I hope that Australia will get on the bandwagon and take advantage not only of the local market but also, through our own technology and the advancements that have already been made in that field, an export market of not inconsiderable proportions through Asia and beyond in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of my address tonight, this legislation is yet another step in the ever-expanding concern that this Government has for all Australians to receive the best communications services available. This will certainly mean that people in many of the country areas of Australia will have a greater diversity of services and a greater quality of services. In those respects, with the safeguards that are envisaged in this legislation, I certainly commend the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) made most of the main points that need to be made by the Opposition in relation to this legislation. I will confine my remarks to certain aspects which I think are important and which illustrate the reasons for our amendments. To begin with , I think there has been a slight misrepresentation of the importance of this legislation. An extremely important measure is being undertaken here. A series of improved radio and television services is proposed not just for what might be called the strictly country areas but also for large regional cities. In fact, the provisions of the legislation extend to every place in Australia except the five capital cities. They extend not only to remote areas but also to major cities, such as Newcastle, Wollongong, Hobart, Launceston, Darwin and Alice Springs. In that sense the provisions before us deal not just with inadequate services in certain remote areas but also with cities of hundreds of thousands of people. In that sense they have to be looked at carefully, not simply in terms of the claimed aims but also in terms of what they are going to do in relation to the concentration of media ownership in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We in the Australian Labor Party applaud any attempt to increase services for country areas. We believe that there should be a maximum effort on the part of the Government to provide such increased radio and television services. It should be emphasised that this legislation is not concerned with the different methods of providing such regional services but is primarily concerned with the provision of commercial services. In my view the commercial nature of these services needs to be questioned. Let us ask this question: If we are concerned to provide more regional and country services why are we not giving out more public radio licences and extending Australian Broadcasting Corporation services and multicultural and ethnic services? This legislation does not address itself to those areas at all. It does not address itself to the matter of more public radio or television. There is a big demand for the extension of public radio and television in these other regional centres. As I mentioned, they are not all remote centres; some of them are very big cities. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am saying is that this legislation deals primarily with commercial interests and not with the other aspects of the problem. The Minister for Communications (Mr N.A. Brown) has explained why it is that the Government, if it is sincere in wanting to provide these extra services, has not put forward a program of extending public radio and television or extending the ABC. In many places throughout Australia the ABC has only one radio station rather than two. Certainly, there is a growing need throughout the nation for consideration of second ABC television stations. The Goverment has made comments about extending multicultural television to other areas but it has not gone beyond the capital cities. It has not mentioned these other regional centres. In many of these regional centres there are substantial concentrations of ethnic people, and they need to be taken into account. Ethnic radio has been a great success in the capital cities, but again there has been no provision of ethnic radio for regional and country centres where, as I mentioned, people who speak other languages and for whom English is a second language do not have anything like the same opportunities as people in the capital cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point that needs to be emphasised-in fact it comes up in relation to considerations of ethnic radio-is the Government's commercial interest and its perpetual concern with profit rather than the provision of services. This matter has come out even in the area of ethnic radio. A report which has recently been prepared argues that the ethnic radio stations, 2EA and 3EA, ought to be given over to private enterprise and made commercial radio stations. This would be an extremely retrograde step which would be totally resisted by all ethnic communities. In fact what we ought to be doing is considering extending these kinds of services that are provided by 2EA and 3EA to regional centres. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Ian Cameron" NAMEID="BF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BF4">Mr Ian Cameron</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are no people of ethnic origin there anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is typical of your knowledge. If the honourable member refers to regional cities such as Newcastle and says that there are no people of ethnic origin in those places that goes to show how much he knows about Australia. Let me now express what our difficulties are in relation to the commercial stations. First, the provisions in the Bill are such that they discourage the establishment of independent licences. The independent licensee has to prove that his proposition is commercially viable. If he has to prove that, those who are interested in a supplementary licence can make submissions to try to disprove his claim. In other words, those who may have a vested interest in getting hold of a supplementary licence in fact will be trying to discourage the Government from granting a licence to an independent. This is a serious matter. We know from experience that this is the sort of tactic Australia's media monopolies carry out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the House once again that we are not talking only about small towns; we are talking about large cities being involved in this situation. We are talking about multimillion dollar operations and the profits which can be made from gaining access to radio and television licences in these cities. In that context, the fact that those who are applying for supplementary licences will be given preference in a certain way to those applying for independent licences under the provisions of this Bill-this was outlined by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones)-indicates the extent to which, in fact, this Government is committed to the existent monopolies in broadcasting and television. Time and again we in the Labor Party have complained about the concentration of media ownership. The Bill in its present form does not prevent, for example, a huge media giant who has big interests in the capital cities from applying for a supplementary licence in a large city such as Hobart or Wollongong. Not only is he not prevented but also he can put in various claims to discredit someone who applies for an independent licence. Obviously, those sorts of people have the money, the know-how and the expertise to do this and to undermine those who would like an independent licence to be granted. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we see in this Bill? In the guise of a pretence of wanting to extend services-we have no quarrel with the extension of services-we see very little in the way of provision of public services, government services or ethnic services, but we see the attempt to provide a supplementary licence setup which, in fact, clearly favours those who are already in the media monopoly game and which discourages those who wish to establish independent stations. Our amendments do not oppose the extension of the services. They make this a fairer game in that those who are seeking an independent licence will be given some benefit of the doubt and also they will be able to argue against the granting of a supplementary licence in the same way in which the person who wants a supplementary licence can argue against those who are seeking the independent licence. That leads me to the final point, which concerns local content and local programs. How can a multi-media monopoly, if it gets hold of all these regional stations--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Ian Cameron" NAMEID="BF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BF4">Mr Ian Cameron</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How do you know they are going to?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;According to the provisions of this Bill they will. Do not worry about that. In the big regional centres that is what they will do. As I mentioned, some very big cities are involved under the provisions of this Bill. If those multimedia monopolies get hold of the supplementary licences, what kind of local content will be provided for the people in local areas? These monopolies do not care very much about local content. They are not concerned about providing local news services and all the rest of it. Their interest is simply to maximise their profitability. Given that situation, the aim of the Bill could very easily be undermined. The original aim of the Bill was to provide, in these regional and local centres, independent radio and television stations for the local community. If these stations are not to be independent they will not provide those sorts of things for the local community. Anyone who does not see that clear point is simply kidding himself when, as I mentioned, especially in the big regional centres, millions and millions of dollars of profits will be involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that of course in smaller regional centres where an independent station is not viable we do not oppose this supplementary principle. In my view the amendments we are putting forward will solve the kinds of difficulties which I have raised regarding the concentration of media ownership and the failure to provide for local content. I remind honourable members opposite that there is no provision in the Bill which requires that local stations actually have substantial local content at all. I believe that the Government ought to accept the amendments moved by the Opposition to ensure that we get a bipartisan approach to this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first two amendments the Opposition offers relate to clause 8 which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subject to sub-section (3), the holder of a licence for a commercial broadcasting station or a consortium each member of which is the holder of such a licence may lodge with the Minister, in accordance with a form approved by the Minister, an application for the grant of a licence-</PARA>
<PARA>And so on. We simply propose to add to new sub-sections 82A (1) and 82A (2) of the principal Act the words, 'or any other person'. The point is simply that the purpose of this amendment is to put potential independent operators on the same footing as the holders of the licences to initiate an inquiry into the grant of supplementary and independent licences. As the Bill stands, only holders may initiate an inquiry. If one is a holder of a licence, an incumbent, it is extremely unlikely one would want to have an inquiry so that one could be knocked off. It is like sitting members of the Liberal Party or indeed of any other party saying, 'Look, I think I will initiate a challenge to myself for pre -selection'. It does not make an awful lot of sense. One cannot imagine that there would be too many incumbents who would be racing around trying to organise somebody to run against them. If one is to have an inquiry, if one is to have the option open, one has to have the right of application by the person who wants to challenge the status quo. </PARA>

The licence holder is the only person named who may lodge an application with the Minister. If the Minister says that there is some alternative right, no doubt he will exercise his rights to explain what it is. But I think we have to make this absolutely clear by inserting the words 'or any other person' in proposed new sections 82A (1) and 82A (2). If the existing licensee does not really want a supplementary licence-of course, he may be doubtful about its economic value to him-he can block the process of determination whether there should be an independent or a supplementary licence by simply not applying. In other words, if he does not want the matter opened up at all, he just does nothing. There may be a marginal case for that, one way or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not at all clear in this provision. I would be interested to hear, as a piece of textual exegesis, the honourable member's views on it. We believe on the basis of our policy that a prime requirement is to get new services to rural areas. There should be a process whereby a determination can be brought to a head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The arguments which may be made against an amendment to the clause are, firstly , that anyone can apply to a Minister now to invite an application. There is no formal process for this-just a request to the Minister whose power it is to call for applicants. This is true. But, since the Bill gives the right to an existing licensee to apply, it should as a matter of equity give the same right to others . Secondly, it may be argued that we are creating a new automatic right and therefore taking planning power away from the Minister. We argue that that is not so because the legislation makes a recommendation that the Minister call for applications for a licence if the Minister finds that an independent licence is viable. We could have put up an amendment making it mandatory for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to grant an independent licence. This would have made a parallel process to the granting of a supplementary licence. But we believe that the recommendation carries enough force. We think the opportunity should be there for further review by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may argue that all licensees will apply anyway or that he will announce that he will call applications for independent licences in all areas if applications for supplementary licences are not received by a certain date. There is no reason why a potential independent should be held up by such a process or be made subject to the Minister's discretion when that independent's competitors-the existing licensees-have a statutory right. It is just a matter of simple equity. The incumbent has a statutory right conferred by the legislation; in effect, the independent is subject to the discretion of the Minister. He relies on ministerial whim, if one likes. We believe that that is quite inequitable. Therefore, I urge the Government to accept the amendments to insert in both cases the words 'or any other person'. I seek leave to move the two amendments together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said a moment ago that the Government was not able to accept the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). The reason why the Government is not able to accept those amendments is that they proceed, with the greatest of respect, upon a misapprehension of the nature of the supplementary licence scheme. The very basis of the supplementary licence scheme is that machinery is created by the Bill under which the licensee is able to activate the whole mechanism. He is able, as the Bill provides, to lodge with the Minister an application for the grant, in effect, of a supplementary licence. To say that somebody other than the holder of the licence can do that is, with the greatest of respect, a nonsense. It would be the exact complete negation of the whole supplementary licence scheme to provide, as the honourable member for Lalor has proposed, that someone other than the current licensee has the right to lodge the application. Even if one accepted the sort of principle that the honourable member has contended should be implemented, he would have to do a complete redrafting exercise of the present provision. That is so because the honourable member for Lalor would ask us to accept that when his amendment was added to the Bill, proposed new section 82A for example, would mean that the holder of the licence for a commercial broadcasting station, et cetera, may lodge with the Minister, et cetera, an application for the grant of a licence for a broadcasting service to someone other than himself. Clearly, the other person would not be applying for a supplementary licence. As I said, the proposed amendments are not consistent with the whole structure of the scheme. If one wanted to implement the principle contended for it would require the whole series of provisions to be redrafted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, I make the point that the proposed amendments would have the effect of compressing two inquiries into one and telescoping two independent inquiry processes involved in the supplementary licence scheme into one public inquiry. That would mean that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal would be required to decide two things at the one time and in the one hearing. In the first place it would have to decide whether an independent licence was viable and in the public interest and whether a supplementary licence should be issued to an existing licensee. It would also have to determine, if an independent licence were viable, which of the applicants should be offered the licence. I do not know whether anyone would be able to work out who was bouncing the ball at an inquiry of that sort but it would be, in our submission, unnecessarily confusing if the Tribunal were embarking upon a joint inquiry concerned with both of those matters at the same time. We are of the view that the issues can be properly resolved only by two separate public inquiries. Apart from involving the Tribunal in those excessively complex supplementary licence inquiries, the one process dealing with the two investigations to which I have referred would mean that prospective licensees for an independent licence would be required to prepare detailed applications for inquiries in doubtful areas on the off-chance- that is all it would be-that the Tribunal might determine that applications for an independent licence should be considered. The whole thing would be utterly confusing. </PARA>
<PARA> I revert to the main point; that is, that we are unfortunately unable to accept the amendment because to do so would negate the whole structure of the scheme, the very basis of which is that we take the current licensee and, in effect, invite him under the scheme to apply for a supplementary licence. If he does not do so then the field is open and the Minister may activate the machinery to bring the potential independent aspirants into the field. But there is no point in going on with the supplementary licence scheme if this proposed amendment were added to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>Would this not have the effect which we are trying to achieve, namely, that if somebody in a particular region or a particular area wants a second or further television licence, that is a television licence or a radio licence other than the ones that exists that person would not be able, under these provisions, to apply for that licence? The Minister made the point in his remarks that the power in the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill is given to the person with an existing licence who wants to apply for a supplementary licence. The Minister said: 'If that person does not apply then the field is open for others' . But why should an opportunity be given in the first instance to the person who has a licence in a particular town or city? Why not simply say: 'All right, if someone feels that they can make a go of a television station or a radio station , whether or not they happen to be the owner of an alternative station, why not simply allow them, under the provisions set out in the Bill, to apply and to meet the conditions required so that we can treat independents and those who are already owners in the same way'.

<PARA>Of the amendments (3) and (4), amendment (4) is the key amendment. I will just say something briefly by way of introduction of amendment (3). Amendment 3 deals with the case where the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has not found 'undue concentration'. It says that in that case the course is to follow the Bill's procedure; that is, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal goes on to determine whether an independent is viable and, if so, it recommends that the Minister invite an independent to apply for a licence. If not, it grants the supplementary licence. I want to say a few more words about amendment (4). Amendment (4) proposes to add in section 83 of the principal Act paragraph (g), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The tribunal is satisfied that, where the licence is a supplementary licence, the granting of such licence would not result in undue concentration of influence, whether direct or indirect, on the applicant, having regard to the ownership and control of other media serving the area to be served by the licence. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment (4) says that a licence will not be given to a licensee if he is part of a cross-media grouping. It is meant to apply, for instance, in the case I mentioned in the second reading debate, to the Rouse case in Tasmania. We will not countenance the situation where all radio, television and Press in the town are owned by one person or company. This is unhealthy for diversity. It is also unhealthy for advertisers. We do not believe that this amendment would deny new services to country people. It would work as follows. Section 83 (6) of the principal Act in effect says that if the Tribunal holds an inquiry and a set of the conditions set out in section 6 paragraphs (a) to (f) are satisfied, the licence will be granted. The section applies to all licences and within the set paragraph (e) deals with supplementary licences. A new paragraph (e) is created in this Bill. Amendment (4), which would insert a new paragraph marked (ea), would set a seventh condition-that is, paragraph (g)-which says that for a supplementary licence an 'undue concentration', in effect, is to be frowned upon . Notice it is not undue concentration of ownership but undue concentration of influence. The term is used elsewhere in the Act, so we are not introducing a new concept. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment (4) (eb) provides for evidence about commercial viability to be presented to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal if there is to be any challenge to the presumption of commercial viability. Amendment (5) treats the case where the Broadcasting Tribunal has found 'undue concentration'. It says that if a supplementary licence has been refused on those grounds the recommendation goes automatically to the Minister and he then invites application for an independent. In other words, it then abandons any test of viability. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to emphasise that the inquiry ceases at that point. In our view it would be wrong to allow such a concentration of influence. It is contrary to the established philosophy along those lines originally set as far back as October 1935 when the first regulations against concentration of ownership in radio were made. It has had two-party support ever since. As recently as the time of the former Minister-who is now an aviation superstar-the Honourable A. A . Staley, this Government decided that FM was to be subject to the provisions along with AM radio, thus following the policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments to be adduced in addition to those I have just given are, first, that if the licensee in a cross-ownership situation wants a supplementary licence badly enough he can divest himself of his other interests, when he will then be able to pass the 'undue influence' test; that is, he would be eligible or, alternatively, if he is cross-owned he ought to be viable enough to withstand any independent competition. Therefore, it is up to the independents to make a go of it. This is, paradoxically coming from us, a free enterprise argument if ever there was one. We are great advocates of free enterprise under certain limited circumstances. It is unlikely to be the established licensee who will be in trouble; it is much more likely to be the newcomer. If the argument that is put up here fails a Labor government would be prepared to consider in future other ways of bringing new services to the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat what I said when I opened my remarks at the second reading stage. The flaw of this Bill is that it considers commercial services in isolation. There are other ways such as public or national broadcasting by which new services could be brought in. Unfortunately this Bill ignores these. In fact those alternative methods might well turn out to be more acceptable to many existing commercial broadcasters. I hardly need to restate the argument on the question of undue concentration. I simply say that we stand by the view that we need diversity and multiple sources of information in a society like ours. We believe that there should be competition and advertising and that it is very unhealthy for all outlets to be tied up by one group in one town of which probably the most outstanding examples in Australia would be Launceston and Mildura. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no doubt whatsoever that the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is motivated by some pure motives. The objective of competition of course is desirable but the Government is unable to accept the proposed amendments. I draw the honourable member's attention to amendment (4). At the start we could not accept this in any event because there seems to be a drafting fault which creates a double negative. Therefore it seems to achieve exactly the opposite of the effect which, I presume, is intended by the honourable member. If I read the opening words of the provision of the Broadcasting and Television Act and then add the clause proposed by the honourable member I think the fault will become apparent. Section 83 (6) of the Act provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tribunal shall not refuse to grant a licence to a person unless it has held an inquiry into the grant of the licence and-</PARA>
<PARA>I now adopt the honourable member's words:</PARA>
<PARA> (g) the Tribunal is satisfied that, where the licence is a supplementary licence, the granting of such licence would not result in undue concentration of influence . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member intended to say that the licence would not be granted if there were an undue concentration of influence but in fact he has, with respect, said the opposite. As I have said section 83 (6) provides that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal shall not refuse to grant a licence unless a number of things happen. If one of the things that happens is that there is not undue concentration of influence presumably the intention would be that the licence would not be issued. However the result would be that the honourable member would have a licence issued in that case. It is probably just a drafting mistake but it illustrates one of the several problems that we have with the legislation . </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter is that the reference to, and I quote from the honourable member's amendment, any 'other media' does not have any definition. There would inevitably be difficulties of interpretation which may result in applications for judicial review and endless arguments if the Tribunal gave concentration of influence as a reason for any decision made against the grant of a licence. The fact that there is no definition of any other media would seem by itself to make this an unworkable amendment in our submission. In any event this is probably the substantial objection that we have. If one imposes this criteria it is, once again, at variance with the whole basis of the supplementary licence scheme. It is at variance because it would enable the Tribunal to refuse to grant a supplementary licence, which is what the whole exercise is about, on grounds of concentration of ownership even in those areas where the Tribunal has found that an independent licence would not be viable. Therefore, we could get to the stage where the Tribunal could find that an independent licence would not be viable and the result of that would be that the community would miss out on the service because the licence would be denied to the applicant on the grounds, presumably, of undue concentration of ownership. As I said, that could arise even where the Tribunal has found that an independent licence would not be viable to serve the area. Therefore, people would miss out on obtaining that service. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the other amendment-I am assuming that the honourable member has said what he proposes to say about it-we do not believe that it is appropriate that there should be this onus of proof provision worked into the legislation as it would result in an automatic Tribunal determination that an independent licence would be viable unless evidence to the countrary were offered. We think this is an undersirable way of putting it. In the first place, we say that the proposed amendment does not state what the standard of proof is that will be required by the Tribunal. As the applicant would attempt to supply and the Tribunal would require that evidence anyway, the amendment in our submission is unnecessary and probably unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the proposed amendment overlooks the extensive powers and statutory obligations of the Tribunal to inform itself thoroughly on these matters. I refer the Committee to section 25 (1) and section 25 (2) of the Act. Section 25 (1) provides that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal shall, without regard to legal forms and solemnities, make a thorough investigation into all matters relevant to an inquiry under this Division, and may give all such directions and do all such things as the Tribunal considers are necessary or expedient for the expeditious and just hearing of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 25 (2) provides that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal is not bound by legal rules of evidence and may inform itself on any matter in such manner as it thinks fit. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the Tribunal already has a very wide charter to look at a whole range of matters. The Government takes the view that, having gone down the path of giving extensive powers to the Tribunal and having vested the Tribunal with the responsibility of hearings and issuing licences to applicants, it is appropriate that it should be allowed to have a wide ambit, to have regard to the matters to which it wishes to have regard and to conduct its investigations in its own way, without shackling it by specific provisions relating to an onus of proof which would unnecessarily restrict its activities and the proper performance of its functions. As I said at the outset, although I am sure the honourable member is well motivated by the principles which he has espoused the Government is not able to accept the amendments proposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak about what is happening in the field of ethnic affairs and multiculturalism in this country. Let me say at the outset that I am very disturbed at the attempts that have been made to blame the present economic crisis on immigration and, more seriously, on the role of migrant and ethnic communities in this country. We just cannot afford at a time of serious economic problems to have divisions arising because people are blaming ethnic or migrant communities for those problems. The fact is that for nearly 40 years now we have worked to build a multicultural and integrated Australia. In working towards this goal we have had difficulties and problems. Nevertheless, we have not attempted to divide one section from another or to blame one section of the community for our economic problems. Unfortunately, however, there are certain indications that this is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is more unfortunate is that certain prominent people in the community are attacking the very concept of multiculturalism and of a multicultural society. It is good that the Minister for Communications (Mr N.A. Brown) is in the House to answer the extraordinary statement by Professor Kramer, the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. She not only said that we can get rid of multicultural television but also virtually implied that multiculturalism had no place in our community. Statements of that kind by prominent individuals such as Professor Kramer are divisive and are calculated to attack the basis on which we have tried to build our society since the Second World War. They should be denounced. I am perturbed that that kind of claim has not been denounced by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of a multicultural society was approved by this Government and by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in particular. The Government and certain of its spokespersons are backing away from that concept. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges) recently made an absolute fool of himself at the national language conference when he tried to tell us--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (4) The Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department has advised the Comptroller-General of Customs that an English court would probably not enforce a claim by the Commonwealth based on the forfeiture provisions of section 229 of the Customs Act 1901 and has advised against the instituting of proceedings in the United Kingdom. The then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs accepted that advice and I have found no reason to disagree with that decision. Proceedings to recover possession of the aircraft to which the honourable member refers will not be instituted in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Department of Industry and Commerce exercises control over such exports through the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. Offences or attempted offences against this legislation render the persons concerned subject to the penal provisions of the Customs Act including the forfeiture of the goods concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> It would seem that there are persons who are prepared to become involved in schemes to circumvent known Customs controls over the export of aircraft of historical interest. Assurance is given that the Department will investigate such attempts and take appropriate action wherever necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. Legislation recently passed by Parliament, but not yet proclaimed, increases the penalties from $1,000 to $50,000 or three times the value of the goods (where the Court can determine the value), whichever is the greater.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commonwealth Personal Care Subsidy is paid only to organisations eligible under Part III of the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act which provide approved hostel accommodation and personal care services to their frail residents. The subsidy which was recently increased by 50 per cent to $30 a week , is intended to assist those organisations to employ sufficient staff in their hostels to assist the frail residents to live as independently as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> Individuals caring for themselves and people caring for aged or disabled people in private accommodation are not eligible for Personal Care Subsidy because they do not meet the requirements of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Department of Health administers the Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit under the National Health Act. This benefit is available to people who provide full time nursing care for chronically ill relatives in their homes: these patients would otherwise require admission to a nursing home. For a person to qualify for this benefit, the patient must:</PARA>
<PARA> be 16 years of age or over;</PARA>
<PARA> have a certificate from their doctor stating that, because of infirmity or illness, disease, incapacity or disability, they have a continuing need for nursing care;</PARA>
<PARA> be receiving adequate care from a registered nurse.</PARA>
<PARA> The current rate of benefit is $42 a fortnight and at 30 June 1982 there were approximately 18,000 approved beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also an attendant care pilot scheme being developed by the Department of Social Security which was allocated $100,000 for this purpose in the 1982-83 Budget. This pilot will be administered as part of the Handicapped Persons Welfare Program Up-grading Scheme. The Attendant Care Scheme will investigate the provision of alternative modes of personal care services to severely handicapped people who live in their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The maximum rate of handicapped child's allowance currently payable is $85 a month. The allowance was introduced to assist parents who provide constant care and attention to their child where the child is severely or substantially handicapped and is cared for in the family home rather than in an institution. Handicapped children's benefit is currently paid at the rate of $5 per day. It is payable to approved charitable or religious organisations in respect of each handicapped child under the age of 16 who is accommodated in the residential centre conducted by the organisation. The amount of the benefit is required to be deducted from the account sent to the child's parents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The report by the ACT House of Assembly's Standing Committee on City Management, which contains a number of recommendations, was presented in the Assembly on 25 October 1982 and has now been referred to me.</PARA>
<PARA> I am currently studying the contents of the report.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) This decision was made in the interest of a fair distribution of costs across the whole spectrum of electricity consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority is billed for bulk supply of electricity on the basis of both the energy consumed and the highest demand recorded during the month. In addition, the Authority must provide plant capacity equal to or greater than the highest consumer demand likely to occur within the ACT on the coldest day.</PARA>
<PARA> Except for a small number of very large customers who are billed for both energy and demand, the average consumer is billed only for the energy used. Therefore the tariff charged must be structured so that costs associated with the demand generated and the plant installed are recovered as well as the energy consumed.</PARA>
<PARA> Charges for electricity are constructed on the basis of a reasonable expectation that electricity will be consumed both during and outside peak demand times. While non-solar hot water heaters add significantly to peak demand , they operate ouside peak hours often enough for the Authority to recover costs .</PARA>
<PARA> Solar Water Heaters, on the other hand, while adding to the peak demand, do not require electric boosting during daylight hours. This, as a consequence, denies the Authority a significant amount of potential revenue and requires the shortfall to be subsidised by all other classes of consumers in the ACT. The Authority, therefore, considers that connection to Off-Peak supply is the fairest method of ensuring that Solar Systems 'pay their way'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Authority believes very strongly in energy conservation and applauds the Solar Heating Industry for its resourcefulness and dedication. However, the cost of providing standby boosting for Solar Water Heaters should not be borne by those not fortunate enough to afford the capital cost of their own Solar System.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The restriction does apply to other systems connected to off-peak supply. The ACTEA Schedule of Charges provides that with Off-Peak Water Heating Charge ' booster elements are not permitted'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) and (b) The expenditure during 1981-82 was $4,847,000 and the estimated expenditure for 1982-83 is $4,740,000. This means that there is an estimated marginal decrease in expenditure for 1982-83. Assuming that there will be an element of inflation during 1982-83, the estimated marginal decrease represents a decrease in real terms. It is not possible however to provide an estimate of the real change in the provision made in 1982-83 compared to 1981-82, mainly because this capital expenditure largely results from ongoing programmes with cash flows varying from year to year depending on manufacturing schedules amongst other things. For example the installation of light vessels in Bass Strait will continue in 1982-83 whereas bulk cash payments against this project were made in 1981-82.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Did the Commission also advise that the very tight control of investigations has meant that some matters have necessarily come to the Commission inadequately developed and with too little information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Trade Practices Commission advised that until recently the tight control, by which staff needed the Commission's approval for each investigation, and also the need to institute cases within twelve months, meant that some matters could not be taken up with the companies concerned so that they came to the Commission inadequately developed and with too little information. The TPC has now taken administrative steps to improve this situation by delegating to senior staff the power to seek initial comments from the company complained of.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government keeps under notice both the impact of the Direction and the level of staffing in the Commission to ensure that it is able to carry out its responsibilities under the Trade Practices Act. Additional resources have not been required because:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Ministerial Direction of 25 May 1981 required the Trade Practices Commission to confine its consumer protection investigations to matters raising issues of importance at the national level and where such matters are brought to its attention by another person. This Direction accords with the Government's decisions announced by the Prime Minister on the Review of Commonwealth Functions.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) As noted above, the Commission has now taken administrative steps to speed up the development of possible cases.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr Sinclair</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Two RAN officers have been sent to the United Kingdom to expedite and streamline procedures for the induction into the RAN of former Royal Navy officers who have already applied to transfer to the RAN. These two officers are not a recruiting team and they have been directed not to undertake any active recruiting. The requirement for their visit to the UK arose because of the inability of the Australian High Commission to process ex-RN officer entrants to the RAN following recent staffing reductions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The RAN is not actively seeking RN or ex-RN officer entrants. There are at present 43 RN or ex-RN officers who have been given conditional approval to enter the RAN and unsolicited applications continue to be received.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) RN or ex-RN officers being inducted into the RAN are principally engineers or maritime warfare specialists of the requisite rank and experience required for unfilled billets in the RAN. There is a world wide shortage of engineers and this is in part responsible for the RAN shortages. Appropriately trained and experienced naval specialists are not available from within the RAN's own ranks.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Non commissioned ranks in the RAN are not being denied any opportunity for promotion because of these measures. Initial offers of service to ex-RN officers guarantee neither permanency of employment nor promotion and with very few exceptions, these ex-RN officers serve in the RAN for limited periods and without career prospects. The RAN is continually striving to enhance the career prospects for both eligible non commissioned ranks and its junior officers but such is the complexity of modern maritime warfare that it is not possible to by- pass either essential training or experience during career progression if Australia's navy is to remain a credible fighting force with its officers demonstrating professional competence.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the 1982 direction of the Government of Eire, which followed the example of most European Governments, that, in National Schools, (a) teachers should have a lively regard for the improvement of their pupils, treat them with kindness combined with firmness and should aim at governing them through their affections and reason, and not by harshness and severity, (b) ridicule, sarcasm or remarks likely to undermine a pupil's self-confidence should not be used in any circumstances, (c) the use of corporal punshiment should be forbidden, and (d) any teacher who contravened these rules would be regarded as guilty of conduct unbefitting a teacher and subject to severe disciplinary action.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to the reports of spectacular success in the use of self-discipline by teachers in overcoming problems of difficult pupils in Education for Tomorrow's World, by Henden, Forland and Fraenki, published in 1970 by Grosvenor Books, London.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As my predecessor indicated in his reply to Question No. 3954 from the honourable member earlier this year, the Commonwealth's direct involvement in the administration of schools is limited to the Australian Capital Territory. The ACT Schools Authority has urged all ACT government schools to work towards the abolition of physical punishment.</PARA>
<PARA> ACT Government schools each have a school board which determines educational policy and philosophy for the school, operating within the general directions set by the ACT Schools Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> Schools in the ACT generally wish to be known for their caring relationships, where the teachers are aware of children's needs and guide and promote the whole development of each child, where the teacher's respect for the child as a person cultivates in him or her the desire to learn, and where caring and respect is mutual between all members of the school community.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as government schools in the States and non-government schools are concerned these are matters for the respective State and non-government school authorities to determine. However, I believe that in all schools, teachers who take a professional approach to their duties would adhere to humanitarian principles.</PARA>

<PARA>COMMITTEE FOR THE ALLOCATION OF LOAN FUNDS TO REFUGEES IN CENTRES (CALFRIC)</PARA>
<PARA> Under the CALFRIC loan scheme, funds from my Department's appropriation are allocated to a fund operated by the Committee for the Allocation of Loan Funds to Refugees in Centres (CALFRIC). This Committee makes small, interest-free loans (up to $600) to refugees, to assist them with the expenses of moving out of migrant centres into the community. Money from repayments on loans is recycled via the CALFRIC fund and lent to other refugees. The Committee comprises representatives of the following voluntary agencies:</PARA>
<PARA> The Salvation Army</PARA>
<PARA> Austcare</PARA>
<PARA> Indo China Refugee Association (Australia)</PARA>
<PARA> The Saint Vincent de Paul Society</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Council of Churches</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Council of Social Services;</PARA>
<PARA>as well as of Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Services and of my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1981-82, the Government allocated a further $200,000 to the CALFRIC loan fund bringing to $1.213m the total Commonwealth contribution.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department also makes payments via the Clothing Reimbursement Scheme to reimburse voluntary agencies for the cost of providing essential clothing and personal requisites to refugees who lack these items when they arrive in Australia. A detailed breakdown of all accounts submitted for payment under this scheme in 1981-82 would require an examination of every single claim, and would make demands of staffing resources which I am not prepared to authorise. The major agencies participating in the scheme were:</PARA>
<PARA> Saint Vincent de Paul Society</PARA>
<PARA> The Salvation Army</PARA>
<PARA> Red Cross</PARA>
<PARA> The Smith Family</PARA>
<PARA> Seventh Day Adventist Church</PARA>
<PARA> Hobart City Mission.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to those agencies, however, small community groups participating in the Community Refugee Settlement Scheme are eligible to claim reimbursement for clothing provided to refugees who bypass migrant centres and go straight into the community under that scheme; details of those groups are not readily available.</PARA>
<PARA> A total of $199,850 was paid to voluntary agencies under this scheme in 1981-82 .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Business Migration Program commenced on 19 April 1982. It superseded the previous entrepreneur migration category which had been in operation since November 1976. Arrivals of entrepreneurial migrants and business migrants in the last three financial years are as follows: 1979-80-78</PARA>
<PARA> 1980-81-106</PARA>
<PARA> 1981-82-263</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat was approved under the entrepreneur migration category in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) No. People selected under the former entrepreneurial category and the Business Migration Program are expected to settle in Australia and to satisfy normal migration requirements. The business proposal submitted by the applicant and the likely benefits of the proposal to Australia form important parts of consideration of the application.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) During 1981, 221,473 persons with resident status departed. Of these 10,719 were long term residents (i.e. one year or more) and the remaining 212,754 were short term residents (i.e. less than one year).</PARA>
<PARA> For the same period, 212,765 persons with resident status returned to Australia . This figure comprised 15,303 long term residents and 197,460 short term residents.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to extract from these figures the number of persons who may have departed and returned during the course of the year. The totals would also include persons who may have departed and returned more than once.</PARA>
<PARA> Separate statistics are not maintained on resident businessmen who travel in and out of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> (8) Business migrants are expected to settle permanently in Australia. However, some businessmen need to visit other countries in connection with their business affairs.

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to a statement by the Industrial Commissioner of NSW, issued on 18 August 1982, strongly critical of the conditions under which casual full-time teachers in the Adult Migrant Education Service are employed compared to the 77 permanent teachers in the service.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has his attention also been drawn to a statement by Mr Justice Bauer that ( a) the evidence is that the casual full-time teachers do the same work and participate in teaching education preparation and developments in the various centres and for all intents and purposes do the same work as if they were permanent employees and (b) it might reasonably be said that the conditions of employment result in the casual, full-time teachers subsidising the Adult Migrant Education Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) If so will he respond to the views expressed in the Industrial Commission by releasing the funds necessary to make these casual teaching positions permanent.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3166" SPEAKER="Hodges The Hon J.C." NAMEID="TE7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="ST GEORGE">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TE7">Mr Hodges</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) I have read the statement of Mr Justice Bauer of the NSW Industrial Commission which refers to the conditions of casual teachers employed for 20 hours per week in the NSW Adult Migrant Education Service.</PARA>
<PARA> I have noted that the transcript of the hearing cites instances of casual teachers undertaking activities which extend the time that they spend at the Adult Migrant Education Centre beyond 20 hours per week. The responsibilities of these casual teachers has been compared by Mr Justice Bauer with the permanent teachers who are on duty for 30 hours per week.</PARA>
<PARA> To ensure an adequate degree of flexibility in the size and distribution of the Adult Migrant Education Service to match the changing composition and needs of the non-English speaking migrant intake, it is desirable to have a balance of permanent and casual teachers. As at 15 September 1982, there were 115 permanent teacher positions in the NSW Adult Migrant Education Service. In response to approaches from the NSW Minister for Education, I have agreed to provide funding for the conversion of an additional 30 positions from casual to permanent.</PARA>
<PARA> Within the current appropriations further funds cannot be provided to convert casual positions to permanent ones without reducing the total number of hours of English language instruction available to migrants, or other important services. I have proposed adjustments to the teaching arrangements to make it possible to convert further positions from casual to permanent.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time I have undertaken to examine closely the basis for future funding of permanent teacher positions with particular attention to the appropriate proportion of permanent teachers, given the need for a mix of permanent and casual staff. This is a matter which has national implications and I have indicated to the NSW Minister for Education that the Commonwealth will need to take account of these national implications in responding further to approaches from NSW.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The determination of electricity charges is the responsibility of State Governments and the authorities responsible for generation and/or distribution of electricity within each State. Tariff policies vary such that some States have uniform State-wide charges while in other States charges vary between regions. For your information, however, indicative capital city charges are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) For typical domestic consumers using 5000 kilowatt hours per annum and including some off-peak usage where applicable at 1 October 1982:</PARA>

<PARA>Hobart  4.5</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra  5.4</PARA>
<PARA>Darwin  7.6</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Unit charges applicable to commercial consumers vary considerably according to the amount of electricity consumed. However, for indicative purposes a typical commerical consumer has been assumed to use 250 000 kilowatt hours per year, i.e. equivalent to the electricity consumption of an average multi-storey office block. Based on this assumption the average cost to commercial consumers in Australian capital cities at 1 October 1982 would be:</PARA>
<PARA>c/kWh</PARA>

<PARA>Canberra  8.0</PARA>
<PARA>Darwin  9.0</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Unit charges for industrial consumers also vary considerably according to the level of consumption of the particular industrial consumer. The following are indicative of tariffs charges to small, i.e. 2 million kilowatt hours (GWh) per year, medium (15 GWh) and large (60 GWh) industrial consumers in Australian capital cities as at 1 October 1982:</PARA>
<PARA>2 GWh 15 GWh 60 GWh</PARA>

<PARA> (2) and (3) All States publish tariffs under which large industrial consumers can be charged and in some instances negotiate tariffs with very large consumers (e.g. aluminium smelters).

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> $2.3m was appropriated for free or concessional railway fares and freight for 1981-82 including a once only carryover amount of $0.22m from 1980-81. This carryover was brought about by a change in Australian National Railway Commission's accounting methods since July 1981, from retrospective to current claims.</PARA>
<PARA> The actual expenditure for 1981-82 was $2.08m. The allocation for 1982-83 is $2 .2m. After applying the Gross Domestic Product Implicit Price Deflator of 10.3 per cent, there is only a 4.1 per cent decrease in real terms from the 1981-82 appropriation. In the light of forecast economic circumstances it was felt that likely travel demand would not be high and that the funds provided would meet the requirement.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) I asked my Department for a detailed report so that I could thoroughly review Mr Friedrich's case.</PARA>
<PARA> The facts concerning Mr Friedrich are as follows: Mr Friedrich and his family arrived as visitors on 2 October 1981. Four days later in direct contravention of the undertakings they signed when they applied for their visitors visas, the Friedrich's sought permanent residence.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Friedrich argued that because he had helped people escape from East Germany his life was in danger in his home country of West Germany.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to this my Department contacted the Australian Embassy in West Germany; the West German authorities confirmed that Mr Friedrich was an 'escape helper' but that he was in no danger while he remained in West Germany.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that Mr Friedrich returned to West Berlin after he had arrived in Australia confirms this.</PARA>
<PARA> At the time I reviewed the case Mr Friedrich had not applied for refugee status in Australia. He subsequently did so through his solicitors. I am mindful of Australia's obligations under the Refugee Convention and the proud record this country has of accepting genuine refugees over past decades.

<PARA> (1) Yes. Mr Wallenberg's heroism in saving the lives of large numbers of potential victims of Nazi persecutions in Hungary during World War II is well- known and has been widely acknowledged.

<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) and (5) The Australian Government fully supports the efforts of Sweden to have the case re-examined by the Soviet authorities. Because the Australian Government has no direct standing in the matter, however, there has been little opportunity for us to make an effective intervention.

<PARA> I address my question to the Acting Attorney-General. He is no doubt aware that an enormous amount of commerce in Australia is carried out in proprietary companies. He would be aware also that to form a proprietary company it is necessary to have $2, two directors and two shareholders. In view of the wide- ranging use of proprietary companies, would he and the Government give consideration to ensuring that the capitalisation of these companies is such as to bear their responsibilities and that to do that may require some gearing within the companies' structure? Also, having determined that, would he like to pursue that matter with the ministerial council, where I am sure he would find some welcoming ears?</PARA>

<PARA> The Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities, at a meeting held in Sydney on 12 February 1982, considered a proposal that the Companies Act 1981 should require all companies to raise and maintain a prescribed minimum nominal and paid-up capital. At that meeting the Ministerial Council agreed that this proposal should be considered in the context of the proposed Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1984.

<PARA> (1) and (2) The decision to undertake an independent review of the functions, structure and operation of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH and MRC) was made by the Government in July 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (5) The decision was taken in the context of the Government's budgetary considerations of operating costs of the NH and MRC. As such, it is inappropriate for the document to be tabled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No. However, as the ASTEC Report on Medical Research in Australia would have been an important source document, the implementation of the review was deferred until the report was available.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) See (1) to (5) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Dr B. J. Shea, O.B.E. (a) 22 January 1982; (b) 8 March 1982. Dr J. P. Coghlan (a) 12 January 1982; (b) 3 March 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Dr Shea left Australia on 18 April 1982 and returned on 5 May 1982. This commitment was known prior to his appointment to the Review Committee, and did not affect the preparation and presentation of the Review Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) The Review Committee had, as part of its Terms of Reference, a requirement to report to the Minister for Health by 30 May 1982. The Committee considered that a closing date for submissions of 19 April 1982 was desirable to allow evaluation of the material provided. The Committee did, however, continue to receive submissions lodged after the formal closing date.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The following organisations, institutes and individuals were invited, on the dates indicated, to make a submission to the Review Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> Heads of all State and Territory Health Departments and authorities-16 March 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Professional bodies and organisations represented on Council-16 March 1982</PARA>

<PARA> (13) The NH and MRC is a body which provides professional and scientific advice to Governments. A wide cross-section of relevant bodies affected by the NH and MRC's activities were invited to lodge submissions. Therefore, a public announcement about the review was considered unnecessary.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) Yes. Reasons for these specific variations have not been identified. However the levels of dissolved solids and sodium can vary with the sources of supply and with local weather patterns, and changes over a 3 1/2 year period ( the interval between the answers) are not unexpected. By way of example, in the A.C.T. since early 1979, water from the Googong Dam has been used to augment supplies from dams on the Cotter River. Because water from the Googong Dam has levels of total dissolved solids and sodium marginally higher than water from the dams in the Cotter catchment, A.C.T. water now has a range of values (see answer to Question No. 4584).</PARA>
<PARA> Questions seeking additional information on particular supplies are best directed to the appropriate water authority.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) I am advised that the aspects mentioned were considered. However, all matters in the report must be considered by all the other relevant expert committees and their reports, in turn, examined by the Council before any recommendations are made by the NH and MRC.</PARA>

Indeed, the Commonwealth has also employed a number of Consultants to undertake specialist tasks during the Study.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) I am advised that no consideration is being given by any regulatory agency in the United States of America for dumping high-level waste in the Pacific Ocean. Sea-dumping of high-level waste is prohibited by the United States Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972. In addition, the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter of 1972, to which the United States is a signatory, declares high-level radioactive wastes as unsuitable for dumping at sea.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Government has drawn to the attention of the United States resolutions of the South Pacific Forum, of which Australia is a member, expressing opposition to the dumping of nuclear wastes in the Pacific Ocean. These resolutions reflect the deep concern felt by the South Pacific countries about the dumping of radioactive waste in the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The question of the disposal of their nuclear waste is a domestic responsibility of individual countries as a part of the management of their nuclear power industries. However, in the light of the answers given to (1), (2) and (3) above Australia has no expectation that the United States will dump high -level nuclear wastes or other nuclear wastes unsuitable for dumping at sea in the Pacific Ocean, irrespective of whether or not such wastes are derived from Australian origin uranium or other nuclear materials.</PARA>

<PARA> A number of officers in the Department's Central Office and the Northern Territory spend varying proportions of their time handling matters associated with uranium mining in the Northern Territory. The estimated expenditure in 1982 -83 on salaries and allowances for officers involved with uranium mining activities in the Northern Territory is $126,000.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ML7">Mr McVeigh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) and (b) In 1981-82 the National Library spent $2,492,000 on the purchase of books, $24,600 on the purchase of sound recordings and $18,600 on the oral history recording program. In 1982-83 it plans to spend $3,012,000 on the book collection, $46,000 on the purchase of sound recordings and $25,000 on the oral history program.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Library is not able to acquire the full range of any type of library material as defined in the Library's published Selection Policy. In spending the sound recordings budget, which is a responsibility of the Sound Archivist, priority has been given to the purchase of retrospective materials, since these may come on the market only once.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The legal deposit provisions of the Copyright Act 1968, under which books and other printed materials are deposited in the Library, do not extend to sound recordings or other non-print materials. However in May this year the members of the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) agreed to deposit voluntarily in the Library one pressing of all records manufactured in Australia by them from the beginning of 1982. The Attorney-General's Department is presently reviewing audio-visual copyright law. In a submission to that Department, the Library has recommended the extension of the deposit provisions to include sound recordings and other materials.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) About 200,000 recordings, approximately half of the Library's recording collection, are stored at the old Government Printing Office at Kingston A.C.T. While this accommodation is not considered to provide satisfactory conditions of storage, considerable resources have been devoted during 1982 to improving this environment. A recent Library conservation condition report states that ''the provision of sisalation which covers all windows prevents light from coming into the building . . . the floor is clean, while the building is not dust free, dust is now controlled . . . there is no evidence of vermin . . . in short the storage condition of records has dramatically improved. All 12 inch records have been sleeved and the sleeving of 10 inch records is well underway.'' The risk of damage to those parts of the Library's collections which cannot be stored in the Library building, was recognised by the Government when it authorised the construction of a 7,000 sq. m. extension to the building in the 1982-83 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The sound recording collection is not yet adequately documented or catalogued. Because of the rapid growth of the collection since its establishment in 1971 to 416,000 records at 30 June 1982, priority has been given to organising it prior to cataloguing. Considerable progress has been made in the organisation of the collection.</PARA>
<PARA> Since January 1981 a task force, originally of 3 and now of 6 part-time staff, has been engaged in the organisation of the recordings. In that time more than 60,000 broadcast discs have been organised so that any identified discs can be retrieved immediately. More than 40,000 LP discs have also been organised to allow retrieval of an identified disc and organisation of the considerable 78 collection is well underway.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) At present no librarian works in the Sound Recording Section. This is one of the specialist areas of the Library where administrative, rather than Librarian designations, have been adopted at least for the present. The Head of the Section, the Sound Archivist, is recognised as one of the leaders of his profession in Australia. It is planned to allocate a Librarian to the Section in 1982-83 to proceed with a cataloguing program.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) One full-time member of staff is engaged in copying sound recordings. Generally these recordings have been lent to the Library for the purpose of obtaining copies for the sound recordings collection. From time to time the Sound Archivist also allocates resources to the copying of material for broadcast. In the past limited facilities existed for listening. It has been necessary to curtail the listening service in 1982 due to limited resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) There are presently 4 full-time members of staff, in addition to 6 part- time officers who each work 30 hours per week in sorting and organising the recordings. Between December 1981 and September 1982 the Section had the additional services of a Technical Assistant, dedicated exclusively to copying sound material. A replacement for this officer will shortly be appointed. No relevant comment can be offered about the staff of an average suburban record shop.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) All special collections in the Library would benefit from the injection of subject specialists. However, in determining the resources it should allocate in meeting its obligation to preserve and develop the national collections and to make them available for use, the Library must take into account the need to respond to demands for the development of all services. Since 1973 the permanent establishment of the Sound Recording Section has been increased from 2 to 4 with appropriate upward reclassification. In addition, since 1981 a total of 6 part- time positions have been assigned to the Section. This increase in staff has taken place over a period (since 1979) in which the National Library's overall ceiling has actually fallen by 9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The Sound Recording Section, as elsewhere within the Library, must determine an order of priorities in utilising its resources. Because of more pressing commitments, only a very small proportion of acetate material has been copied. However, such material is stored in environmentally controlled conditions which inhibit further deterioration.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) The establishment of the sound recording collection and services was a pioneering initiative by the Library. The Library is currently the major public source of audio information, both through its sound recording collection and services and oral history unit.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) No. The Library has enhanced the resources available for its sound archives since January 1981.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0N7">Mr Nixon</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Neither the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation nor its predecessor has sold dried vine fruits on international markets. The Corporation's powers are generally to promote and control the export of dried vine fruit from Australia and its powers to trade in dried fruit placed under its control have not been used to date. A consortium of packing houses formed a private company for marketing purposes during the 1920s. Today this company is known as Australian Dried Fruits Sales Pty Ltd (ADFS) and the honourable member may have confused this company with the statutory organisation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The meaning of the term ''growers' organisations'' is not clear. There are 57 persons, organisations or companies that have been granted licences to export dried vine fruit in 1982 but only four are significant in volume of sales on international markets. The main industry organisation for example, known as Australian Dried Fruits Association (ADFA), is composed of packers and marketing firms as well as growers but it does not engage in the selling of fruit. Members of the ADFA control about 95 per cent of Australian dried vine fruit production; the remaining 5 per cent is packed by two independent companies in South Australia. For several years all fruit produced by ADFA members was marketed through ADFS. In late 1981, however, the Robinvale Producers Co-operative Co. Ltd, the Barmera Co-operative Packing Co. Ltd, and Berri Co-operative Packing Union Ltd-all members of ADFA-appointed G. Wood Son and Co. Pty Ltd as their marketing agent for the domestic and export markets.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) None. See (1) above. However, I understand that the Mildura Co-operative Fruit Company Ltd and Irymple Packing Pty Ltd sell fruit through ADFS. The two South Australian independent packers arrange their own sales.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The approximate percentages of the dried vine fruit crop packed by the various groups of packers are:</PARA>
<PARA> Mildura Co-operative Fruit Company Ltd, approximately 39 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Irymple Packing Pty Ltd, Aurora Packing Pty Ltd, Coomealla Packing Pty Ltd, Sarnia Packing Pty Ltd, approximately 42 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Rivergrowers Co-operative Ltd, Waikerie Co-operative Producers Ltd, Anganston Fruitgrowers Co-operative Ltd, Swan Settlers Co-operative Association. Ltd, approximately 4 per cent (sold through ADFS).</PARA>
<PARA> Robinvale Producers Co-operative Co. Ltd, Barmera Co-operative Packing Co. Ltd, Berri Co-operative Packing Union Ltd, approximately 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Angas Park Fruit Company Pty Ltd, Robern (Overseas) Pty Ltd, approximately 5 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> (5) There are at present two dried fruit sellers exporting on behalf of their packer principals. The two South Australian independent packers conduct their own export operations. The quantities exported are those permitted by the corporation to be exported generally or to specific markets. The Corporation endeavours to ensure, as far as it is practicable to so do, that each exporter's share of each export market or region is proportionate to his annual handling of dried vine fruits.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The United Kingdon is the only major international market affected by the recent changes in Australian selling arrangements. All four main Australian sellers export to the UK. In recent years there has been no competition between them in that market, as they have been required to sell through the one agent approved by the Corporation to sell Australian dried vine fruit there. The Corporation also lays down minimum prices, and certain terms and conditions, for sales to export markets.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1982, after representations by a significant sector of the Australian industry, the Corporation approved three agents in the UK market as part of an investigation to help it decide on future agency arrangements. Each seller now conducts his trade with the UK through a particular one of the three agents. No evidence is yet available to indicate that the new agency arrangements in 1982 have reduced returns to producers. The main competition in that market in 1982 has been from cheap Turkish fruits.</PARA>

Mr C. Lloyd-Bostock is one of the three new members and was appointed as having such qualifications.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Mr Lucey is the General Manager of the largest co-operative packing house, Mildura Co-operative Fruit Co Ltd, but the Irymple Group of proprietary companies packs a larger volume of dried fruit.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Australian Dried Fruits Corporation has power to approve arrangements necessary or convenient to control export of dried fruits from Australia, and to control the sale and distribution after export, of Australian dried fruits. This power includes requiring that a purchaser, agent or representative to or through whom the dried fruits are shipped be approved by the Corporation. The arrangements approved, which vary from market to market, are reviewed from time to time in the light of changing circumstances in Australia and overseas. Since the appointment of Corporation members early in 1982, two additional import agencies have been approved for the United Kingdom market.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No significant increase has occurred in the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation's administrative costs following appointment of the two additional agents.</PARA>
<PARA> (6)There is no definitive evidence whether the dual agency arrangements in the UK are favoured or opposed by a majority of dried vine fruit producers. The Corporation of course has power to act without seeking such evidence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's question are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government has received reports confirming that some members of the Seychelles army mutinied in August. The rebels complained of mistreatment and demanded the dismissal of several senior officers. The mutiny collapsed after 36 hours when troops supporting the Rene Administration captured key installations. The press reported that five mutineers, one loyalist soldier and two civilians were killed and that Tanzanian troops were involved in an unsuccessful attempt to retake the radio station. Other reports suggest that a large number of Seychellois were killed, but the Government is not able to verify this. The Government has not seen any reports connecting the deaths of Seychellois with action by Tanzanian troops.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) Yes. However I understand that throughout Europe many major galleries and art museums such as the Louvre, charge for admission.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. There are works of art and other items of importance to the nation's heritage which are displayed in Commonwealth institutions and buildings as mentioned by the honourable member. These works do not, however, come within the meaning of National Collection as defined in the National Gallery Act 1975 as being all works of art that are owned by the Gallery from time to time. Charges are levied for entry to the Australian National Gallery only.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) An extensive range of exemptions applies in relation to charges for admission to the Australian National Gallery as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> children under 15;</PARA>
<PARA> full-time students;</PARA>
<PARA> persons in receipt of pensions, benefits and allowances under the Social Security Act 1947 and the Repatriation Act 1920 and their dependants; and</PARA>
<PARA> members of the Australian National Gallery Association.</PARA>
<PARA> It is anticipated that over 50 per cent of visitors to the gallery will be admitted free in this way.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member may be aware that the Gallery recently announced that, by arrangement with ESSO Australia Ltd, the Gallery will be open to the public free of charge, for a three hour period from 5.00pm to 8.00pm on Thursday evenings during the daylight saving period to 10 March 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Works of art and other material of importance to the nation's heritage which are displayed in Commonwealth institutions and buildings, including the collection owned by the National Gallery, and the Gallery building itself, have been funded principally from annual appropriations made by Parliament. From time to time these collections have been supplemented by specific donations from individuals. Some are also enhanced by surplus material from Government departments and authorities. For example, some Government aircraft have become part of the collection of the Australian War Memorial in this way.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I replied to the Port Augusta Corporation on 7 September 1982 in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The level of rail traffic in flammable liquids through Port Augusta is not considered a significant safety hazard. The quantities of petrol and LPG carried by rail through Port Augusta are 180 tonnes per week and 20 tonnes per week, respectively. These quantities are relatively small and much less than that carried every day through many Australian Communities. It is generally acknowledged that rail transport of these goods is considerably safer than road transport. Within the town limits, safe operating procedures ensure that the risk of accidents with these fuels is minimised.</PARA>
<PARA> The conditions for transporting of flammable liquids by the Australian National Railways Commission are regulated by the provisions of the Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail, which ensures the safest possible conditions of carriage.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has, in the interests of effective town planning, indicated that it sees a long term need for a by-pass route around Port Augusta. Current indications suggest that the by-pass will not be required for quite some time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) On 6 June 1979 the then Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Development, Mr W. F. Bird, wrote to the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Chaney , conveying the Council's decision to recommend the 'removal of the optional electoral enrolment provision in respect of Aboriginals'. He also set out the Council's rider to that recommendation-</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Council further decided that . . . the amendment should be delayed until after a program of electoral education had been undertaken and completed. This delay is intended to allow a program of electoral education to run for some time so that Aboriginals currently unenrolled may be given the opportunity of learning about elections, enrolment and voting before they are required by law to enrol. A delay of a period of between 2-4 years for this purpose is envisaged by Council'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Aboriginal Electoral Education Program Teams commenced in Western Australia and South Australia in June 1979. A third team began operating in January 1981 when the program was extended to the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no proposal to extend the program to other States during 1982-83. The program will be extended as and when financial and staff resources permit.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No, not at this stage. However, any extension of the program to Queensland or other States would, of course, be made in consultation with the State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Subsequent to March 1980 the Queensland Government decided, for what I understand to be reasons of State electoral administration, not to enter into joint roll arrangements with the Commonwealth. It must be remembered, however, that the conduct of State elections and the maintenance of electoral rolls for State purposes are matters for the State Governments concerned. Discussions are proceeding on the possible introduction of dual Commonwealth-State electoral claim cards.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) As at 11 November 1982, enrolment for both Commonwealth and State purposes in New South Wales was identical; and, in Victoria 243 more electors were enrolled for Commonwealth purposes than for State purposes. This difference in Victoria results from the different residential requirements of Commonwealth and State Legislation-the Commonwealth legislation requires one months residence in a Subdivision before an enrolment entitlement is established, whereas the Victorian legislation requires three months residence.</PARA>
<PARA> In New South Wales and Victoria the State electoral legislation does not differentiate between Aboriginals, natural-born or naturalized subjects and therefore there are no separate details regarding the enrolment of Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) As was stated in the answer to Question No. 5628 part 3 (Hansard, 31 March 1980, page 1492), in those States where it is compulsory for Aboriginals to enrol, the enforcement of the compulsory provisions is the responsibility of State authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Government has made a commitment to introduce compulsory enrolment for Aboriginals. That commitment still stands. The timing of the necessary amending legislation is a matter for the Government.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (a) The Commonwealth Government and the Government of South Australia have a joint commitment to complete the reconstruction and sealing of the Stuart Highway in South Australia between Port Augusta and the Northern Territory border by 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the size of this project, and the difficulties of constructing roads in harsh, remote locations, it is not possible to predict accurately at this stage when it will be completed. However, at the present construction rate, it is anticipated the highway will be sealed to the border by late 1986 ahead of the 1987 commitment.</PARA>
<PARA> Sealing of the road between Port Augusta and Pimba was completed in March 1981 when reconstruction and sealing of the 50 kilometres between Bookaloo and Mount Gunson was finished. Of the remaining 757 kilometres of the highway between Pimba and the Northern Territory border, it is expected that sealing as far as Gosses will be completed by the end of November this year, bringing to 334 kilometres the total length of sealed road north of Port Augusta.</PARA>

<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has allocated additional funding to enable the New South Wales Government to increase the number of permanent teachers by 30 positions in 1982-83.

My Department's review of the arrangements in other States indicates a situation which differs markedly from State to State in terms of remuneration and in terms of leave benefits and tenure for non-permanent teachers.</PARA>

<PARA> The re-organisation of the top structure of the Department is being implemented . As part of the restructuring of the Department it is proposed to locate in Canberra all Commission delegates who handle appeals against decisions of Repatriation Boards. This should enhance the consistency of decision-making at this level. In addition, a Legal Services Division has been established. Among other things, it will advise on the functions, structure and operation of the determining system.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the priority tasks of the new Legal Services Division will be the development of a system of reference documentation for distribution to all Repatriation Boards and Commission delegates. This documentation will include copies of identified significant decisions of the Courts and the Repatriation Review Tribunal as they become available. The Legal Division is responsible for developing a consistent approach to the consideration of claims and appeals and identifying training requirements for those engaged in the determination system. Some training courses have already been run. This Division is also responsible for monitoring the decisions of the various determining bodies to check that they are consistent and correct in law.</PARA>
<PARA> These matters are still in the developing stage. While it is hoped that they will result in more effective decision-making, it is too early to assess any effects.</PARA>
<PARA> The Repatriation Review Tribunal has commenced collecting copies of its decisions reasons in a form to make them more readily accessible and in this exercise the Tribunal is seeking to identify more significant decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> I also understand that the Tribunal has been convening meetings of Deputy Presidents to discuss the various decisions of the Courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the Repatriation area.</PARA>

<PARA> Whether the Government will initiate a program throughout Australia to educate us in the words of our new anthem, 'Advance Australia Fair'.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Advance Australia Fair' was chosen as the National Tune by a large majority of voters at a national poll in 1977. It was particularly noted at the time that the choice was for a tune and not a song and that 'God Save The Queen' would remain the National Anthem.</PARA>
<PARA> The original words of 'Advance Australia Fair', composed by Peter Dodds McCormick in 1878, were written for an earlier period in our history and are not officially recognised for use today. Earlier this year the Government considered whether it should take formal steps concerning words for a National Song. It was felt that words that would find general acceptance would evolve in time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The International Year of Mobilisation for Sanctions against South Africa was proposed by the International Conference on Sanctions against South Africa, which was held in Paris from 20-27 May 1981. Australia attended the Paris Conference as an observer, but did not participate in its deliberations and does not adhere to the Paris Declaration.</PARA>
<PARA> In November 1981 the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution (36/ 172 B) which endorsed the report of the Paris Conference and proclaimed the year 1982 International Year of Mobilisation for Sanctions against South Africa. Australia abstained on this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's approach is based on the Government's belief that the subject of mandatory sanctions is within the exclusive competence of the Security Council. However should the Security Council decide to impose sanctions against South Africa, Australia would abide by its decision.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia has adopted a number of measures, which could be regarded as sanctions in the broadest sense of the term, against both the Soviet Union and South Africa. These measures are designed to curtail the range of our bilaterial relations with those countries and are an expression of the Government's condemnation of the policies and actions of the governments of those countries.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no inconsistency between the measures adopted in the cases of South Africa and the Soviet Union.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. I am advised that investigations into the 'Barclay' brand of cigarettes commenced before questions were asked in the Parliament concerning claims about the delivery of tar and nicotine by this brand and possible implications for the testing methodology currently in use. The investigations followed an informal expression of concern by representatives of an Australian cigarette manufacturer in April 1982 regarding the validity and comparability of tar and nicotine yield test results for the 'Barclay' brand of cigarettes. My Department and the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL) investigated technical aspects of the type of filter used and of the implications as regards the testing methodology used in accordance with the Voluntary Code in Respect of CPM ('Tar') and Nicotine Labelling on Cigarette Packaging.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) Based on the results of the investigations referred to in (1) and the evidence available to my Department and AGAL, including the results of research conducted overseas, there appears to be no scientific case for any change in the current industry/AGAL agreed collaborative testing methodology for determining tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ML7">Mr McVeigh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australia Council has advised me as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Grants made by the Theatre Board to the Popular Theatre Troupe in 1982 were :</PARA>
<PARA> General grant towards activities-$75,000</PARA>
<PARA> Supplementary grant-$4,000</PARA>
<PARA> Challenge grant-$4,000</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Theatre Board funding for the Troupe over recent years has reflected the Board's concern to assist the development of a diversity of theatre experiences. The Popular Theatre Troupe has been an innovative force in drama in Queensland in terms of its approach to drama and its commitment to presenting theatre in community venues such as shopping centres, schools and factories.</PARA>
<PARA> In approving the grant towards the Troupe's activities in 1982, the Board took into account the Troupe's record of presenting innovative productions and the lack of similar theatre experiences available in Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Theatre Board has decided not to provide financial assistance to the Troupe in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The material contained in productions of the Popular Theatre Troupe has related to controversial social issues and on some occasions has contained satirical material aimed at the Queensland Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Two productions of the Troupe-Crook Shop and The State We're In (1982) have not been approved for performance in State high schools. This is a matter for the Queensland Arts Council and the Education Department in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No representations concerning the Popular Theatre Troupe have been received by the Australia Council from the Queensland Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Board considered other applicants had stronger claims for assistance from the limited funds at its disposal. The Board's decision also took into account the following factors affecting the Troupe's operations:</PARA>
<PARA> the precarious financial position of the company, including its continuing failure to attract significant funding from sources other than the Australia Council;</PARA>
<PARA> concern about the artistic development of the company;</PARA>
<PARA> frequent turnover of actors and staff which has resulted in the discontinuity of the Troupe's activities and a failure to develop professional skills;</PARA>
<PARA> at a meeting with the Theatre Board in Brisbane on 24 September 1982, members of the Company could not indicate to the Board that they would continue with the Troupe in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Concern about the artistic development of the Troupe was a factor which influenced the Board's decision to withdraw its support. The term 'artistic development' refers to the ability of the Troupe to maintain its operations on a sound basis and to continue to present stimulating drama productions of high quality. The Board considers the following factors inhibit the Troupe's artistic development:</PARA>
<PARA> the Troupe is without an artistic director;</PARA>
<PARA> there is frequent turnover of members of the Troupe, most members serving for 12 months only;</PARA>
<PARA> there has been a frequent turnover of administrators for the Troupe;</PARA>
<PARA> the Troupe lacks long term artistic plans.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) No. Council decisions to fund the Troupe have not been influenced by the content of the Troupe's productions. Nor was the content of the Troupe's productions considered in relation to the Board's decision to withdraw funding in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The Queensland Government has never funded the Troupe. The Theatre Board has always been aware of the refusal of the Queensland Government to fund the Troupe and it was not a consideration in the Board's decision to withdraw funding.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) No fixed guidelines have been developed to cover situations where State funding is not available for theatre groups. The Theatre Board considers applications against its policies as set out in its policy booklet, the artistic merit of projects proposed, and funds available.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The Theatre Board will, on request from the Troupe, review its decision.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy, who has responsibility for the uranium enrichment feasibility study, has provided me with the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia is basing its investigations on a plant size of 1 million SWU/per annum; however, to be economic, the capacity of the enrichment plant would need to grow from 200,000 SWU/year in the early 1990' s to approximately 1 million SWU/year over a period of five to six years. The UEGA anticipates that the plant would eventually reach a capacity of 3 million SWU/year, twelve to fifteen years after start-up.</PARA>
<PARA> 2(a) It is not possible to estimate the construction workforce on a yearly basis as construction of gas centrifuge enrichment plants is characterised by the continued addition of production units as demands grows. It is estimated, however, that the construction workforce could amount to some four hundred people on average, who may be able to enjoy semi-permanency, possibly for more than 10 years depending on the rate of growth of the enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) It is estimated that the operational labour force would grow from some two hundred people to about five hundred.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The capital cost of the plant when at 1 million SWU/year capacity would be in the region of $600m in 1982 dollars rising to $1.5 billion at a capacity of 3 million SWU/year.</PARA>
<PARA> 4(a), (b), (c) The UEGA has not studied in detail the establishment of a uranium conversion plant, however this would be necessary if a full-scale feasibility study is undertaken and if it is apparent that no other organisation is interested in establishing a conversion plant.</PARA>
<PARA> A feasibility study of a uranium conversion plant at Pt. Pirie is being conducted by the Uranium Conversion Joint Venture comprising Broken Hill Associated Smelters Pty Ltd, Roxby Management Services Pty Ltd, British Nuclear Fuels Limited, and the South Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that an Australian uranium conversion plant should ideally have an initial capacity of around 1,000 tonnes U/year, rising to a maximum of 4,500 tonnes U/year by the time enrichment capacity reaches 3 million SWU/year (early in the 2000's).</PARA>
<PARA> The capital cost of such a plant would vary with capacity and the technology chosen, in the range of $60m-$120m (in 1982 dollars). Likewise, direct employment in normal operation would range from 100 to 300 people with probably around 500 during construction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my address at the official opening of the International Trade Development Centre in Melbourne on 8 November 1982, I said that the Australian Government has put forward a package of proposals for consideration at the GATT Ministerial Meeting being held in late November. I indicated that the proposals covered areas such as protectionism, subsidies, safeguards, agriculture and dispute settlement and, in particular, involved a standstill on all industry assistance measures which have a trade distorting effect, to be followed by a wind-back of these measures. I pointed out, moreover, that the latter proposal is designed to break the vicious circle of protectionism and develop momentum for sustained economic recovery and growth. I said that such an approach was essential if the present economic malaise is to be overcome and the 'beggar thy neighbour' policies which we saw leading up to the economic chaos of the 1930s are to be avoided. A copy of my address is available from the Parliamentary Library. As has been stated on many occasions, the Australian initiative relating to protectionism concerns international protectionism-that is, a commitment by the major trading nations to reverse the trend of recent years towards increased protectionism. In this context, there has been no suggestion that Australia would act unilaterally. What I said in effect on 8 November was that the Australian Government believes that the major trading nations of the world must take measures to liberalise trade, not restrict it. The Government considers that a meaningful and lasting commitment of this type is necessary to facilitate an early return to sustained growth in world trade coupled with brighter prospects for economic recovery.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 September 1982, (Hansard, page 1778) Mr Bowen asked the Treasurer the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the Supreme Court Action involving McCabe-Lafranchi and Commercial Securities (Vic.) Pty Ltd before Mr Justice Jenkinson. A judgment was delivered as far back as 14 June 1979. I refer to the fact that in His Honor's judgment he said: . . . one of the inspectors gave evidence that the attention of officers of the Income Tax Department had been directed, at the inspector's suggestion, by an officer of the Corporate Affairs Office to a very large pile of documents then standing in an enclosed but uncovered yard . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Those documents were collected by officers of the Australian Taxation Office. They related to corporations engaged in tax evasion. Is it a fact that no investigations were undertaken into these companies and the promoters of tax evasion schemes, even after the Australian Taxation Office had come into possession of the documents? This occurred three years prior to the publication of the McCabe-Lafranchi report. Is it also a fact that no investigations have been carried out with respect to these companies and promoters since the publication of the McCabe-Lafranchi report?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has confirmed that a large volume of documents and financial records were obtained by his officers in May 1979 from an open area where the records had been, for some time, subjected to the prevailing weather conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this exposure to the elements some of the material was so badly damaged that it had to be destroyed. In addition, examination of the remaining documents and records indicated that in most instances the documents and records of the companies were incomplete. Taxation officers were able to obtain better information regarding the profits and sales of shares in the companies from other sources. As is evident from my comments of 27 June 1982 on the McCabe-Lafranchi report, taxation investigations of stripped companies were conducted on a test case basis, that is, action in regard to the bulk of companies awaited the outcome of attempted proceedings in representative cases. Legal advice had been sought in respect of such cases as early as 1974.</PARA>
<PARA> A special prosecutor has recently been appointed with the specific task of prosecuting persons responsible for stripping companies with pre-tax profits. Charges have already been laid against several persons. Other cases are under investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> It should not be overlooked that the recently-introduced Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill will apply to many of the companies for which records are held. The proposed legislation will require the former owners of companies that were stripped of pre-tax profits and promoters of those arrangements to effect recoupment of the evaded tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 September 1982 (Hansard, page 1447) Mr Cunningham asked the Treasurer, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I asked on 24 August in relation to the importation of a Spanish aircraft by a Melbourne aviation company. At that time I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Did the Australian Taxation Office give a clearance to the importers to declare the aircraft to be new? Was the Taxation Office aware that the aircraft was declared at Customs as a demonstration aircraft? Is it a fact that the aircraft first flew in 1978? Is it a fact the aircraft was originally an armed forces aircraft in Spain? What criteria did the Taxation Office refer to in declaring the aircraft to be new?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am not in a position to answer that question today; I hope to be so tomorrow .</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Treasurer in a position to answer the question now? If not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated in answer to the question without notice on 15 September 1982, the Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that the provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act preclude him from divulging information in relation to the particular aviation company.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner was able to say, however, that it is a feature of the investment allowance concession that it applies only to new property. The income tax law defines new to mean not having previously been either used by any person or acquired or held by any person for use by that person. Reconditioned or wholly or mainly reconstructed property does not qualify as new property. Whether property that has, before acquisition, been a demonstration model would qualify as new property would depend upon the degree of use to which the property had been put for demonstration purposes.</PARA>

<PARA> What was the estimated loss to taxation revenue as a result of the successful operation of tax avoidance schemes and arrangements which have been the subject of specific anti-tax avoidance legislation since 1975-76, from the time the schemes commenced to operate or were discovered until the time the legislation took effect.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3215" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="HUNTER">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not possible to estimate the loss to taxation revenue that may result from the tax avoidance schemes referred to in the honourable member's question. The Commissioner of Taxation does not accept that the vast majority of schemes which were entered into in the period referred to by the honourable member have achieved the result of avoiding tax. However, taxpayers involved in the schemes which the Commissioner contends are ineffective have generally exercised their rights of objection and appeal. The resulting disputes will probably ultimately have to be resolved in the courts. As the Commissioner indicated in the 60th Report to Parliament, the matter of bringing before the courts cases representative of the various schemes is a long drawn out process which is frequently prolonged by unco-operative scheme promoters. This remains true notwithstanding that, as stated in the 61st Report, cases representative of 28 kinds of scheme were heard or awaited hearing during 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> Until the efficacy of the various schemes has been determined by the courts, it is not possible to say how much tax has in fact been avoided. Recent decisions of the courts which have upheld the Commissioner's rejection of some schemes indicates that other schemes are also likely to be held to be ineffective. To safeguard the revenue against the possibility of the courts ultimately finding in favour of the taxpayers, action has been taken to outlaw the various schemes as soon as full details have been obtained.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, although there was an amount of $1,035m unpaid and further substantial amounts paid against disputed liability in respect of all identified tax avoidance schemes (other than those involving companies that have been stripped of their pre-tax profits) as at 8 October 1982, it is confidently expected that, when the judicial processes available to taxpayers involved in those schemes have been exhausted, the amount of revenue actually lost as a result of the schemes will be substantially less than the figure mentioned. It is also relevant that legislation has been introduced that will increase from 10 per cent per annum to 20 per cent per annum the penalty for late payment of income tax.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) No. On page 19 of its Report the Taxation Review Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 'A distinction must be made here between ''narrow-based'' taxes falling upon only a few consumption goods and services (even though they be ones that absorb quite a significant proportion of total expenditure) and ''broad-based'' taxes levied on very large ranges of goods and services even if not quite all consumption. The Australian sales and excise taxes are an obvious example of the former category; the British and Continental value-added taxes belong to the latter.'</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) I have publicly stated that many commentators in asserting that the Australian sales tax is regressive overlook some significant features of the tax which offset the usually regressive impact of such taxes.</PARA>
<PARA> In the first place the rate structure is an important feature often overlooked. There are three rate classes, with rates of 7 1/2, 20 and 32 1/2 per cent. The 32 1/2 per cent class includes goods such as cameras, jewellery, television sets and record playing equipment. Items like household furniture and floor coverings , refrigerators, crockery and cutlery are only taxed at 7 1/2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Even more significant, food, rent and power, on which the major proportion of lower incomes are spent, are not taxed nor has the Government proposed they be taxed. The sales tax is accordingly structured to offset regressive effects.</PARA>
<PARA> Taxation incidence studies rely upon family or household expenditure surveys for their basic data. Findings from such studies need to be treated with caution because of shortcomings in the surveys themselves, the absence of up-to-date information-the last household survey in Australia was in 1975-76-and the need to make a number of broad assumptions (for example about the effect of the tax on consumption patterns) in deriving estimates of taxation incidence.</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to this important reservation, I am informed that a Treasury study, based on the 1975-76 ABS Household Expenditure Survey, found that a 2 1/2 per cent increase in tax on all goods subject to sales tax in the planned 1981-82 Budget would have had the following effects:</PARA>
<PARA> Average Weekly Household Income 1975-76</PARA>
<PARA>$0-80 $80-140 $140-200 $200-260 $260-340 $340</PARA>
<PARA>% % % % % % Proportion of gross income paid in tax  1.2 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.8 0.7</PARA>
<PARA> The apparent regressive effect at the lowest income level has to be heavily qualified because there are statistical problems with the lowest income group. 12.2 per cent of households in this group received income as a result of self- employment and many of those surveyed in 1975-76 had a significant, though temporary, reduction in income. Consumption for self-employed persons in this group was 3 times their income and probably reflects more closely income expectations or prior experience. If average income over a longer time period were taken into consideration these households would be placed in a higher income group. Mr Neil Warren of the University of NSW in fact stated in his study on incidence, the figures from which are often quoted by the Opposition, that 'it is therefore necessary to be guarded in the conclusions one reaches in respect of incidence estimates for the two lowest income groups'.</PARA>
<PARA> If the lowest income group were omitted it could be said that the changes to the sales tax arrangements proposed in the 1981-82 Budget would have had a roughly proportional effect on the bulk of taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA> In a comprehensive incidence study it is not only necessary to examine how the tax was raised but also where the revenue was spent. The Asprey Taxation Review Committee suggested that the method generally used to calculate incidence, including the one used to calculate the above figures, overstate the regressive effect at low incomes. Income in the Household Expenditure Survey includes transfer payments received from the Government sector (for example by way of pension). The Asprey Committee suggested, however, that taxation incidence should be calculated by tax payments less transfer payments as a proportion of original income. This method of presentation reveals a significant redistribution in favour of the lowest income groups.</PARA>
<PARA> A recent OECD study has also indicated that general consumption taxes in member countries (given the way they operate in those countries) are not regressive but tend to be more or less proportional.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 August 1982:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it a fact that Bankcard charges up to 5 1/2 per cent on every transaction purchase with Bankcard, and this charge is levied from the retail outlets and others who accept the card for purchases so that, if a cardholder buys something worth $100, the bank takes up to $5.50 and only pays the retailer $94.50.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is it also a fact that many bankcard holders pay off their debts within a month, or at the most 2 months, of buying the goods or services on their card so that the period of credit actually given to the cardholder in these cases is only 1 or perhaps 2 months.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) If so, is it a fact that (a) the bank can then advance the credit to someone else and again collect up to 5 1/2 per cent on the next transaction, (b) the same credit may be turned over up to 10 or 12 times in a year and the corresponding fees, of up to 5 1/2 per cent, charged every time or on every transaction, and (c) the true rate of return to Bankcard can therefore be as high as 66 per cent per annum on the $100 committed, that is $5.50 x 12 turnovers.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Will the Government (a) take action against the banks to prevent them making these disguised profits at will and (b) initiate a thorough investigation into Bankcard and other credit card systems, such as has been conducted in New Zealand recently, to assess the true profits made under these schemes and to evaluate the impact of the credit card revolution on our monetary system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am advised that Bankcard banks levy a merchant service fee on the sellers of goods and services where sales have been financed by Bankcard. The fee is a service charge designed to cover, inter alia, the administrative costs incurred by the Bankcard organisation in processing transactions and the administrative and other costs (including provision for bad debts) incurred by participating banks in relation to Bankcard. The size of the charge to individual merchants is a matter for each bank to determine in negotiation with its customers. However, I am advised that the charges commonly fall in the range of 1 1/2 per cent to 5 1/2 per cent of the merchant's total Bankcard turnover, depending on his monthly volume of Bankcard sales and the average value of his Bankcard transactions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am advised that it is not uncommon for Bankcard users to repay their outstanding balance within their period of charge free credit, which, depending on the juxtaposition of the date of purchase and the monthly billing date, may extend to nearly two months. However, many Bankcard users do not repay as promptly as this; the available data for amounts financed and advances outstanding under Bankcard (including cash advances) suggest that, on average, balances remain outstanding for around five months.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is possible for the set of transactions hypothesised in the question to occur under certain very restrictive assumptions about dates of purchase, dates of payment and details of the merchant Bankcard transactions. The resulting hypothetical fee income of $66 per annum for each $100 of revolving credit would represent revenue earned.</PARA>
<PARA> Profits to the Banks concerned would be substantially less than the revenue figures cited because, as noted in (1), the merchant service fee is a charge for services rendered and the cost of providing those services needs to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The authorities carefully examined the operations of the Bankcard scheme prior to its introduction in 1974. Also, in July 1980 the Trade Practices Commission completed a detailed study of the operation of the Bankcard scheme. As a result, a number of anti-competitive elements in the agreements between member banks in the scheme were amended, including to provide that each bank must take its own decision on charges it makes to merchants and cardholders and on the period of free credit it allows cardholders. Restrictive conditions on the participation to the Bankcard scheme were also removed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes, but the increase in sales tax on fruit wines resulted from general across-the-board increases in rates. In the 1981 and 1982 Budgets all sales tax rates were increased by 2.5 percentage points so that goods previously taxable at 15 percent became taxable at 17.5 percent as from 19 August 1981 and taxable at 20 percent as from 18 August 1982. As fermented fruit juices were amongst those goods affected by the general across-the-board increase in rates it was not practicable to consider their position in isolation from all other goods that were previously taxable at the same rate as fermented fruit juices.</PARA>
<PARA> These general increases in rates did not apply to exempt goods such as grape wine and apple cider produced in Australia. However, the rate of tax on imported grape wine and cider increased in line with locally produced fermented fruit juices.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In framing the 1978-79 Budget the Government gave consideration to a wide range of representations for tax relief or other form of assistance. It was not a question of the Government rejecting these representations including those of Mr Gianduzzo but whether in the context of the overall Budget it was possible to grant some form of tax relief and, if so, what form it was to take.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Commissioner of Taxation informs me that he is not aware of any lack of co-operation on the part of Mr Gianduzzo.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am not personally aware of Mr Gianduzzo's work situation but the point has been made to me in representations on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) I have explained the Government's position in my answer to question 2.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The goods referred to relate to decisions made by the Commissioner of Taxation under item 36 and are contained in the publication titled Sales Tax Exemptions and Classifications.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) (a) There is no discrimination in favour of the products listed in question 8 as against those produced by Mr Gianduzzo. With the exception of stout and cider, all of the alcoholic products ruled to be exempt are made principally of grape wine and references to apricot, banana, cherry pineapple indicate the kind of flavourings added. These products are not fruit wines of the kind produced by Mr Gianduzzo. Stout is exempt under item 36 (1), being a beer while cider is specifically exempted by item 36 (2). Wines produced from fruits other than the grape or from other products such as honey (mead) or rice (saki) are taxable.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) If fruit wines were to be exempted, the exemption would have to apply to both the imported and local product to avoid infringing the GATT. This could have repercussions in relation to the discrimination between local wines and overseas wines and also the existing sales tax discrimination between beer and cider of local and overseas origin. Those of Australian origin were exempted prior to Australia becoming a party to the GATT. The exemption of imported products would reduce the element of protection at present enjoyed by Australian beer, wine and cider because of their exemption.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Other factors that need to be taken into account by the Government include the overall incidence of taxation including excise duty, customs duty and income tax and the general economic position of the industry. Wine producers, for example, incurred substantial income tax liabilities as a result of a change in the valuation of wine stocks some years ago and are only now recovering from that change.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to pages 51 and 52 of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission's annual report for 1965-66 where it is stated that it had been necessary to reprocess several hundred aluminium fuel elements containing a total of one kilogram of uranium 233 used in physics experiments; that some of these elements had become swollen and defective and all were becoming difficult to handle because of the increasing radiation levels due to daughter products of the contained uranium 233; that, a small laboratory- scale recycle facility was built and operated to produce decontaminated uranium dioxide for refabrication into new fuel elements, and that reprocessing and reconversion had been completed with a loss of approximately 1 per cent of uranium 233.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The answer to Question No. 4469 referred specifically to spent fuel elements from the HIFAR reactor at Lucas Heights and has no bearing on this question.</PARA>
<PARA> The physics experiments referred to in the AAEC's Annual Report for 1965-66 were part of a program initiated in 1963-64 to obtain basic neutron data on the behaviour of various fuel moderator mixtures in high temperature gas cooled reactors. These experiments were also referred to in the AAEC's Annual Reports for 1963-64 (pages 34, 35) and 1964-65 (pages 38 and 40).</PARA>
<PARA> For the purpose of these experiments, one kg of U233, containing small amounts of U232 as an impurity, was obtained on lease from the USA and fabricated into fuel elements. Two sets of experiments were carried out, using the AAEC's MOATA reactor. In the first, sub-critical fuel assemblies (simulating conditions in a full, cold, reactor core) provided a means to check nuclear data and test methods of computing reactor core characteristics. In the second, samples representative of reactor core composition and sufficiently large to establish the reactor's nuclear properties were placed within MOATA to measure neutron reaction rates.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) See (2). Initially the one kg of U233 was fabricated into 205 fuel elements , each containing an average of 4.85 grams of U233.</PARA>
<PARA> Fission product activity in the U233 was negligible because all experiments were carried out at extremely low level fission rates. However, as the decay of U232 present in the U233 resulted in the growth of daughter products and increasing levels of gamma radiation, and also because during the experiments a small number of fuel elements had suffered damage, in 1966 all these fuel elements were processed to remove the radioactivity arising from the decay of U232 and the recovered uranium oxide was refabricated. 177 fuel elements were fabricated, averaging 5.05 grams of U233, as well as 20 half plates and 2 quarter plates. In 1967 the entire batch of elements was processed a second time in order to reduce the radioactivity arising from the growth of the decay products from U232, so that the material could be conveniently transported to the USA at the termination of the lease.</PARA>
<PARA> There has been no other reprocessing and reconversion of fuel elements at this or any other facility at Lucas Heights. The facility used for processing the U233 has been dismantled.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) Overall recovery of uranium present after dissolution was about 98 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) None of the U233 was stockpiled: it was returned to the lessor in 1967.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Solid waste containing 3.45g of U233 was obtained from treatment of processing solutions, and a further 3.34g of U233 are stored in solution. The solid waste has been placed in storage facilities at Lucas Heights. Contaminated solid materials such as gloves, tissues, equipment, aluminium powder and graphite containing 16.06g of U233 are also held in storage facilities at Lucas Heights, whilst contaminated materials containing a further 4.04g of U233 were disposed of in the Little Forest burial ground prior to its closure in 1968.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) There were 25,569 requests for reference to Boards of Review and 1,615 appeals to courts (representing less than 0.4 per cent of annual issues of assessment) on hand in the Australian Taxation Office as at 30 June 1982. Of those cases, 6,612 references and 602 appeals were deferred either at the taxpayer's request or pending the outcome of decisions in other cases or pending the outcome of enquiries or correspondence already in course. Of the remaining cases only a small proportion will need to be referred to the Boards of Review or the Courts. The vast majority will be resolved in discussions between the taxpayers concerned and the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The period which can elapse between the receipt by the Taxation Office of a request for reference to a Board of Review and the time when the matter is heard by the Board varies in each case due to a variety of factors. At present there are three Boards of Review. No. 1 Board is based in Sydney, No. 2 in Melbourne and No. 3 in Brisbane. Each Board also travels to other capitals and (as the need arises) to provincial cities and towns. Because of this it frequently happens that the delay in hearing cases in the less populous States is less than it is in the 'home' cities of the respective Boards. For these and other reasons it is extremely difficult to make an accurate forecast of the time it may take to have a case heard by a Board of Review. However, based on the historical annual output of the three Boards (and excluding deferred cases) it is estimated that as at 30 June 1982, No. 1 Board had approximately 18 months work on hand, No. 2 Board had about 28 months and No. 3 Board about 9 months.</PARA>

<PARA>General Aviation Study was publicly released by then Minister for Transport on 13 March 1981 on the basis that there was no Government commitment to its recommendations pending industry consideration of the report and consultation on its cost recovery recommendation through the Aviation Industry Advisory Council (AVIAC). On 16 July 1981, the Minister announced that the Government had decided not to take up the cost recovery recommendations of the Study. The non-cost recovery recommendations, other than those dealing with airport traffic priorities and noise abatement, were subsequently referred to AVIAC for consideration. Those matters are currently under review by the council.</PARA>

<PARA>On the basis of the basic thrust of the Holcroft recommendations, the Government substantially revised the air fare formula for TAA and Ansett on 1 April 1981. A study undertaken by Price Waterhouse Associates Pty was commissioned in July 1981 to further address some cost allocation issues not finalised by the Holcroft Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government subsequently established the Independent Air Fares Committee which is now solely responsible for the setting and determination of domestic airfares for all regular public transport passenger operators. The powers of the Minister to approve domestic air fares previously held under Air Navigation Regulation 106 were repealed upon commencement of the Independent Air Fares committee Act 1981.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (4) The Commonwealth Government has, for some time, recognised the need for combined Federal/State initiatives in the enforcement and prevention of crime.</PARA>
<PARA> On 28 April 1982, in answer to a question without notice on this subject, the Prime Minister stated that the Government was considering the possible establishment of a Crimes Commission to tackle the problems posed by organised crime (Hansard page 1927). The issue of a Crimes Commission has also been taken up with the States through the Premiers' Conference, the Australian Police Ministers' Council and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.</PARA>
<PARA> On 21 October 1982 the Acting Attorney-General introduced, into this House, a Bill to set up the National Crimes Commission. The Bill contains several mechanisms to facilitate joint investigations by the Commonwealth, States and Northern Territory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The report contains no convincing evidence that fluoridation of water increases mutagenicity and mortality from cancer. It recommends the suspension of a Bill dealing with compulsory fluoridation in Quebec until fluoridation has been subjected to further investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to mutagenicity, the extensive report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Fluoridation of Victorian Water Supplies (1980) summarises reports of studies in Britain in 1958 and 1962, and in the United States of America in 1974 and 1976, which show no association between water fluoridation and the incidence of congenital malformations. Details of a further investigation in England, which also shows no such association, were published in 'Community Medicine': 2. p.190, 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> The allegation of a link between fluoridation of water and cancer led to a number of investigations all of which show no association between fluoridation and cancer. These investigations were carried out in the United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Australia (New South Wales).</PARA>
<PARA> An investigation throughout Canada which was conducted by the Canadian Department of National Health and Welfare was completed in 1978. It was concluded that '. . . the maintenance of the fluoride level of potable water at approximately 1 mg/L is the most efficient procedure to decrease the incidence of dental caries, and such a level of fluoride poses no risk to the health of Canadians'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am informed that no cities in the United States of America deny access to their ports by United States Navy ships in the categories mentioned. However, some ports in the United States are not visited by conventional or nuclear- powered warships either because there is no operational requirement to do so or because of particular port characteristics such as channel depth, accessibility, port services, and so on. These requirements are assessed by national, not local authorities. The criteria employed by the United States authorities in deciding visits by United States Navy nuclear-powered ships to United States domestic ports are identical with those employed for visits to foreign ports.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am informed that no NATO country imposes a blanket ban on visits by nuclear-powered warships. Requests for port entry are handled bilaterally between the governments concerned on a case-by-case basis employing safety and environmental criteria corresponding to those introduced by Australia in 1976. Visits by nuclear-armed ships are permitted by most NATO countries. However, I understand that Denmark and Norway maintain policies of not permitting the stationing of nuclear weapons in their territory in peace time and look to other governments to respect their nuclear policies. The United States, Britain and France follow a policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons in particular ships.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (3) As the honourable member will be aware the Government introduced legislation earlier this year to assist home buyers who first occupied a home after 1 July 1977. The scheme provides a rebate on home loan interest payments in the first year of occupancy up to a limit of $700 where there is a dependent child or dependent student or $500 where there is no dependent child or dependent student, the rebate entitlement reducing by $100 per year over the succeeding four years.</PARA>
<PARA> Following on a further decision announced in the Budget, more recent legislation has extended the home loan interest rebate to others in respect of interest that exceeds 10 per cent per annum on up to $60,000 of a loan. The rebate under both schemes is at the standard rate of tax and applies to home interest payments after 1 July 1982. Where a taxpayer meets the criteria for a rebate under both schemes the scheme which confers the larger rebate will apply.</PARA>
<PARA> The full-year cost to income tax revenue of allowing deductions in respect of home loan interest payments is estimated as follows:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of income tax deductions allowable for expenditure incurred by a primary producer on soil conservation is governed by section 75D of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Section 75D authorises an immediate deduction for the cost which a farmer incurs in constructing surface or sub-surface drainage works for the purpose of controlling salinity or assisting in drainage control on farmland , except where the work consists of the drainage of a swamp or low-lying land.</PARA>
<PARA> Land forming or levelling in irrigation areas to improve drainage of irrigation water, whether or not such work is carried out using laser equipment, is generally regarded as being for the purpose of controlling or combating salinity in the land or a potential salinity problem and, therefore, eligible for immediate deduction under section 75D.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (3) The Department of Primary Industry has made enquiries into reports of some reduction in the area of vegetables contracted for processing purposes in Tasmania. The Department is satisfied that there is no link between the changes in the area contracted for vegetables in Tasmania and the arrangements for closer economic relations between Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> Most vegetable products of importance for Tasmania are already free of duty or subject only to the minimal tariffs if imported from New Zealand. In these circumstances the agreement achieved with New Zealand for an accelerated removal of its export subsidy arrangements for peas, beans, sweet corn and potato products and for a phasing out of export subsidies on all other products from 1985 to 1987, should result in an improvement in the relative competitiveness of Tasmania's vegetable growing and processing industries vis-a-vis New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am advised that the only affiliation between Australian and New Zealand vegetable processors is the operation of a single frozen vegetable processing plant by Petersville Australia Limited in New Zealand through its international branch, Petersville International Limited.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is currently investigating some of the matters raised in the paper, and will provide comments directly to the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. I am informed that the ABS conducted an Australia-wide evaluation survey soon after the 1981 Census for the purpose of measuring under-enumeration in the Census. An analysis of the data from this survey is understood to have shown that, overall, there is no significant difference in census under- enumeration between Australian-born and overseas-born persons.</PARA>
<PARA> I am also informed that special efforts were made in the 1981 Census-in the Fairfield City Council area as well as other areas with large numbers of migrants-to produce an accurate enumeration of persons born overseas. These efforts are considered to have been successful as the results of the evaluation survey show that only a very small percentage of persons was missed in the Census.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As far as the Commonwealth's local government tax sharing funds are concerned, the allocation between local authorities within a State is related, among other things, to the population of each authority. Since estimates of the population in the Fairfield City Council area would need to be compared with estimates of the population derived on the same basis in other local government jurisdictions in New South Wales, it is not possible to comment on the substance of the claim concerning $135,000 foregone by the Fairfield City Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Under the local government tax sharing arrangemens, the Commonwealth provides funds to each State government on the basis of a set formula. Each State is then responsible for the allocation of the funds between the local authorities within its borders. The question of any additional payments to individual local authorities is therefore a matter for consideration by the State government concerned.</PARA>
