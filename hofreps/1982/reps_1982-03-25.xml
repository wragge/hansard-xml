What is the Bureau's official policy concerning prior notification being given to enterprises which are to be visited by Bureau inspectors? Can he assure this House that such a policy is in line with the conventions of the International Labour Organisation in this area?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to the fact that small businesses-50 per cent of them are farmers-are being asked by bankers to use bank backed money bills to raise carry-on finance and the fact that the 90-day bill is selling for 20 per cent and the bank brokerage fee is now 4 1/2 per cent, making the effective interest rate 24 1/2 per cent. As the Treasurer did not seem to agree with my calling during the adjournment debate last night for complete deregulation, statutory reserve deposit releases to term and farm development or the lowering of the Reserve Bank of Australia limit of $500,000 for imported capital, I ask: Will the Treasurer consider lifting the Government' s money supply, now at 11 per cent, to help ease pressure on interest rates, as these extraordinary high rates are fueling inflation and making it difficult for small businesses to carry on?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I thought that the prescription urged by my honourable friend from Maranoa would, in fact, lead to a fall in interest rates other than in the very short term I might be attracted to what he is putting. Unfortunately, it is quite wrong to believe that easing monetary policies will lead, in other than the very short term, to reduction in interest rates. I gently point out to the honourable gentleman that the effective interest rate that he was talking about could be affected somewhat by the availability of tax deductibility of certain business expenses. I think that ought to be borne in mind in some of the statistics that he used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The circumstances of present high interest rates have been explained on a number of occasions. They cannot be isolated from the present high level of interest rates around the world. The idea that Australia can live in sublime isolation from international economic forces is quite wrong. If the prescription urged by the honourable gentleman were, in fact, adopted there might for a very short period be some easing of interest rate pressure, but in the medium to longer term it would underwrite higher inflation and therefore return, in my judgment and the judgment of the Government, still higher interest rates which surely is not the objective the honourable gentleman seeks.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Qantas is operating to Mauritius and it is hoped that it will extend such operation to routes in southern Africa and further on. I know that Qantas has been examining the matter. The Government was concerned that Qantas should not re-establish its direct link with South Africa. I think the reasons for that are well known. We do not wish to, and do not, encourage trade with South Africa. Although there is no prohibition of it, there is no active promotion of trade with South Africa. We believe that maximum pressure should be exerted against South Africa, to seek to break down the system of apartheid. I think we all know that there is a degree of racial intolerance amongst all countries, but most countries around the world, by law, practice or custom, seek to diminish and eradicate racial intolerance. That is certainly the approach of the States and the Commonwealth of Australia. It is certainly the approach of the overwhelming majority of Australian citizens of all political complexions. The difference in South Africa is simply that racial intolerance, bigotry and discrimination are enshrined in the law in a multitude of ways. People cannot move without a police pass. People of the wrong colour cannot live in certain areas. People of the wrong colour might be allowed to get a job in an area, but their wives and families have to stay 300 miles behind, in the hills. The honourable gentleman may know people who work in South Africa. An engineer, the son of some people with whom I am on friendly terms, does in fact work in South Africa, and the letters that are sent back describe, whether it be on the playing field or whatever, kinds of discrimination which Australians would certainly find abhorrent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir Robert Menzies indicated in earlier discussions, going back I suppose 20 or 30 years, that he believed that the whole system of apartheid was abhorrent and doomed to the most ghastly failure because, in all its simplicity, the South Africans were saying that they would give black Africans educational and economic equality but never, of course, political equality. Therein is the certainty that apartheid must one day fail, because the more people have educational or economic equality, the less will they be prepared to accept or tolerate political inequality. Whatever view one might have of the immorality of apartheid, logically, and on a straight analysis of what apartheid is about, it is doomed to failure. Therefore, successive Australian governments over time have sought, with many other nations, to exert pressure in relation to South Africa so that there may be a modification and change of policy; so that something that is abhorrent to the very nature of people and of human relationships can be modified and changed by evolution rather than by much rougher and more difficult means if there should be no change on the part of the South African Government. It is based on our attitude to the South African regime, to its nature, to the fact that apartheid and discrimination are enshrined in law, that we take certain actions that we otherwise would not. As I have said on a number of occasions, it is not South Africa that is a bulwark against communism in Southern Africa. Rather, it presents an invitation to communism because the nature of the system that it has established invites communism to overthrow something that is repugnant to the whole human race.</PARA>

If this is the case, and in the past the Minister has acknowledged that it is, will he undertake in his review of defence expenditure to exempt the development and utilisation of defence facilities in Western Australia from current and forthcoming defence expenditure restraints? Further, noting the announced savings in planned expenditure for defence capital infrastructure in the area of site acquisition and buildings of more than $2m, will his Department purchase forthwith a site in north-west Western Australia for a patrol boat base previously appearing in Budget Estimates as anticipated to cost $250,000?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that for some time Mr Mugabe has been advocating a one- party state as the most appropriate form of government for Zimbabwe. Mr Mugabe is also on record as saying that that objective would not be imposed either hastily or illegally. He has said that he wants that discussed as widely as possible. In that connection I note that recently the Minister for Legal and Parliamentary Affairs in Zimbabwe told the Press that the Zimbabwean Government intends to re-examine the Constitution. But he also reaffirmed Mr Mugabe's assurance that any changes would be made constitutionally and in consultation with the white members of parliament. I am aware of concern that has been expressed in Australia about the possible dangers to democracy in Zimbabwe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Relations between our countries are close. I think it is true to say that Zimbabweans have a high regard for Australia particularly bearing in mind the role played by Australia, and particularly the Prime Minister, in achieving their independence and because of the assistance we have given them since independence. Many Australian teachers are working there. So all in all Australians are interested in what is happening in that country. I am sure that I am speaking for all of us when I say that we hope the democratic processes through which independence was achieved will continue there. Through our High Commission in Salisbury we have made known at a high level to the Zimbabwean Government the concern being felt in Australia over the question of adhering to due constitutional processes in that country. Australia and indeed all friends of Zimbabwe who wish Zimbabwe well look to a continuation of the policies of reconciliation, which have distinguished that country since independence.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for the Northern Territory would be aware, the Government has completed its consideration of the report into coastal surveillance. There has been an ongoing review of the coastal surveillance program for some considerable time. Indeed, since the Government took a decision on the recommendations of that report numerous discussions have been carried out between the State Ministers and officers associated with the problem of surveillance in the various States and officers of my Department. There has been a generally favourable reaction to the decision that the Government has taken. The Government has decided to strengthen the administrative and managerial procedures to increase the efficiency of the upgraded arrangements which were originally introduced in 1978.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The existing tenders expire between September of this year and March next year. New tender documents are being drawn up. Fresh tenders will be called as the existing tenders expire. We will continue to use the resources of the Department of Defence and civil tendering arrangements which are undoubtedly the most economic way to provide a valuable coastal surveillance service for this country . The results so far have been favourable and with the new arrangements that will apply we believe that the operations of coastal surveillance will improve even further. With the economies of scale that will be available as a result of these arrangements I feel sure that we will maximise the benefits of the existing resources available from the Department of Defence and the private sector to the advantage of the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports that the Tasmanian Government proposes to spend $1m, I think, on an artificial job creation scheme. It can be described only as a waste of taxpayers' money for the simple reason that schemes of that sort, both in Australia and overseas, have been proved to be quite unsuccessful in reducing unemployment. Indeed, the former Labor Federal Government had such a scheme which was called the Regional Employment Development scheme. While that scheme was in operation employment in this country fell. It was one of the very rare times in the history of this country that employment fell. Not only did employment fall during that period but also unemployment doubled. It is not very surprising that the Labor Government abolished the very scheme that it introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there is a lot that a Government can do. The Tasmanian Government was given the opportunity to contribute financially to a very valuable work preparation centre and skills training centre for young unemployed people in Hobart. It is conducted by the Centacare agency at Mount St Canice. The Tasmanian Government, and in particular the responsible Minister, Mr Aulich, have, I regret to say, on frequent occasions rejected all invitations to contribute to that very worthwhile scheme. They have shown a completely callous attitude towards young unemployed people in that State. Not only is it a callous attitude to take; it is extremely hypocritical to come along in the twilight hours in the life of the Tasmanian Government and now say, not having contributed when they could have to a worthwhile scheme that exists already, that they will waste $1m on a fanciful, phoney job creation scheme which is doomed to failure.</PARA>

Is the short term rate of interest determined essentially by the current level of liquidity and the demand for liquidity? If the short term rate of interest is to be held down, is it necessary for the money supply to grow at a rate which will be sufficient to accommodate the current rate of inflation together with current growth? Is the money supply at the present time growing at a rate of 10.6 per cent which is about 3 per cent less than the combined inflation rate plus growth rate?

I assure him that I did not imply anything in my answer to the honourable member for Maranoa; I stated what I have always believed to be the case, that is, that the long term level of interest rates is influenced by the level of inflation. Anybody who believes that we can bring down interest rates without adopting policies that affect inflation is not being realistic. The Government remains very much of the view that controlling the rate of growth of the money supply is a major weapon in controlling inflation. It believes that, if in the interest of buying short term relief for interest rates we let go the money supply, we merely underwrite in the longer term higher inflation and thus, in the longer term, much higher interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1399" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some time ago the Minister for Administrative Services had discussions with the royal commissioner. As I understand it, the view of the royal commissioner was that the present terms of reference are wide enough to cover those matters. It is worth noting that in the terms of reference there is mention of a Terence John Clark and persons associated with him, and further on the use made by Terence John Clark and persons associated with him of banking, financial and other institutions in connection with those activities. When the Acting Prime Minister, in conjunction with the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland-this is a joint Royal Commission-made the announcement about the establishment of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking , he said also that it was envisaged that the judicial inquiry may be given supplementary terms of reference referring to the activities of other drug trafficking groups should the need arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there is any necessity for that, or if a royal commissioner felt in any sense that there was a need to widen the terms of reference, the Commonwealth would certainly accede to that request. I would be very surprised if the States likewise were not prepared to accede to such a request. But as I understand it, there has not been a request from the royal commissioner or from any of the States at this point to widen the terms of reference because the parties believe that the present terms of reference are wide enough to cover the totality of matters which I believe all members of this House would want to have covered. It is worth noting again that the Commonwealth initiated the Stewart Royal Commission. It is worth noting also that the joint New South Wales-Federal police task force was initiated by the Williams and Woodward royal commissions. Flowing out of these royal commissions the police task force was established. It was at the Commonwealth's initiative, through an approach to Mr Wran, that the terms of reference of that task force were in fact widened. Again, if there were any matters that we felt needed examination, that were not within the terms of reference, they could be widened so long as the New South Wales Government was prepared to agree.</PARA>
<PARA> If there are any honourable members who believe they have information which would assist the vastly important work of the Royal Commission or of the task force, it would obviously be helpful to make that information available to one or the other. I think it is worth noting also that, consistent with what I have said, if the Leader of the Opposition believed the Royal Commission terms of reference were not adequate to examine the matters which he has been seeking to raise during Question Time in this House, I would be prepared to have him discuss those matters with the Attorney-General to see whether the terms of reference should be widened to cover those matters. If there was a need to have them widened to cover those matters, I am sure we could secure the agreement of other parties to have them so widened.</PARA>
<PARA> It is still the Commonwealth's view, on the advice available to us, that the terms of reference are wide enough. But if on some of the matters which are apparently available to the Leader of the Opposition he feels otherwise, I make the offer to him: He can discuss the matter with the Attorney-General, or with the other law officer, the Solicitor-General, and if out of that discussion there is evidence that the terms of reference are not wide enough, I will put it to my colleagues and to the other parties concerned to secure a widening of the terms of reference.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the answer that the Prime Minister has just given and in relation to answers that he has given on this subject in the Parliament more recently, I would suggest to him that I would prefer to deal not with the chimneysweep but with the Prime Minister. Therefore, I ask: Is it a fact that the royal commission is not competent to investigate Nugan Hand except insofar as it might be connected to the activities of Terence John Clark? Is it also a fact, as Mr Justice Woodward complained at page 1654 of his report, that the task force has grave limitations on its capacity to investigate drug trafficking in general, let alone the activities that have been raised in this House about Nugan Hand? In view of these facts I ask the Prime Minister, and not one of his subsidiary officers: Will he set up a royal commission which will have effective power and authority to investigate the association of Nugan Hand with gun running and foreign intelligence agencies, as well as narcotics and organised crime?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Woodward Royal Commision was a New South Wales royal commission and the Commonwealth has taken many actions as a result of that royal commission. I would be interested to know what actions the New South Wales Government has taken as a result of that royal commission. But I make the point again that in the reference of the Stewart Royal Commission, which has been established in co-operation with a number of States, the advice available to us is that the Royal Commission can examine any matters that are relevant, including the matters that were raised by the Leader of the Opposition. I made the offer that the Leader of the Opposition may like to discuss the terms of reference with the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General. He was somewhat unnecessarily disparaging of them, but I made that offer for specific reasons. They are the legal officers of the Commonwealth, the first and second legal advisers of the Commonwealth, and therefore they would be able to offer fully professional advice as to whether the terms of the Royal Commission cover the matters which the Leader of the Opposition would want examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think all members of the House would want these matters examined. I believe the debates have in part been semantic ones because the Leader of the Opposition persists in taking the view that the royal commission established by a number of governments and the task force established by two governments are inadequate for this purpose. It would seem to us totally unnecessary to establish a separate royal commission to cover ground that is already being covered by the Stewart Royal Commission, especially so since we are advised that the terms of reference are adequate.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat the offer: If the Leader of the Opposition, if he likes in conjunction with whatever legal advisers he has within his party, wishes to discuss the matter with the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General, they can come to a view on legal grounds and not on grounds of political debate in this chamber as to whether terms of reference are adequate to cover all the matters in relation to Nugan Hand. We believe they are wide enough. Our advice is that they are wide enough. We have said and others have said that if there is a need to widen the terms of reference of the Royal Commission to cover related and drug-running groups and all the rest, well then that will happen. Nothing could be plainer than that. I believe the offer to the Leader of the Opposition is a perfectly fair and appropriate one, and if he would co-operate in it we could lay at rest for all time the disputatious argument as to whether these matters are fully examined or not.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1979 sugar agreement was the first agreement to carry a provision for an objective mechanism to review the domestic sugar price ex refinery. It is a fact that the formula carries within it a capacity to allow for the rising cost of inputs. It is also a fact that the industry has been to me to tell me that it believes the formula does not correctly provide for the increasing prices of fertiliser and fuels and that, therefore, it believes the domestic price of sugar is too low. It is interesting to note that when we were negotiating the formula the Bureau of Agricultural Economics put up a different formula-one similar to the wheat agreement-that would have in fact allowed for a higher domestic price in July of this year when the next rise is to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is anticipated that, because of increasing costs, there might be an increase in the domestic price of sugar to about $425 or $435 a tonne. Under the BAE formula it would have been approximately $490 a tonne. The sugar industry has been to me complaining about the formula which it negotiated with the Commonwealth and State governments in 1979. I have said to the industry that I am, of course, prepared to look at it mid-term, but I think it would require one to see the whole life of the agreement, as most of these formulas do, before one could make an objective assessment as to whether industry circumstances require change mid-term. Therefore, it is difficult to open the formula half way through the life of the agreement. I am, of course, prepared to listen to further argument.</PARA>

The honourable gentleman's Hunter Valley area, the North Coast area and some of the areas to the west of Sydney are amongst those sectors of the New South Wales community affected. I am told that the capital works program of Telecom is currently running about one per cent below profile. This has been caused by some delay in materials supply from contractors . Telecom has asked those contractors to see whether they can improve their delivery during the balance of 1981-82 in order to correct that shortfall.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, Telecom has decided that because of the particular problems in some regional areas of New South Wales, of the $20m of additional funds that I spoke of a little while ago in the House being provided for the capital works program of Telecom by a rediversion of funds within its own funds supply, Telecom intends to allocate another $7.7m and to transfer some staff to accelerate capital works and program development in those regions. I am told that there is also to be a transfer of some 51 line servicemen from Victoria and some 67 linesmen from other areas. In addition, the staff of the Hunter Valley has been boosted recently by 34 employees.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I welcome the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) this morning that a submission from me in support of the extension of the terms of reference of the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking, which is also investigating Terence John Clark and matters associated with his activities, will be accepted. Having made the submission and, I believe, making a very strong series of points in support of the extension of the terms of reference of the inquiry so that effectively it becomes a full inquiry into the Nugan Hand organisations and into allegations of a vast range referring to that matter, I presume that those recommendations will be accepted and the terms of reference expanded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make the point that the terms of reference for the Stewart Royal Commission as they now stand are, in the considered view of myself and my advisers, inadequate to attend to the matters which have been raised in connection with the Nugan Hand organisation. The Stewart Royal Commission, according to the terms of reference which it has been given, is literally restricted to investigating matters associated with Terence John Clark and his connection with illicit drugs. It may well prove that the Nugan Hand organisation does have some association with Terence John Clark or with his past activities. However, the Nugan Hand activities go well beyond Terence John Clark. As I mentioned in my question this morning, there are matters apart from narcotics and organised crime which relate to allegations about gun running, about the laundering of money which it appears has been earned illegally and the bank's association with foreign intelligence agencies. Any terms of reference which fall short of allowing a royal commission of inquiry to investigate all of those matters-the vast range of very disturbing allegations about Nugan Hand-would be unsatisfactory to me. That is the first point I want to make. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the second matter which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has constantly referred to-the joint task force of Commonwealth and New South Wales police into Nugan Hand-I find again the Prime Minister's attempts at reassurance unsatisfactory. The joint task force is restricted to investigating Nugan Hand in relation very largely to drug matters. In his statement in the Parliament a little over a week ago the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) said that the terms of reference would be extended to enable the joint task force to investigate breaches by Nugan Hand of Commonwealth laws as well as all State laws. However, it is not so important what the Minister says in this Parliament as what are declared to be the terms of reference and the Prime Minister has clearly declared what they are. In his letter to the New South Wales Premier he says:</PARA>
<PARA> I therefore propose that we widen the terms of reference of the Commonwealth- New South Wales Police Task Force on Drug Trafficking to enable it to investigate matters raised in recommendation 5 and other related matters and report to us. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5, of course, refers to the Woodward Commission report. It states :</PARA>
<PARA> The evidence concerning Harry Wainwright, Nugan Hand Ltd and its associated companies and the affairs of Murray Stewart Riley and in particular his associates as revealed in evidence be referred to appropriate law enforcement bodies for further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have in the body of this report referred to the circumstances under which Wainwright obtained citizenship of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the document, in announcing that an interim report of the joint task force had been received, went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently the Prime Minister and Premier of New South Wales agreed to the widening of the terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Except that the force should not become involved in the investigation of the immigration aspects of Wainwright's activities nor in the financial aspects of the Corporate Affairs Commission investigation of Nugan Hand unless the finances related to illegal drug activity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The document is headed: 'If it is decided that the report should not be released to the Press the following Press release might be made'. As I understand it, it was released by the Prime Minister. So what it is effectively saying is that matters related to Wainwright, one of the key persons of concern to the Woodward report in respect of recommendation 5, are to be excluded from investigation. Financial matters are not to be investigated unless they are related to illegal drug activity. True, the Corporate Affairs Commission is looking at some aspect of this matter. But this does seem to be a very messy business. There are at least three agencies or instrumentalities of government which are operating in this area in discrete fashions. There is the Stewart Royal Commission which to an extent has overlapped into Nugan Hand but does not cover all of Nugan Hand; there is the joint police force which is clearly restricted in this matter; and there is the Corporate Affairs Commission which is carrying out investigation on financial matters quite discretely unless they are associated with drug running by Nugan Hand, in which case the task force can be drawn into the matter. There should be co-operation. That, Mr Speaker, is a very messy and totally unsatisfactory approach. The question is, of course: Is the Prime Minister correct in his confident assertions in this Parlimament that the task force is an appropriately structured body to investigate the vast range of allegations about Nugan Hand; that is, does he have that authority? I in no way reflect upon the competence of the people in the task force. I am sure they have been selected because they excel in their field. I am talking about their authority. If we look at the Woodward Royal Commission report we find these sorts of comments by Justice Woodward recorded at page 1646:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The task force does not have the powers that were vested in Mr Justice Woodward. He makes that point again at page 1654 of the report. I ask honourable members to bear with me as it is a somewhat longer declaration. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> Without the powers of a Royal Commissioner to secure the attendance of witnesses for questioning and the production of documents, the task force is still capable of doing valuable work. However, it must be conventional work and can be directed against only lower level drug traffickers. It cannot be expected , without considerable luck,-</PARA>
<PARA>For gosh sake, we want more than luck with this sort of inquiry-</PARA>
<PARA>to be successful against the high level traffickers. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Woodward goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Task Force would be more effective if it has powers similar to those possessed by its American counterpart and the ability to call upon some authority, probably a Supreme Court Judge, to exercise powers similar to those granted to a Royal Commissioner under the Royal Commissions Act, 1923. </PARA>
<PARA>There you have it, Mr Speaker, without my extracting any more declarations from the findings of Justice Woodward. The task force, no matter how competent its officers are, no matter how skilled and no matter what the success rate is that may backup their selection to carry out this investigation, is hamstrung by very limited terms of reference. So, in all the circumstances-that is, the clear evidence that the Stewart Royal Commission is restricted to inquiring into matters related to Terence John Clark and associated matters which perchance may meander into the area of Nugan Hand but not cover all of the area of Nugan Hand and declarations by Mr Justice Woodward of the deficiencies of the joint task force-we on this side of the House are quite justified in demanding that there should be a full royal commission of inquiry into Nugan Hand, its operations, its structure, allegations about it-all of those sorts of associated matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we justified in our concern about the way in which this matter has progressed in more general terms? I remind honourable members that this matter became an issue of contention in this Parliament on Thursday, 11 March, after the televising of a program on Channel 9, Sydney. That program followed a series of disclosures on this matter which had been regularly published in the major weekend newspaper, the National Times. That Channel 9 news interview on the morning of the day that I declared involved a man named Volkman, a former Narcotics Bureau agent. He asserted that he and three of his colleagues had been subjected to victimisation and vilification and that they believed it was because they had been gathering information on the Nugan Hand organisation. He said he had reached the point where he could take no more and he resigned. There are public declarations by other people in the Bureau of Customs-I presume from the manner in which this has been reported that it was the Bureau of Customs-and by people formerly serving in the former Narcotics Bureau, which appear to bolster the claims of Volkman. The nub of Volkman's allegations which disturbs this House is:</PARA>
<PARA> So far as the investigation is concerned, my information is that a Minister of the Crown, a Federal Minister of the Crown, directed that no action of any overt nature take place in respect of the Nugan Hand organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>Through the extraordinarily clumsy behaviour of the Government in handling this matter it has developed to the point where the Government, at least tacitly, has agreed that it will have to consider seriously the Opposition's proposals. Those proposals simply are that there should be a full royal commission of inquiry into these allegations. If it is to be the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry with expanded terms of reference, as a face saver, I quibble not at all. I am pleased. But the result that very properly should be achieved appears to be in the process of being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that they were serious allegations. Is there any evidence to substantiate them? The documents I tabled a few minutes ago are being processed with other important pieces of paper in the Parliament; the Government requires copies. I will rely on my memory for dates; they can be corrected later. It is my recollection that in about March 1978 a Mr Bates of the Narcotics Bureau put together a memorandum the effect of which was to put investigations into the activities of Nugan Hand on to the back burner, as it were. It was claimed in this Parliament by the Minister for Administrative Services that that was a misinterpretation of what Mr Bates was saying; that what Mr Bates was really saying was that the investigations would go from overt to covert in their nature . However, another document which I tabled today and which I have referred to before, declares in a footnote appended to a report by a narcotics investigator that certain information about the behaviour of Nugan Hand in its illicit narcotics operation is being provided from a reliable source and that if the investigation into Nugan Hand is ever resurrected this source can be tapped effectively. Those two things in juxtaposition seem to bowl over middle stump the claim of the Minister for Administrative Services that the operation had moved from overt to covert. </PARA>
<PARA> If we reflect for a minute, the claim was nonsense anyway because almost exclusively the operations of the Narcotics Bureau will be covert by their nature. There would be very little that it could do overtly; the operations would have to be covert by their nature. Largely, the overt activity would be at the time of arrest and processing through courts. If we reflect for a minute, it was a nonsensical claim by the Minister. However, I go back to the report of Mr Justice Woodward. It is a curious set of circumstances that those documents exist. They seem to give some foundation-at least I say some; I suspect more-to the claims of Volkman that impediments were put in the way of the proper processes of investigation and enforcement of the law in relation to Nugan Hand. In the Woodward report we find page after page of condemnation of Federal Government authorities for their obstructionism in the processes of his Royal Commission. On pages 1649 and 1650 Mr Justice Woodward stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Before proceeding overseas, lack of co-operation and, indeed, refusal to co- operate on the part of the Federal Government and its Departments provided an obstacle to me in the course of my investigations and was very much in the front of my mind when I left Australia on 1st September, 1978. </PARA>
<PARA>In another volume he states at page 19:</PARA>
<PARA> In general, I did not receive co-operation from the Federal Government and its authorities, the Customs Bureau and the Federal Narcotics Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA>I apologise for a more lengthly quote but, for the sake of substance in the record, I have to resort to it. At page 20 he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At the time I was deeply involved in investigating heroin trafficking in this State. Few better ways of avoiding giving assistance to an investigating Royal Commission than that offered could be devised. Nevertheless, attempts were made to obtain assistance by writing letters to the nominated Commonwealth Solicitor and framing questions, in writing, about persons and activities then under investigation. Some of these questions were briefly answered. Many were not answered. At no time was full information ever supplied as sought. Despite many requests, I was never shown a single file or did I interview a single Commonwealth officer. </PARA>
<PARA>He did not see one single Commonwealth officer or one single file, he says in this report, when he was investigating heroin trafficking in New South Wales. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> No effective information was ever received from the Narcotics Bureau and this gravely hampered and restricted this Commission's inquiries into heroin trafficking. But I did receive first hand experience of the unfortunate effects of a total failure of inter-agency co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: the unfortunate effects of a total failure of inter-agency co- operation'. That is to say, on the face of the evidence provided, there was clear, continuing and quite conscious obstructionism on the part of Federal Government instrumentalities concerning the investigations by the Woodward Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, one feels justifiable reason for having qualms about the determination, zeal and energy that the Government will employ in this matter. There is nothing but fiction behind the succession of propositions by the Government that the Stewart Royal Commission has authority to investigate Nugan Hand and associated matters. It is a crude, attemptedly deceptive, playing with words that gives the Government no credit for candour. It knows full well that the full range of allegations relating to Nugan Hand cannot be investigated by the Stewart Royal Commission, as it now stands. That Commission cannot look at allegations of gun running. It cannot look at allegations concerning the alleged involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency or such matters, which are just as crucial and deserving of investigation as are the allegations of drug running and association with organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA> The best that the Minister for Administrative Services could say in this House on 18 March, when the pressure was building up was:</PARA>
<PARA> In last Tuesday's debate . . . I said I believed that the evidence concerning Nugan Hand could be referred to the Royal Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Royal Commissioner Stewart. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> After discussion with the Attorney-General I sent to the Royal Commissioner, first of all, on behalf of the Prime Minister, a copy of the first report of the joint task force. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say the following, which I believe is significant:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I believe that, on behalf of everybody who is concerned, this will test the ability of the Royal Commissioner to deal with these matters. Obviously the Royal Commissioner will tell us whether his terms of reference encompass these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a curious statement by a Minister who says that he has discussed the matter with the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), who in turn would have taken the advice of the Solicitor-General. He went on to say that he was putting it in as a matter of pot luck, as a fishing expedition. He was not sure whether the Royal Commission could look at it. That would be determined by the Royal Commissioner. Of course it cannot and, of course, the terms of reference have to be expanded. So, on the available evidence of public record, as the terms of reference of the Stewart Royal Commission stand, they are restricted to the investigation of Terrence John Clark and matters related to his activities involving illicit narcotics transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> The joint New South Wales-Commonwealth task force, which is composed of the Federal and New South Wales police forces, suffers from clear deficiencies and limitations concerning the ambit of its operations. That has been declared, beyond any dispute by Mr Justice Woodward. There is, quite apparently, a long, continuing practice on the part of the Federal Government of being obstructionist in regard to these investigations. On the face of the evidence that is available, one would trust that that would stop. There is prima facie, on the basis of the documentation available, in association with that sort of evidence in the Woodward report, clear ground for concern that, in spite of information being available to the Government for more than five years about the nature of the Nugan Hand activities, in 1978 Nugan Hand was put on to the back burner and, it would appear, eventually into deep freeze. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of these circumstances, a full investigation must be made of Nugan Hand, of people associated with it, and of the allegations concerning Nugan Hand and those people. That can be done only by a royal comission which has adequate terms of reference. It is extraordinary that the matter has taken more than a week to reach today the point at which the Government is now conceding that it will consider expanded terms of reference. Incredibly, yesterday I was prevented from tabling documents relating to this matter. I say 'incredible' because I had been taunted by the Government over the preceding several days of sitting to present them. I felt some caution in so doing because names of informants were included. I deleted the names of the informants and, because I have had a chance to think about the matter overnight, have increased the number of documents that I have tabled today. There are several from the more than 23 documents, notes and other bits of paper that I have relating to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter I want to mention is: With a properly set up royal commission of inquiry into this matter, with adequate terms of reference, which satisfies me that there will be no more of this fudging on the part of the Federal Government, I will supply the documentation which I have. I am asked also to identify to the Royal Commission the source or sources of my information. If that is to be done I would want to see certain very clear and convincing safeguards established for my informant or informants should his or their identities be disclosed to the Royal Commission. I do that for this reason. It will be remembered in a debate early last week on a related matter that I pointed out that this gentleman Volkman, who made the serious allegations which set this issue off, declared that after he appeared before the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs in this country and gave evidence in camera-in which he identified people within the Narcotics Bureau, as I understand the matter, whose behaviour was improper-a search warrant was subsequently executed on his premises. The consequence of the execution of that search warrant was that the transcript of the evidence which he gave to that Royal Commission, in which he named officers with whom he had served, was seized. Subsequent to that he was subjected to threats and intimidation. He later appeared in the Magistrates Court on a charge of smuggling birds. The charge was not proceeded with or whatever, but certainly he was not indicted. No conviction was recorded against him. Some nine months later an ex-officio indictment was executed by the Attorney-General against this man in spite of the fact that the case was not proceeded with in the lower court. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances-the seizure of the transcript and the threats extended to him-he believes rightly or wrongly that he has been persecuted through the courts by the Government. We must have quite clear and quite convincing iron- clad guarantees about the protection of people who might come forward or who might be identified as sources of information for the Royal Commission. I am pleased that we at least appear to be having some success in this matter and that the dawn of common sense apparently is beginning to rise with the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The offer I made to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) was very specific and clear. It was to discuss with the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) whether the terms of reference of the Royal Commission and/or the task force will be adequate for the widest possible examination of all matters related to the Nugan Hand organisation and any other matters relating to these problems. In the light of what the Leader of the Opposition has said I would like to repeat that on the advice available to the Government the terms of the Royal Commission are in fact wide enough to achieve that very result. If it can be demonstrated to law officers with some competence in this field that the terms of reference are not wide enough, then they will be widened. They are certainly not construed in the narrow sense as the Leader of the Opposition persists in doing in this House. Nevertheless, the matter will be one that will be decided by proper legal interpretation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate that the Government has not been slow or reluctant in any sense to come forward in these matters because much of what has happened has happened as a result of Commonwealth initiatives. That relates to the widening of the terms of reference of the task force and it also relates very much to the establishment of the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. When the Leader of the Opposition quoted from page 1654 of the report of the Woodward Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking I do not recollect that he quoted the last sentence from that page, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> However, a decision on whether the Task Force should have these powers must await assessment of its future performance. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting that the Royal Commission was established subsequent to that date. Quite clearly the Royal Commission and the task force are working very closely together. Whilst they are two bodies they are in fact pursuing the one broad objective. It was the deliberate decision of governments that it was best to proceed in this way with the task force operating between the police force of New South Wales and the Commonwealth and then to have the Royal Commission embracing of all four governments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not adequate to suggest that Mr Justice Woodward indicated that the capacities of the task force were inadequate because that is only part of the story. The task force is proceeding. Mr Justice Woodward did say that the decision on whether its powers were sufficient would have to wait for an assessment of its work. In any case a royal commission has been established and there can be only one matter that needs resolution. I am happy to rest on the judgment of the law officers of the Commonwealth as to whether the terms of reference of that Royal Commission are in fact adequate to cover all matters related to it. On the advice available to us the terms of reference are adequate . If they need extension, as was indicated in the original announcement of the Royal Commission, then they will be extended. </PARA>
<PARA> It would have been much easier to make final judgments in relation to these matters if the Leader of the Opposition had co-operated, as every citizen of this Commonwealth would have been expected to co-operate with a royal commission or with a police task force, and has made his information available so that proper judgment could be made about the adequacy of the terms of reference. I am delighted now that he has accepted my invitation to do so. I hope that the discussions with the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General are held forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It has been brought to my attention that on 23 March 1982 in the Senate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) indicated that his attention had been drawn to a Press release issued for and on behalf of the National President of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia. He told the Senate that he had seen a copy of the Press statement and he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . and which I understand emanated from the office of Mr Clyde Holding in this Parliament House--</PARA>
<PARA>When pressed on the matter, Senator Messner resiled from that statement and was content to say that he had received a copy of the statement from my office in Parliament House and he felt that that was strange. The implication and the thrust of Senator Messner's statements were that this document, rather than being a document put out by the National President of the Vietnam Veterans Association, in fact had me as the author. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts of the matter are simply these: Following a debate which took place in this House last Thursday and which I initiated a large number of statements and allegations were made both by me and by the Minister who answered on behalf of the Government. Following that, a Press release was issued by the National President of the Vietnam Veterans Association which was embargoed until midday on Sunday. I did not see that statement until I came to Parliament House on Tuesday where a copy of it was waiting for me. It was a lengthy statement. It not only disagreed with views expressed by the Minister on behalf of the Government in terms of interpretation but also had an alternative statement of fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to its importance it seemed to me, in order that all honourable members would have a complete record of the thrust of the allegations that had been made in the debate, that it would be an appropriate course for me to incorporate that statement in Hansard so that all honourable members could make their own judgments on it. I subsequently did that on Tuesday night. But it also seemed to me, as I had no method of knowing which Minister would be at the table during the adjournment debate, that as a matter of courtesy it would be appropriate for me to bring the statement to the attention of the relevant Minister in case he had not seen it. I instructed my research officer to take a copy of the statement round to the Minister's office and when I raised the matter in the adjournment debate I was able to indicate to the Minister at the table that I was seeking leave to have this statement incorporated in Hansard and that a copy had been sent to the appropriate Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a matter of regret that what was essentially a simple act of courtesy should be misinterpreted in this way and also that statements should be made which were disparaging of the organisation, the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, and its President. It seems that the Minister concerned is having increasing difficulty in dealing with simple acts of courtesy, with any kind of integrity at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Thursday, 18 March, we heard the results of the review by this Government of its housing policies. This matter has already been debated but, as it was directed to the Victorian election campaign, there is need to examine it again. The main thrust of the policy was the family home tax rebate. It was introduced as a desperate attempt to save a Liberal Government in Victoria, which has been proved utterly incompetent and, worse, a Government tainted by corruption, as highlighted by the scandalous land deals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The people of Australia, and particularly of Victoria, should realise that the scheme is limited to first home buyers. Therefore a scheme estimated in the first full year to cost $230m will benefit only 28 per cent of home buyers. The other 72 per cent of home buyers will continue to battle with ever increasing mortgage repayments without any assistance from the Fraser Government. Further, there is no means test on the scheme and it will therefore not be directed to those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA> A survey by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research in 1980 showed that 45 per cent of first home buyers in Victoria earned in excess of 150 per cent of average male weekly earnings-that is, on today's figures, $ 450 weekly or more. This Government was prepared to buy an election victory in Victoria by a scheme directed at only 28 per cent of home buyers. But then came the real crunch. The Fraser Government allowed saving banks again to increase housing interest rates by one per cent to 13.5 per cent. That is a 4 per cent increase from 9.5 per cent in March 1980 to a staggering 13.5 per cent in March 1982. This one per cent increase in interest rates will result in a $22 increase in monthly repayments on a bank loan of $30,000 over 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Liberals, stricken with panic, then decided to offer a one per cent interest rebate to about 72 per cent of Victorian home buyers who miss out on the Federal scheme. This proposal is an election bribe. The Liberals have no shame about plundering the public purse to retain the spoils of office. Mr Kennett, the Victorian Minister of Housing, stated on 19 March that the scheme would be an election winner. That is another prediction by that man which will be proved wrong on 3 April when the Victorian people elect a Cain Labor government. However, we should remember the disgraceful motive of Mr Kennett, being not to help anyone but only to hang on to power at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the insatiable appetite of the Liberal Party for deceit and distortion, together with the capacity of the propaganda machine to peddle such political distortion, it is necessary to spell out some of the facts on this election bribe, described by the Victorian Liberals as a housing policy. Firstly , bank interest on a 25-year loan of $30,000 has increased in two years from 9.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent. As a result, monthly repayments on such a loan have increased in that period by $88. For those forced to borrow from building societies, interest rates have increased by 3 per cent from 12.5 per cent in March 1980 to 15.5 per cent in March 1982. On a $30,000 building society loan over 25 years monthly repayments have increased to approximately $390. The one per cent rebate for people who have a bank loan amounts to $22 a month but because of the interest rate increases over the past two years their mortgage payments have gone up by $88 a month as a direct result of this Government's policies. Therefore, allowing for the rebate of $22 a month, such a home buyer is still $66 a month worse off than he was two years ago. That is all that is being done for those home buyers by the introduction of the one per cent rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the cost of the scheme, according to Mr Kennett, is about $30m. This is a gross distortion of the true cost. The correct figure is closer to $60m. Mr John Cain was certainly correct when he said the Liberals cannot add up. A one per cent increase in interest rates in Australia will cost approximately $300m per annum in increased interest payments. Of that amount, Victoria accounts for about $80m. The scheme will cater for 72 per cent of home buyers who are not covered by the Federal proposal. Seventy-two per cent of $80m is almost $60m. It is amazing that Mr Kennett could have arrived at a figure of $30m. He claimed that the scheme would be financed from $60m transferred from the Mark I housing policy, which was dropped like a hot potato when the Federal Government inflicted a further increase of one per cent in interest rates. Mr Kennett said further that there would be $30m left from the $60m to extend the scheme. In fact, there will be nothing left as the scheme will absorb all of the $60m. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there will be further increases in interest rates not just for Victorians but for all Australians. Mr Morris, the President of the Victorian Building Societies Association, said on 19 March that it was even more inevitable that interest rates would increase. He was, of course, commenting on the policies of this Government and the Victorian Liberal Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Mr Campbell, the Chairman of the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, has predicted an increase of 1 1/2 per cent. In addition, we have seen the first step to deregulate the banks. We have now started along the Campbell track. Economists from the Australian National University predict that there will be increases in interest rates of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent if deregulation is adopted. That is the direction in which this Government is heading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those Victorians who are renting homes have been ignored again and face a bleak future unless urgent attention is given to the public housing sector. A survey in January by the Real Estate Institute of Australia revealed a 1.1 per cent vacancy rate for private rental accommodation in Melbourne, the second lowest of any capital city. Only Adelaide with a 0.7 per cent vacancy rate was lower than Melbourne. The Institute's Executive Director said that rents are on the increase. That is certainly true. There have been dramatic rent increases in the past two years. For example, in the inner suburbs of Melbourne rents rose by between 20 per cent and 50 per cent from January 1980 to December 1981. Real estate agents in Melbourne are predicting that rents will continue to rise sharply this year with increases of about 30 per cent in some areas. </PARA>
<PARA> On Tuesday of this week the Minister for Housing and Construction announced a disgraceful proposal to spend $300,000 to advertise the housing policy of the Fraser Government. He said that 34.6 per cent of that amount of money would be directed to advertising in Melbourne. He claimed that this figure is based on an historical analysis of where the Government was getting the inquiries from.</PARA>

That left only Friday and Monday. According to the Minister, there were many inquiries over the weekend. The fact is that the only analysis involved in the distribution of the $300,000 of public money was the opinion polls in Victoria- the opinion polls which were spelling the end of the Liberal Government in that State. This type of activity by the Liberal Party is par for the course. I invite honourable members to recall the scandalous use by the Fraser Government of the Government Information Unit as a propaganda machine for the Liberal Party during the 1980 election campaign. The Liberals are at it again, dipping their fingers into taxpayers' money for blatant political purposes. But in Victoria the party is over for the Liberals. Victorians will deliver their judgment on 3 April by electing a Cain Labor government.</PARA></TALK.START>

I point out to him that for some years the applications for homes savings grants from his State of Victoria represented one-third of the total number of applications in Australia. The honourable member indicated that a certain sum of money is to be spent on a certain basis. For the information of the honourable member, there will be 148 television advertisements appearing in Sydney and only 77 in Melbourne. The reason for spending the higher percentage of the money in Victoria is that the cost of television advertising in that State is much higher. We have allocated $64,000 for Sydney and $70,800 for Melbourne. There will be 77 advertisements in Victoria and 148 in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Next year will see the city of Broken Hill celebrating its 100th birthday and this is a significant event not only in the history of that great mining city but also in the history of our young nation. It was through the wealth gained from the Barrier Range that many of Australia's industrial giants were born and, without this direct wealth being paid to mining companies and by the taxes and royalties paid to the State and Federal governments, this nation's development would have been much slower.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The lode still provides direct input for large industries in centres other than Broken Hill-in particular Port Pirie in South Australia, Risdon in Tasmania and, to a lesser extent, Cockle Creek in New South Wales. However, as with all mines, the Broken Hill lode is a reducing asset and, although major mining companies have invested considerable sums in exploration over many years, the only significant discovery in recent time has been that of the Fitzpatrick lode by North Broken Hill Ltd. This discovery, however, is only likely to extend the life of the North Broken Hill mine from its present life expectancy by about four years. </PARA>
<PARA> It has become the practice for the mines on the southern end of the line of lode, consisting of the Zinc Corporation and New Broken Hill Consolidated, to extract a greater proportion of lower grade ores, but the time has come when the economic viability of continued mining operations will depend upon the cost of extraction, with particular emphasis on labour, transport and energy. Even with these taken into consideration, much will depend upon State and Federal government decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> A committee known as the Broken Hill Economic Review Committee was set up in 1979, and it held its first meeting in January 1980, to look into the diversification of Broken Hill's economy and other matters that it was hoped would ensure the long-term future of Broken Hill. The committee consisted of representatives of all levels of government, and representatives of the Broken Hill community. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth representative was an observer only. The committee did an excellent job, and in its report it touched on the history of Broken Hill, the local economy, transport, population and employment, age structure of the city and work force, and education. In fact, an extremely broad range of subjects were investigated and reported upon. </PARA>
<PARA> There were matters raised in the report that I feel should be highlighted so that they are placed on record in this Parliament. One relates to the unique nature of the Broken Hill royalty scale. These royalties are being paid to the New South Wales State Government. The formula for this royalty scale is complicated and, as time does not permit, I shall not go into details of the formula. Suffice to say that this royalty has acted in the same way as a resource tax or a 'super-profits' tax. On top of this are paid company tax, payroll tax, municipal rates and water board rates. If one adds the tax paid by the employees of the mining companies of Broken Hill, one finds that the total payout over 10 years to June 1979 was $355.9m. In royalties the coal industry has caught up and surpassed Broken Hill in recent years. For example, from 1976 to 1980 coal mines paid $153m, whilst Broken Hill companies paid $108m. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the historical importance of Broken Hill to the nation's treasuries has been significant. Not only have governments benefited, but also it is a fact that many industrial movements throughout Australia have received assistance from the workers of Broken Hill through the Barrier Industrial Council, during their times of hardship and strife, by way of voluntary levies paid by the workers of Broken Hill. The citizens of Broken Hill have always had a reputation for self-reliance born out of necessity, with the traditional feeling that governments of any persuasion were interested only in what wealth could be obtained from their city in the semi-arid region of western New South Wales. Broken Hill has, therefore, developed a tough and independent outlook, but now it is realised, particularly on the findings of the Economic Review Committee, that some of the wealth that has been won from Broken Hill will have to be returned if the city is to have a long-term future. </PARA>
<PARA> One way in which this could be achieved would be in carrying out one of the recommendations of the Economic Review Committee by devising an incentive whereby royalty relief would be provided to mining companies extracting low- grade ores, possibly on a sliding scale relating royalty to the head grade of the ore. It would then be up to the Federal Government to match any royalty relief approved by the New South Wales State Government with Federal tax relief. This would not only enable full utilisation of the ore body of the city but would give Broken Hill time to broaden its economic base and prepare itself for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Although royalty relief is one of the major points recommended by the report, there were other recommendations. One was that a co-ordinator be appointed by the New South Wales Premier to liaise with relevant organisations and follow up on progress in relation to recommendations approved by the Government or other decisions taken by the Government in relation to Broken Hill. Another was that a Commonwealth-State task force should be established to examine and recommend an overall manpower planning measure. A Broken Hill action committee was to be established to examine and recommend ways of achieving a more attractive industrial relations image and of improving the competitive position of Broken Hill in relation to other country areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The citizens of Broken Hill are becoming impatient that little has happened since the committee brought out its report 14 months ago. The only thing that they can see occurring is reduced services being provided by governments. The State member for Broken Hill, Mr Bill Beckroge, has done a good job in keeping the matter before the New South Wales State Parliament, and it is hoped that the State Minister for Industrial Development and Decentralisation, Mr Don Day, will soon make a statement on the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Broken Hill has the will to survive and to maintain its position as one of the major cities of inland Australia, but it will mean a great deal of flexibility being displayed by local, State and Federal Governments. The mining companies will have to play their part keeping in mind the problems that they face on a fluctuating overseas market. The Broken Hill union movement, under the leadership of the Barrier Industrial Council, has had a major part to play in the history and traditions of Broken Hill, but I believe that, because of its structure and the place it holds in the Broken Hill community, it has yet to play its most significant role in assuring the future of Broken Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> Since my election to the Federal Parliament, I have tried to ensure that other members are aware of the significant role that Broken Hill has played in the New South Wales and Australian economy over a great number of years. </PARA>

It wants only a fair go from both the State and Federal governments, mainly in relief from crippling royalties and taxes. I hope that, when the State Government decides to reduce its royalty scale to a more reasonable level and provide other assistance to Broken Hill, the Federal Government will be there to match its support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer was that that was not known. The lady put my friend on to a person who said that he was a secretary to the Victorian Minister for Housing. His answer to that question was: 'Rental assistance amounting to $5.2m will be given by the Federal Government to Victoria.' The Victorian Government does not know how it will be used but a conference is being held on Friday. If the Victorian Government does not know how to use $5m in regard to rental accommodation, I think the Federal Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) and the Minister in Victoria might well come to my electorate. Plenty of people could tell them what to do with this $5m. I have had people come to me in regard to this matter. For instance, a widow with a teenage son who lived in a little two bedroom unit said that things were so bad that she would have to downgrade to a one bedroom unit and would have to sleep in the lounge room because they could not afford to keep a two bedroom unit going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the situation under the policies of this Government and of the Government in Victoria. The list goes on. In my bayside electorate of Isaacs the numerous caravan parks are all full because people cannot afford to live anywhere else. For reassurance, my friend who rang this number asked this secretary to the Minister for Housing also how that one per cent would be financed. This is what one of the secretaries to the Minister said: 'I assume someone has worked it out.' In other words, the Victorian Government has this great attitude towards financing its new wonderful schemes and yet it had the cheek the other day to say that the promises of the Cain government-which it will be on Saturday week-would cost $3,000m. It cannot even cost its own promises. The Victorian Government does not know; it is making wild promises in an effort to stop itself from going down the gurgler. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite one more case from my electorate. In 1977 the State Government bought a place called 'Yarrabah' in Aspendale, which is on the beach, to use as a special school. It was reported then to have cost the State Government around $190,000. It paid $190,000 for a special school. The incompetence of the Victorian Government is so great. It did not even go into the project and it was found that the place was not suitable. There were numerous reasons for that, one of which was the whole area was zoned residential and could not be used. It is an absolute disgrace that 'Yarrabah' is still vacant five years later, at an original cost to the Victorian taxpayers of nearly $200,000. This type of government in Victoria has been going on for over a quarter of a century. It is about time-it will be time on Saturday week-that the Victorian people got rid of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear much, especially from the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch), about how investment is growing and how things in Victoria are so wonderful. I mentioned that in a speech yesterday. However, he leaves out certain aspects. I wish to quote some Australian Bureau of Statistics figures on actual private new fixed capital expenditure by the State. I will refer to South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria and how the percentages have changed between September 1980 and September 1981. In New South Wales the real new fixed capital expenditure has increased by 15.3 per cent; in South Australia it has declined by 6.7 per cent; and, in Victoria, the real change has been minus 7.3 per cent. Private expenditure and new capital expenditure in the 12 months, from September to September, has declined by 7.3 per cent in Victoria. In regard to the States' shares of private fixed capital expenditure, from September 1979 to 1981 there was an increase in New South Wales from 36.2 per cent to 37.1 per cent. New South Wales is continuing to increase slightly its share. South Australia's share has decreased from 7.5 per cent to 5.7 per cent and Victoria's share has decreased from 26.6 per cent to 20.2. per cent- an absolute disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to direct my remarks also to the Victorian elections but, on this occasion in contrast to honourable members opposite, in support of the Thompson Government. (Quorum formed). I think we now have double the number of Labor members in the chamber. There were three before and now there are six. There were 700 per cent more members on this side of the House at the time the quorum was called. At the outset I want to direct my remarks, which are in support of the Thompson Government, to the Victorian election. When I heard the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) and the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles) attack the Liberal Government's record and proposals on housing, I tried to remember who on the other side of the House had taken a keen interest in low cost housing. The harsh reality is that the only person in the Labor Party who has shown any continuing interest in low cost housing is probably Norm Gallagher. The fact is that during this debate this morning and at other times there has been an unfortunate tendency in the election debate in Victoria to lose sight of the real issues and to forget the very significant progress that has been made by Victoria under a Liberal government. I remind the House that Victoria has the highest level of household income of any State in Australia, that Victorians enjoy the highest rate of home ownership, that Victoria has the highest skilled work force in Australia, and its unemployment rate is the lowest in any State. I have listened to honourable members opposite before. Their cliches are deserving of the purring they are giving them now. The reality is that achievements have occurred in Victoria because of the consistent and positive development policies pursued by successive Liberal governments in that State. They are the sorts of policies which clearly distinguish a Liberal approach from a Labor approach to government and which the Liberal Premier, Lindsay Thompson, has pledged to continue in the interests of all Victorians.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rather hard to look at it. Members of that party have virtually submerged themselves, to coin a phrase. I understand the leader is holding a meeting of his supporters tomorrow and he has booked a local telephone booth. The Liberal policy statement can bluntly be put forward as a blueprint for continuing responsible economic management, for the encouragement of growth and employment through private endeavour and for firm and responsible industrial relations policies. As has been made clear, the Liberal Government will introduce innovative and creative programs to encourage the further development of small business and to promote investment in natural resource and high technology industries. Despite all disclaimers, when one looks at the detail of the Labor Party's policies one finds that in reality they are just a re-run of the sorts of policies pursued by other Labor governments. There is hardly any need to remind the House of the various Labor government records of economic management. Look at the glitter that has gone off the image of that model for Labor leaders, the Premier of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remarked in a rather passing way during the Lowe by-election that I could understand the concerns of some New South Welshmen with the sales tax that was imposed on certain essential items such as candles, hurricane lamps, hot water bottles and roller skates for commuters. Regrettably the joke is coming true. Rather than liberate, the private talent and resources on which future growth would depend, a Labor government in Victoria would undoubtedly mean more government intervention and regulation-except, of course, over the trade union movement-and more bureaucracy and more State socialism. The centrepiece of Labor 's development strategy is to be yet another government body-the Victorian development fund. This fund is to take $675m of the cash reserves of the State's public authorities to finance Labor's extravagant capital works program. Let us look at what the independent Cochrane-Muir report had to say about this. It has identified in fact that $225m can be prudently used and it is their advice which will, of course, guide a Liberal government. Quite properly, Professor Cochrane and Sir Lawrence Muir have said that the resources of the State superannuation fund must be managed in the interests of its policy holders. They are not, of course, the resources of the Government and they cannot be disposed of at the Government's whim. </PARA>
<PARA> So when the electors of Victoria make their choice on 3 April they should recall the words of the New South Wales Auditor-General who said last year that if the public authorities in that State had been run as private operations they would be bankrupt now. The Wran Labor Government has reduced that State to insolvency. A Cain Labor government would unquestionably follow in the same direction-the direction of promising to extend government controls into other areas of economic activity. According to the State Labor leadership, all of the State's energy resources would be brought under public ownership. Instead of freeing up the State's large public utilities such as the State Electricity Commission of Victoria and the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria and allowing them to pursue viable management policies and plan confidently for the future, a Labor government would in effect make them extensions of the State bureaucracy. There would be more regulation and more red tape to stifle initiative and incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> For some reason, which is beyond logic, the Labor Party maintains a mystical belief in the ability of bureaucrats and their alleged political masters to make better decisions for the community than people can make for themselves. One area , of course, where there will be less government intervention and less public control under a Labor government is the area of industrial relations. It does not matter what else we do in this country; if we do not get our industrial relations right we do not get our government right. There is no doubt that abject proposals have been put forward in the field of industrial relations in Victoria. The myth of that special relationship between the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement was blown apart not only in the years between 1972 and 1975 but critically and tragically in the State of New South Wales now. There is an urgent need to estabish a sound industrial relations framework not only federally but also at the State level whick is understood and accepted by all practitioners-unions, employers and government. If one examines the record of industrial relations of the Australian Labor Party in Victoria one will see that the current climate of confrontation and disintegration will worsen. In delivering the ALP policy speech, Mr Cain said:</PARA>
<PARA> The heavy handed, legalistic approach to industrial relations has not worked, and never will . . . All sections of the Victorian workforce must be encouraged to work together for Victoria to grow and prosper. </PARA>
<PARA>They are fine words, but what about the detailed application of that policy? Will the interests of Victorians be protected by Labor abolishing the Vital State Projects Act--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, the people of Victoria will be faced with a unique historical opportunity. They will be able to exercise their vote in a State election not merely to change the Government in Victoria but also to change the whole direction of the nation. The people of Victoria will be in a position to deliver the death blow to the reactionary Liberalism of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his cronies. They will reject the Fraser philosophy which has created an economic crisis of massive dimensions in this country and which, because of the failure of the Victorian Liberal Government to do anything about it, has damaged Victoria more than any other State. The reason the Victorian Liberal Government has exacerbated and contributed to the crisis in Victoria is because that Government has the same reactionary philosophy as the Prime Minister. This point must be made clear. The dogmatic set of ideas which guide the Fraser Government are the same ideas which guide the Thompson Government. The very same reactionary philosophy which is ruining Australia is the philosophy which is destroying Victoria. The poor people of that State have, so to speak, to suffer a double dose of Liberalism with the Fraser Government's destructive policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me outline some of the disastrous results. First of all, there has been a massive increase in the level of unemployment throughout Australia, especially in Victoria. The Fraser Government systematically refuses to do anything about unemployment. In accordance with its philosophy, it simply leaves it up to the market place. What does the Thompson Government do? Does it offset the Federal policy by creating new jobs? Not at all. All that Mr Dixon, the Victorian Minister for Employment and Training, can think of is a series of advertising schemes which promote Mr Dixon but which do nothing for the unemployed. One such scheme, called the 'Great Scheme', is supposed to identify jobs. How can the location of jobs be identified when they do not exist? That is the situation in Victoria at the present time. The Thompson Government, rather than wasting money on such advertising campaigns, should be putting money into employing people in the many areas of human need services which have been run down in Victoria. The provision of better public transport, roads, hospital facilities and community health centres are all areas in which people could be employed. Yet they are not so employed because of the dogmatic Fraser philosophy of the Thompson Government . </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, as I emphasised in a speech yesterday, manufacturing industry, which is the backbone of the Victorian economy, is continuously being wound down by the policies of the Fraser Government. In the Fraser Government's first five years 20,000 jobs were lost in the Victorian manufacturing industry, yet what does the Thompson Government do? Does it act to reverse that trend? Does it take on the Federal Liberal Government? Not at all. It makes a few quiet noises and lets the industry go to the wall. That is clearly illustrated with the new Fraser motor car policy. Thompson has simply accepted it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thompson has simply accepted that policy, yet it will result in the loss of at least another 20,000 jobs in the next three years. Equally serious is the fact that the run-down of manufacturing industry will hit the decentralised areas of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. Their future will be very bleak if the Thompson Government is re-elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Liberal policies have led to skyrocketing interest rates on homes and small business. The Fraser Government in less than three years has increased interest rates by 4 per cent. The average family is paying nearly $200 a month more than it was. The latest rise is accompanied by a so-called housing package which the Federal Government is disgracefully using public money to market. That new housing policy has been described by the Australian newspaper-not exactly a pro-Labor paper-as 'an economic nonsense'. These are some of the comments made in the Australian about the policy:</PARA>
<PARA> It is unlikely to help the home construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . those moving because their families are growing-usually those most in need-get no help at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme also does nothing to help the large number of Australians who rent. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . it will make life impossible for many small businessmen. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Fraser Government's policies are so bad that they have been rejected by even the conservative editorialists of the Australian, is there anyone left who can support it? Unfortunately, there is. The Thompson Liberal Government in Victoria. It continues to support the Fraser strategy. The evidence for that claim is clear. Did Thompson attack the Prime Minister about his economic policies which have led to the housing disaster? Certainly not. What did he do? He went through the ridiculous exercise of abandoning the housing policy he had announced eight days previously and he introduced a scheme to cover up, not to solve, Fraser's mistakes. The people of Victoria are to be fooled by the State Liberals into believing that they will not have to pay the one per cent increase imposed by the Federal Liberals. That action more than any other clearly exposes the nature of Mr Thompson and his gang. They have no new policies, no new ideas, no solutions to the massive problems facing Victoria. They are simply Fraser's ventriloquist dolls manipulated by Fraser's ideology, by his approach. But the people of Victoria will take their vengeance. They will vote in a Cain Labor government. That government will be a government of responsibility, a government which is led by a great Australian who has enormous compassion for ordinary people and high managerial ability. He will show the Liberals how a State should be run. He will provide a new direction for that State and will spell the end of the Fraser Liberals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, I present the forty-fifth general report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="Z37">Mr BUNGEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This general report reviews the activity of the Committee during 1981. The report includes a reference to departments improving the standard of their submissions. We have set out in the report some key factors which should be included in the departmental submissions. These include: The need for the proposed work; the alternative solutions which have been examined prior to the decision to proceed with the work; an indication of the priority of the work in relation to other planned works by the department; details of any cost-benefit studies; details of any environmental studies; information of negotiations or discussions with other departments, State and local authorities, companies, unions and the public in relation to the work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to environmental factors, the Committee has signalled its intention to examine more fully compliance with the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. The Committee is frequently advised that proposed works require urgent attention, early completion of the works being necessitated by certain factors. Responsible departments should co-ordinate their planning and resource allocation with a view to giving the Committee sufficient time to publicise its inquiry, for interested groups and organisations to provide submissions and for the Committee to hold public hearings and report to Parliament. It appears to the Committee that the works become urgent because of lack of foresight and a lack of timely commitment either by the Government or in departmental decision making and through administrative and budgeting machinery. </PARA>
<PARA> Also in this general report is a section dealing with the construction of airport works which pre-empted consideration by the Committee. Authorisation and completion of these works without investigation by the Committee was a matter of concern. On a brighter note, the Committee observed the adoption of its recommendations in respect of defence housing. Full and regular consultation now appears to be taking place between Service families and the Departments of Defence, Administrative Services and Housing and Construction on the needs and problems of occupants of defence housing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has commented on the Commonwealth's contribution to the national heritage. The Committee believes the Commonwealth expenditure in designing and constructing new buildings to complement historic buildings or areas should be recognised and that the public should be made aware of the Commonwealth's contribution. The Committee has drawn to the attention of the Government the need to clarify further the precise definition of a public work as noted in sections 5 and 18 of the Public Works Committee Act. The question of the definition of a public work arose over the proposed construction of an oceanographic research vessel for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year was a busy year for the Committee, with 12 reports being presented and some 54 meetings being held in the year. The works examined totalled $207.9m with works costing $190.45m being recommended for construction by the Committee. The work load on Committee members and staff has been heavy, and as Chairman I wish to record my thanks to them. During the year, the Vice-Chairman, Senator Jean Melzer, retired and the Committee wishes her well for the future. Additionally, on behalf of the Committee, I now place on record acknowledgment of the help and assistance received from many departments, particularly the Department of Housing and Construction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I endorse the remarks of the Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works-the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey)-and thank him for his kind remarks about the members of the Committee. I am very happy to serve on that Committee under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Canning. I was very sorry to lose from the Committee Senator Melzer and Senator Harold Young. Senator Young is now the President of the Senate and I congratulate him for being elevated to that high position. The Senate can only gain by having Senator Young as President. Senator Young was a great worker on the Committee. As I have said, I am sorry to lose him, but I know that he has gone to bigger and better things. I am very happy to have Senator Foreman and Senator Martyr join the Committee. I congratulate the honourable member for Sydney, Mr Les McMahon, on being elevated to the position of Vice-Chairman of the Committee. He is doing a wonderful job in that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will make a couple of remarks in relation to what the Chairman has said about the environmental considerations that have been referred to the Committee. They relate mainly to the Department of Defence. It has stated in evidence that projects have been submitted to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment when it has been satisfied on the evidence that no environmental impact studies were required. On two occasion it has been proved by the Committee that further investigations were needed by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. I suggest that the evidence given by the Department of Defence to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment led it to make its findings in that regard. I suggest to the Ministers of both departments that they look closely at environmental problems that exist in relation to Defence Force establishments and that they give further consideration to them. The Chairman gave the departments fair warning today when he stated that he would require more evidence in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of the urgency of works, work on the Townsville international terminal came before this Parliament as an urgency motion and did not come before the Committee. The report states that in 1980 the estimated costs for that terminal were supposedly $2.38m. They are now estimated at $3.2m. That terminal is still not complete. In my opinion, the Townsville international terminal was commenced for political expediency. Because of that we have to pay out more money. By the time it is finished it will probably cost an extra $2m. When we went to Townsville to inspect the sites for the new Commonwealth office buildings, we were shown over the international terminal and were told how wonderful it was that we could do all these projects so quickly, in a few weeks. When we said during evidence given by the Department of Housing and Construction that it would be a great idea to have the Commonwealth office buildings in Townsville and house all the public servants in one building, the departmental representatives said it would take quite a while to do and it would be 10 months before the plans could be drawn up. Lots of taxpayers' money could have been saved if the Department had hurried a bit more in that regard and had the Commonwealth office buildings built ahead of schedule. I thank the Parliament for allowing me to say these few words. I would like briefly to thank the members of the staff of the Committee. They work very had, as do all the other Committee members. I thank the Secretary, Mr Fenton, the Assistant Secretary, Mr Fetter, Mr Davies and the stenographer, Mrs Thompson, who have done a wonderful job. I have worked on the Road Safety Committee. The staff of the Public Works Committee are the most superior staff I have ever worked with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I concur with the comments made already on this matter. I wish to make one or two points. In my time on the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I have noticed that great discipline has been imposed on government departments in bringing forward public works. I believe this is perhaps the most important function of the Committee. I know that there is public criticism of government committees. They can cost a fair amount of money. They employ staff and incur costs for travelling, although, of course, members do not receive allowances. But the money involved in cases such as the Public Works Committee is repaid over and over again in the discipline imposed on departments whereby they are forced to examine so closely why they are spending money and in what form they are spending it. I think that ought to be brought out, at least in the case of the Public Works Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to point out one aspect of the report this year that seems to me to be important; it relates to the environment. The honourable member for Griffiths ( Mr Humphreys) rightly pointed out in his remarks the concern of the Committee about all aspects of the environment. An aspect relating to the built environment is also brought out in this report, and that is that on many occasions the Commonwealth Government uses taxpayers' funds-often a large amount of them-to ensure that Commonwealth buildings are either preserved or built in such a way that the environment is not offended by a new built environment. The report points out cases where hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent, in addition to the minimum that would be spent, to preserve buildings. Often, Commonwealth governments of whatever persuasion are criticised for not having enough funding concern for the preservation of the National Estate. Whatever funds are spent through other departments, it ought to be borne in mind that in the capital works program of the Department of Housing and Construction, large amounts of money are put forward to support the national heritage in addition to all other areas of funding. I know that this has also been carried out by such instrumentalities as Australia Post. Its most recent report points out that large amounts have been spent merely to preserve the national heritage. I hope that with politicians on both sides supporting this approach we will receive some credit. I hope that the few words in this report point that out clearly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia currently has a population of around 15 million and two-thirds of that population live in seven cities. There are physical, social and economic limitations on further population growth in those cities. By the turn of the century the population in this country is projected to be about 20 million. We are now faced with the large task of planning how and where to house that additional population; how to provide those people with income security, employment and equitable access to community services. Commonsense would lead us to look to policies of regional development in order to meet many of those challenges. Tragically, the Government is pursuing policies which run contrary to commonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the first time in Australia's history, we have a Federal Government that has no regional development policies, one which has cut funding for urban and regional development programs by 90 per cent. The small allocations made in the 1981-82 Budget were for the purpose of winding up former programs. The growth centres program is now defunct. In April 1981, the Government terminated the decentralisation assistance program and abolished the Decentralisation Advisory Board. It has failed to provide appropriate regional development policies. It has no vision of what our regional policies ought to be or could be. Instead, it has pursued policies that are causing many of our established regional centres to decay. I refer in particular to the areas of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the Government is imposing restrictive and regressive monetarist policies on the Australian economy and the Australian people. In turn, those policies are having a stifling effect on domestic economic activity. In particular, they are having a devastating effect on activity in several important regional economies. Cutbacks in public capital works and Federal funding of the States for community services have taken their toll of regional economies. Again, restrictions on the availability of credit, and the dramatic rises in interest rates have taken their toll on small businesses in regional areas especially. Reductions in household spending capacity have eroded demand for domestically produced goods and services. Australian firms are going to the wall and unemployment is rising. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Government is promoting a major structural shift in Australia's pattern of economic development. In an unbalanced and unco-ordinated way, it is promoting a change from the post-war industrial development strategy of import replacement, in favour of export orientation. Such a shift has profound implications, not least for the viability of many of our nation's regional centres which were built up after World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make clear Labor's position. We support the balanced development of our natural resources and a balanced expansion of our exports of pastoral, agricultural, mineral, energy and manufactured products. The serious problems that face many of our regional communities result not from the fact that we are attempting to expand our national exports so much as from the way in which this Government is promoting that expansion, the rate and pace of which is causing much concern. Specialisation, associated with export orientation, leads to greater degrees of industry centralisation in a few regions and higher levels of ownership concentration in a few hands. Further international integration through trade brings with it costs as well as benefits. To the extent that a nation retains a viable and diversified domestic production base, benefits are maximised and costs minimised. Only then can it have the security of self- reliance. Only then can it have the security of self-defence. Only then can it promote the security of its internal regions. If a nation dismantles its domestic production sectors, if it fails to promote the viability of decentralised regions, it becomes fragmented, vulnerable and dependent. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the thrust of this Government's policy of scatter gun development-at the cost of writing a blank cheque for the foreign corporations which control this country. That is the price we pay as a nation for the withdrawl of this Government from its responsibility to co-ordinate the pattern and pace of resource development. That is the cost that is being borne now. and will be borne by future generations, as a result of the failure of the Government to promote broadly-based industrial development. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the specific plight of Victoria, which has suffered doubly, first at the hands of a conservative Federal Government and, secondly, from living for years in the shadow of a moribund conservative State government. It has suffered especially, of course, at the hands of this conservative Federal Government. Both governments are in a shambles and divided among themselves. The Fraser Ministry and the 'dries' of its back benches regard Victoria as a museum. They are not prepared to assist its ailing manufacturing sector. They are not interested in the survival of important centres such as Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo. They are joining forces with the mining companies of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia and are uprooting their historical connections with the southern States. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to quote from the October 1981 report of the Victorian Department of Economic Development, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Considerable investment funds are thought to be leaving the State and are being reinvested in other States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Collins House Group and the wealthy members of the Melbourne Club are transferring Victorian funds to the mineral processing ventures of those northern States. That is the group that is represented by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his cohorts. It is the group that is so strongly represented in the Victorian Government. In fact, that Government is selling out its own people. Let us be clear that the Victorian Government uncritically supports the export-oriented strategy of the Fraser Government. In the 10 years 1970-71 to 1980-81, there has been a net population migration from Victoria of more than 60 ,000. As a result, a number of country towns and regional centres have experienced a population decline. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the social cost of this agonising decline, particularly in the three areas that I have mentioned, those, of Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo. Geelong is Victoria's second largest city and the ninth largest in the nation. It should enjoy all of the advantages of a major population centre. In 1967, it was declared a growth area by the Victorian Government. It has suffered a severe manufacturing employment decline and has an unemployment rate of 9.8 per cent compared with 7 per cent for Victoria as a whole. The Geelong regional Commission has estimated that if unmployment is to be reduced to 6 per cent an additional 3,000 jobs will be required in the region by 1983. I emphasise that we are merely talking about reducing the figure to 6 per cent. In 1973-74, Geelong had 300 manufacturing plants, employing 21,740 people. By 1978-79, the number of plants had fallen to 208 and employment to 18,583. Over half of Geelong's manufacturing employment is now found within four plants, and all are facing real difficulties. In the 1970s, job losses occurred in the textiles and wood product industries. In the 1980s, the vehicle industry faces losses as a result of the Government's policies and measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Geelong Regional Commission has called for the decentralisation of Commonwealth Government offices to that centre. It argues that the serious outflow of tradesmen from the region jeopardises its capacity to pursue downstream activities. It sees the need to provide employment for professional and clerical workers as well as a basis for attracting other productive industries to the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Ballarat is another region that has suffered population and job losses. In 1975 -76, it had 141 manufacturing plants, which employed 7,715. By 1978-79, the number of plants had fallen to 131 and employment stood at 6,761. The greatest falls occurred in the highly protected textiles, clothing and footwear industries, the transport equipment industry and the metal industries, the transport equipment industry and the metal products industry. According to the last official figures available, in March 1981 unemployment in Ballarat amounted to 9.5 per cent and some 3,841 persons were registered as unemployed. It is a scandal that the razor gang should have terminated the publishing of local area unemployment details. The information base for regional planning was poor enough before that. Now it is effectively non-existent. How can one plan and how can decisions be made on these vital issues if one cannot at least have public discussions with the people involved to find out how many are unemployed in that region. Local estimates put the current number of unemployed at around 5,000. A recent study by the Ballarat College of Advanced Education has estimated that in September 1981 unemployment in the 15-year to 24-year age group was in excess of 27 per cent. Over 200 people in Ballarat have lost their jobs in the past two weeks. I was informed that today more people are to be laid off at Pridham's abattoirs in that region. That is the disturbing situation in those two cities. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the city of Bendigo, which the Government Whip and honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) represents in this House. Bendigo has also suffered population and job losses. The State Government has failed to act on its promises to build State offices in Bendigo, a new fire station, a new police station and new school at White Hills. I might sound a bit parish pump but I am replying to those people who at times are parish pump politicians, who have made these blind promises and have not kept them. The Federal Government threatens the closure of the ordnance factory in Bendigo, which employs over 600 people, including 126 apprentices which make up about one-third of the student numbers at the Bendigo Technical College. The Federal Government has also decided that engineering courses at the Bendigo College of Advanced Education will be discontinued. Employment at the Bendigo rail workshops has fallen from around 700 in 1970 to around 450 in 1981. This has all happened under the conservative Government of Victoria. Further declines are expected in Bendigo's manufacturing industries, which have already been thumped by this Federal Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> In January this year the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures argued that the companies were delaying investments until the Government clarified its industry assistance policy. The Victorian Chamber of Manufacturers claimed that 3,695 jobs in Bendigo would be affected by a further reduction in protection and that the viability of industries would be seriously damaged by even a marginal drop in protection. That has been the blind position taken by this Government. This is a conservative government in the national sphere and it is supposed to be working in co-operation with its State colleagues, the Victorian Thompson Government, formerly the Hamer Government. That State is now in the throes of an election. On 3 April the people of Victoria will make their decision. They will make their decision on what has happened. Apart from a period of three years 1972-75 in the national sphere we have seen decades of Liberal leadership. Since 1955 a conservative government has been in control in Victoria. The same conservative Government that has been in power most of that time has allowed this transfer of investment away from Victoria. This transfer has accelerated under the policies of the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give honourable member's some of the positive programs of a Federal Labor Government. Labor would set up an inquiry into the problems and potentials of regions to provide for more detailed regional information collections. We would establish a regional task force to work in co-operation with the States and local government specifically to build on local initiatives of the people in the area. We would locate Commonwealth Government offices in regional centres. We would co-ordinate Federal, State and local government provisions of services with a view to expanding the provision of services in priority regional centres. We would use the Federal Government's powers over foreign investment to achieve a higher degree of technology transfer and industrial research and development suitable for decentralised location and we would change the charter of the Industries Assistance Commission which is at present concerned with eliminating industries. We would instruct the Commission to identify ways of promoting new industries, especially for regional locations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Surely the honourable member for Reid will settle for a former Minister. I was on the question of the tactics of the Australian Labor Party. It is sad to think that it has lost all of its political sense of aggression. I would have thought that the one subject that it would leave alone and not bring into the spotlight would have been a subject which deals with decentralisation. It is one which deals with concern for people who live beyond the boundaries of the great metropolitan cities of this country. I would have thought that the Australian Labor Party would bring to mind the situation that exists in their classic State of New South Wales. I thought it was terribly disturbing to hear a comment made in this House this morning that in some respects New South Wales could be on the verge of bankruptcy. It is a great State, ostensibly led by a leader of great charisma and it is sad that it is on the verge of bankruptcy. If anything contributed to this condition in New South Wales it must be the complete lack of regional development. It is all very well to talk about formal regional development and the setting up of great boards and bureaucracies. But there is another aspect with which I propose to deal and that is the actual contribution made to people who live in not the isolated areas-I will not particularly push the parochial pump in the 15 minutes or so that I have-but those who live beyond the boundaries of the metropolitan areas. I would have thought that of all the subjects the Opposition could have brought up for discussion today, they would have religiously avoided this one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am talking about New South Wales. I suppose in a way it is a blessing to our people-the members of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party in Victoria-that the situation in New South Wales has been exposed. It will act as a very sober warning to those who may have been on the brink of making a decision to support the Labor Party on this occasion. Sometimes voters say to themselves: 'We will give them three years. They cannot do much harm'. But that way of thinking, of course, was totally exposed when the Whitlam Government was in power and this country was brought to its knees. Once the results of what happens in New South Wales are exposed to the people of Victoria, they will affect the election. I am sure they would not take any risk of following the example of a State that has been brought to its knees. If one thing has contributed to that-I repeat it-it has been its complete lack of decentralisation. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) as a sincere man although we totally oppose many of the things he brings forward in this House. He is respected. I think it unfair that the Opposition should have given him the job of presenting a case for a party that is totally condemned for its record of contempt for people who do not live in the great urbanised areas of this country . </PARA>
<PARA> I have so much information here that I do not know where to start. I think one very fundamental group which is associated with regional development in its purer sense is that of the local authorities of this nation, wherever they may be, the semi-governmental bodies such as harbour boards but more particularly the shires and municipalities spread throughout the length and breadth of this country. I think there are something like 939 of them. I take the opportunity of explaining that there is a committee of this House-of which I have had the privilege of chairing for many years-appointed by the local government movement. If I speak on local government, I do so with a little bit of experience and with having had the opportunity of seeing the whole spectrum of local government throughout the length and breadth of this country. It was extremely difficult for many years for local government to get any recognition whatsoever. This Government has contributed in a very fundamental sense in two ways. A very meaningful liaison has been created between local government and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I mention the Prime Minister particularly because he made the decision that local government would be brought into the pre-Budget discussions. I think that these meaningful discussions will be held on 1 May. That will be a very effective liaison. </PARA>
<PARA> A more important point is that if we want to talk about regional development we have to talk about what we are doing for people who live in those regions and about what we contribute to their quality of life-health, education, communication facilities and air services. This is all part of the general picture. We should not talk about the formal creation of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation-a bureaucracy whose achievements were not very impressive. A meaningful liaison has been established now. It is very important to get to the people at the top when a problem exists. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I wish to raise is the matter of Commonwealth grants. The perfect formula has been adopted-Commonwealth grants are allocated through a State instrumentality. In other words, the money comes from the Commonwealth-I wish the States would remember that from time to time-but it is distributed through a State-created body. The Opposition wants to create regional boards. We on this side of the House have a great apprehension about such boards because the Opposition wants yet again to adopt the policy of centralisation. Perhaps it is not attempting to centralise in Melbourne but it is attempting to centralise in Geelong, Ballarat or Bendigo. According to general standards throughout Australia these areas are highly developed areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at one or two other points. I think it is a pretty weak argument to refer to history and say that the Labor Party has a forlorn record but I think memories can sometimes be a bit short. The people who live beyond the metropolitan areas were hammered into the ground during the short period that the Whitlam Government was in power. People who have been governed by State Labor governments have had a much more intimate knowledge of the same sort of experience. I do not want to talk too much about my own State but it is an excellent example of decentralisation. It is interesting to look at a map of New South Wales. Wollongong and Newcastle are really suburbs of Sydney according to our standards of distance. Where else can one find any developed areas in New South Wales? What do we see if we have a look at a map of Queensland? We see a most exciting situation. We see the city of Mt Isa and all that is going on in the north-west. We see the towns of Emerald and Blackwater and the huge developments that are taking place there. One can go to Cairns, Mackay and Bundaberg, which is the city from which you come, Mr Deputy Speaker, up the coast of Queensland. There are exciting developments in each of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I could talk for 15 minutes or 15 hours about each of these regional developments. Regional development is what is projected by the State government itself and, ultimately, with funds that are provided by the Federal Government. As I said earlier, I think it is a weak argument to go back in history but we suffered a great deal over the period 1972 to 1975. First of all, we in Queensland were stripped of our petrol equalisation concessions. We were stripped of air subsidies. I do not know what his motive was but when the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) was the Minister for Social Security he would not receive deputations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He would not receive deputations from my part of the world at any rate because we were considered to be second rate citizens. What about the Isolated Children's Parents Association? In 1974-1975, after a lot of struggling , debate and so on, it managed to get $9,538,000. The contribution by this Government in 1981-82 for isolated children is $16,729,000. Regional development is keeping people in those areas, keeping them reasonably content and giving them just a few crumbs-we are not looking for more than that-off the rich man's table. But during the term of the Labor Government in Queensland and then during the term of the Federal Labor Government I do not think that more than a few miles of bitumen would have been put down anywhere in the west of the State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The introduction of the Menzies beef roads scheme was an example of regional development. One has to be able to get into a region in order to develop it. The great epic contribution to this nation was the beef roads scheme introduced by the Menzies Government. That is an example of regional development. That involved the creation of communication facilities. I could go on and on about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly, last April the Minister for National Development and Energy ( Senator Sir John Carrick) announced that the Federal Government would discontinue its regional development policy because-after all, one cannot argue against this-it felt that it was more properly the responsibility of the States. The States constantly bring before this Government the matter of their sovereign rights and they say: 'Pay, but do not interfere too much'. I refer to road safety which is a very clear and very worrying example of this attitude. The Minister, not only because of the advice, closely examined the situation at Albury-Wodonga and elsewhere-but also because of the record itself, decided to discontinue this bureaucracy. The rate of growth at Albury-Wodonga was 3 per cent and the cost effectiveness was just so out of balance that no responsible government could have continued with that bureaucracy. Certain things were kept in train. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been talking about my State but I wish now to refer to South Australia and to what is known as the iron triangle study. I will give a few details about that. The iron triangle study group was formed in February 1981 as a result of a joint Commonwealth-State initiative. The study group was to investigate the most appropriate long term strategies for development in the central part of South Australia, particularly with respect to the major urban centres of Port Augusta, Port Pirie and Whyalla. The study group presented its report to the Prime Minister and to the Premier of South Australia last March. The major conclusion of the study group with respect to development strategies for the region was:</PARA>
<PARA> The only strategy identified which will result in growth in the economy of the area is the development of resource-based industries both within the Iron Triangle and within the northern region. Flow effects from such developments will impact on the Iron Triangle cities, and commercially viable service and support industries will develop as a result. </PARA>
<PARA>A hard core of resource industry exists. Regrettably, until we see better times this is vitally essential. As I said, I have so much information here that I find it worrying that I cannot deal with it all. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to defence. I suppose that nothing else is of much value if we cannot defend the country and assure its security. For many years great accent has been placed on northern frontier defence and so on. The Minister for Defence (Mr Killen), with the co-operation of his advisers, has brought into existence a force known as Norforce. Norforce is a hard core task force which will defend northern Australia. Again, that is a clear indication of what can happen when a government which thinks along the right lines is in power. I cannot understand the behaviour of members of the Labor Party. The Labor Party once was very eminent for its tactics and its strategy. I am surprised that it has brought up a subject, the arguments about which it cannot possibly win. Its record in this field is lamentable. All it did when in government was to hammer people who lived beyond the metropolitan areas into the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us contrast the situation in two States. Let us look at what can happen when there is a sense of responsibility and an awareness of decentralisation. I contrast the coal industry in New South Wales which is rapidly falling into shambles with what is happening in the exciting developing coal industry in Queensland, particularly in my area of Blackwater and the central highlands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to section 25 of the Australia-Japan Foundation Act 1976, I present the annual report of the Australia-Japan Foundation 1980-81. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a short statement relating to the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The establishment almost six years ago of the Australia-Japan Foundation was an important event in the development of Australia's relations with Japan. It is no less important today. The Government intends to maintain its support for the Foundation's development and activities in the sphere of trade and commerce and in the wider field of broadly-based cultural and personal exchanges. On the occasion of the visit to Australia in January 1980 by the then Prime Minister of Japan, the late Mr Masayoshi Ohira, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced that the Australian Government intended to increase substantially the funds made available to the Foundation. As a result of this increase, during the 12 months covered by this report the Foundation was able to support over 250 projects-more than double the number for the previous year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Foundation, during its five years of operation, has supported a wide range of activities, including many important new initiatives. While the trading and financial links with Japan continue to strengthen, there is still much we do not know about each other's society. Foundation programs emphasising people to people contact and the dissemination of knowledge about one country in the other seek to lower the cultural barriers and give us a better understanding of each other. The attention which has been given to the involvement of ordinary Australians and Japanese through the Foundation's travel grant and media programs has ensured that its focus has not been narrowly academic. Nevertheless , support for scholarship, particulary the development of Australian studies in Japan and Japanese studies in Australia, occupies an important place in the Foundation's overall activities. Other important projects involving people to people contact include support for exchanges of Australian and Japanese youth and sporting exchanges. The AJF Trophy Australia-Japan Golf Match, now an important event in the international golfing calendar, brings Australian and Japanese professional and amateur golfers together in a unique event. Wide television coverage of the event has ensured that it is enjoyed annually by millions of Australians and Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA> The Foundation has sought to keep people in both countries well informed of its activities. It distributes its own newsletter and more than 60 journalists and newspaper executives from Australia and Japan have visited the other country under the Foundation's journalist exchange program. Other major media projects have included the joint production of television documentary programs on both countries and a series of film festivals. Some new areas of Foundation activity include: A major conference of Australian and Japanese sister city representatives to promote community exchanges between sister cities; the establishment of a Press award in Japan to encourage wider and more informed coverage of Australia in the Japanese Press; support for a series of visits by Australian trade union officials to Japan; and, in association with the International Cultural Corporation of Australia, financial assistance towards an Australia-wide exhibition of the Idemitsu collection of Japanese paintings and ceramics. These are only some examples of new areas of contact between Australians and Japanese which the Foundation is developing. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Australia-Japan Foundation are normally appointed for five years and the terms of all the original members of the Foundation, including its first Chairman, Sir Russel Madigan, have now expired. I pay tribute to Sir Russel and the other members for their excellent work during these past five years in establishing the Foundation on a sound basis and in developing such a wide program of activities. I have much pleasure in tabling the fifth annual report of the Australia-Japan Foundation for 1980-81. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -by leave-The Opposition welcomes the statement and joins with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) in expressing our appreciation of the work done by members of the Australia-Japan Foundation. It is an interesting foundation. I think I can use the words of the Executive Director, Professor Hocker, when he said that the purpose of the Foundation is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . to encourage a closer relationship between the peoples of Australia and Japan to further the mutual knowledge and understanding of those peoples . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is important because never before in our relationship has there been a greater need to achieve knowledge and understanding of each other. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said, particularly when talking about money and trade, that one country might need the other country more than that country needs it. For example, it could be said that in money terms we desperately need the Soviet trade because it is on a ratio of five to one in our favour. In that context, it could be said that Australia needs Japan more than Japan needs Australia. The trade figures confirm that. Australian exports to Japan represented 27 per cent of our total exports and were valued at over $5 billion. Our imports were somewhat less: They represented 19 per cent of our total imports and were valued at $3.5 billion. The Foundation is doing very important work because it operates outside the market place and it endeavours to show to the Japanese that Australia is not just a farm with a mine on it; it is a country which produces agricultural goods and minerals. The Foundation seeks to develop personal contacts between Australians and Japanese and to assist with the dissemination of knowledge about each other. </PARA>
<PARA> The Japanese perceptions of Australia were examined recently in two detailed and constructive papers prepared by the Japan secretariat. I might add that it appears that these papers were leaked to the Press as they were featured in the Sydney Morning Herald. Leaks can be useful because we of the Opposition do not have access to the secretariat's work, nor do we have any access to the work of the committees. Perhaps that matter ought to be remedied at some stage. These reports indicate, perhaps of some surprise to Australians, how the Japanese perceive us. The Japanese regard Australians as rich, as having a derivative culture and as being rather racist. As the Japanese perceive countries in a hierarchical order, the West, the United States and the English speaking countries are now at the apex. They have replaced China, which is the source of much of Japan's culture. It is deemed that Australia, by association, is part of this Anglo-American group of capitalists that run the world's economy, though Australia is at the bottom of it. I suppose that part is accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> Our economic success is seen as the result of luck, through the possession of natural resources, and not because of hard work. The Japanese appreciate the fact that we seem to be successful because we are rich. In the past-I am not going to condemn them-they have not shown a great deal of interest in the poor, but they have improved their performance. Net overseas development assistance disbursements increased by 29.6 per cent in the national currency to $3,304m in 1980, equivalent to 0.32 per cent of gross national product. Australia, which must continue to do better, devoted 0.48 per cent of GNP in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that the programs of the Foundation continue to be recognised. I commend those projects which are directed at the youth of both countries. The working holidays scheme which exists between the two countries is excellent. It is worth noting that Australia is the only country with which Japan has such a scheme. I note that there is trade union representative on the board of directors of the Foundation. I note he was lately appointed. I also note that trade union matters have been all but ignored in each of the Foundation's programs. Japan has a very strong and healthy trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of the Foundation's library is to be encouraged and funds should be made available to have as much Australian source material as possible translated into Japanese. We have a library but there is no point in having a wealth of printed material available in Tokyo if it is not printed in Japanese. The work of the Foundation staff in Tokyo and the Australian Information Service at the Australian Embassy in Japan could be analysed to ensure that there is no duplication of effort and that the competence in Japanese of Australian officials doing information work is very high. The AIS, if it does not already do so, could leave inquiries from the Japanese public to the Foundation office while it does the job of supplying the Japanese Government and Japanese business and journalists with information from Australia, written in Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA> We of the Opposition stress the importance of having sufficient high quality printed matter in Japanese. They are sophisticated people who need to be persuaded to take an interest in Australia. The material should reflect the subtle aspects of Japanese cultural interests and be made to appeal to it. I commend all the efforts that the Foundation is making to promote language studies. We must have Australians who are not only competent in their chosen profession but also fluent in Japanese. Having people who are merely linguists ensures only that we have some potential good quality interpreters. Let us remember that interpreting is a difficult art that needs close study and it is not always given full support in Australia. Much good work has been done by the Foundation and much still needs to be done with imagination, money and foresight . </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I suggest that Australia should take some initiatives with Japan in securing peace in South East Asia. I think there is a good chance for Australia to take initiatives with the Japanese, particularly in respect of the difficulties between China and Vietnam and also the Kampuchean problems. I want to see a lessening of the hostilities between the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations and Vietnam. I think our ally, the United States, is somewhat unwise in urging re-armament or taking up a greater share of what is called the defence burden. I have just seen an address given in Canberra by Professor Hideo Hitaki, who makes very much the same point. In talking about the link between government and business in Japan, he made a significant point by referring to the fact that the American Government has begun to urge Japan to accept a larger role in the defence of the West, which has some connotations for Australia as it is on the rim of the Pacific. The analysis in Japan of the proposal for increased defence expenditure was that the Japanese political elites, who do not believe there is any serious Soviet threat , felt that in order to soften American pressure on trade Japan had to increase its defence appropriations. Even though they were sceptical of the interpretation by the United States of the international situation, Japanese political elites were ready to accede to the suggested increased defence role in order to maintain good relations with the United States. This opinion is widely held not only in the ruling party in Japan and in the defence agency but also in the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the business community. It is for that reason, apart from the excellent work that has been done by the Foundation, that we must take further initiatives with Japan. We live in this region together and we want to guarantee peace. I think we can do it by taking initiatives such as those I have in mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed works which were referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of additional training and sleeping accommodation, R.A.A.F. Base, Laverton, Vic. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposal is for new facilities to support an increase of about 17 per cent in the number of staff and students at the Royal Australian Air Force school of radio. The RAAF needs more people skilled in electronics and radio for new equipments being introduced into the service, such as the new tactical fighter. The work will consist of the following elements: Two-storey cluster groups of accommodation units for 208 airmen; a three-storey training building; and associated external works, services and landscaping. </PARA>
<PARA> In reporting favourably, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has also raised two issues on which I believe the House would wish to have an indication of the Government's views. Firstly, the Committee has noted that it was disturbed to hear evidence of a failure rate of 50 per cent at the RAAF radio school among apprentice recruits. I am advised that the current failure rate is now lower than this. Over the past three years, it has been around 36 per cent. I am also advised that recruitment selection criteria are kept under review, and that the school is giving added attention to improvements in training methods, to raise the pass rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Committee has suggested a reconsideration of the recruitment of young women as trade apprentices in the RAAF, having also noted that the basic principle for equal opportunities would appear to be selectively applied and in need of urgent review. I am advised that up to date the policy has been to provide opportunities for women to obtain technical training through the adult technical training scheme, which recruits down to the age of 17 years. The RAAF is further considering its ability to provide a proper domestic environment and training facilities for women apprentices. The estimated cost of the work is $5. 6m at August 1981 prices. If the House agrees to support this motion, planning may proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>

While the aircraft currently being used there are not the original aircraft of Sir Richard Williams's time, when one looks at some of the physical plant around the place one would be forgiven for thinking that they were essentially World War I places.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed works which were referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Upgrading of airport facilities for the introduction of domestic wide-body aircraft at the Adelaide and Hobart airports.</PARA>
<PARA>In the original motion of 27 August 1981, the House referred to the Committee proposed works at six airports. The Committee previously reported on four locations, Coolangatta, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney in report 11 of 1981, recommending the construction of these works at a total estimated cost of $12. 85m at August 1981 prices. Planning and implementation of these works are now in hand. The Committee's current report deals with the proposed work at Adelaide and Hobart and completes the original reference. The works to be provided by the Commonwealth to accommodate the wide-body aircraft at Adelaide and Hobart will include, where necessary: Alteration and expansion of terminal facilities; strengthening and extension of runway, taxiway and apron pavements, and associated engineering works. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommendation 1, the Committee states that there is justification and a need for a further study by a parliamentary committee into the subject of aircraft noise as a matter of urgency. Accordingly, the House of Representatives should refer to the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation the matter of aircraft noise, and that the Standing Committee be requested to inquire into and report on all aspects of aircraft noise within and adjacent to major urban areas. This matter has been referred to the Minister for Transport ( Mr Hunt) for his consideration. Recommendation 2 states that Adelaide Airport will need to operate at its present site until an alternative location can be found, land acquired and new facilities provided. The Committee also recommends that planning for the future airport needs of Adelaide should start now. The Minister for Transport has informed me that the above recommendation is in hand. The South Australian Airfield Committee consisting of representatives of the State and Commonwealth governments is actively pursuing this issue and is expected to report before the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 3 states that projections of aircraft and passenger movements for Adelaide indicate these will increase and that existing facilities at Adelaide Airport are inadequate to meet present and future demand, especially for wide-body aircraft. The Government agrees with this. Recommendation 4 states that, as an interim measure, the proposed extensions and upgrading of pavements and the terminal extensions should proceed as proposed. The Government agrees with this. Recommendation 5 states that there is scope for more rigorous application of noise abatement procedures and that such procedures should be immediately reviewed by the Department of Transport, especially such aspects as the operation of light executive jets and the ground running of turbo-propellor aircraft within curfew hours. This matter has been referred to the Minister for Transport for his consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 6 states that there is a need to upgrade and extend the apron pavement at Hobart to eliminate congestion and to provide for increasing Boeing 727 operations. The Government agrees with this. Recommendation 7 states that on the basis of airline projections for Boeing 727 aircraft at Hobart, the proposed runway and taxiway upgrading is not a proven necessity at this time and that this work should be deferred for at least two years unless pavement distress begins to appear earlier. The Government notes this recommendation. However, the pavement condition will be kept under review, as the effect on the pavement by the aircraft traffic forecast by the airlines will be only marginally less than that forecast by the Department of Transport. This pavement is constructed of material which would be seriously affected were water allowed to enter through deterioration of the bituminous surface. Accordingly, the work will be implemented immediately it is found necessary to protect the pavement from any deterioration. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 8 states that justification for the fillet widening and turning nodes for wide-body operation has not been shown and that this work should not proceed. The Government accepts this recommendation. However, if it is found necessary to undertake the runway and taxiway upgrading, consideration will need to be given to the economic advantage of proceeding with the fillet widening and turning nodes at the same time. In paragraph 9 the Committee recommends that modification of the existing domestic terminal be made for international operations at Hobart Airport rather than providing a separate international terminal building. In regard to this recommendation members will be aware of Ansett's withdrawal from the Hobart to New Zealand route and a reappraisal of what may be necessary at Hobart is in process. A separate international terminal building will not be proceeding pending this reappraisal. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of the work recommended by the Committee is $8.85m at January 1982 prices, being $8m at Adelaide and $0.85m at Hobart. The Government accepts this recommendation. With the exception noted previously, the Committee has recommended construction of the work in the reference. If the House agrees to support this motion, planning may proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It could be said that the report is good in parts. I think that the reason for this view is the degree of public involvement, in particular at the Adelaide hearing on 3 December and again at the hearing that continued in Melbourne. In the submissions that the Committee received, there were documented some 70 or more letters from residents, the vast majority of whom were opposed to the extensions. I think that the Government needs to give a great deal of weight to the views of the residents who have to put up with the inconvenience of an airport. It is also fair to put on record that the residents , in the main, to my knowledge, are not opposed to Adelaide or South Australia having an international airport, although, by their enemies, they are portrayed as holding such views. They are, in fact, trying to ensure that Adelaide is serviced by an international airport, giving due consideration to the people who may have to live in the vicinity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the hearing on 3 December I made a number of submissions and I still hold by those submissions. I want briefly to refer to them. One submission was that the State and Federal governments should declare the site for the new international airport. That has been on the cards for many months now. I am concerned that if we do not get a declaration of where the site is to be before the commencement of building is to take place then we will have a situation whereby the people currently around the airport will be fobbed off. The second main proposition that I put concerned noise proofing. This has been carried out in other countries. I am glad to see that the Committee did not wipe that off but I want to pursue the matter because I do not feel that the answer given today is sufficient to assure me-certainly my constituents, particularly those residents around the airport-that the Government will take this matter seriously. The third matter was that of the curfew. Only those people who live in the vicinity of an airport-I live very close to the Adelaide Airport-understand the problems of having to put up with jets flying in and out inside the curfew hours. That is one of the most harassing things that the residents have had to put up with for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that the report is good in parts. We will have to await the action of the Government flowing from the report to see whether or not the good parts or the bad parts are picked up. I want to make mention of what I suppose could be called a minority report of Senator Foreman, on page 23, entitled 'Senator Foreman's views'. I believe that Senator Foreman has listened to the problems of the residents. In his minority report he states:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) tangible and positive steps must be taken now by the Commonwealth and State Governments for the construction of a new airport for Adelaide;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the present curfew must be maintained and more rigorously enforced;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the operations by small executive jets inside the curfew must cease forthwith; likewise the ground running of turbo-propellor aircraft;</PARA>
<PARA>These are three of the areas that I touched on and about which I made submissions. The last point refers to the problem caused by the ground running of Fokker Friendship aircraft at Adelaide Airport. They run sometimes for two to three hours, starting at 2 o'clock in the morning. Once one is awakened by them, the opportunity to get back to sleep is lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point raised in Senator Foreman's views is that of noise proofing. Whilst he does not take anything away from the recommendations of the Standing Committee that the matter be referred to an inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation, he has stated fairly strongly the view that all schools and hospitals-particularly those in flight paths of the main runway-must have sound proofing treatment where necessary. The question of air conditioning is dealt with likewise. These are things that will come. They will have to come. Certainly they have been tackled in other countries where within certain radii of runways or in particular zones surrounding airports people are reimbursed for soundproofing. The fifth point raised by Senator Foreman is that noise abatement procedures outside the curfew be rigorously enforced and that punitive action be taken against operators who do not comply with the procedures; that is, other than those who break the curfew because of safety or emergency reasons. I commend Senator Foreman's views and feel that he was receptive to the minority of the people of Adelaide-that is, the residents who have to put up with the inconvenience of an airport. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the other minority report, that of Senator Martyr. Perhaps this is where we find the bad parts. I do not find that surprising because I was able to be at the hearing in Adelaide and I felt that Senator Martyr was not responsive to the views of the public and, quite frankly, was rather aggressive. On page 24 of the report, Senator Martyr said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . no hard evidence was adduced to prove psychological or physiological damage or distress of such proportions as to warrant the Joint Committee's recommendation. Nor was there any hard evidence adduced to prove structural or mechanical damage to homes or other buildings. </PARA>
<PARA>For God's sake, I do not know what the man expected. Did he expect the residents to bring in broken windows, doors hanging off their hinges and so on? The transcript shows that a number of residents at that public hearing invited him to their houses at the time flights were taking off. I well recall one old lady referring to the fact that she could do a jig without getting off her seat. When the jets took off the vibration was such that her feet were dancing an Irish jig . I am quite sure that that would be acknowledged by the Chairman of the Committee and those who were at that hearing. I have to discount Senator Martyr' s views because he has shown a clear bias towards the Department of Transport, the technocrats, and has ignored the people who put their views as to what they had seen and experienced. </PARA>
<PARA> The quality of the general recommendations and conclusions of the report is pleasing but, as I said at the beginning, it depends on what the Government does with those recommendations. What will happen to the proposition that there be a parliamentary study as a matter of urgency of the question of noise? Certainly those members of the Public Works Committee at the hearings I attended heard the views of the residents. I hope they will use their influence wherever possible to make sure that the Government accepts the report in full. </PARA>
<PARA> On the general question of airports and the people who have to put up with them , it is important for this Parliament to recognise majorities and minorities. In this case I want to talk about minorities. In any democratic society one has to accept the decisions and wishes of majorities but we cannot in all cases ignore the views of minorities. The people around Adelaide Airport are looking for help and assistance. They are not trying to hold back progress; they want people to understand their problems, to have sympathy and to try to accept some responsibility. They are saying to the public in general and to this Government that if they are to have imposed on them an international airport with increased traffic, more noise and all of the other problems that go with it, the Government should do a number of things to look after their particular problems, including the problem of noise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in its recommendations accepts the need for some inquiry. That recommendation will not have gone far enough if it turns out to be an inquiry looking into things for years. That is the concern I have. But if the views of the minority are to be given due consideration then I think that the majority- that is, the travelling public and the rest of society who benefit from technological advances such as international airports-have to be prepared in part to pay some of the cost to make life a bit more comfortable, a bit more reasonable, for the minority; that is, those people who live around Adelaide Airport. No doubt people who live near airports in other States feel the same.</PARA>
<PARA> Statements have been made by Ministers and the Prime Minister on the upgrading of airports for wide-bodied jets. However, there is no doubt that upgrading will go ahead to cater for international flights. The question of the safety of people who live around airports then arises. Only recently an exercise was conducted at Adelaide Airport in the main by the Department of Transport and various other safety and emergency organisations. I have explained to the House on a previous occasion that that exercise was nothing less than a farce. I described it, I think aptly, as being like a transcript from a Dad's Army television production. If we are to accept the responsibilities for upgrading airports to handle wider-bodied jet international flights we have to start to take safety seriously. The exercise that was held in Adelaide was a joke. I understand that similar exercises are held annually. I believe that the frequency of these exercises has to be upgraded to a point where they are held at least three or four times a year and perhaps more often. I believe that the various emergency services have to be involved, that governments-Federal, State and local-have to be prepared to put in finance to make these services worth while and able to cope with the kinds of disasters we have seen in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw recently the disasters which occurred at Washington, Boston and in Japan . Australia has been extremely lucky in this respect. The flying times of aircraft in Australia are as high as those in other countries. However, the number of accidents is well down in this country. This makes us all the more vulnerable for the accident to happen. I certainly hope that when an accident does happen it will not be in Adelaide. I hope that the people responsible will start to take seriously the question of safety. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the report of the Committee is good in parts. The good parts will come forward if this Government is serious about the issues that have been brought up. These issues concern the minorities-the people who live around the airport. I wish to thank the Chairman of the Committee for his assistance in preparing the report and in the discussions we have had. I also thank him for the assistance he has given me and to the people of Adelaide. I look forward to seeing the people of Adelaide next week when we again deal with the question of upgrading Adelaide Airport to international status. I am sure that the Chairman and the Committee will take seriously the views of the residents which will be put most firmly next week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is pleasing to see the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey) in the House. I have the greatest regard for the honourable member, who is the Chairman of the Public Works Committee. I think he does a very good job as Chairman. However, I am afraid that I disagree with some of the recommendations that have been made in the Committee's report concerning the upgrading of airport facilities for the introduction of domestic wide-bodied aircraft at Hobart Airport. We are supposed to be looking to the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to tell honourable members a little about the geography of Tasmania. Tasmania is an island with a population of 420,000 people. Tasmanian members get rubbished in this place by honourable members on both sides for our pork barrelling, for the way we look for freight equalisation subsidies, subsidies for our apples, et cetera. We are trying to get Tasmania on its feet and one of the important ways in which that can be done is through tourism. Therefore we do not just look at the present situation-we look to the future. The only way we are going to survive is to get people to come to our beautiful island-the most beautiful island in the world. We want people to come and appreciate what we have to offer. The only way in which they can come to Tasmania-travel by the seaways has been mucked up by many things which I could mention-is by air. We are dependent on this form of transport. </PARA>
<PARA> At present Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia Airlines fly into Tasmania. However, we want international flights to come to our State. We do not want flights just from New Zealand. We want international carriers to bring people to our beautiful island. Therefore we have to prepare and make facilities available. I do not want to criticise the Department of Transport or anybody else, but I get sick of other people making decisions for Tasmanians. As I said, we need to be forward looking. When Sir Denham Henty built a beautiful airport and terminal at Launceston everybody said: 'What are they building that for? It will never be used'. It is certainly being used at the moment and it is certainly an example of what forward thinking can be all about. It seems a bit stupid to me--</PARA>

I am not owned by Ansett and TAA. They can do what they like. But I am a politician and like the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) and the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney). I represent people. Therefore we do not have to bend to the will and wish of TAA and Ansett, or the Department of Transport or anybody else. They might say what they want for Hobart, but it does not follow that that is what Hobart wants. Hobart wants a separate international terminal which can be used by people visiting our State. Surely we should not expend $650,000 on renovating or altering the present terminal when it will cost only $950,000 to construct a new terminal. It is common sense to spend a little extra and build a new terminal that can be used by everybody. We do not want to be at the whim or fancy of anybody.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XD4">Mr GOODLUCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We should not be. Everybody who comes into Tasmania would be able to use such a facility. If I could take a little bit of credit-as a rule I do not like taking credit-I said to the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) that it is absolutely imperative that we have a separate terminal. I think that the Government is now going to reappraise the situation and hopefully we can get a new terminal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the whole situation is a bit stupid. I heard a few little tidbits-I am sure the honourable member for Canning would not mind me saying this-concerning Ansett and TAA which at the moment have a monopoly on air services to Hobart although we have a few little airlines. It is true that Ansett has pulled out of the New Zealand run and left the service to TAA. I have heard it said on behalf of one airline: 'Oh, it is impossible to build a new terminal because the only place it can be built is alongside our competitor's terminal'. It is argued that the terminal should not be built because its passengers would suffer a little bit of inconvenience. That is a lot of stupidity when we are comparing a cost of $650,000 with $950,000. I hope that the Government will heed not just my advice but also the advice of most Tasmanians who are looking to the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to be continually criticised for pork barrelling about apples and about freight equalisation. Tasmanians want to be able to stand on their own feet. The rest of Australia wants Tasmania; we want to be independent. We want a terminal which will be used not just by TAA or Ansett but by future Tasmanians including Tasmanians from the north and north west. I notice that the honourable member for Braddon is nodding his head in agreement. On how many occasions have we criticised the way in which roads are constructed? We have seen bulldozers and other equipment moved in to build a road. However, after about three or four miles of road have been built the machinery and men are taken away to somewhere else. Would it not be common sense to think of the future when we are considering the upgrading of runways at Hobart? Would it not be better to do a bit of forward planning? We all know that changes are being made in the airline industry every day. The airlines are even cutting fares around Australia at the moment. TAA has cut fares because it cannot get the passengers to travel on its wide-bodied aircraft. But the airline cannot cut fares into Tasmania because wide-bodied aircraft are not used on that service. The point I want to make is that we have to look to the future; we have to make decisions for the future. We should disregard the Department of Transport and the airlines which are interested only in their own area and start thinking about people. Let us start looking to the future. If we do we might get somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to condemn the report of the Public Works Committee. If the honourable member for Canning does not mind me saying so, the Committee has done a dash good job. It has presented only the facts. However, I would like to quote the following statement from the Committee's report. The Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee regrets that works relating to international facilities at Hobart were not referred to it in conjunction with other works proposed for the Hobart Airport. Failure to include such works in the reference to the Committee has denied the people of Hobart, airline and tourist interests, from publicly commenting on the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>The people of Tasmania are the ones to comment on those proposals, not the Department of Transport, Ansett or TAA. </PARA>

There have never been such real cuts in public works in this country as there have been under this Government, particularly in the last few years. If one takes the period from 1975 until the present, one will see that there has been an enormous cut. One of the major reasons for that is the Government's broad economic policies. One has to recognise that the reason why the Government has cut back government spending on these public works is that it prefers to divert funds to allow the private sector, particularly the resource sector, to develop.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is about time that these men of conscience, these men who support the Government, recognised that the Government 's broad economic policies are responsible for cutbacks in public works programs , the Hobart Airport project being one of them. In every city and every electorate programs have been cut back because of the Government's broad economic policies, because it wants to make room for investment to develop a resource sector which is controlled mostly by external forces. In the meantime, our public works programs have been denuded. It is about time that Government supporters were more constructive, more honest and more committed to Australia as a whole, instead of making parish pump speeches and considering only the survival of their own political skins. We know there are a lot of nervous nellies on the Government's back benches. We know of the division that is going on in the conservative Liberal Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, before this debate was adjourned, I was replying to the honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie) who made the point that the coal industry is in difficulty. It seems to me that the honourable gentleman was probably overstating the case. He went on to give the impression that the extent to which there were difficulties reflected the attitude of the unions. I think there are other factors at work. At this moment the coal mining industry does have some profitability problems but I have very little doubt about the long term prospects of the industry in Australia, and in New South Wales in particular. Last night I mentioned that massive capital expenditure has been undertaken in the New South Wales coal industry over this financial year. In fact, it is double that of the previous year and 600 per cent more than that in 1979-80. I mentioned that employment had increased to such an extent that it is now in excess of the 1952 post-war peak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that the performance of the industry in recent times has been extremely impressive. Exports of New South Wales coal in 1980-81 rose by 8.4 per cent to a record 23.7 million tonnes. That is hardly the performance of an industry in the doldrums. Steaming coal exports rose by 41.5 per cent to 9.4 million tonnes. That runs at variance with the honourable member's contention that the New South Wales coal industry is in difficulty. Coking coal exports fell a little but exports increased overall by 8.4 per cent, as I have mentioned. Power station consumption in New South Wales rose by 4 per cent to 15 million tonnes and steel industry consumption also rose considerably, in all to some 8.7 million tonnes. Overall, the domestic markets in New South Wales accounted for a consumption increase of 5.1 per cent to 24.3 million tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the future prospects for the coal mining industry? I was interested to read in the report of the Department of Trade and Resources called 'Australian Coal Loading Facilities', which has just been received, a paragraph which stated :</PARA>
<PARA> WOCOL, the authoritative World Coal Study, published early in 1980, concluded that coal will have to supply between one half and two-thirds of the additional energy needed by the world during the remainder of the century and that the world trade in steaming coal would have to grow 10-15 times above 1979 levels.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Coal Board report for 1980-81 puts the prospects for New South Wales coal exports in 1981-82 at 27 million tonnes, as against 23 million tonnes for the previous year. The report, which puts New South Wales domestic consumption at 28 million tonnes for 1981-82, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Thus, in the Board's view, total disposals of coal to all markets should increase to about 55.0 million tonnes in 1981-82. . . . this would require a raw coal output for the year of about 65.0 million tonnes. The coal industry has the capacity to produce this amount. </PARA>
<PARA>The Coal Board's long-term prosperity chart, which is contained in the report, shows that by the 1990s exports will quadruple and there will be a trebling of domestic consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> Development is also taking place in the public sector of the coal mining industry where expenditure is as impressive as is the large scale increase in private expenditure. In New South Wales, a great deal of progress is being made in the development of coal loaders. At Port Kembla, for example, in September 1981 the loading facilities had a maximum hourly rate of 2,500 tonnes, but by the end of 1982 it is expected to increase to 5,000 tonnes. Over this 12-month period, the port is being dredged from a depth of 11.6 metres to one of 15 metres. Nominal vessel size has increased from 75,000 tonnes to 110,000 tonnes. As well, the annual capacity of the Port Kembla loader will increase over the same period from 7.5 million tonnes to 15 million tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar situation prevails in Newcastle, especially with the development of the new Kooragang Island facility. Without going into all of the particulars about the increased depth and the maximum hourly rate-impressive though they may be-I summarise the Newcastle situation by saying simply that the annual capacity of the Newcastle loading facilities will be increased from 18 million tonnes to 25 million tonnes in the 12-month period. That is obviously an extremely impressive development in the State of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are knockers. Doubtless I will be followed in this debate by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), a prospect almost too horrible to contemplate. But we have to face the facts of life. He will be a Jonah with regard to the coal mining industry. He will point to current problems in the industry and disregard the mark of confidence demonstrated by the enormous increase in private investment in the coal mining industry which, whilst not providing the most lucrative returns for the current year or even the next financial year, will reap over a period a very lucrative harvest for the entrepreneurs involved. The honourable member should have more confidence and faith and give credit where it is due. I believe it is due to those entrepreneurs and certainly to the Government of New South Wales. It is true that more public money could be expended and that more loading facilities could be provided, but we can also have more than we need at a given point in time. It is important to obtain a rate of expansion and growth which is not inhibiting. We might be dragging the chain a little in the development of our coal loaders, but that has a great deal to do with the adequacy and flow of funds from Commonwealth to State instrumentalities and governments. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the worst things that could happen to the industry at the moment-I acknowledge that it has troubles on the industrial front-is to follow at the Federal level policies which will aggravate the situation. I acknowledge some of the points made by the honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie). His speech was very well informed, if I may say so. He has obviously had the benefit of talks with colliery owners. He drew attention to the incidence of industrial turbulence and the like which are of the very nature of coal mining industries throughout the world; it is the case today and always has been. Doubtless it reflects the element of danger and the bad features involved in this type of employment. It is true that wages are now beginning to reflect the disabilities and adversities which employees in the industry suffer. Employees now have better hours and higher wages, as they should. In recent times industrial disputation has been engaged in to prevent the erosion of living standards which has occurred as a result of this Government's policies and its failure to index wages and taxation. Also, there have been efforts to obtain a prosperity loading which is a justifiable demand on a prosperous industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst thing that can happen now is to disturb the comparative quiet and tranquility that prevails in the industry by introducing aggressive industrial legislation, particularly of the kind that is proposed at present. What an absurd thing it would be if the Government went to the coal mining industry now with its proposal to create company unions. If it really wants to set the industry aflame, bring about disruption and destroy our export potential and the confidence of people who want to purchase coal from Australia, it will in that way aggravate the industrial scene in the coal mining industry. If it wants to contrive a recipe to blow asunder the industry's impressive prospects, tell the coal miners that the company union concept will be introduced. Coal miners in Australia, or anywhere else in the world would never concede to such a ridiculous proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, tell them that compulsory unionism, which has been traditional in the industry in this country, and many others, will not be permitted. The Government should tell them that you intend to invoke in private enterprise-and in the coal mining industry in particular-a private enterprise counterpart of the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) legislation. I would not want to be a coal entrepreneur, an investor, in that situation. However, I would not be surprised if this Government resorted to that course of action. I have the feeling that this Government would even set out to preserve its flagging electoral prospects by creating industrial disputation, by provoking trouble in industries such as the coal mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you have been very tolerant, as is usually your demeanour. The purpose of these Bills is to make alterations to the payments made in respect of long service leave in the coal mining industry and also to make alterations in respect of the coal mining research industry provisions. In that connection and in the very short time I have left I want to raise one matter which concerns the Illawarra area and which especially involves the research program which is financed by one of the Bills being debated at present. The Illawarra area in the vicinity of Port Kembla, as the honourable member for Macarthur knows, has a very great problem in disposing of coal wash refuse. The honourable member for Macarthur, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) and I, have had representations from the Wollongong council for the financing of a large-scale environmental program to deal with this phenomenon. The fact is that whereas up to recent times some 3.7 million tonnes of wash refuse has been generated annually, this is moving up to 14 million tonnes with the new Port Kembla loader facility coming on service. In the second stage of the loader facility it will go to a massive 22 million tonnes of refuse disposal each year. I know that certain programs are financed from the proceeds of this research levy. The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick ) in another place has told me of these things and of the fact that $190,000 has been allocated for a study of colliery waste disposal practices in Australia. This was initiated in 1979. I want to make the point that that is not good enough; it is not a substitute for an effective environmental impact study in regard to this problem. It would be silly to cause all the States to undertake such a study. We should be looking at it from the standpoint of a Commonwealth initiative which would bring benefit to all the coal mining regions in Australia . </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I believe the coal mining industry, while mildly despondent this year, has a great future. When the Opposition comes to government, which is a very likely prospect in the not too distant future, that industry can be assured of every backing and governmental support, especially in respect of the public services that are necessary to aid and abet those private entrepreneurs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to have the opportunity to follow my colleague from the Illawarra region, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), particularly as it gives me the opportunity immediately to nail a bit of the nonsense he has just spoken. When he said that we are dragging the chain on the coal loaders, I presume he was talking about the Australian Labor Party of New South Wales, which has done so little to increase the capacity to export coal in that State. He said that the adequacy of coal loaders has a lot to do with the adequacy of federal funding. The nonsense of that is evidenced from the fact that the private enterprise sector offered to build a coal loader at Botany Bay in New South Wales in 1975. The then Liberal-Country Party State Government accepted that proposition after an environmental impact study. This was cancelled by the new State Labor Government in 1976. We are now in 1982; six years on and there has been no significant increase whatsoever in the capacity to export coal out of New South Wales, although a loader is now under construction at Port Kembla.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that the inadequate level of coal loading facilities out of New South Wales, particularly from Sydney and Port Kembla, is due simply and uncomplicatedly to the refusal of the State Government of New South Wales to allow private enterprise to build a coal loader. It has nothing whatsoever to do with any alleged or imaginary lack of federal funding. It is incredible that the Labor Party has the capacity to rewrite history in this matter, just as it manages to rewrite history on a date relating to early November 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> I am intrigued too that the honourable member for Hughes suggests there are only short term problems in the coal industry and that the evidence of investment and increasing employment shows that people still have immense faith in the future even though they are losing their shirts today. I think what he has to recognise is that the level of investment that has gone on certainly will enable some very efficient and modern mines to survive this present problem, but that there is an inevitability of closures of coal mines, particularly underground coal mines and particularly those in my electorate as well as in the electorates of the honourable member for Hughes and the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West). There is an inevitability of closures if the present situation persists. That present situation is being severely worsened by the anti-coal mining policies of the New South Wales State Labor Government, not simply in relation to coal loaders but also in respect of the secret tax that that Government imposed on the industry through enormous rises in rail freights along with, of course, the requirement that all coal should travel by rail, rather than by the far cheaper method of road transport. This system is to be introduced later this year when the new Port Kembla coal loader begins operating . It will add enormously to the costs of production of coal mines that are already suffering huge losses. There will be an inevitability of closures of coal mines and a loss of jobs if this takes place. </PARA>
<PARA> The relevance of these facts to this Excise Tariff (Coal) Amendment Bill is clear-cut because this Bill requires the industry to pay an excise in order to do various things, including, of course, some coal research. The capacity of the industry to keep meeting charges of this nature is being severely limited by its unfortunate financial experience right now. I must say I acknowledge the point made by the honourable member for Hughes that the speech made by the honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie) was very well researched indeed and was full of some very significant facts. One of those facts was that 11 million tonnes of coal that should be exported from New South Wales in the coming financial year will no longer be exported because of a lack of capacity to load the coal and because of continual industrial disruption, particularly at the port level. The fact that this 11 million tonnes of coal will not be exported will have an enourmous impact on the coal industry. For example-perhaps the Labor Party should think about this a little more-there is about one employee for every 2, 000-odd tonnes of coal that is mined. If 11 million tonnes of coal is done away with, well over 5,000 existing or potential jobs in the coal mining industry will be done away with. </PARA>
<PARA> In my area I am looking already at a situation in which substantial reductions have occurred in the number of people employed in the coal industry because of the Wran Government's anti-coal policies in that region. The thought of 5,500 jobs not simply at risk but inevitably lost or else not fulfilled-the jobs will simply not turn up as they should in view of the enormous investment in new mines that has been going on-is something that is incredible at a time when the industry, according to the honourable member for Hughes, faces a great future and is going through only a temporary downturn. The problems that will face the industry from losing that kind of skilled labour are serious enough, but even more serious is the fact that once an underground coal mine is closed down it is virtually impossible to go back into it. It means that the coal is lost not simply to the company but also to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a few other points about the burden imposed on coal companies which does, as I said, limit their capacity to meet other excise levels such as those contained in this Bill. For example, the New South Wales State Government's decision to nationalise or socialise-whatever else honourable members want to call it; perhaps an appropriate word is thieve-the rights of owners of land who have coal rights attached to that ownership of the land, without compensation, is one of the most incredible bits of socialist activity that this State Government of New South Wales has been guilty of. Of course, it is in the same pattern as taking away the quotas of dairymen in my electorate without offering any compensation-quotas for which in many cases they paid very dearly. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case I refer to the rights to coal beneath the surface of people's freehold property which did obtain in some areas and where this title had in many instances been acquired at great expense. For example, many of the coal mines had purchased property in their areas in order to acquire the rights to the coal. I know of one company which is seriously involved. About 40 per cent of its reserves are on freehold land that that company had purchased. Those rights are now to be taken away without compensation by the New South Wales State Government. Another company had about 30 per cent of its coal reserves in freehold land with these particular kinds of rights. These lands have simply been expropriated. I think the people of Australia do not realise that a Labor government, even with a smiling pleasant face and even with a respectable appearance--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Werriwa says that is closet socialism. I agree with him and I wish he would come out of the closet. The problem is that even when we have what appears to be a reasonable State Labor government we will find this kind of socialist acquisition of people's property with no compensation. This adds about $1.70 per tonne to the cost of saleable coal for those companies whose rights have been expropriated by the New South Wales Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, there are other charges that the industry has to face such as the secret tax through rail freights-I have raised this in this House on previous occasions-and industrial disruption. I am intrigued by the comment of the honourable member for Hughes that it would be a disgrace if this Federal Government brought about industrial disruption which was stimulated-I think that is the word he used-in order to achieve some political objective because of the impact this would have on the coal mining industry. If by that he means that it would be disgraceful for the Federal Government to resist excessive wage demands then I am afraid I cannot agree with him. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the honourable member for Hughes recommended that the Federal Government should adopt the same principle that led the State Government in New South Wales into absolute chaos. It always gives way immediately it comes under any kind of wage pressure from its unions. In the electricity power generating area, for example, the New South Wales State Government allegedly came to a deal with the unions which brought the unions increased wages and reduced hours. There was a guarantee from the State Government that there would be no increase in the price of electricity and that there would be industrial peace. Of course, the consequence of that was that we got half the package. We got that part of the package which brought increased wages. We got that part of the package which brought reduced hours to the workers but we did not get that part of the package which got rid of industrial disruption and we did not get that part of the package which guaranteed us no increased costs in electricity because of higher productivity. I guarantee to the honourable member for Hughes that the Federal Government will not adopt those crazy, ratbag policies of the State Labor Government. It gave ground on every occasion in matters of this kind and it has simply led us into more disastrous disruption. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to stress one other massive cost that is hitting the industry. I refer to the cost of financing the enormous stocks of coal at grass because of a mixture of the inadequacy of the coal loader system of New South Wales under the State Government, following its rejection of the private enterprise proposal to have a coal loader at Botany Bay which by now would have been working for many years and, of course, the excessive level of industrial disputation, particularly by workers at those instrumentalities that are run by the State Labor Government of New South Wales. The Maritime Services Board of New South Wales would, without doubt, be the most incompetent employer in Australia and would certainly have one of the worst industrial records. One has only to look at the queue of ships outside Newcastle and Port Kembla to see the mute testimony to the incompetence of the Maritime Services Board in terms of its industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the cost of keeping the mines open and storing the coal at grass because about 12 million tonnes of New South Wales coal is stockpiled at grass at the moment mainly because it has not been possible to export it. In passing, I add that because of these huge queues of ships the coal proprietors of New South Wales have cancelled the total shipments for the month after next. There is no chance of getting those ships into the ports. The current situation is that the ships being loaded now have been waiting for up to four and a half months. The coal proprietors have a simple choice: Do they get rid of their employees or do they keep producing and put the coal at grass? They have endeavoured to do the right thing-to keep the mines operating and to keep the men at work. That is why they have 12 million tonnes of coal at grass. The average value of that coal is at least $40 a tonne. The total value of this coal which is lying at grass is about $500m. The interest cost of this money that should have been received by the proprietors, the coal mining companies, is about $100m a year. That is how much money is being wasted; effectively, $100m is not being earned. A large amount of interest is being paid by the coal companies because they are having to finance their stocks at grass. </PARA>
<PARA> Added to that is the enormous cost of demurrage. It costs $10,000 to $15,000 a day to have those coal ships lying off Newcastle and Port Kembla. In many instances we find that the demurrage paid is worth more than the cargo that the ship eventually takes away. These are costs not only to the coal industry but also to the Australian nation. They are the costs of disruption and the costs of ratbaggery in sections of the union movement. I do not refer to the whole union movement because there are some responsible sections of the union movement. For example, the Transport Workers Union sought quite properly and sensibly along with the coal miners at the South Coast to take over the operations of the old Port Kembla coal loader. I commend those two unions because they know how important it is to keep exporting coal. Honourable members should realise the enormous cost to the people of Australia of this kind of disruption and this kind of anti-coal policy adopted by the New South Wales State Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like briefly now to deal with the specific problems raised by the Excise Tariff (Coal) Amendment Bill. The amount of money to be raised by this Bill is relatively small. Basically, it is part of a package of measures designed to give effect to the Government's decision to increase the amount of revenue raised to ensure adequate funding of the coal mining industry long service leave fund in the coming financial year. The excise revenue obtained from black coal currently is apportioned on the basis of two-thirds-that is, 10c a tonne-to the coal mining industry long service leave trust fund, and a one- third allocation-that is 5c a tonne-to the coal research account. It is proposed to increase the amount going to the superannuation fund to 20c a tonne. There is also a proposal-negotiations are in fact being conducted to this end with the New South Wales, Tasmanian and Western Australian governments-to withdraw the Commonwealth from involvement in the funding of the long service leave situation as recommended by the Review of Commonwealth Functions. The reason for this is very simple. The long service leave fund was set up in 1949 to finance long service leave in the industry on a national basis from this excise duty paid by the producers of black coal. Claims made on the fund by employers for reimbursement of the cost of long service leave granted to their employees made on the fund by employers, of course, offset the excise that was raised by the Commonwealth. The reason for suggesting the termination of Commonwealth involvement in this long service leave trust fund was that basically the industry in effect was paying the money for its workers' superannuation fund. This is obviously a private sector responsibility and it is an accepted condition of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are precedents in Victoria and South Australia for coal industry administration of long service leave arrangements. There is no doubt that in many people's eyes improvements in labour conditions since the Act was introduced in 1949 have made the continued involvement of the Commonwealth unnecessary. For example, in 1976 the Bland Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee considered that the Commonwealth could withdraw. The task group on Government regulation of industry was of the opinion that there should be a review of the appropriateness of continued Commonwealth involvement. The Lynch Committee took the view that it should be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> They are all sensible arguments for the Government getting out of this area which is properly that of private enterprise. However, I make one comment of a cautionary nature: As the payment is presently arranged on a tonnage basis the more efficient open cut mines, which produce more coal per employee than the more expensive underground mines, are in effect subsidising many of the underground mines in New South Wales, particularly in my electorate. In other words, many Queensland open cut coal mines are subsidising New South Wales underground coal mines. I regret to say that I find that an attractive proposition, representing as I do an area that has underground coal mines. I think also that it does have some significance-I concede it is only marginal-in ensuring that we do not simply allow our easily won coal to be mined to the major disadvantage of our coal which is more expensive to mine. So one little disadvantage can emerge from this proposal which is now being discussed with the State government's. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I think the Opposition and the nation must recognise that the coal industry's growth prospects for the next few years have deteriorated seriously as a result of the international economic recession and the resultant continuing oil glut. The coal industry cannot afford to be belted around the ears by governments, particularly State governments but also Federal governments. I think it important that State and Federal governments combine to get their houses in order so that they do not keep competing for the coal industry's funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills before us, the Excise Tariff (Coal) Amendment Bill and the Coal Industry Legislation Amendment Bill, determine that the amount paid into the coal research account will remain at 5c, but that the amount paid into the long service leave fund will double from 10c to 20c to ensure adequate funding for the remainder of the 1981-82 financial year and for the 1982-83 financial year. Having defined the legislation before us, I now direct my remarks to the vacuousness of the arguments that have come forward from Government speakers. We hear them month after month, year after year. I refer to the arguments of the honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie), the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) and the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), who has just resumed his seat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government must recognise that the coal industry is a major industry in this country. It is a major source of international revenue. Yet, speech after speech, week after week, from the Government side we hear-and I can describe it in no other words-claptrap, point scoring, whinging, 'blame the State governments', 'blame the trade unions', 'blame the delays in the transport services', 'the transport charges are too high'. But most of the unions involved in the movement of coal through the ports of this country are Federal unions. The trade they are involved in is an international trade, a national responsibility. Nevertheless, after 30 years of conservative government the only solution Government members can come up with is to point score. Therein lies the tragedy of this Government. It does not have any positive attitudes. It does not have any solutions. It does not have any proposals to help this industry-it is a major industry-which is facing severe competition on the world scene. </PARA>
<PARA> One would expect that if the honourable members to whom I referred and if the Ministers who are responsible for the coal trade-the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony)-had any sense of responsibility for their portfolios, they would be taking action. I defy any member of the Government to show me one constructive proposal that has come forward from any Fraser Administration to assist or improve the coal trade or to expedite the movement of coal through our ports. Not one proposal has come from the Fraser Government. That is because it is bereft of ideas. Its members are more concerned about fighting amongst themselves on the matters of who might be the Prime Minister, who might be a Minister and who will get kicked out. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get back to considering this very important industry and the remarks of the honourable member for Macarthur. The honourable member for Macarthur is still harping about the Botany Bay coal loader. It might be news to him that the New South Wales Liberal-Country Party Government did absolutely nothing for the coal industry of New South Wales in its 10 or 11 years in office. Last week the honourable member said that it was essential to keep the existing coal loader open to trucks. Yet the truckers and the coal committee from his own electorate have said that after months of talks they have agreed that truck transport should be only to the top of the Illawarra escarpment. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macarthur ignores the fact that it is the Wran Government that is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on coal loading facilities, on upgrading rail lines, on the purchase of locomotives-150 new locomotives at $1m each. That is the expenditure for one item alone. The Wran Government is spending that money to facilitate the trade, to improve the throughput of coal at our ports. But what do we get from this Government? We get point-scoring, name-calling, rat-baggery and a total absence of any positive proposal or suggestion to improve our standing in the international market-place for coal. The honourable member talks gloom, he acts in gloom, he lives in gloom and he spreads gloom around his electorate. He was not prepared to come into this House and play a positive role by defending the lack of action from his Government and Ministry. He preferred instead to spend 18 of his 20 minutes caning the Labor governments and the Australian Labor Party and two minutes on the substance of the Bill. So much for the honourable member for Macarthur. So much for the policies of this Government-it does not have any policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the tragedy the coal industry is facing. The coal industry, the movement of coal, the competitiveness of coal, are complex issues. The honourable member for Paterson comes from my region, the Hunter region. He also has yet to make one positive suggestion to improve the situation. In that region most of the unions involved in the movement of coal to the port, through the port onto the ships and away, are Federal unions. The number of unions increases the potential for friction. On the other hand, the number of bodies involved in the production, marketing, sale, chartering of vessels and loading further complicate the picture. There is no on-going mechanism anywhere in Australia, at any of the coal ports, that is designed to bring together all of these parties, to create an awareness within each of these parties of the complex nature of the industry, of the ramifications of delays or disruptions to shipping schedules. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, from those who are involved in the industry there is no acknowledgement of what these things mean to people working in the industry or the risks they take working under the ground. It is a job I would not take on for any money. Because of the risks those people take, they think they are entitled to certain rewards. When people are working underground in a dangerous industry such as the coal industry, in which the death rate has increased with mechanisation and the removal of pillars, and when the owners, the corporations that control those mines, in earlier years revealed massive profits, is it not reasonable to expect the people in this industry to say 'We participate in production, aren't we entitled to a fairer share'?</PARA>
<PARA> All of those problems could be brought together if there were a co-ordinating mechanism. It should be originating with the Federal Government, through the Ministers who are responsible for international trade, foreign affairs and international transport, but there is a vacuum. The best they can produce is the throw-away line of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) a few weeks ago in the Lowe by-election when he referred in a rather arrogant and demeaning way to the ships waiting off Newcastle as Wran's navy. Even then he exposed his almost total lack of knowledge of this subject as he could not even get the number of ships right. The best he could do was say that there were 57 ships off the port. There have never been more than 45 vessels waiting off Newcastle. </PARA>

That kind of vacuous, innane comment comes from the responsible Ministers who ought to be taking a positive stance. They are point scoring. It is petty, party political point scoring. The taxpayers just brought the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs back from four weeks abroad. He spent three days at a conference on youth affairs but it took him four weeks to get there and back. Heaven knows how much it cost the taxpayers. That is the kind of comment that we get from the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A whole range of reasons lead to delays in shipping. Firstly, given a normal situation without any disruption of supply of product to the port, given a normal situation in which everything is running smoothly and there is no disruption or delay on the part of the producers or shippers or in the arrivals of vessels, there will be a minimum of 15 vessels off Newcastle for the foreseeable future. That comes about through the nature of the global shipping industry and the positioning of vessels. Vessels take their place under the coal loaders in order of their arrival off the port. So let us try first to understand what the industry is about and how it functions. Then let us try for once as a nation, despite the obstruction of honourable members opposite, to find a solution. To have 15 vessels waiting off the port is normal; to have over 15 is abnormal and disrupts shipment schedules, causing difficulties for the purchasers at the other end, that is, at the receiving ports. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the number of unions and parties involved, how do we find a way of minimising disruptions and delays? I have taken up with the Prime Minister this matter of the delays of vessels. In July last year I wrote to the Prime Minister about the unique position off Newcastle, Port Kembla and Port Hedland. Most of the vessels there are in international waters and there is no way we can control their movements. I asked him to take up the whole subject with the governments of the countries of origin of those vessels. The answer that came back from the Prime Minister was to refer it to the Minister for Transport. The answer that came back from the Minister for Transport was that he saw it as a waste of resources to spend time on such an issue. So nothing came from that. </PARA>
<PARA> The only approach that we have put forward in the absence of any other initiative from the government has been the creation of port co-ordination committees. Those committees could have representatives of the coal producers, the shippers, the relevant unions involved, the port authorities, local government authority and, in the case of Newcastle, the fishing industry because that industry has been disrupted by refuse from the vessels, by the number of vessels and by ships swinging on their anchor chains because of weather changes. That is not, I suggest, an optimal solution but it is a proposal that is put forward in the absence of anything from government. It is a proposal put forward because the Federal Government ought to be involved. I understand that the Minister for Transport is prepared to participate-nobody else on the Government side has said anything-as are the State Government, the Port of Newcastle, the Maritime Services Board and each of the unions involved. We should try to get a better understanding, as I mentioned earlier, of the factors involved so that we can minimise the disruptions. There will always be some kinds of industrial disruptions but if there is an understanding of the impact of those disruptions we will have a chance of minimising them. </PARA>
<PARA> On an issue like this we could head in the direction of fostering industry unions to reduce the number of unions involved. There is a willingness on the part of the unions concerned to do that. I believe that also will help to solve the problem and reduce interruptions and delays. But let me come back to this point because there are two factors involved. One is that delays for vessels outside ports are not unique to Newcastle or Port Kembla. Also at Newcastle particularly there are special human problems involved with the crews of the vessels, which again is a matter on which this Government has refused to act. I have written to the Government asking for a streamlining of the quarantine procedures, but there has been no action; only talk. In the meantime, there has been point scoring. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite honourable members to look at the position in ports around the world, particularly in the Indian Ocean, such as Calcutta, Madras, Durban, Colombo, Rangoon and Chittagong. All those ports, which are within Australia's breadth, have considerable delays in ships waiting to get in to the facilities. I can give a better example. I refer to the leading coal port in the United States, Hampton Roads on the east coast. On a fine day when the sun is warm and the breeze is light one is likely to find 100 vessels there. On odd occasions one can find 150. That is due to similiar problems-the positioning of vessels, vessels looking for spot cargoes and the incapacities of coal loading facilities . I have heard honourable members opposite say that we are wrecking the coal market by having these delays. We on this side of the House want to minimise delays. But we want positive action, co-operation and leadership from the Federal Government, whose prime responsibility it is. Let me quote from the American magazine Fortune of 14 December last a report of a statement attributed to Mary Ann Heider, Manager of the bulk department of Anders Williams and Company in the Port of Hampton Roads. She recalls the reaction of a group of visiting foreign customers during the worst delays. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'They did some heavy threatening,' she remembers. 'They screamed and screamed and screamed.' Their message: 'We've either got to come to some arrangement or we'll go elsewhere.'</PARA>
<PARA>I have heard those words over and over again from the incompetents opposite, from those who prefer to point score rather than to put forward positive proposals for this problem. All we have is a Federal Government without responsibility, without leadership, without any sense of direction on this very important trade matter. We have an industry that is complex, that is fragmented, and that competes abroad fragmented. Its members sell as individuals or small groups to one customer or to buyers operating as a unit. In the words of the late Rex Connor, there are occasions on which one can only draw the conclusion that some of our coal traders abroad behave like hillbillies in the market in which they are dealing with their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude on this note: The ball is in the Government's court. We do not want point scoring. We want an improvement to the coal trade. If, as the honourable member for Macarthur suggests, the coal companies should be subsidised, the cost of transporting coal to the ports should be reduced, let this Government provide the subsidies as it is doing with the airlines. If he expects the public of Australia to pay for health care under the good old user- pays principle, I think it is reasonable to expect profit-making major corporations also to be treated on the user-pays principle. I conclude on this important issue by saying let us for once have some positive leadership from the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am being told by my Whip to sit down but I was very concerned to hear some of the statements that were made by the honourable member for Shortland insofar as the Newcastle coal industry is concerned. The allegations he made about the Federal Government are not correct. We have a wonderful opportunity within Australia to produce more coal for an expanding industry in different parts of the world, particularly our steaming coal. I am very concerned about what the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) said because, in the Gloucester area within my electorate, there is potential for tremendous development of steaming coal. It is essential that that coal be allowed to go out of the ports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the honourable member for Shortland has said about the ships off the ports is that it is the fault of the Commonwealth. Many of the unions concerned are in the hands of the State. The people of Newcastle and of the Hunter Valley see that their area is being severely disadvantaged because of the actions of unions in the area. I go so far as to say that, in the electorate of the honourable member for Shortland and in the southern end of my electorate and in other electorates within the Newcastle area, there is grave concern about the militant action, unnecessary action and unfair action that is being adopted by the unions that the honourable member and his party represent in this House. I do not want to see the Commonwealth blamed for this. All that we want to see is a little common sense on the part of the unions in relation to the winning and the transportation of our coal, and the letting of our ships into the harbour and the letting out of those ships in a reasonable time. We know that some of the ships have to queue up. That is so. But there is unnecessary queuing up. I fly across the harbour twice a week. There are 30, 40 or 50 boats there. </PARA>
<PARA> The companies which own the boats and the exporters to whom we are selling are getting very concerned about this problem. If honourable members want to know anything more about the matter, they should ask the Mitsubishi organisation and other companies that are buying our coal. Those companies will find substitutes if we are not in a position to supply the natural resources, the goods. We do not want that to happen. If it happens, the honourable member for Shortland, who protects the unions by statements in his local newspaper and in this Parliament, will be the guilty man. He and others with whom he abides support the unions in the Hunter Valley area whose actions are killing the district which is an area with wonderful opportunities. It will never achieve them whilst it has a representative who says the type of things that he says here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill will amend the Aboriginal Land Rights ( Northern Territory) Act to accomplish six different objectives. Clauses 4, 5 and 6 provide amendments to allow five land trusts to be set up to hold separate titles to land within the Hermannsburg lease, also to reduce the numbers of members required on a lands trust and to remove the necessity of having a chairman of a lands trust. Clauses 8 to 11 will enable Cliff Island to be included within the Tiwi Lands Trust area and the consolidation of titles of Bathurst and Melville Islands under the Tiwi Trust. I understand that the Minister will be given discretion by clause 9 to transfer funds from Aboriginal benefit trust accounts to Consolidated Revenue to repay previous advances to land councils for administrative expenses because of a shortfall of royalties. Clause 10 simply provides for the payment of legal costs in closures of seas hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 7 is included, I understand, ostensibly to remove doubts about the ability of the Minister progressively to grant land recommended to an Aboriginal land trust and also allow the Minister to establish a different number of land trusts than that recommended by the Aboriginal Land Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. We certainly do not wish to oppose the granting of leases to the Aboriginal people, particularly to the people at Hermannsburg. However, although we are not opposing the Bill, we have some reservations regarding the true reason for the Government and the Minister including clause 7, that is, as I have just said, the clause which will allow the Minister to grant lands recommended by the Commissioner on a progressive or step-by-step basis. The Minister says that he must have this power to allow an early transfer of title to the relevant land trust without waiting for a High Court decision regarding eight small parcels of land which are currently subject to a challenge by Peko-Wallsend Ltd in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> To establish my doubts about the purpose of this provision, I quote briefly on this aspect from the speech in the Senate of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of clause 7 will be to allow me to grant any land in stages. That could apply to the Alligator Rivers region as it could to any other region. </PARA>
<PARA>Then Senator Peter Baume said:</PARA>
<PARA>within the Alligator Rivers area there are eight small parcels of land in the area recommended for grant by the Lands Commissioner, each of which is held up at the moment because of concerns that we have over the Finniss River Appeal which is before the High Court of Australia. The matters being appealed in the Finniss River case are matters which are relevant to these eight small pieces of land. </PARA>
<PARA>Then the Minister added:</PARA>
<PARA> Those eight pieces contain land which may be of great importance to traditional Aboriginal owners because they include areas which are controlled by Peko- Wallsend Ltd which may contain mineral wealth and which Aboriginals want to become Aboriginal land in due course so that negotiations could take place in the usual way for mining to proceed on them. If the Senate or the Parliament chose not to pass this amendment, the only losers could be the traditional Aboriginal people; the only winners could be the people who hold the pieces of land-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Peko-Wallsend. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, there the Minister is saying that, if this amendment is not passed to allow the land grants to be made on a step by step basis, the Aboriginal title to those eight small parcels of land would be at risk. If he grants the major portion, including Jabiluka, there is a barrier, he says, to eventually granting these eight areas at later date. But the important thing is that he is inferring, in his second reading speech and the Committee stage in the other place, that only two grants will be made, one large grant and one small grant. But I understand that there is now a strong probability, due to the Government's desire to push uranium mining at Jabiluka-that is the huge Pancontinental Mining Ltd mine in the heart of the sensitive wetlands area-that the small uranium mining area may be granted to the Aboriginal people first, to allow mining to proceed, with the rest of their land to be transferred much later. That is because, I understand, there is some difficulty about surveying the land, on the ground, from Commissioner Toohey's map. It will be easy to survey Jabiluka quickly but it will take a much longer time to survey the whole of the area that Commissioner Toohey recommended be passed on to the Aboriginal land trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable members to examine the process by which Aboriginal land is granted to traditional owners and is held in trust by Aboriginal land trusts; to examine how land councils are set up to negotiate for traditional owners and how land trusts are supposed to lease land granted to them to the National Parks and Wildlife Service for national parks and conservation areas; and, finally, to examine how traditional Aboriginal owners have a right to veto over uranium mining, or indeed any mining, if they wish to exercise a veto. The Commissioner recommends to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and area of land claim that should be granted to the traditional Aboriginal owners. This is covered by section 11 (1) (A) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. If the Minister agrees he then establishes a land trust and recommends a grant of land, or part of the land claimed, to an Aboriginal land trust set up under the relevant section of the Act. That Aboriginal land trust is then obligated under the relevant sections of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and the Australian National Parks and Wild Life Conservation Act to grant a lease of Aboriginal land, or any part of the land, as the Director of Parks and Wildlife specifies for declaration as a national park or conservation area. This is the way that stage 1 of the Kakadu National Park was handled. </PARA>
<PARA> So clearly if this matter was not complicated by this Government's manic desire to expedite uranium mining-in this case at Jabiluka-the procedure would be thus: The Minister grants the latest recommendation from Commissioner Toohey to the traditional owners through an Aboriginal land trust and then leases the land to the National Parks and Wildlife Service for stage 2 of Kakadu National Park. No doubt at that point the Government would instruct the Director to excise the Jabiluka area from the park, as it has already excised Koongarra and Ranger, to allow uranium mining to proceed. But now we are giving power to the Minister to grant Commissioner Toohey's recommendations via not one but any number of grants . That is fine if the Government's only motive is to grant one large parcel of land followed later by the eight parcels in question which are under the jurisdiction of the High Court. But it is not as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the House that the Government has some secondary and more devious motives in mind. Two highly contentious actions could occur because, as I have said, the surveying of all this land in question is not completed. The surveying of the Jabiluka enclave could be completed well in advance of the survey of the total area. The Minister is now considering-he did not say anything about this in the Senate-first granting only the Jabiluka area to the Aboriginal land trust that will be set up to make it possible for an early start to mining at Jabiluka . Of course that will be after an agreement is pushed through with Pancontinental by the Northern Land Council and if it is agreed to by the traditional owners. The Minister could then follow later with the rest of the grant when the surveys are finished and, later on again, perhaps buy the eight small parcels of land involved in the Peko-Wallsend High Court case. </PARA>
<PARA> It is further likely, though, that even now Stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park will not be declared because the National Parks and Wildlife Service seems to have been pushed completely from the picture. I understand that Stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park will be declared at some later date after all the land has been surveyed and handed over to the Aboriginal land trusts. At a still later date, the rest of the original area for Stage 2 of this beautiful proposed national park will be declared a conservation zone only, to allow minerals exploration at the behest of the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it not entirely fortuitous for the Government that via this seemingly innocuous piece of legislation it says it can expedite the title transfer to the Aboriginals without waiting for a High Court decision on eight small parcels of land. At the same time it is very fortuitous for them that this Bill will allow an early start on the Jabiluka uranium mining project by cynically surveying that tiny piece of land first and then giving it to the trust to allow the Northern Land Council to negotiate the deal with Pancontinental and the Getty oil company. That explains the conditional approval last week by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) for the Jabiluka partners to seek sales contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> This also will deliberately extend three great pressures on the traditional owners. The first pressure comes from the ministerial announcement to which I have just referred, the second from the inference that if the traditional owners do not agree to the agreement worked out by the Northern Land Council there might be some delay in the transfer of the title for the majority of their land, and the third and final pressure is that the Northern Land Council has already, on 27 February last, initialled an agreement with the uranium mining partners. What pressure is being placed upon these traditional Aboriginal owners by those three actions?</PARA>
<PARA> We in the Federal Australian Labor Party will not oppose the Bill because our motives could surely be misconstrued as being obstructive of Aboriginal land rights. Of course we are the instigators of Aboriginal land rights and we would never be obstructive of those land rights. We wish to see the Aboriginals get their land. We have a strong and enduring commitment to land rights but we are awake to the Minister's real motives and reasons for pushing this Bill through the Senate-in one day last week and now lifting it up the order of business today and whacking it through this afternoon as quickly as possible. This action is not to see that the Aboriginals get their land-they have waited 200 years for that-but to see that Pancontinental gets approval to go ahead with the Jabiluka mining lease as soon as possible. Make no mistake, this Bill is designed to expedite the Jabiluka project, the largest of all the uranium mines, just as much as it is designed to transfer title of Aboriginal land. If the Minister gets title to Jabiluka only he is exacerbating the heavy pressure that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources has already placed upon these traditional bush people. I quote what the Minister for Trade and Resources said last week after a rushed trip to Darwin. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have today given conditional approval under the Government's uranium export policy for the development of the Jabiluka uranium deposits in the Northern Territory. This means that I will be able to authorise the project partners to enter the market place to commence negotiations for the sale of product from Jabiluka. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say that that was conditional on agreement by the traditional owners, but he knew full well that his signing of this initial agreement to allow them to go ahead and seek conditional contracts would put pressure on these people to go along with it. There is a panic element in the whole Jabiluka exercise, anyway. That is the point. Now we come to the bitter heart of it. I quote the Northern Territory Minister for Mines, Mr Tuxworth. Some little time ago, when questioned about the viability of the uranium mining industry in the Territory, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our view is that if we haven't sold our uranium by contract by 1985, we won't be selling any more 'till the year 2000, or of that order. </PARA>
<PARA> Our assessment is that if these two (Pancontinental and Denison)-</PARA>
<PARA>The Jabiluka and Koongarra crowd-</PARA>
<PARA>haven't sold their cake-</PARA>
<PARA>I like his use of the term 'cake'-</PARA>
<PARA>and are off and running by 1985, they aren't going to go. </PARA>
<PARA>When asked by the interviewer from the Australian Financial Review whether, in view of the falling uranium market, it would not be wiser to hold off development, Mr Tuxworth said:</PARA>
<PARA>Do you want half of something or all of nothing? I'll take half of something every time. </PARA>
<PARA>This is why this Bill is being rushed through: Jabiluka needs to be quickly handed over to the Aboriginal land trusts so they can be pressured by this Government, by the Northern Territory Government, by Pancontinental, and by the Northern Land Council too, into signing an agreement to proceed at Jabiluka. This mine should not proceed at all. Leaving aside the Aboriginal land rights argument, it is not a goer. It will compound over production of Australian uranium as world demand is declining. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pity he did not understand the exigencies of the world uranium market a little better. If he did he might be saving some of his investors a little money. Australia seems to be the only country in the world taking a bullish attitude to uranium mining. The Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Jabiluka is a world ranking deposit with total estimated reserves in excess of 200,000 tonnes of uranium oxide. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that the Government expected to sell at least 4,500 tonnes of uranium a year and hoped to employ 540 people. He said that the Government hoped the $600m development would eventually sell 9,000 tonnes of uranium a year and employ a few more people. The truth is that it is extremely irresponsible of this Minister and this Government to be pushing this industry at a time of downturn and world oversupply. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's own Australian Atomic Energy Commission which could scarcely be accused of not being a promoter of nuclear power and the uranium industry said in its last report that the forecasts of the Western world annual requirements for uranium by it since 1975 had consistently fallen. It was saying in 1975 that the Western world demand would be 108,000 tonnes by 1985 but this year the figure is down to 39,000 tonnes. The story is similar with regard to enriched uranium. When using the measurement unit involved in the description of enriched uranium, the figures were: Australian Atomic Energy Commission production in 1975, 52 million separate work units; this year, down to 25 million separate work units. That is the state of the industry. Some of the mines this Minister and the Government are pushing are in the Northern Territory -in the beautiful Kakadu National Park that has been included in the World Heritage list and in the National Estate list. It is one of the most sensitive areas in Australia. It is on a par with south-west Tasmania and the Great Barrier Reef. The Government wants to put these mines-create enclaves-in the middle of this area. </PARA>
<PARA> If all of the proposed mines-Ranger, Jabiluka, Nabarlek, Yeelirrie in Western Australia and Koongarra plus Roxby Downs-go ahead we would be producing 15,000 tonnes of uranium a year. Yet the AAEC says that world demand will be less than 40,000 tonnes by 1985, and thus we will be lucky to be able to obtain 20 per cent of that market-that is, 8,000 tonnes. Where is the Government going to sell the rest of it? How hard are we going to push in the declining market situation? I can only say that in this situation there will be more hawking of uranium around the world. In a situation where the price falls, where in the scramble to sell, the much publicised safeguards are watered down. This is happening now. Witness this Government's somersault to allow reprocessing to proceed in which plutonium is produced from Australian uranium from used fuel rods in conventional reactors. Plutonium is the fissionable material from which nuclear weapons are made. They say they can control this under the safeguards agreements , under an inefficient International Atomic Energy Agency procedure. That is simply wrong. It is nonsense. The Government is completely misleading Australia in professing confidence in safeguards arrangements. This Government will do anything. It has proven that. It will break down its safeguards to sell uranium in a declining market situation, in a world downturn situation, even at the risk of plutonium from Australian uranium being used to manufacture nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the role of the Northern Land Council in this whole affair of Jabiluka and the transfer of title. It is most unfortunate the Council has already initialled contracts with Pan-continental Mining Ltd. I understand that, however, the traditional owners are unhappy and confused. They do not know what the NLC is up to. They do not know what they are going to get. Many, as always, are again opposed to uranium mining. My colleague the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) will develop this theme further. But perhaps the Northern Land Council can explain to me its rush to agreement with Pancontinental. There are now some fundamental concerns about the structure and, indeed, the whole model of the Northern Land Council-not concern at giving land to Aboriginal traditional owners but at the administration and negotiation of mining approvals that should now be the concern of this Parliament. For instance , is the Northern Land Council's haste to rush to agreement to develop Jabiluka due to a desire to finance its own growing bureaucracy which is now dominated not by blacks but by white lawyers and barristers-a bevy of legal representatives with a staff now of over 70 people? Are both the land councils and the Aboriginal owners becoming too dependent on mining funds? Is the Northern Land Council developing a vested interest in mining against the interests and desires of the traditional owners? Have some of the legal advisers openly expressed a pro-mining view during the conduct of the negotiations? If so , have they put a no mining option to the traditional owners when explaining the options of the agreement as they are obliged to under section 48 of the Act? Finally, is the Land Council and traditional owner model, now showing signs of inbuilt basic conflict between two sets of values?</PARA>
<PARA> As an illustration of this, I refer to a speech I made last June when debating an earlier set of amendments which were partly designed to allow uranium mining at Jabiluka to proceed. In that speech I described the country that I saw when I was in the area a couple of years ago. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> As we drove along the road into Jabiluka, a representative of Pancontinental said to me: 'This road over the crossing we are going over, this low lying area next to the mining area, is eight feet under water during the wet season'. That indicates the climate and rainfall in that area. The mining companies say that they will contain the radio active water within a closed system. In the dry season this wetlands area is a maze of creeks and billabongs. In the wet season it becomes an area of fast flowing waterways feeding the south and east Alligator Rivers system. The threat of radio active leakage into the park region will always be present althought things have improved since the 1979 environmental impact statement was submitted proposing open cut mining. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members can imagine my amazement -this was when the Bill was debated in the Senate- when a Mr Eric Pratt, Q.C., senior counsel for the Northern Land Council, had the audacity to send a telex without, I understand, the approval of the Northern Land Council to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), in which he criticised my statement as being either misconceived or dishonest. Mr Pratt said in his telex:</PARA>
<PARA> Have seen Press statement issued by Stuart West. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I take it he means the honourable member for Cunningham. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Pratt went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The mining is justified environmentally and economically and will result in substantial economic benefits to Aboriginals. Environmental requirements have been established and agreed to by Government, the supervising authorities and the Northern Land Council, so as to ensure protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is the situation: A senior counsel of the NLC 9 months ago, before and/or during negotiations with Pancontinental, comes out in a predetermined way and says he has made up his mind, and without the approval of the NLC, sends a telex to the Minister to use during a debate in this Parliament. Did the NLC instruct its Q.C. to send a telex like that on a Pancontinental telex machine after he had lunched with Pancontinental officials? If he did that, who in fact is running the Northern Land Council in these negotiations-white barristers and solicitors or blacks on behalf of the Aboriginal traditional owners? Who is running it-the Aboriginals themselves or the hired silks who have suddenly taken over the organisations and who are supposed to negotiate on behalf of these simple traditional owners?</PARA>
<PARA> Another question I want to raise before I finish is: What is in this initialled agreement for the Aboriginals? To what extent are they becoming dependent on mining, perhaps against their own basic interests, and certainly against the interests of proper socio-economic programs developed under the Government but in cohesion with them in the Territory? Funding of the Land Councils from uranium mining companies is on this basis. Royalties of 4.25 per cent are paid to the Aboriginals. Of this amount, 24 per cent goes to the NLC, 14 per cent to the Central Land Council, 2 per cent to the Tiwi Council, 30 per cent to the Northern Territory Aboriginals and 30 per cent to the traditional owners. In December 1981, the first payment of $1.5m was made and $144,000 of that went to the NLC, plus an up front payment to the community. So far, so good. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the situation with the initialled Jabiluka agreement? I understand that the Northern Land Council is to get $200,000 a year for the first four years, then gets its share of the royalties thereafter. I have heard that the up front payment will be anything from $1m to $10m, but the NLC will receive only a small amount of that; the rest will go into the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account. That is not enough money for the Aboriginals if they are to go ahead. I am not saying that they are getting too much. I am saying that the organisation and the model that has been set up are now showing distinct signs of being used not for the benefits of the Aboriginal traditional owners but in the interests of a prevailing, and snowballing bureaucracy in the land councils which are taking the decisions and not properly informing the people, on the grounds probably that the people are not, because of their traditional life style, capable of understanding these highly complicated agreements anyway. I only hope that the Aboriginals use the power that they have under section 40 of the Act; that is, the power of veto over what the Land Council is doing. Let us remember that the Land Council initialled an agreement some time ago. Under section 48 the Minister can at least ensure that they are properly informed of what is going on and that they do not sell their birthright for a Toyota 4-wheel drive. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by returning to the role of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the declaration of Stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park, which is being completely ignored in this whole affair. Stage 1 of Kakadu National Park is on the National Estate. In October last year it was accepted by the World Heritage List Committee in Sydney for inclusion in the World Heritage List. The National Parks and Wildlife Service, in its submission to the committee of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation, said that the natural heritage of Kakadu National Park is of outstanding universal value, and gave 13 major justifications which cover preservation of Aboriginal cultural, physical and biological assistance of the whole park ecosystem. Now, besides not being satisfied with mining at Koongara in an enclave within Stage 1 and mining at Ranger on the parameter, Jabiluka will be established as an eventual enclave within Stage 2, if it is ever declared. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) pushed aside in these matters? When will Stage 2 be declared? Without the protection of being included in the park, the Aboriginal land will be subject to the massive effects of uranium mining at Ranger and Jabiluka. No Commonwealth environmental protection legislation will apply to this area before it is declared as a park. Separate transfer of Jabiluka will prove that this Government's priorities lie with the uranium companies and not with the Aboriginals or with the interests of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I am informed that the National Parks and Wildlife Service has not been consulted on the implications of this amendment and two senior officers have voiced their disapproval. That Service, under the administration of this Government, has been left completely in the dark on this matter. We support Aboriginal land rights. We support the declaration of all of the Kakadu area as a great national park that Australia can be proud of. I believe that we must seriously question the structure under which Aboriginal land rights are administered once granted. We do not support uranium mining and we put those companies on notice that they will not receive our support when we are in government. </PARA>

<PARA> That the House take note of the message. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement arises from the Government's consideration of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, which was tabled on 19 August 1981. While the recommendations in the report essentially deal with the Senate, the Government's response covers, and is therefore being made in, both Houses of the Parliament. I note in passing that the current procedures for considering the parliamentary estimates were to be reviewed in any event for the 1982-83 Budget. The Government acknowledges the valuable work of the Committee. In developing its response it has had the benefit of the Committee's further views and has discussed the matters raised by the Committee with the Presiding Officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference of the Senate Select Committee were to inquire into and report upon Parliament's control of its own appropriations and staffing, and related matters. The central theme in the report is that Parliament should have greater independence and autonomy in regard to its internal arrangements and operations. Control of parliament's appropriations and staffing is seen by the Committee as essential to achieving this independence. The Government, of course , agrees that the independence of parliament as such from Executive control is a central principle of our Constitution which must be upheld. But just as the Parliament must exercise its rights and meet its responsibilities, so must the Government be able to fulfil its constitutional obligations; in this case the control of the expenditure of public money. </PARA>
<PARA> In responding to the report, the Government has had to devise a balance between these fundamental principles bearing in mind the provisions of the Australian Constitution and the development of parliamentary government in Australia. I believe that the detailed measures I will outline a little later meet this challenge. This balance assumes there will be a continuing dialogue between the Parliament and the Executive, and it remains the Government's firm intention that such dialogue is effective, and recognises the proper roles and responsibilities of each party. The fact that this response has taken the time it has flows in part from our commitment to such discussions at all stages. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Government's response to the specific major recommendations of the Jessop Committee. The report contains recommendations on five main topics : Parliament's control of its own funding; a separate parliamenary appropriation Bill; transfer of items in appropriations of Government departments to the Parliamentary Appropriation Bill and parliamentary administration; control over staffing and terms and conditions of employment; and a parliamentary appropriations and staffing committee. </PARA>
<PARA> On the first and key issue the Government believes firmly that it needs to maintain control over the total amount of funds available for expenditure by the Parliament because of the constitutional responsbility of the Government for budgetary policy and for the level of public expenditure. Obviously, the funds that are spent on the Parliament are funds that come from the Australian taxpayer in exactly the same way as funds that are spent in any of the other recurring circumstances that are provided by government, although, as will be seen shortly, the parliamentary appropriation Bill will, for the first time, remove parliamentary appropriations from those recurrent services of Government. Moreover, it is the Government which has the odium of raising the revenue which funds that expenditure. However the Goverment recognises that detailed control over individual expenditure items is not necessary. The Government therefore proposes that it simply approve overall figures, broken down into a capital and a recurrent item, for each of the Senate, the House of Representatives and, as a group, the three joint departments. This arrangement properly balances the overall Government responsibility for the level of public expenditure with the responsibility of the parliamentary departments and the Presiding Officers to determine, subject to parliamentary approval, the direction of that expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also proposes that, commencing with the financial year 1982-83, there be a separate parliamentary appropriation Bill which, consistent with the Select Committee recommendations, will not be treated as a Bill for the ordinary annual services of government, and will cover all recurrent and capital expenditure items currently administered by the parliamentary departments. I should also say that the arrangements for consultations between you, Mr Speaker, Mr President, my colleague the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) and myself, as well as consultations at officer level, during the Budget process will of course be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Within the total figure for parliamentary departments, the Government is also suggesting an Advance to the Presiding Officers as recommended by the Select Committee, provided that such an advance is operated in the same way as is the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The Government will be proposing an amendment to the Audit Act in due course to facilitate the use of this Advance. On the question of the transfer of certain items from appropriations of Government departments to the Parliamentary Appropriation Bill and parliamentary administration, the Government proposes that the two aspects be considered together and therefore that these items should be the subject of further discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the topic of control over staffing. The Government has most carefully considered the need to maintain a measure of control over the total number of public sector employees and of course, the terms and conditions under which they are employed. The Government's policies in this regard are a matter of public record. Suffice it to say that the Government does not wish public sector employees to have any pace-setting role. It expects that due regard therefore be paid to principles of wage restraint. On the basis that the Presiding Officers undertake to consult with the Public Service Board before determining staff ceilings for individual parliamentary departments, and provided that the Presiding Officers publish projected ceilings in advance, with the previous year's actual ceilings, by reporting annually to this Parliament, the Government is willing to give control over staff numbers to the Presiding Officers. </PARA>
<PARA> On terms and conditions of employment of parliamentary staff, the Government is also asking Presiding Officers to give an undertaking to consult with the Public Service Board before determining-as they are now empowered to-those terms and conditions, and that such determinations should also be published annually when the Presiding Officers report to the Parliament. The reason for this is to avoid any undesirable 'leap-frogging' in terms and conditions between parliamentary and executive departments. I should make it clear that these consultations would be on the basis that the final powers reside with the Presiding Officers, that they agree to consult, but that there is to be no statutory requirement on them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The decisions of the Parliament in these areas should be subject to the same types of scrutiny, inside and outside the Parliament, as those of the Government itself. It is up to the Parliament to prove its managerial ability in the same fashion as it is for the Government. It is for this reason that the Government is proposing that the Presiding Officers report annually to the Parliament on the numbers, classification and disposition of staff, as well as any variation in terms and conditions of employment. They should also provide a detailed breakdown of previous and proposed expenditure within each of the items contained in the Parliamentary Appropriation Bill. Given these arrangements, a number of further powers will be transferred to the Presiding Officers as recommended by the Senate Committee. The Government will be proposing amendments to the Public Service Acts Amendment Bill 1981, now before the Parliament, to vest in the Presiding Officers power to create, classify and abolish offices, and to make appointments below the level of permanent head. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Select Committee proposed the establishment of a Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee. The Government considers that it is appropriate for the Senate itself to decide on the mechanisms it wishes to establish to advise the President on his responsibilities and, therefore, proposes to leave this recommendation in the Senate's hands. For this House, the Government will not be proposing, nor would it support, any similar committee</PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that the revised arrangements, as I have outlined, will provide the basis for a reasonable balance between the need for the Parliament to have a greater degree of autonomy in relation to funding and staffing and the need for the Government to retain a limited number of overall controls in the execution of its proper responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I understand that the Opposition wishes to move an amendment with respect to the establishment of a committee. Because under the procedures that we have adopted I would not have an opportunity to respond, I want briefly to expand upon the reasons that I have given. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The right honourable gentleman could ask his colleague to move that the House take note of the paper. Then he would have an opportunity to respond.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Also, Mr Speaker, I could speak to the amendment and cover the subject in that way. I will not address the matter in great detail. It seemed to me that I needed to make two other points. One was with respect to the establishment of a committee. Mr Speaker, under the Westminster system the office that you occupy and the office of your counterpart, the Presiding Officer of the Senate, have always been seen as paramount in the functioning of the Parliament. The Standing Orders largely accord to you responsibility for determination of those areas in respect of which such responsibility is not otherwise specified. It seems a pity to impose on you, as part of your ultimate responsibility to the Parliament, a committee system which will not enhance the function and structure of the decisions that you are called upon to take in exercising your executive responsibility, as distinct from your responsibility as Speaker to administer this chamber. Therefore, the Government does not regard the establishment of a committee as a way in which this place can be better governed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It does not believe that a committee is necessary, given that already there is a range of joint and House committees to advise you and the Parliament on the respective functions which are of prime concern to honourable members. Indeed, we believe that within the structure of the present procedures and practices ample opportunity exists for honourable members to contribute to policy formulation by making recommendations on the funding of particular areas of parliamentary responsibility. There is, of course, already a standing Library Committee. The projected amendment makes reference to the Parliamentary Library, but at Question Time on many occasions over the course of the years you and your predecessors have been called to answer specific questions with respect to matters of administration. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, taking all of these matters into account, the Government does not believe that the establishment of a committee along the lines that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) intends to recommend represents a way by which the Parliament can be better and more efficiently governed than by the Speaker and the President having ultimate responsibility for determining funding , staffing and other matters towards which this statement is directed. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter concerns the staffing of committees, as well as other staff demands within the responsibilities to be transferred henceforth to yourself and to Mr President. Quite obviously, the constraints that will be imposed under the Parliamentary Appropriations Bill will be constraints which, for the first time, will relate to the actual amount of money that is to be allocated for expenditure in the operation of the Parliament. That will mean that decisions will need to be taken in relation to the best utilisation of those funds, for recurrent and capital purposes, in the three categories to which reference has been made in the statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope it will not be a matter of one House setting terms and conditions of employment which would lead to an escalation in the pay expectations of individual officers in the other. In other words, one would hope that, in the very natural desire to meet the expectations of those who will serve the various committees in this and the other place, there will not be a tendency on the part of those who make recommendations on one side or the other of the Parliament to set in train a leap-frogging process which will erode the real benefits which I have no doubt that you, in your discretion, would seek to exercise in providing the services that honourable members seek. In other words, I hope that the very leap-frogging process that we seek to avoid in the broad area of public service will not occur in respect of the committees-or those employed by them-that are established in either the Senate or this House. On that basis I commend this new procedure, which I see as a notable advance in the regulation of the funding and operations of the Parliament, to this House. I trust that it will enjoy the support of all honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'the House is of the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) a joint committee should be established to inquire into and report upon the Parliament's control of its own appropriations and staffing, and related matters , including the functions administered by the Department of the Parliamentary Library, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, and the Joint House Department, and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) provisions relating to membership, powers and proceedings of the committee should be contained in a subsequent resolution'. </PARA>
<PARA>In a nutshell, the amendment proposes the establishing of a joint committee. It is a matter that could well have been dealt with without any difficulty at all. I would be surprised if Government back benchers and other interested honourable members on that side-be they members of the Liberal Party or the National Country Party-did not agree with what I am trying to say. I assume they have discussed this matter. I might add that the Opposition has not given it a party discussion because it did not know the matter was coming on for debate until today. We do not take any umbrage at that because we are looking at a Senate committee on which our own members participated. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that we have the chance to discuss these matters of how we can improve the Parliament. For example, honourable members would be aware that my leader has had notices of motion under General Business as far back as November. One is about how the machinery of the Australian Parliament, amongst other things, could be bettered. He has another about annual appropriations for the Parliamentary Library, et cetera. Neither of those notices of motion has had a chance to be discussed because of the way the Parliament functions. That, of course, is a problem of time. </PARA>
<PARA> The very significant thing about what has happened to the House of Representatives in relation to the Senate committee system is that we have fallen miles behind. I think this is to be deplored. Nobody is at fault. If we go back to prior to 1972 it will be seen that a simultaneous resolution was put forward in both the Senate and the House of Representatives that a committee system should be established. At that stage we were in Opposition. We favoured the committee system. But because we were in Opposition and the Executive of the day did not agree with us, no committee system was readily established in the House of Representatives. Strangely, because of what could be called the minority party in the Senate agreeing with the Opposition, which we were, it became the practice of the Senate to establish committees, and it has done so. In the course of that procedure it established the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing which, honourable members might note, in its terms of reference not only talks about the Senate's appropriation but also states:</PARA>
<PARA> That a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon Parliament 's control of its own appropriations and staffing . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So the Senate has been kind enough to indicate how we might be able to control our own appropriation and staffing in the House of Representatives. I would have thought that whilst any reasonable Executive would applaud what the Senate has done, it might have given the House of Representatives a chance also to make recommendations. After all, we have a much closer affiliation with the electorate. We have all sorts of different approaches to the problems of the nation and in constitutional terms we are the people who have to talk about appropriation and taxation. To use the words of the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) 'we have the odium of raising it'. I think it is important therefore that we ought to have some input as to how the appropriation can best be spent in the terms of this Parliament. We agree that it is important to divorce the Parliament from the Executive. I again make the point that I assume the Executive has taken this matter to its own party rooms and had a keen discussion as to how it sees the proposal. I am not objecting to the Committee's recommendations but I could not see, for example, how the office of the President is to remain paramount, which was an expression used by the Leader of the House today. In paragraph 6.6, the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing makes this recommendation-a Senate recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that the Committee would be chaired by the President and would comprise 6 . . . members . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee would be charged with the responsibility of the Estimates of the Senate and the consideration of staffing proposals affecting the Senate and its committees. So it is very clear that the distinguished President of the other chamber is going to be told, in a reasonable way, how best the appropriations and the staffing should be dealt with. I do not think he will have that paramount position that was mentioned by the Leader of the House. Again-this is an interesting one-in relation to the Estimates the report states that the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee would examine the proposals and then there would be a submission to the Minister for Finance for inclusion in a separate parliamentary appropriation Bill. This is the Senate. The recommendations go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Should the Government of the day be opposed to any of the Estimates as agreed to by the Committee and included in the Parliamentary Appropriation Bill . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I am not too clear how that happens. It does appear that the Committee is going to suggest the amount that should be in the Bill and then it is assuming that it will be in the Bill because the Committee then says that an opportunity will be afforded to the government of the day to raise its objections. I think this is a bit unusual because if we look at the constitutional position for a start, it does appear that the Senate is not really in a position to increase the appropriation, in other words, to engender more taxation. That is just a minor point. But I think it is very much to the point that this Senate Committee will be a very strong and paramount committee. The Committee report also states:</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to staffing, the Committee would examine proposals seeking to vary the organisational structure of the Senate . . . and staffing and recruitment policies and make recommendations to the President. </PARA>
<PARA>I think in view of that, the Senate has certainly gone a long way along the road to working out its own destiny with an appropriation which we would be expected to provide. We do not seem to have any of those facilities. One is not critical of any Speaker, least of all yourself, Mr Speaker. But what we are trying to get here is some input into what would be a reasonable appropriation for both Houses to cover all the matters that are the subject of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the House of Commons (Administration) Act we see that the commission includes the Speaker, the Leader of the House, a member of the Opposition and three other members. One gets an input. But we have a very unusual situation here where there will be no input from the point of view of the House of Representatives. If we are going to talk about controlling our own funding, we agree with that, but we would want to see also some intelligent appraisal of what the funding should be. Therefore, it would be on the basis that we would have some clear knowledge of the input. I think the Bill, whatever it is, would certainly pass both Houses without too much trouble if we had a joint committee that could look at some of the matters I have in mind. At least the committee would have dealt with the Bill. It would be a bit unfair to be talking about an annual appropriation if people feel they have never had a chance to make an input on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, in relation to staffing, we think it is certainly important that the Public Service not be the pacesetter. But also it does not want to be the last rung of the ladder. We have had awful trouble here in a number of areas outside the Parliament. But certainly relating to Public Service administration and industrial matters, we have had massive strikes that have been settled only by arbitral processes which have castigated the Public Service administration. The Professional Radio Employees Institute dispute which brought every airline in Australia to a halt is a classic example. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is having dreadful trouble at present trying to get some flexibility into what is called the rigidity of the Public Service administration of salaries. We are breaking out of that. That is to be welcomed. At the same time we do not want to be creating salaries which are in any way above what would be the norm. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is also important that we attract the best, as we should in Parliament. It is important that we perhaps take people from outside the Public Service. We might need them from the private sector in the terms of getting the expertise that we want. For example, there is some concern in the research area available basically to the back bench and more importantly to the Opposition which, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, has to compete with the Executive and with all the resources of its bureaucracy available to it, plus its own ministerial staff. It is not really a fair competition unless we can get adequate research staff. There has been some limitation and cut back in respect of research staff. That is not an indictment of any particular person but it is an Executive approach to appropriation. We see nothing wrong with improving the quality of staff and certainly guaranteeing that there would be no stranglehold by the Public Service Board. I make the point again that we would like the Presiding Officers to be able to get the best possible staff. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying is that I hope the Government could see some merit in a joint committee where we could perhaps go back jointly, as we do in a number of areas, and say: 'Let us look at this Parliament as one segment, not in two separate parts'. It is certainly in one segment when it talks about the question of the Parliamentary Library, the Joint House Department or the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. It is important that we have an input there. Nobody disagrees with that. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to be quite blinkered in vision to think that when it comes to the appropriation of what is worth while from the point of view of the House of Representatives we will not really have an input into it and the Senate will be making all sorts of arrangements to suit itself. It would not be beyond exaggeration to suggest that the Senate might think it needs a lot more financial resources than the House of Representatives and would be expecting to get them simply because it is the Senate that makes those determinations. It could be some sort of an embarrassment and it could perhaps lead to conflict if it is suggested the Senate needs so much more. One of the things the Senate would certainly be pitching its focus on in that respect would be its committee system because it has so many committees. It wants to give support to them, it wants to get more staff for them and more appropriation. We, by the same token, are bereft of that facility. Perhaps now we will be bereft of an appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it was an intelligent move to establish joint committees in a number of areas. They have worked well in the past. I think in relation to this matter it is important for the Government to suggest to the Senate that it welcomes the work done by the Senate but that in respect of the appropriations a joint committee should be set up. It could benefit from input of members of the House of Representatives. None of the senators have any knowledge of the House of Representatives or of the responsibilities of members of this House. They work in a different area altogether and they are motivated by their priorities. Again , I make the very clear point that the senators will dictate all sorts of conditions, which they feel is their right, to the President of the Senate in relation to staff and appropriations. Before we reach that situation, I have moved:</PARA>
<PARA>That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'the House is o the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) a joint committee should be established to inquire into and report upon the Parliament's control</PARA>
<PARA>That is the whole of the Parliament-</PARA>
<PARA> of its own appropriations and staffing, and related matters, including the functions administered by the Department of the Parliamentary Library, the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, and the Joint House Department, and-</PARA>
<PARA>This is a machinery provision-</PARA>
<PARA> (2) provisions relating to membership, powers and proceedings of the committee should be contained in a subsequent resolution'. </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude my remarks on this basis: The Opposition envisages a committee that would not be large in size but would comprise the usual joint membership. It should be able to report quickly because it would have all the advantages of the Senate investigation and recommendations. Without being offensive to the Senate, I do not think such a committee would agree with the detailed recommendations of the Senate as I have outlined to the Leader of the House in respect of paragraph 6 which appeared at pages 21 and 22. It is for that reason the Opposition feels that there should be some input from members of the House of Representatives. The only way to achieve that is to establish a joint committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to clarify the situation and I think it is important that I do so. The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) has moved that we take note of the message from the Senate. That, in itself, is not an Executive act. We are taking note. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has moved an amendment to omit all the words after 'That' with a view to substituting other words which begin 'the House is of the opinion that'. We really have two non- Executive motions. If the amendment were passed it would be a non-Executive amendment. I think the statement made by the Leader of the House indicates that an Executive action will flow. That, I think, is the principal point of this debate-the Executive Government has indicated a course of action which will flow . Am I correct?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, perhaps I should explain that a parliamentary appropriation Bill would become an Executive Act which would, of course, set down the parameters for the new procedure. While there is no Executive Act, this statement indicates a course of action which will take place and which will involve a procedure concerning the ratification by this House of sums of money to be administered in the policy form which has been outlined in my statement. On the other hand, as I understand the amendment moved by my distinguished friend, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), it is a product of the Opposition's intention that , if his motion were to be passed, a committee would be established. Presumably that committee would also have to await the passage of the parliamentary appropriation Act before it would have anything to consider. I am not sure whether that is the position.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no doubt that the Aboriginal land rights legislation has had a huge effect in the Northern Territory on both Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act has now been in force for just over five years. The amendments in question today, contained in the Aboriginal Land Rights Legislation Amendment Bill, are not controversial but they are significant. They are good amendments recognising both the wishes of Aborigines and the needs of the wider population. For that reason, I support them. From the outset I identify to the House the particular importance of clauses 4, 5 and 6. It is these clauses that provide for title to the Hermannsburg area south-west of Alice Springs to be granted to the traditional owners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was struck recently by a comment in an article written last year by Mr Charles Perkins, Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission. He claimed in an article entitled 'Fifteen Years of Development' that:</PARA>
<PARA> The developments in the last decade have been remarkable but in the last five years even more so. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is no coincidence that the period cited by Mr Perkins is the period in which the Aboriginal Land Rights Act has been in force, because it is only over the last five years that Aborigines have emerged from the paternalism of previous administrations into a period of self-management and self-reliance. But what of land rights in the Northern Territory? When the land rights Act was proclaimed Aborigines were granted some 19 per cent of Northern Territory land under Schedule 1 to that Act. Since then 60 land claims have been lodged. Of those, 17 were settled or received, one was withdrawn, one was amalgamated with another and 41 are still outstanding. Nearly all the land available for claim in the Northern Territory has become the subject of one land claim or another. In fact, over 45 per cent of the Northern Territory either has been granted to Aborigines or is under claim. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard two tables which outline the status of Aboriginal land claims in the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Mr TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In incorporating these documents, I point out that since they were prepared in 1981 a few minor changes have occurred. The changes relate to a few claims for which hearings have begun. It is interesting to note that the area of Aboriginal land claims represents well over 600,000 square kilometres, an area almost three times the size of Victoria. Clauses 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill before us provide for land to be granted to the Hermannsburg people in accordance with their wishes. Ever since 1976 it has been made clear that they do not want just one land trust for their area. They have said that just one lease could not recognise traditional ownership of their land. They have insisted that only the direct grant of separate titles to each clan group could suit the needs of the people. They have said that the different groups could speak for their own land but they could not speak for each other's land. Since then a great deal of survey work has been carried out by the Australian Survey Office, assisted by Finke River Mission and the clan groups, to define the traditional boundaries within the lease. The result, incorporated in clause 4, is that the grant of a title to the land will go not to a single trust but to five land trusts. Clause 5 meets the request by the Hermannsburg people regarding the membership of the trusts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this point I place it on record that the Hermannsburg people have waited too long for their land, and the Commonwealth has certainly been tardy in bringing in these amendments. I indicate also that the Aranda people in Hermannsburg and Alice Springs have been frustrated and have had to put up with a lot of tensions . The area just south of Hermannsburg takes in Palm Valley in the Amadeus Basin, where there are huge deposits of oil and natural gas. The Palm Valley mining partners are Magellan Petroleum Australia Limited, Flinders Petroleum N.L., Charles Davis Limited and United Canso Oil and Gas Co. (N.T.) Pty Ltd. The position of the Aranda people is clear. They want to see a pipeline from Palm Valley to Alice Springs. They can see the benefit of this for all concerned and they certainly want to reap the benefits of the royalty payments that will accrue to them. What the Central Land Council must do as the secretarial agency for the owners is meet the different groups involved frequently and get on with developing any solutions which in the long run will advantage the Aranda people.</PARA>
<PARA> Another significant clause of the Bill before us is clause 7, which will allow the Minister to grant land in stages. An immediate effect of this will be to facilitate the granting of the Jabiluka project area. There have been some suggestions that this amendment is aimed solely at Jabiluka. This is simply not true because the land will be capable of being granted in a matter of months anyway. Contrary to what the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) said today, nothing is being pushed through. There have been long consultations and negotiations with the Aboriginals in the area and they are yet to agree on matters relating to the Pancontinental proposals. The significance of this Bill is that it places beyond doubt the Minister's power to deal with those portions of land recommended by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner for grant but upon which the Minister cannot act on account of an application now before the High Court arising from an earlier claim. </PARA>
<PARA> Since its inception, the Land Rights Act has created a number of problems for both Aborigines and the rest of the Northern Territory. Unfortunately there are groups in the community who, because of their own vested interests, refuse to acknowledge that any problems need to be resolved. There is a need for continued discussions between the land councils, the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth to secure further amendments to this legislation as a matter of priority. I am aware that negotiations are current on issues such as the conversion of pastoral leases, repetitive claims, land for public purposes, rights of access and protection of mining interests following exploration. I want to emphasise the need for amendments to be worked out within a reasonable time frame so that community tensions should not be let get out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation recognises the problem of claims on land adjacent to seas. It is an issue dealt with at some length by Barry Rowland, Q.C., in his examination of the Act last year. At the moment both land claims on the coast, if granted, and Schedule 1 land adjacent to the coast, have their seaward boundaries at the low water mark. The problem is that a large part of fishing in the Northern Territory is involved in fishing inshore in creeks between high and low water. The method of fishing is by placing traps and nets on the land between high and low water and collecting fish that are caught when the tide goes out. But, as Rowland points out, 'Effectively all of the coastline of the Northern Territory is, in the absence of permission, out of bounds'. So the present methods of fishing amount to trespass. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly there is a detriment to fishermen in land claims along the coast. Clause 10 of the Bill therefore provides for the cost of legal representation to be paid for fishermen by the Commonwealth on the same basis as assistance with legal fees applies for pastoralists. My reservation about this is that some people might be precluded from assistance on the basis of income. Surely there is a moral principle involved here whereby the Commonwealth should pay, within reason, for the legal costs of people who are forced to defend their interests through no other reason than a piece of legislation that was forced upon them by the Commonwealth. Regardless of this assistance, the closure of seas adjacent to Aboriginal land will still remain a problem. For this reason, I urge continuing discussions to see whether a suitable compromise can be found. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many more problem areas to be resolved, such as the lodging of claims on stock routes. Even though this is technically possible, I believe the action by the Central Land Council was provocative in the extreme and certainly contributed nothing to the acceptance of land rights in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Putting aside these other problems for today, I would like to deal with one other issue, and that is pastoral leases purchased by Aboriginal people that can be claimed by other Aboriginals. The case that sticks in my mind is the Bathern family of Beetaloo station. The Batherns are an Aboriginal family whose property has been subject to a land claim. Yet when we look at the claimants we see that they are traditional owners from Newcastle Waters, which is off Beetaloo station . To make matters worse the Batherns were denied legal aid to help them defend their own interests. I am aware that a claim has been lodged on Vanderlin Island where the Johnson family, an Aboriginal family, has found its property subject to claim. The problem of the deprivation of rights and the livelihood of Aboriginal lessees has been identified by Rowland. It is worth while noting his comment that 'It would seem to be counterproductive to place the Aboriginals in jeopardy'. </PARA>
<PARA> The massive boost for funding Aboriginal enterprises over the last few years and the payment of mining royalties to the land councils has had a tremendous positive impact on Aboriginal development. I must record how impressed I am with the Aboriginal Development Commission, which is a progressive organisation catering successfully for the varying needs of Aboriginals throughout Australia. I believe this is due partially to the flexibility the Commission has but also to the professional expertise of its commissioners and their approach to Aboriginal issues. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) should consider the possibility of the Aboriginals Benefits Trust Account contributing money to the ADC at some future date when royalty income is more substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to commend the positive attitude that has been taken by the Northern Land Council towards Aboriginal development in the Northern Territory. The NLC understands the benefits that mining can bring the Aboriginal people and accordingly has undertaken to negotiate properly with mining compamies. Because the NLC is operating as an effective administrator it is now unfairly incurring the jealous wrath of the Labor Party. Obviously, the Labor Party wants to put Aboriginals back 50 years and put them under some sort of ALP yoke and further bureaucracy. In order to give honourable members some idea of the massive benefits that accrue to Aboriginals as a result of mining royalties, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a document setting out my estimates of the mining royalty situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On my estimates it is important to note that royalties are expected to yield, yearly, $28m for Aboriginals in the future in addition to considerable pre-production payments, which also will amount to many millions of dollars. I note that when debating this legislation in the other place the Opposition spokesman on Aboriginal affairs, Senator Ryan, used the debate to reiterate her narrow-minded views on uranium mining. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this point I would like to state the total opposition of the Labor party to the mining and export of uranium.</PARA>
<PARA>When one listens to the impractical jeremiah comments made today by the honourable member for Cunningham one wonders how noble he is in trying to protect the uranium industry because he is on record as trying to destroy that industry. Let me ask these questions: Whom does the Labor Party think it is kidding about this matter? Whom does it think it is helping? Does not the Labor Party know that the Aboriginals actually support uranium mining? The honourable member for Cunningham is patronising and offensive to the Aboriginals when in speaking for them today he says that he knows what is best for them. The traditional owners are not simple bush people, as the honourable member implied. He is out of date. Instead ALP supporters, who come into this House with tears in their eyes and bleeding hearts on Aboriginal issues, would deliberately use Aboriginals to further their anti-uranium policy. The ALP is very good at supporting Aboriginals when and only when it suits ALP purposes. But when the Aboriginal people disagree with the ALP, that party forgets them. Who does the ALP really think it is helping by taking a stupid anti-uranium stance? Certainly not the Aboriginals. Where else will the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Fund receive royalties upon which the Aboriginals will rely to gain some independence from government funding?</PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, I would like to reflect on what the future might bring for Aboriginals as development increases. We are reaching the stage at which many Aboriginal enterprises are becoming self-supporting and, as the documents I have incorporated in Hansard show, royalty payments will be about $28m per annum. I believe that we are reaching the stage where Aboriginal organisations themselves can start making more of their own decisions about Aboriginal development programs and start funding them out of their own considerable resources. I would envisage that community needs programs such as health and social welfare, over and above that which would normally be provided by the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory governments, could be paid for in this way. As I mentioned before, I suport these amendments because they are good amendments. I hope that, in the course of this debate, I have also prompted discussion on a range of issues which still need to be addressed and resolved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by refuting the allegations made by the honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Tambling) in respect of the attitude of the Australian Labor Party towards Aborigines in that part of Australia. If the honourable gentleman had spent a little more time talking to traditional owners, he would have realised that he is exaggerating the case if he says that all traditional owners in the Northern Territory support uranium mining. I know that he supports it. He is entitled to that position. But equally , just as he is entitled to support it, traditional Aboriginal owners are entitled to have the option to refuse it, if they wish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As has already been indicated by the shadow Minister in the Senate, the Labor Party is not opposed to this legislation, because a number of the amendments are a response by the Minister to legitimate requests from Aboriginal communities to meet problems in ensuring the grant of title to Aboriginal land. I want to relate most of my remarks to that part of the Bill which deals with the issue of title to land in the Alligator Rivers Region. The Minister has stated that his objective in pressing this amendment is to issue title in respect of some seven parcels of land which were recently granted by the Lands Commission, and not to delay the issue of title by virtue of some appeals that have been brought in the High Court of Australia. If that is the Minister's only motive, there can be little objection. </PARA>
<PARA> However, these titles include areas of land which are currently the subject of negotiation between the Northern Land Council and Pancontinental Mining Ltd in respect of the mining project at Jabiluka. My concern is that, given the opportunity to amend the Act, the Minister or the Government has continued to ignore some of the problems inherent in the legislation, which were pointed out by Mr Rowland, Queen's Counsel, in his examination of the Act, which was completed in August 1980. One of the more important criticisms made by Mr Rowland which, to my mind, operates continually adversely to the interests of traditional owners, is that in the legislation that created the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and which gave birth to the Northern Land Council, we created an organisational framework which was not related to the structures of Aboriginal society, and in which the potential for conflict of interest was endemic. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to minimise the significance of either the land rights legislation or the creation of structures such as the Northern Land Council as being important milestones in the continuing quest of Aboriginal communities for land rights and the protection of their culture. The fact is that, within the legislation, Parliament has created, in the Northern Land Council, a conflict model which would test the skills of the most able manager in the corporate sector or the capacity of any very senior and experienced public servant. </PARA>
<PARA> In his important analysis of the operation of the Aboriginal Land Rights ( Northern Territory) Act, Mr Rowland, Q.C., pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> The Land Council is funded in part from royalty type payments received from mining on Aboriginal land (section 64 (1) and section 35 (1)). </PARA>
<PARA>This is his opinion:</PARA>
<PARA> It may at times be seen to have a financial interest that could temper the objectivity of its advice to the traditional owner. </PARA>
<PARA>It is regrettable that, given the amendments to the Act contained in this legislation, there has been no attempt by the Government either to act on the Rowland recommendations or to initiate discussion of these recommendations with Aboriginal communities or within land councils. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the Rowland recommendations on land councils, at pages 54 and 55 of his report. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Land Councils</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I have already indicated earlier the areas of concern that relate primarily to the conflict of interest situation that can arise where:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a Land Council acts for several parties that may have different views and interests relating to proposals that affect more than one party; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Land Council is funded in part from royalty type payments received from mining on Aboriginal land (s. 64(1) and s.35 (1)). It may at times be seen to have a financial interest that could temper the objectivity of its advice to the traditional owner. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to (a) above, I would suggest that either the local Land Trust or the Aboriginal owners and communities be given executive power to seek their own independent advice and do their own negotiations, subject to overriding approval , or otherwise by the Land Council and the minister before any agreement can be finalised, with the Land Council holding the balance to decide between conflicting views or interests where consent is not a requisite. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been told by senior officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs that the suggestion that Land Councils be relieved of their function to negotiate on behalf of Aboriginal groups would, in their view, be a departure from a basic principle established under the Act. Clearly also Woodward J. place great emphasis on the role of the Land Councils in this regard. I do not intend to debate whether this is a basic principle or not. I believe there are practical as well as philosophical difficulties in this area and I see a need for a change of emphasis. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to (b) above, I would suggest that the Land Councils should be funded from consolidated revenue or from the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account; the main thrust being that their funds be not linked directly to the amount of royalty type payments received. No doubt the 30% of the amount paid by the Commonwealth could still be paid to the Land Council for payment to the Aboriginal groups in the area affected (sections 64 and 35). I have mentioned earlier that I am told that there will be sufficient funds available for the purposes of negotiation without relying upon future royalty type payments. It may be thought that this is sufficient to overcome the problem I have raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding will also be required for the local groups referred to under item(a).</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that this would retain the original concept of the Land Councils , enable them to be seen to be completely independent and objective, and at the same time it would give some standing and autonomy to the local groups. </PARA>
<PARA> It is outside my competence to deal in detail with the administrative procedures that this would entail but I cannot foresee that they would pose any great problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. In his speech in the Senate supporting the Bill, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) indicated that the stage had been reached in negotiations between Pancontinental Mining Ltd and the Northern Land Council that the Council was now going back to the traditional owners to explain the agreement to them and to ensure-to quote him-'that it has their agreement'. He indicated that he, as the Minister, must be satisfied that appropriate information is available to traditional owners to enable them to make the judgment which they are required to make under the Act. I wonder how serious is the Minister. I wonder how serious is the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I wonder how serious are we, as a Parliament, when, at the same time as these discussions are taking place, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Government have given approval for the sale of uranium from Jabiluka even before the traditional owners have allowed mining to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does not that decision, which has been publicised, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory knows, throughout the Northern Territory, reduce the process which the Minister describes under the Act to a charade? Does not such action reinforce the attitude that is to be found within Aboriginal communities right throughout the Northern Territory, that is, that irrespective of any opposition that they might have to mining, their values and their views will be overridden by a government determined to have mining, a government that prefers to achieve its mining objectives by a legal charade that could project the view that Aboriginal approval to mining is an approval that is freely given. The decision taken by the Deputy Prime Minister is to be deplored. It is just one more additional pressure designed to produce agreement from traditional owners. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking of requirements under the Act and the appropriate methods and procedures, Mr Pratt, who is now a Queen's Counsel, said in the 1977 issue of Habitat:</PARA>
<PARA> Among the important duties of the Land Council is that of consultation with the traditional owners of Aboriginal land before any decision is made in respect to that land. This removes the responsibilities from miners and government alike in establishing in any given place at any given time precisely with whom they should be negotiating. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If the right people are not brought together and given an opportunity of consultation in their own time and unless they are given adequate assistance in reaching a decision, including due explanation of any proposal, then it cannot be said-</PARA>
<PARA>Let me repeat that-</PARA>
<PARA>it cannot be said that true Aboriginal consent or dissent has been obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>He says later in the article:</PARA>
<PARA> Time is needed for consultation and experimentation. It should be emphasised that it is not likely that the same measures will suit all clans or communities.</PARA>
<PARA>So Mr Pratt is as aware as the honourable member for the Northern Territory of the diversities in attitude within Aboriginal communities on this very important question. </PARA>
<PARA> Those very commendable sentiments seem to have been abandoned recently by Mr Pratt, who during the Koongara debate publicly entered the political arena on behalf of the Government to rebuke the shadow Minister responsible for the environment and conservation. The honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) has referred to that. I thought that it was strange at the time that a Queen's Counsel acting on behalf of the Northern Land Council would seek to involve himself in what was an area of public political controversy. I presumed that he was acting on instructions. It was not until I was in Oenpelli some time later that I learned that the relevant meeting of the traditional owners had not yet taken place, so there was no way that Mr Pratt could be said to be acting on their instructions when he sent the telex to the Minister which was quoted in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that that highlights the dilemma in which traditional owners find themselves. Under the Act, traditional owners have to be advised on the range and the options available to them. One of those options is a non-mining option. On the evidence, I do not believe-nor do I think that the honourable member for Northern Territory would believe it if he talked to traditional owners; nor do I believe that the Minister would believe it if he examined what is happening on the ground-that anyone could honestly reach the conclusion that the no-mining option has ever been seriously available to traditional owners. My discussion with them confirms that. I am not arguing that there may not be some Aboriginals who favour mining. But what seems to me to have emerged in this situation is a new form of legal paternalism in which negotiations are entered into by legal advisers for and on behalf of the Northern Land Council and when, after Mr Pratt has reached what he regards as satisfactory arrangements with the mining companies-who, after all, ultimately pay his fees-considerable pressures are applied to traditional owners to give their approval and to comply with those agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, I for one am sick to death of reading in the southern Press articles about black nomad millionaires and about the large sums of money received by some Aboriginals, so that within the white community there is the view that there is a whole group of tribal Aboriginals wandering around the Northern Territory who can write a cheque as if they were Saudi Arabian oil sheiks. I say this on the facts: In any agreement signed to date no traditional owner has received financial benefits which would compare in any way favourably with the fees that have been received by the lawyers who have negotiated these agreements . I am concerned that these legal advisers are so confident of the benefits of their negotiations that considerable pressures are applied on traditional owners to have them concur with whatever agreements have been reached with mining companies. One such owner was so concerned about the future of his land and the pressure placed upon him and his family that he wrote a letter to the Northern Land Council. I will read only sections of it but I seek leave to incorporate the whole letter in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>The Chairman,</PARA>
<PARA>Bureau of the Northern Land Council,</PARA>
<PARA>P.O. Box 3046,</PARA>
<PARA>Darwin, NT 5794</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> We had a meeting today. Chris Haynes came out to check up on what I have been saying. He said I should write to you and tell you myself. </PARA>
<PARA> My father's father lived on this land. He was the King of the Gagudju. He looked after this land and the people who lived on it. My father was all the same. Now it is my responsibility. I am an owner for this land. We all together look after this land, the managers and the owners. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been telling people for a long time about our land but they haven't been hearing us. They listen but they haven't been hearing us. This has happened many times but still they don't understand. </PARA>
<PARA> We can't wait any more. Everybody is pushing us. Pushing, pushing, pushing. Now they want us to sign but they don't understand what it means for us. This is our life. Everybody said 'You're asking far too much money. You Aboriginal people have got to have good reasons for asking for a lot of money. What do you want this money for?'</PARA>
<PARA> Now I'll ask you one question. How much is your life worth? How much do I have to pay you so I can take your life away? People will say that we are just trying to make trouble now and stop everything, but we don't want trouble. We just want you to understand what we are giving up . . . our life. It will cost Pancon money. It will cost us our life. </PARA>
<PARA> We know you don't understand by the things you ask us to do. We can't tell you all our sacred sites, like you want us to because you don't understand. How can a fence protect our culture. Our culture is more than a painting on a rock. You even think that all our culture is there painted on a rock for everybody to see. We've got big places. Some for men. Some for women. We've got places where we make boys into young men. </PARA>
<PARA> We've got places where our ancestors came when they made the land and gave us our language and songs. How can you think that your fences can save our culture. We need more than fences. We need understanding but you haven't got that yet. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not trying to stop you. I know you have been trying but you are all the time pushing and wanting us to sign. Some ceremonies take six years or seven years, but you have only given us six months or seven months to negotiate. </PARA>
<PARA> These rocks, they've been here for millions of years. We are only new. We have only been here for forty, maybe fifty thousand years. You have only just come here. You don't even know the place yet. </PARA>
<PARA> So, we are still responsible and this is what we say. Because you don't understand, we have asked others to write the story for our places. They sit, they listen. We tell them and they understand. We asked one man, Stephen Davis, to tell those men how we feel but you didn't listen. We didn't want trouble. We just want you to understand. We don't know what is wrong with you. We tell you the truth. We are always straight with you. But now we must do something ourselves. We have seen what happened to others when mining came too quickly. They've lost. They're getting skinny. They don't believe in that mining any more . We don't want that to happen to us and so we have asked for our stories to be written. We want our sacred places to stay as they are. We want to make sure they are protected. They are our culture. They are our life. When our stories are written we will tell them ourselves. We cannot tell you our sacred things but we can teach you with the outside stories that are written down. </PARA>
<PARA> We want you to understand this so that we can work together. </PARA>

<PARA>I find that a singularly sad, moving and eloquent letter which highlights the plight of one traditional owner and stands as stark testimony to the pressures upon him. It is not just a matter of pressure upon him. Pressure has been applied to individuals whose personal association with this traditional owner, Mr Neiiji, has made them targets-targets of Mr Pratt, the learned Queen's Counsel who is acting for and on behalf of the Northern Land Council. If the Minister cares to inquire he will learn that one of the younger, more dedicated park rangers responsible for Aboriginal training schemes in the National Parks and Wildlife Service recently was called back from leave to meet false charges levelled against him by Mr Pratt. I invite the Minister to make that examination . </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, if the Minister inquires he will be informed that by virtue of the assistance provided by Mr Davis-who is mentioned in Mr Neiiji's letter-to Mr Neiiji to write his story, the story of his land and his relationship with his land, the Sacred Sites Authority was approached and told it should terminate any relationship it had with Mr Davis, again on the basis of representations made by the enthusiastic Mr Pratt. I do not know whether these representations are made on Mr Pratt's own initiative or whether he regards that as part of a continuing brief for his client. I doubt whether there is any resolution or minute on the records of the Northern Land Council to justify these actions by senior counsel who seems to be confused as to where his duties lie. On Mr Pratt's own analysis the relationship of his clients must also include traditional owners. If perhaps there is some conflict between the interests of the Northern Land Council and the traditional owners then the Minister should be paying close attention to the recommendations of Mr Rowland which would enable, through the Northern Land Council, separate legal representation for traditional owners. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister's undertakings are to be taken seriously, I invite him, not at the conclusion of the negotiations but now, to examine the comprehension and the understanding of the traditional owners of agreements that are already initialled. I had discussions last weekend with some traditional owners as to their understanding and their comprehension. If the Minister can say to this House that the traditional owners are in a state of real knowledge in respect of those agreements then the Minister would be deluding himself. In fairness to all the parties concerned, areas of understanding, of trust and of comprehension by traditional owners of their rights and entitlements, should have been established at the earliest point of the negotiations. The fact is that they were not. The fact is that the Government is so anxious to push mining development in the face of declining markets that it is prepared to allow standards to prevail which would not operate and which would not be accepted at any other level of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The time is well overdue when we must do more than pay lip service to Aboriginal hopes and aspirations and like the honourable member for the Northern Territory believe that we have satisfied those aspirations by standing up and quoting some general sum of money which will be flowing to Aboriginal people. The glib assertions to be found in the honourable member's speech and in the Minister's speech may well satisfy a compliant back bench which is committed to mining on traditional Aboriginal land but it will not satisfy the hopes of the Aboriginal people of Australia. It certainly will not satisfy the members of the Opposition, the Australian Labor Party. The Aboriginal Land Rights Act gave important rights to traditional owners and placed important responsibilities upon the Northern Land Council. It is the Minister's responsibility to see that those rights are protected and it is the Minister's responsibility to see that those responsibilities vested in the Northern Land Council are effectively discharged. </PARA>
<PARA> The relationship which exists between this Government, this Parliament, this nation and its Aboriginal people is moving to a point where increasingly it is inviting the scrutiny of the Western world. It is important-it is overdue-that in developing those relationships we see that many of the basic concepts which were contained in the Aboriginal Land Rights Act are maintained. It is important also that while giving due recognition to the many things that have been achieved we realise that in meeting the debts which Australian society owes to the Aboriginal people, who are still the most oppressed group in Australian society, we will not settle for the smug rhetoric which has been expressed by the Minister in respect of this Bill and which has been expressed by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I take the opportunity in concluding this debate to address a few remarks to the House. So many things have been put by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) as fact. Let me just put to the House some real facts. Firstly, the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) tried to assert that this legislation was being put to the Parliament in order to enable the Jabiluka project to be given the go-ahead. The assertion was that without this legislation the project could not be given approval by the Aboriginals or by the Government. That assertion by the honourable member is simply not correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position was very plainly put by my colleague, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), in the Senate on 18 March as recorded at page 758 of the Senate Hansard of that date. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator raises the question about whether I need this clause to be passed to enable the Jabiluka project to go ahead. The short answer to that is no, it is not necessary for this clause to be passed. The Jabiluka area can be granted once the appropriate survey work is completed. The Jabiluka project could go ahead whether or not this amendment is passed. In fact, the purpose of this amendment is to put beyond doubt the capacity of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to make progressive grants. The purpose of that is to ensure that Aboriginals are not disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA>So the beneficial reason for this legislation is to favour Aboriginals so that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs may make progressive grants of title in respect of Aboriginal land. My colleague went on to explain the kind of circumstances in which it would be beneficial to be able to make those progressive grants of land. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me state one other incontrovertible fact. The Northern Land Council has not reached any agreement for the mining of this land. Consultations are still proceeding. If honourable members, particularly the honourable member for Cunningham and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, know the requirements of the Aboriginal land rights legislation they will know that before an agreement to mine can be consummated the consent of the traditional owners is required to any agreement reached by the Northern Land Council. That is stipulated by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE6">Mr VINER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The third fact is-the legislation also stipulates this-that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is required to be satisfied that a land council, in this case the Northern Land Council, has itself satisfied the requirements of the Act. That, as I have pointed out, required consultation with the Northern Land Council. But it is more than consultation. It requires the consent of the traditional owners to any agreement proposed to be entered into for mining on Aboriginal land. I can speak not only from a knowledge of what the Act itself requires but also from personal experience having been directly involved in the preparation and passage of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and in the negotiations which were conducted by the Northern Land Council with the Government and the Ranger mining companies with respect to the Ranger uranium mining development. So I have some personal knowledge of the lengths to which the Northern Land Council goes to consult with traditional owners, to ascertain their views and to be satisfied that they consent to the agreement negotiated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose 'hypocrisy' is a word that is very lightly used in this place. Indeed , it ought not be used at all because it is unparliamentary. So I do not use that word. But I make this point, having listended to the honourable member for Cunningham being critical of white people who provide technical and expert assistance on a proper professional and commercial basis to the Northern Land Council. Of course, we heard in this place the derisive comment by the honourable member for Cunningham about hired silks. The hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party really does seem to know no bounds because have honourable members opposite forgotten that white lawyers fought hard, honourably and properly on behalf of Aboriginal people to achieve Aboriginal land rights and see legislation of this kind passed by this Parliament? Do they forget that Mr Justice Woodward, who provided the report which is the foundation of Aboriginal land rights, was himself a lawyer? Do they forget that Mr Justice Brennan, a distinguished member of the High Court of Australia, and previously a leading counsel of the Woodward Commission, is the father of Aboriginal land rights? If they look at the Bill annexed to the Woodward Aboriginal Land Rights Commission report they will see what distinguished legal work he carried out. He is a white lawyer. Do they forget the example of the work that was done by Geoff Eames for the Central Land Council? He is a white lawyer. Do they forget the work done by Phillip Toyne, a white lawyer who did so much to achieve land rights for the Pitjantjatjara people of South Australia? He was responsible for legislation that the Tonkin Government placed before the South Australian Parliament. It seems to me that the Australian Labor Party so quickly and so easily forgets the work of these white lawyers when it so quickly seeks to condemn those who are being properly employed and who are properly working for the Northern Land Council today. </PARA>
<PARA> The attack by the Opposition has not been launched against this Bill. Rather, it has been launched against the prospect of further uranium mining in the Northern Territory. One wonders where the Opposition's support for Aboriginals begins and where its vehement opposition to uranium mining ends. I have gone through that experience before. I have heard before all the sorts of things that members of the Opposition have said this afternoon. I have observed at first hand the lengths to which members of the Opposition will go in the vehemence of their opposition to uranium mining to prevent Aboriginals in the Northern Territory, through their own body-the Northern Land Council which is an all- Aboriginal body-conducting negotiations and consultations with traditional owners in a proper way having due and proper regard for the interests of those traditional owners and the necessity to communicate with them, to take that approach cautiously and carefully and at great length to see that they understand and know before any consent is given. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the position of Big Bill Neiiji. I understand that his letter, which has been incorporated in Hansard, has been published in the Northern Territory. I am quite sure that Big Bill, as a traditional owner, will be heard and will be listened to by the Northern Land Council and I am quite sure that before the Council agrees to anything with Pancontinental Mining Ltd for mining at Jabiluka it will be satisfied that the traditional owners collectively consent to whatever is proposed. I ought to make the point, as members of the Opposition have tried to attack my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), that the Government proceeded to give the project approval conditional upon the conclusion of an agreement by the Northern Land Council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Social Services Act with respect to the payment of the family allowance to certain temporary residents of Australia, the waiting periods for unemployment and sickness benefits and the recovery of a sickness benefit from compensation payments. It also contains a number of minor technical and machinery amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members are aware, family allowance is payable to parents residing in Australia who have the custody, care and control of children under the age of 16 or who have dependent full time student children aged between 16 and 25. In the case of parents not born Australia, and where there is no clear intention to reside here permanently, family allowance is payable after residence in Australia for 12 months. Under these provisions, family allowance is payable to diplomats and consuls and their non-locally-engaged staff, also to overseas armed forces personnel who are not attached to the Australian forces, and the close families of these persons. Such persons have no real claim on the Australian community for the support of their children. Rather, they are the responsibility of their own governments. It was never envisaged that the family allowance scheme should encompass the support of people in these circumstances and it is considered appropriate that the eligibility which these people have at present should be removed. Similarly, as the law stands at present, family allowance is payable with respect to the children of a person who is a prohibited immigrant and has entered or remained in Australia without approval. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill renders such persons ineligible to receive family allowance. If, of course, the position of a prohibited immigrant is regularised under the provisions of the Migration Act, thus rendering him eligible to remain in Australia, his exclusion from family allowance would cease. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards diplomatic personnel, I mention that there are situations in which certain countries are represented by honorary consuls who are Australian citizens or permanent residents. The amendment in the Bill will not apply to such persons as the exclusion is expressly limited to persons in the relevant categories who are not Australian citizens or permanent residents. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the provisions in the Bill which will modify the operation of the rules which specify the day from which unemployment and sickness benefits are payable. New administrative arrangements were made last year under which claims for unemployment benefit are lodged with the Department of Social Security rather than the Commonwealth Employment Service as was previously the case. Unemployment benefit is payable from 7 days after the date the person became unemployed, or 7 days after the date he makes a claim, whichever is the later. It has become apparent that, in some circumstances, an unavoidable delay occurs between the time an unemployed person registers as unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service and obtains a claim form for unemployment benefit, and the time that the claim is lodged with the Department of Social Security. Where, for instance, people in rural areas receive and submit claims by post, the lodging of this form with the Department of Social Security may be delayed. As a result, entitlement to unemployment benefit is delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that, where a person registers as unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service, and his claim for unemployment benefit is made within 14 days of the date of that registration, he will be regarded as having made a claim on the day on which he registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. In special cases, such as where mails or travel are disrupted by floods , bush fires, industrial disputes etcetera, the Director-General will be able to extend the period of 14 days, thus further minimising any adverse effect of the claim being delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the provisions of the Social Services Act relating to the waiting period for sickness benefit. Generally, under the existing provisions a claimant for sickness benefit is required to serve a seven-day waiting period before entitlement to benefit commences provided he has not already served such a waiting period in the previous 13 weeks. There are people who suffer from chronic illnesses who require treatment or who otherwise become incapacitated for work in respect of the same sickness at periods longer than 13 weeks. In these cases a claimant is requires to serve a second waiting period on recurrence of the incapacity. This can cause hardship where such people have exhausted their sick leave entitlements and have no other means of support during the waiting period. The Bill rectifies this situation by providing that the waiting period may be waived in respect of a recurring incapacity which is connected with the cause of a previous incapacity in respect of which sickness benefit was paid. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the provisions of Division 3A of Part VII of the Act. These provisions were enacted in 1979 but have not been proclaimed because of a number of administrative and machinery deficiencies. The principles embodied in Division 3A extend the principles already contained in section 115 of the Social Services Act and are not new. Section 115 provides that, if compensation is received for the same incapacity as that which qualifies a person for sickness benefit, and it is paid for the same period in respect of which he is qualified to receive sickness benefit, the rate of the benefit normally payable for that period is reduced by the amount of the relevant part of the compensation. Similarly, sickness benefit may be recovered where the compensation is subsequently paid for the same period for which sickness benefit has been paid. Typically, this occurs where a person receives sickness benefit whilst awaiting settlement of a compensation claim, and some or all of the sickness benefit paid is recovered on settlement. These provisions ensure that a person does not receive a 'double payment' in respect of an incapacity for work and that responsibility for maintaining the incapacitated worker is properly borne by the third party liable to pay compensation, rather than the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 115 does have a number of shortcomings and these shortcomings have been exploited to circumvent the recovery provisions to which I have made reference. It was in order to address these problems that Division 3A was enacted in 1979 to strengthen and clarify that provision where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Division 3A has itself been found to have a number of deficiencies. It was because of a concern that the division would not be as effective as intended that there has been delay in bringing its provisions into operation. For example , Division 3A as drafted would not encompass compensation payable under 'no- fault' motor accident schemes because its terms are restricted to cases where compensation arises by reason of a judgment of a court or an agreement in settlement of a claim. The amendments will remove this restriction. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing Division 3A also makes for cumbersome administration in some respects. The provisions under which notices relating to recovery of sickness benefit are given to the parties involved require the same notices to be given to both an insurer and a third party. Experience has shown that third parties who are insured do not wish to become involved in these matters, and the amendments provide that it is necessary to give notices only to the insurer. This will reflect the position at present under section 115, and avoid both costs to third parties and in administration. The amendments also enable notices to be given more efficiently, so that a more effective service is provided to insurers subject to the legislation. At present, notices under Division 3A would have to be given only by post. The amendments will enable the Director-General to give a notice to an insurer over the counter, in appropriate circumstances. This will also reflect the current position under section 115. </PARA>
<PARA> A further amendment changes the way in which the Director-General directs that compensation is to be taken into account in these situations. The existing Division 3A requires the Director-General to give a direction as to the rate of sickness benefit to be paid. This is cumbersome, because the rate of sickness benefit may alter for other reasons, such as a receipt of income, and a new direction would be necessary. The amendments require the Director-General to give a direction as to the amount by which sickness benefit is to be reduced in taking account of compensation. If the rate of sickness benefit alters for other reasons, it will not be necessary to make a new direction. Other amendments remove a number of other deficiencies in Division 3A of a machinery nature. As I have said, the Bill also contains machinery or administrative changes to other parts of the Act, as well as a substantial number of minor or formal amendments of a drafting nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to 1972, the Department of Social Security was known as the Department of Social Services. The Social Services Act has not been amended to reflect this change of name. The Bill therefore proposes to change the title of the Act to the Social Security Act and the title of the Director-General of Social Services to the Director-General of Social Security. References to other specific offices within the Department will also be similarly amended. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's initiative in 1976 in introducing a new system of family allowances is not fully reflected in the terminology of the Act. The Bill replaces a number of out-dated references to 'child endowment' with references to 'family allowance'. The Bill also incorporates an amendment to clarify the entitlement of institutions to family allowance in respect of dependent, full time students between the ages of 16 and 25. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment will extend the notification provisions of the Act with respect to handicapped child's allowance, where the child has left the home in which he or she was receiving constant care and attention. This will ensure that the person with continuing entitlement to allowance is identified at an early stage. A schedule to the Bill proposes amendments which will remove some technical inconsistencies in the legislation and bring the legislative drafting style into line with current practice. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In my ministerial statement to this House on 'Wage Determination and Industrial Relations' on 16 February, I informed the House that I intended to introduce a number of legislative initiatives. I now present a Bill to the House about matters that I then foreshadowed. The Bill contains a number of elements but its philosophy can be distilled to three main themes: Protection of the rights of the individual; to provide a better balance in the powers, rights and duties of employers and employees; and to open the door to movement from within the work force so that present union rigidities and monopolies are loosened and structures created which are more suited to a modern economy and representative negotiations between employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me develop these themes and outline to the House how the Bill will give effect to the Government's aims. Fundamental to the Government's approach is its belief that the expression and pursuit of democratic freedoms, including the rights of association and the withholding of labour, and the operation of free institutions, such as trade unions, cannot survive in the absence of law. Our industrial relations system assists in setting a base from which behaviour patterns can develop which are acceptable to the majority and which in turn foster a strong, progressive nation. The notion that for some reason unions are so different that they and the conduct of their members should stand beyond the law is untenable and at the root of much of the industrial trouble Australia has experienced in recent years. There are constitutional limits on the Commonwealth 's industrial relations powers although there may be more room to make new laws than we have given the Constitution credit for in the past. In the life of this Government we have already acted within our legislative power to protect the public interest. We have legislated to ensure that rank and file union members have a greater say in union affairs and, to this end, are provided with full information on their union's financial affairs. We have strengthened the provisions for secret ballots. We have provided a method of seeking rapid deregistration where a union threatens the safety, health or welfare of the public. We have also strengthened our own hand in dealing with unreasonable industrial action by employees of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, by this Bill, proposing legislation in support of the principle of voluntary unionism and the restructuring of unions away from a craft and occupational basis. We are also legislating to give employers the automatic right to stand down employees who cannot be usefully employed as a result of industrial action. These proposals reflect so far as is reasonable the points raised by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and employer representatives at two meetings of the National Labour Consultative Council. </PARA>
<PARA>Voluntary Unionism</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Legislation for voluntary unionism is a firm policy of the Government parties. In our liberal democratic society individuals should have the right to decide whether or not they want to join a union. If they do not they should be protected by the law. This Bill will give them that protection. If they do so, they are encouraged to play a responsible and active part in their union's affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody should be under any pressure to join a trade union. There should be a completely free choice of whether to join or not to join a union. This is a central feature of the Bill now before the House. It introduces to the principal Act this right of choice. It removes from the jurisdiction of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the power to grant preference to unionists and it provides avenues of redress against both employers and unions in the event of victimisation of individuals who do not want to join a union. </PARA>
<PARA> The objects of the Act will be amended to declare positively the principle of voluntary unionism. By the Bill, an employer or a union will be prohibited from disadvantaging, to use a general description, an employee or prospective employee not wishing to belong to a union. A person will be able to defend his or her freedom of choice by a right to seek compensation in the Federal Court of Australia for loss or damage suffered as a result of action taken to force him or her to join a union. We are providing that, where an employer is the subject of compensation proceedings and considers that a union's conduct has induced the employer to take the action for which he is being proceeded against, the union may be joined as a party to those proceedings. It would then be open to the Court to give judgment against the union instead of the employer or partly against the union and partly against the employer. It may be of interest to honourable members to note that this is consistent with provisions passed recently in the United Kingdom Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Stand-downs</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the provisions in the Bill relating to stand-downs. Increasingly, strikes and bans from plant to plant or industrial action by small key groups of workers have been used to put intense economic pressure on a single employer, a whole industry or the whole community. In circumstances of this character, an employer simply has no work for his employees. The employer's capacity to resist a strike or other industrial action is reduced to nothing, because the wages bill goes on running. Protection is needed in that situation and the Government intends to provide it. If unions are to have, as a basic principle, the right to strike then it is surely not unreasonable for employers to have at their individual disposal, the right to protect their commercial interests in circumstances where they are put at risk by union action. </PARA>
<PARA> Strikes, and other forms of industrial action, do not simply affect the businesses of those directly subject to that action. They affect also other businesses and other employees dependent upon the goods and services of the business being disrupted. As the community has come to appreciate to its cost and often to its despair, industrial action in one place ripples widely throughout society. The law has long recognised, by awards of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, that workers who are not on strike but who cannot be usefully employed because of action elsewhere, may be stood-down without pay. But the processes to be followed are, in many instances, cumbersome and involve delays. The terms of the stand-down award may not in the end be commensurate with the industrial pressure being exerted leaving the employer lamenting that the law and the circumstances leave him defenceless. </PARA>
<PARA> Using a blend of constitutional powers, the Bill extends to employers the direct right-I emphasise that-to stand-down employees who cannot be usefully employed because of industrial action. The decision to stand-down will be the decision of the employer according to the circumstances with which he is faced. There may be circumstances in which employers would wish to use the processes available presently through the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Bill gives employers the choice between doing that or using the new provisions. However, the Commission will not be able to limit the rights of employers under these new provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Industry Unions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the proposals relating to industry unions. There is a widely held community view that the craft system of union organisation is increasingly creating difficulties for the sensible operation of industrial relations. Craft and conglomerate unionism has resulted in a situation where most industries and many enterprises face a multiplicity of unions. Union amalgamation of itself is not sufficient to improve this situation substantially. Much of the past discussion about amalgamation of unions failed to distinguish between the objective of allowing the creation of industry unions and amalgamations which create bigger conglomerate craft unions, the membership of which straddles a number of industries. Encouragement of the development of unions along these lines will not, in the Government's view, assist in reducing the level of industrial disputes to any significant degree. The record of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union is testimony to that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's long-standing objective, expressed in our industrial relations platform, is the encouragement of industry based unions. It is also the objective of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. This legislation faces up to the need for change by providing a legislative framework which will facilitate the restructuring of unions into fewer industry based organisations. The Government is well aware that the development of industry based unions will not be an easy process or one that will take place overnight. However, a start has to be made. Within the trade union movement itself and amongst employers there is evidence of interest in some industries that unions should be industry based. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill defines an industry for the purpose of registration of an industry union as the business, trade, manufacture, undertaking or calling of employers. It is proposed to leave to regulations the prescription of classes of industry for which a union can be formed to enable discussions to be held with the ACTU and employers as the process of change is initiated. In this way the development of industry unions can occur in consultation with unions and employers directly involved and the peak employer and union bodies. To obtain registration an association of employees will need to satisfy the Registrar that the members are employed in a single industry and that they constitute a substantial majority of the total number of persons employed in that industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for regulations to be made to allow for a secret ballot to be held of employees in an industry to test whether a substantial majority wish to form or join an association seeking registration as an industry union. The Government also is making provision for an existing union to become an industry union by the process of changing its rules to enable the absorption of employees who would not otherwise be eligible to become members. However, an existing organisation, seeking to establish itself on an industry basis, will have to satisfy the Industrial Registrar that the rule changes are authentic and have been democratically endorsed within the organisation. Where an amalgamation of unions would result in the formation of an industry union, special conditions will apply to facilitate that amalgamation. </PARA>
<PARA> The present requirement that in a ballot to approve an amalgamation at least one half of the persons on the roll of voters must vote and, of those voting formally, more than one half must vote in favour of the amalgamation, will be relaxed. Where an amalgamation would result in the formation of an industry union, and only that in that case, not less than one quarter of the persons on the roll of voters will need to vote, and of those voting formally more than one half must vote in favour of the amalgamation. This particular provision is drawn from earlier recommendations made to me by the National Labour Consultative Council about the amalgamation processes of the Act. These provisions of the Bill are seen by the Government as a first step in the process of encouraging the formation of industry unions. We will naturally be watching their application and development closely and be ready to adapt or change them in the light of experience. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not included in this Bill any provision for the formation of enterprise unions of which I have spoken in this House and to other audiences. The Government's proposals in this area are being further developed in consultation with employer and union groups. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Provisions of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> There will continue to be, unless the situation is remedied, problems in relation to the deregistration of organisations under both the State and Commonwealth systems. This Bill is intended to cover the situation where a union tries to play off one industrial relations system against another in circumstances where a State union is deregistered in its own jurisdiction. A State union will not be able to move into the Federal jurisdiction to avoid the consequences of its industrial misbehaviour in a State jurisdiction and the discipline of that jurisdiction. These proposals have been introduced at the request of the Western Australian Government. To operate, this part of the Bill requires reciprocal State legislation. I will be raising this with my colleagues , the State Ministers for labour. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments are made by this Bill to provide for greater certainty in the administration of unions where casual vacancies arise. There are situations in which it may be desirable for a vacancy to be filled by appointment, rather than by election. The amendment will permit a casual vacancy to be filled by appointment, provided that the unexpired portion of the term of office is less than 12 months. Special provision is made in the case of appointment to a casual vacancy in an electoral college. At present, the rules of an organisation do not permit a person to be elected to hold an office for a period exceeding four years, without being re-elected. The Government has accepted representations from the ACTU, through the National Labour Consultative Council, that this requirement is unduly harsh when officers are approaching retiring age. The Bill , therefore, proposes that the rules of an organisation may permit the holder of a full time office, who is due to retire within a period of 12 months after the expiration of the period for which he was elected, to remain in office until he retires. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with what I said earlier about encouraging democratic control of organisations registered under the Act, the Government has decided to enlarge the scope for financial assistance to parties to proceedings in the Federal Court in cases involving that principle. The opportunity has been taken of consolidating the financial assistance provisions in the Act. The Bill also introduces new procedural arrangements to simplify the application of the Territories of variations to common rules made in the Commission. These arise from discussion of this matter in the National Labour Consultative Council. These principal legislative initiatives which I bring before the House-voluntary unionism, an employer's statutory right of stand down and the formation of industry unions-are the start of a program of reform of the Australian industrial relations system. There is much to be done. As I said to the House in my ministerial statement on 16 February last, ultimately reform of industrial relations in Australia needs to go further than simplifying and restructuring what we now have. It is as challenging a cause as any which faces Australia. This Bill tackles three principal areas of current interest. It is based on the philosophy, policies and objectives of the Government parties. The Bill confronts no one. It looks to strengthening the rights of individuals, bringing into balance the rights of unions and employers and opens the door to the restructuring of union organisation in this country. I therefore commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a short Bill, Mr Deputy Speaker, and a simple one. It follows from what is provided in the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill, to give effect to the Government's intentions about the voluntary nature of union membership and preference to unionism. The Bill declares void any award determination or agreement which makes provision relating to the employment of persons by reference to membership of an association. It withdraws powers to make provision for preference by reference to membership of an association. It is therefore designed to put into effect in the area of Commonwealth Government employment the principles proposed in the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before the House will make important changes to both the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act. Firstly, the House will be pleased to know that the National Health Act will be amended to authorise the provision, by the Commonwealth, of free vaccine for immunisation against the disease of mumps. The inclusion of a mumps vaccine at Commonwealth expense in the immunisation programs presently conducted by the States and Territories complies with the principles of good public health and is an indication of the Government's continuing concern to safeguard and improve public health. It is proposed to substitute a combined measles-mumps vaccine for the measles vaccine currently being provided. The combined vaccine will be administered to children at 12 months of age in accordance with the childhood immunisation schedule recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council. It is anticipated that around 342,000 children will be immunised in a full year with the new vaccine. At today's prices of $4.65 per dose, the Government will be contributing $1.5m a year to the new immunisation program. Although this will, in part, be offset by the phasing out of the single measles vaccine, the additional expenditure at today's prices will be in the order of $1m each year. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the proposed changes to the health insurance arrangements. Honourable members will be aware of the considerable attention that has recently been focused on what is commonly described as medical benefits fraud by medical practitioners. This Bill contains new measures which will present a very strong deterrent against such abuse. It is now possible to estimate, from statistics compiled, that the extent of fraud and overservicing by some members of the medical profession is of the order of at least $100m a year in medical benefits, of which about half is attributable to fraud and half to overservicing. My references to fraud relate to such matters as making claims for services that were not provided, whereas my references to overservicing relate to the provision of services which were not reasonably necessary. Before proceeding to outline the provisions relating to fraud, I wish to place clearly on record the Government's view that it is a minority of the medical profession which is abusing the health insurance system. It is for that reason that I believe these provisions will have the support of the majority of medical practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> In commercial terms, medical practitioners are in a virtually unique position. The financial structure of their practices is largely underwritten by the medical benefits scheme which is publicly financed through both taxation and medical benefits fund contributions. Furthermore, most patients are generally not in a position to question the correctness of medical accounts. The operation of the medical benefits scheme is therefore very heavily dependent upon the trustworthiness of medical practitioners. The existing health insurance legislation already contains provisions for penalties in the form of imprisonment or fines to be imposed by the courts on practitioners convicted of medical benefits fraud. However, those provisions do not take into account what might be termed the commercial aspects of such fraud. Furthermore, there are sometimes substantial practical difficulties faced by the prosecution in obtaining what might reasonably be considered to be adequate penalties in medical benefits fraud cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that a medical practitioner who has been proved to have committed medical benefits fraud on two or more charges is guilty of a most serious breach of trust and should be dealt with accordingly. It believes that this serious breach of trust warrants the exclusion of that practitioner from the financial benefits of the medical benefits arrangements for a substantial period. Accordingly, this Bill contains provisions under which services by a practitioner who has been found by a court to have committed medical benefits fraud on two or more charges will not attract payment of medical benefits for a period of three years. I must emphasise that there will be adequate provision for appeal. First, in relation to the initial findings by the court, the practitioner has the usual rights of appeal to a higher court. Furthermore, before a first disqualification for medical benefits purposes comes into effect, the practitioner concerned may apply to the Minister for a review of the disqualification. In the course of any first period of disqualification, the practitioner may again seek a review of that disqualification by the Minister. The Minister will be empowered, upon any such application, to modify the disqualification by reference to several matters, including: A reduction of the period of disqualification from three years to some shorter period; permitting the continued payment of medical benefits for certain specified types of services; permitting the continued payment of medical benefits in respect of services to specified groups of persons or services in specified places, such as hospitals. Provision will also be made allowing an appeal by a practitioner to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of a decision by the Minister on an application made to him for modification of a disqualification. </PARA>
<PARA> I should point out to the House that the provisions which I have outlined above concerning ministerial reviews of disqualifications apply only in respect of a first period of disqualification. They do not apply to any subsequent disqualifications which may arise where the practitioner concerned has again had two or more medical benefits fraud offences proven. The Bill provides for the publishing and laying before each House of Parliament of a statement setting out the details and effects of the practitioner's disqualification. There is also adequate provision made for past, present and prospective patients of a disqualified practitioner to be advised of the details and effects of the disqualification. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable members to note that the provisions which I have outlined relate to cases of medical benefits fraud proven by due legal processes through courts of law. They are founded upon, and are limited to, the financial aspects of transactions through the medical benefits scheme and they stand apart from any penalties the courts may see fit to impose in relation to the criminal aspects of such cases. In order that the necessary supporting regulations and administrative arrangements may be made for the operation of these provisions, they will come into operation on a future date to be fixed by proclamation. While the Government has given priority in this Bill to the problem of fraud, it is also very concerned at the extent of overservicing that is believed to occur. It intends therefore to review the existing legislation relating to overservicing and take whatever measures are shown to be necessary to control this other area of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes provisions of an administrative nature, concerning the issue of health care cards to people in the low income category as defined in the Health Insurance Act. Currently, the legislation provides for the making of a declaration that an eligible person having a low income is a disadvantaged person. Such a declaration operates for a period of six months and enables the person to obtain concessions under the health insurance arrangements. The person is deemed under the legislation to have lodged a further application for a declaration of disadvantaged person status at the end of the six months period. However, this has the practical disadvantage that a new declaration can give continuous disadvantaged person status only retrospectively. The amendment provided for in the Bill will enable the assessment of eligibility for continued disadvantaged person status over the last four weeks of the six months period and thus for a new declaration to be made before the end of that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, medical practitioners have been moving towards incorporation of their practices under company laws in order to gain certain benefits in relation to superannuation and to limit their personal liability for damages. The Department of Health has been involved in deliberations with representatives of the profession and with other interested organisations to ensure that, in relation to health benefits matters, the incorporation of medical practices does not affect the personal responsibility of practitioners for their services, and that they continue to be individually subject to the provisions of the health insurance legislation relating to the making of false statements and claims and the provision of excessive services. In principle, the Australian Medical Association has made quite clear its position on maintaining the personal professional responsibility of medical practitioners to their patients, whether or not they are employees of incorporated medical practices. </PARA>
<PARA> It is consistent with this approach that a practitioner who provides a service to a patient ought to be personally identified on any documents used in connection with the claiming of benefits. Accordingly, the Bill before the House provides that Commonwealth medical benefits are not payable in respect of a service unless these documents contain information to be prescribed by regulations. This will enable the making of regulations requiring accounts, receipts and assignment forms to bear the name of the individual practitioner who has provided the service and other associated information. Also consistent with the principle of personal accountability of practitioners are the provisions of this Bill which aim to ensure that, in the emerging situation of incorporation of medical practices, or in other employment situations, individual practitioners will continue to be subject to existing provisions concerning irregularities in connection with claims for medical benefits and controls over the provision of excessive services attracting medical benefits. The proposed new provisions will provide that, where a practitioner is an employee of an incorporated practice or some other type of employer, both he and the practice or other employer will be accountable in relation to the making of false statements or claims in respect of medical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to overservicing-that is, claiming medical benefits for medical services that are not reasonably necessary-the existing legislation provides for a system of medical services committees of inquiry. These committees are able to make recommendations that practitioners who are found to have provided excessive services should be counselled, reprimanded or required to repay benefits. The provisions of this Bill will ensure that, in proceedings before such committees of inquiry, practitioners employed by incorporated practices or other types of employers cannot, in effect, shield behind alleged directions by the incorporated practice or other employer. The incorporated practice or other employer will also be subject to the operation of these committees. However, in a case of incorporated practices, the other practitioners who are not directly involved will not be affected as individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that the basic registration of medical practitioners to practise is effected under State and Territory laws. Responsibility for ensuring the personal accountability of practitioners to their patients insofar as clinical procedures are concerned, is primarily a matter for the State and Territory authorities. The Minister for Health is therefore consulting with his State and Northern Territory colleagues with an aim of obtaining, as far as practicable, appropriate co-ordination of their registration laws and those of the Commonwealth which are concerned with medical benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for time limits to be imposed on the lodgment of claims for Commonwealth medical benefits. Claims lodged by the public on the funds will no longer be automatically accepted for payment if the service was rendered prior to the introduction of current health arrangements and more than two years have elapsed between date of service and date of lodgment. The date the current health insurance arrangements came into operation is specified as 1 September 1981 and provision exists to vary this date in the event of future changes. It should be noted that there is no intention to impose a time limit on the lodgment of claims relating to services rendered within a current scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> A time limit will also be imposed for medical benefits claims where the doctor bills the Commonwealth direct. A claim will no longer be automatically accepted for payment by the Department of Health if the claim is not lodged within six months of the service being provided. At the discretion of the Minister for Health, the time limits referred to may be extended where this is considered justified, particularly to avoid any hardship that may be caused to the claimant . A period of grace of three months will be allowed after the legislation is enacted and before the restrictions are imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already indicated, there is presently no time limit on the lodgment of any claim involving Commonwealth medical benefits. The major reasons for the imposition of time limits are the difficulties and costs currently experienced in processing 'old claims' and the opportunities for fraud and incorrect payment that the present system provides. (Quorum formed). It is hoped that in the future these problems will be substantially reduced. Registered medical benefits organisations are currently required to lodge claims for reimbursement of Commonwealth medical benefits with the Department of Health and to provide such supporting information as is prescribed. A similar requirement exists for the organisations to lodge claims for advance payments of Commonwealth medical benefits. Such claims are required to be accompanied by certain information including prescribed information about earlier advances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill presently before the House provides that the form and the manner in which the required information is to be provided in support of claims for reimbursement or advances may be prescribed by regulations. It is intended that the regulations will specify the manner and form by reference to the media on which the information is to be recorded-for example, disc, magnetic tape or film -as well as the format for the data and the actual information content for each item of data. Information is currently supplied in a non-standard fashion which has required the Department of Health to operate expensive manual and computerised systems. For this reason it is considered, in the interests of economy and efficiency, that the new provisions are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 106AA of the Health Insurance Act presently provides for the publication of the particulars of determinations made by the Minister for Health in accordance with the report of a medical services committee of inquiry on alleged cases of overservicing on the part of medical practitioners. As a further means of discouraging such improper practices, clause 26 of the Bill will amend section 106AA to require the Minister to prepare a statement setting out the particulars of any such determination and have a copy of it laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of its preparation. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 31 of the Bill makes a similar amendment to section 106G of the Health Insurance Act which contains similar provisions relating to the reports of optometrical services committees of inquiry. Again a statement setting out the particulars of any determination by the Minister will be required to be laid before both Houses of Parliament. The Bill will also make important changes to section 130 of the Health Insurance Act. This section concerns the divulging and release of information obtained by a Commonwealth officer in the performance of his duties under the Act. It is believed that these proposed changes will, amongst other things, greatly assist the Government's attempts to combat and discourage the instances of fraud, overservicing and other improper practices to which I have previously referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The present provisions of section 130 are mainly concerned with maintaining the confidentiality of information concerning the affairs of other persons, which is acquired by officers in the peformance of their duties under the Act. May I take this opportunity of reaffirming the Government's continued belief in and support of this very important principle. The Government also believes, however, that in order to assist in the discouragement of the sorts of improper practices to which I have just referred and the effective administration of other Commonwealth or State Acts, provision should be made to allow the release, by the Department of Health to specific persons or authorities, of information relating to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to section 130 will therefore allow the release of information concerning the conviction of a person on charges of fraud under the Act, to the Commonwealth Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs, specified State authorities and personnel and authorised personnel of registered health insurance organisations. The new provisions will also allow the release to these persons of information considered to be relevant to, respectively, the administration of an Act administered by either the Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the administration of a specified law of a State or Territory, or the carrying on of the business of a specified registered health insurance organisation, whichever the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions do not open the way for indiscriminate use of information concerning the affairs of individual members of the public. Protection of the identity of an individual person will be maintained except in cases where the person has been convicted of an offence under the health insurance legislation or where the Minister has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person has committed, or been a party to, such an offence. Furthermore, persons under the control of any recipient organisations or authorities shall not divulge information made available by the Department of Health except in the performance of their official duties within that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the amendments to the National Health Act. Honourable members will be aware that under the new health funding arrangements States and Territories generally have the responsibility for determining levels of public hospital charges. However, the levels of public hospital charges, and the related benefits are a significant factor in determining basic hospital contribution rates. As a general principle, the benefit available from basic hospital insurance should generally cover the charges raised by public hospitals provided the charges do not bear too heavily on the hospital insurance system and, therefore, on contributors to the basic hospital tables.</PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Act extend the existing power of the Minister for Health to declare standard hospital inpatient fees for hospital benefit purposes to cover professional and outpatient service fees for which basic hospital benefits are also payable. They will ensure a consistent approach by the Commonwealth in this area and, at the same time, provide a mechanism for the Commonwealth to protect the interests of contributors where hospital charges raised conflict with Commonwealth policy or would increase basic hospital table contribution rates to an unreasonable extent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes the conferring on the Minister of an additional power to control management practices of registered health benefits organisations. The Government has always maintained a policy of minimum interference in the internal administration of registered health benefits organisations. It also believes that healthy competition in the industry promotes efficiency, assists in keeping contribution rates at minimum levels and, therefore, is in the best interests of contributors. These views remain unchanged. It is believed, however , that a broad power to deal with inappropriate management practices would be desirable. As the National Health Act currently stands, there are provisions that may be used in relation to specific instances of undesirable management practices, but only on an ad hoc basis. In addition to conferring powers to deal with inappropriate management practices, the new provisions will authorise the Minister to issue directions to a registered organisation, other than a friendly society, prohibiting it from carrying on business other than business as a registered organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> A further minor amendment proposed in the Bill relates to the processing of rule changes of registered health benefits organisations under the National Health Act. The Minister's power to approve changes to rules relating to benefits and conditions for the payment of benefits for non-basic tables will be extended to cover existing tables as well as new tables. However, the overall policy of allowing organisations considerable scope for innovation and flexibility in relation to non-basic health insurance benefits cover would not be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has for some time now viewed with concern the various problems that have necessitated many of the amendments proposed in this Bill. These proposals have been foreshadowed for some considerable time and will receive, I believe, the full support of the Australian people. Much careful thought and planning has gone into their preparation. Overall, I firmly believe that the Bill contains important provisions which will be of great assistance in ensuring that the provision of health care in this country remains as efficient, equitable, cost effective and free from abuse as possible. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is the main part of a package of Bills to extend taxing and control laws to rigs used in exploring or exploiting the non-living natural resources of the seabed of Australia's continental shelf. The package includes provisions extending the control and taxing aspects of Customs, excise and sales tax Acts and the controls available under immigration and quarantine laws. For constitutional reasons, amendments proposed to be made to the various taxing Acts will be the subject of separate Bills in the package. Certain collection and control provisions associated with those taxing provisions are, however, included in this Bill. It has been the Government's longstanding policy that the treatment to be accorded these off-shore activities should be no different, in principle, from the treatment accorded similar resources ventures being undertaken within Australia. The petroleum exploration and recovery activities taking place in Bass Strait and elsewhere around Australia for upwards of 15 years have been governed by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. In that period, the only extension to off-shore activities of Commonwealth law outside the ambit of that Act was the application in 1968 of relevant income tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This package of measures has now become necessary as a result of developments on the North West Shelf of Western Australia. The previous practice was for all overseas sourced rigs, ships, equipment and materials for off-shore operations to be imported in the normal way through Australian ports. The massive scale of the North West Shelf developments, however, requires that a number of giant platforms be brought directly to the places on the shelf at which they are to operate. During the operation of the rigs there will necessarily be a constant flow of service craft, personnel and goods between the installations and the Australian mainland. There may be occasional movement between places overseas and an installation once attached. It is essential that these important activities should not provide an avenue for the entry into Australia of prohibited imports, such as drugs, or of exotic diseases or illegal immigrants. I know that both sides of the House support the Government in the importance that it attaches to the maintenance of Australia's security in matters of customs, quarantine and immigration. The package of Bills provides a proper legislative basis for the exercise of customs, excise, immigration and quarantine powers to remove any degree of danger of illicit activities at these remote sites. The powers are necessary both for the arrival of those installations and for subsequent contacts between the installations and places overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the amendments proposed by the Bill, a person wishing to bring an installation directly from overseas to its operating site will be required to obtain prior permission. Where permission is granted it will be subject to the applicant's compliance with specified conditions. The conditions will ensure that the arrival of the installation and its attachement will be supervised by officers until customs, immigration and quarantine clearance is given. Generally , these Bills provide that installations attached to the Australian seabed will be deemed to be places in Australia. However, the amendments to the Quarantine Act provide that an overseas installation shall be deemed to be part of Australia on attachment only if it has previously been given pratique. This will be given only if the quarantine officer on his prior inspection is satisfied that it is disease free. By the device of treating installations as part of Australia, movements between the Australian mainland and installations which have been attached and cleared may be allowed to proceed without substantial hindrance. However quarantine controls may, if necessary, also be applied to this movement. Contact between an attached installation and places overseas will be controlled. This means that anything which comes from overseas for delivery to an installation must first enter Australia through a first port of entry. At first ports of entry there are adequate facilities for the customs, immigration and quarantine examination of vessels and goods which would not generally be available at installations. Goods that are found to be a health risk can be treated or destroyed and prohibited imports can be seized. </PARA>
<PARA> The customs and quarantine amendments provide for goods from overseas to be permitted to be brought directly to an installation. This discretion is considered desirable to permit the operator of an installation to obtain goods quickly from overseas. Such goods might be mechanical parts which may be necessary to repair some equipment and which would not usually present a customs or health risk. The discretion will be used sparingly and as a general rule vessels will be required to call first at normal ports of entry. The discretionary arrangements if used may present some risks of avoidance of controls. Accordingly, the Bill proposes provisions to give officers powers and functions that are, in respect of off-shore installations, equivalent to those now given to them by existing legislation in respect of vessels, goods and persons at points of entry into, or exit from, Australia. Powers under the Immigration (Unauthorised Arrivals) Act 1980 now apply to certain ships when they enter Australian waters and to certain aircraft when they land in Australia . For the purposes of that Act, 'Australian waters' do not extend beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea. The powers under that Act will be extended to those ships when brought to an Australian installation outside Australian waters, as so defined, and to those aircraft that land at any Australian installation. The powers I have mentioned include the power to board installations and search or examine them for goods on board for customs, immigration or quarantine purposes. If, for example, there are any goods on board which could carry disease to mainland Australia, these may be ordered into quarantine and treated or destroyed as appropriate. Prohibited imports may also be seized and customs control exercised over dutiable goods on board. It is also necessary to ensure that there is proper authority for the application of the taxing provisions of customs, excise and sales tax law. This will be achieved by further Bills in this package. </PARA>
<PARA> A very important result of applying the customs laws to these operations will be the legislative protection of the right of Australian industry to share in the Development opportunities to the same extent as now applies in relation to undertakings within Australia. The granting of concessional by-laws in respect of equipment and materials manufactured outside Australia for use with off-shore installations will be dependent on suitably equivalent goods of Australian manufacture not being reasonably available. By Parts VIII and IX of this Bill, which will amend Sales Tax Assessment Acts (Nos 1 and 5) 1930, together with a group of sales tax Bills that I will introduce shortly, it is proposed also to extend the application of the sales tax law to off-shore installations of the kind that I have earlier described. In practice, the sales tax law in respect of the importation of goods is closely associated with the customs law. Administrative efficiency in the collection of sales tax on importation of goods is achieved by giving a collector of customs power to collect sales tax at the same time as customs duty is collected. </PARA>
<PARA> Parts VIII and IX and the associated sales tax Bills will amend the sales tax law in conformity with the proposed amendments of the customs law, thereby achieving desirable uniformity in the application of these laws to off-shore installations and removing the scope for anomalies which could exist if the two laws operated differently. The amendments to both laws will have a common date of commencement. It is intended that, after the second reading is agreed to, this Bill be referred to a legislation committee of this House. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

Where such an installation is first brought to a place in Australia from which it is to be taken for attachment to the seabed, the installation and goods on board are to be taken as imported on arrival of the installation at that place. Goods brought direct from overseas on an installation are also to be deemed to be imported on their arrival. Likewise, goods taken from an installation to a place overseas are to be deemed to have been exported. The Bill also proposes amendments to the principal Act to identify when an installation is imported. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to extend the application of that Act to the production of excisable products of off-shore installations. Under existing legislation petroleum products produced from off-shore wells are regarded as coming within the ambit of the Excise Acts when the product is brought to a shore-based installation at which subsequent processes are performed. The proposed provisions will not result in variation of any present liability to excise duty. They, taken with a complementary amendment to the Excise Act 1901, will authorise excise officers to have access to installations and to examine processes and recording systems.

<PARA>These Bills are a further part of the package of Bills to extend the application of certain controls and taxation measures to off-shore installations. The Sales Tax Acts do not currently impose tax on transactions or acts involving goods which are outside geographical Australia but within the area of the continental shelf. </PARA>
<PARA> The measures proposed by these Bills, together with the associated measures contained in other Bills in this package, will have the effect that any off- shore installation will be given, from the date of its attachment to the continental shelf, the status of a place in Australia. This will mean that any transaction or act affecting goods on such an installation which would be taxable if the goods were in geographical Australia will, in future, also be taxable. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments will apply to installations brought to the continental shelf directly from overseas and to installations taken there from Australia. They will apply to the latter whether or not the installations were themselves originally imported into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In their practical effect, the amendments will not subject to sales tax an installation itself insofar as it is for use in the mining industry in carrying out mining operations or in the treatment of products of those operatons because such an installation is, in these circumstances, exempt from tax under other provisions. However, certain attachments to or parts of an installation-for example, attachments or parts used for the comfort, entertainment or recreation of persons living on an installation-could be subject to sales tax. Attachments or parts of this kind which would be taxable include cinema equipment, built-in or fixed sporting equipment, floor coverings and kitchen equipment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Road transport, whether of freight or people, will in the Australian context remain in all areas the most efficient and convenient form of transport, except for large bulk cargoes. Therefore Australia, with its huge distances and low population, will always rely heavily in both city and country areas on its road system. The natural tendency of Australians to prefer the motor car to mass transit systems is to be commended. There is ample evidence, even in areas of large-scale public transport, that the comparative cost of mass transit is still higher. Australia does not suffer from lack of space and the only real requirement is that our planners commence the planning of Australia, and in particular our urban areas, to accommodate the problems that the automobile will generate. This should commence by reducing the density trend of our cities and be followed by effective road systems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unlike other sectors of the transport system, the motorist and the road freight operator make substantial net contributions to the federal revenue. The States also impose a considerable burden on the motorist although to my knowledge most of these funds are spent on the road system. The tax contribution of road users is much greater than many would believe. While personally involved in the transport industry I was able to calculate that for a truck travelling on a thousand mile journey the contribution to government revenue was in fact 50 per cent of the actual freight charge, presuming that the truck travelled loaded to its permissible maximum. When I mention the less obvious contribution to revenue from road users few people realise that the sales tax attributable to fair wear and tear on truck tyres is 50c per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> The car owner also contributes, albeit to a much lesser degree, through sales tax on the original vehicle and replacement items. The taxes levied in the financial year 1979-80 on the road user are as follows: The Commonwealth received fuel excise collections of $861m, the crude oil levy of which about 70 per cent would be applicable to the motorist of $1,445.3m; sales tax, $1,245m and customs duty, $302.4m; total State receipts which can be added to that of combined motor vehicle and driver taxes, $471.5m; road maintenance taxes and similar charges, $12.2m. That is a total of State and Commonwealth collections from the motorist of $4,337.4m. Expenditure on roads by all governments in 1978- 79 was $2,139.4m. As honourable members can see, there is a huge discrepancy, in fact $2,198m, or half the money that was spent on roads. At this stage let me make it clear that I do not support the expenditure of all road user revenue on roads. I accept that the purpose of some collections may not really be seen even for that purpose. However, I raise the matter to destroy any argument that the motorist and in particular the road freight operator does not fully fund the provision of his running surface and ancillary aids. </PARA>
<PARA> Railways lose money and coastal shipping loses money. Only road and air users contribute directly and in excess of government expenditure. Remote area dwellers are particularly hard hit by this policy. The incidence of road use compared with other transport systems must increase as one gets further away from the cities. The burden of direct funding of one's transport must therefore fall heavily on these people. Further, nearly all taxes related to road users have a direct relevance to the miles covered. This would appear to be fair and reasonable, but it totally ignores the huge costs to those who live furthest away. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy is a tax on decentralisation. The huge irony is that after contributing this high level of revenue to government coffers, road transport is still generally cheaper than government transport, such as rail. So those rural areas achieve little benefit from the community subsidy to public transport. Such subsidy, plus more, is consumed by the gross inefficiencies which invariably surface when government deviates from its successful function of tax gathering and assumes the role of entrepreneur. Australia must therefore treat its road system with top priority in terms of its transport options, now and for many years in the future. This statement is further substantiated when we consider that it is estimated that 25 per cent of the cost of all goods consumed in Australia is in freight costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Another interesting assessment of the savings attributable to better road systems is to be found in the submission to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of the Australian Automobile Association in January 1981. The submission states:</PARA>
<PARA> It can be shown that significant savings in commercial and private travel time would result from an adequate road system. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, quoting the Bureau of Transport Economics, discounted benefits in travel time reductions of $6261 million would flow from the warranted roads programme. Because of inadequate funding $700 million of these discounted benefits are being lost. The $700 million is made up of $188 million in savings of private travel time and $512 million in savings of commercial travel time. The latter figure of $512 million is particularly significant. As road transport is a highly competitive industry the benefits of this saving and the consequent reduction in cost pressures will be quickly passed on the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA>As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety I am constantly exposed to road trauma. I was hospitalised in 1976 for four months as the result of a road crash that certainly would not have occurred had road conditions at that place met acceptable standards. Allen Atkins, a researcher, estimates that the annual cost of road crashes to the Australian nation is $2, 000m per annum. Naturally this total cost cannot be attributed to road conditions, nor can money replace the 3,500 dead per annum or the 100,000 maimed . However, if as little as 10 per cent were so attributable the cost is still substantial in terms of total road expenditure. The case for a better road system has many more supporting factors. However, I will rest my case in that area and deal with other aspects of today's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for Commonwealth expenditure of $2,337m over the financial years 1982-83 through to 1984-85. The annual allocations are $734m, $778m and $ 825m respectively. During this time State and local governments will also make substantial contributions to the road system. Unlike the Commonwealth these two levels of government will also be actively involved in spending all of the funds provided. Relatively there has been a change in the levels of expenditure between the three levels of government. Comparatively local government has emerged as the biggest spender on roads and the Commonwealth the lesser. Figures on road funding provided by the Bureau of Transport Economics in its 1979 assessment of the Australian road system give the following information: Based on current prices in 1974-75 the Commonwealth spent $439m, the States spent $ 356m and local government spent $567m-a total of $1,362. In 1978-79 the Commonwealth spent $584m, the States spent $696m and local government spent $ 859m. The annual average growth rate for the Commonwealth was 7.4 per cent; for the States it was 18.3 per cent and for local government it was 10.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest Bureau of Transport Economics report also extrapolates this type of funding based on a 1974-75 constant year. When we get into present times we find that spending by the Commonwealth for 1981-82 will be reduced to $277.4m and for 1982-83, to $258.5m compared with the actual cash amount of $734 which I have just mentioned. For 1983-84 it will come down to $238m from $778m, and so on. This is a real value decline in spending over the previous decade of 39.4 per cent. From 1974-75 to 1978-79 the percentage share of road funding by levels of government had changed as follows: For the Commonwealth, the percentage share in 1974-75 was 32.2 per cent and by 1978-79 it was 27.3 per cent. For the States, in 1974-75 it was 26.1 per cent and by 1978-79 it was 32.6 per cent. In 1974-75 local government spent 41.7 per cent and in 1978-79 it spent 40.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these figures can be debated. The method by which the States and local governments divide up the funds provided by the Commonwealth can lead to double counting. These figures do not show the very substantial untied grants that this Government makes available to local government by way of the 2 per cent personal income tax. This year these funds totalled $350,866,000. A large percentage of these funds is directed to roads yet appear as local government expenditure. State and local governments do have the prime responsibility for their road systems. The purpose of the 1981 Act to divide roads into only three categories of national, arterial and local, and for the Commonwealth to accept the responsibility for national highways, supports this view. Therefore, I am not prepared to argue that the Commonwealth is necessarily spending too little in relation to its partners in the roads business. I am sure, however, that the total expenditure is insufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement is further supported by the fact that although there has been a change in the relativities between the Government's expenditures, all appear to have reduced their expenditure on roads when expressed as a percentage of total Budget outlays. In recent times, the percentage of local government Budget expenditure on roads has dropped from slightly above 40 per cent to slightly below 40 per cent, which is a small drop. Total State expenditures in 1974-75 were 5.38 per cent of Budget outlays and in 1979-80 were 4.93 per cent of Budget outlays. Commonwealth expenditure had dropped from 2 per cent in 1975-76 to 1.74 per cent in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> For all the reasons previously given I deplore the reduction in priority that all levels of government have given to our road system and to our road users. The Labor Opposition probably would agree with that viewpoint. However they, like most other Australians who support this viewpoint, do not generally choose to discuss the method by which this imbalance might be rectified. Too many people still believe that the fairy godmother will attend to that. They overlook the fact that even in that fairy story the conveyance eventually turned back into a pumpkin. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Automobile Association, in its submission to the Prime Minister, did have the courage to bite the bullet. At page 6 of its submission it made a suggestion as to the reallocation of Commonwealth budgetary outlays that it thought should occur to redress the imbalance. This was accompanied also with a graph showing how certain areas of the Budget had taken over in expenditure terms. The AAA quite correctly addressed itself to our big ticket expenditure items of social security, health, education and defence as they existed in the 1981 Budget. It recommended expenditure cuts in two of those areas which had shown the greatest percentage growth in recent times-that is a cut of $159m in social security for a percentage reduction of only 1.6 per cent and in health a cut of $39m for a percentage reduction of 1.07 per cent. When the total amount of $198m was transferred to roads it increased the allocation from $628m to $ 901m or an increase of a whopping 31.5 per cent. Had the Association been prepared to include education for a small nip it would probably have achieved an even better result for our deserving road user. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the gasps of the Opposition members become too audible, let me promote arguments for this courageous stand taken by the AAA. It is beyond debate that roads will improve the Australian economy and the ability of the Australian road user to meet his special tax burden. Expenditure on roads is visible and long lasting. The desires of the Australian public, created in the main by the Whitlam Government, for excessive welfare, health and education spending is robbing all other worthwhile yet less sensational programs of sensible funding. Health spending has already entrenched a degree of corruption not previously experienced. Most people would see road spending as preventive medicine; so why should we not allocate money from the health budget directly to roads? In education we have long passed the stage when government spending was aimed at improving the student. Recent teacher strikes in the Australian Capital Territory clearly indicate that the education lobby sees student welfare as its prime industrial tool. When we spend money on roads we get better roads. I cannot say that we get better students for the expenditure of more money. Whilst recognising the needs of the aged, infirm, unemployed, families and others-I sincerely recognise their problems-I sincerely doubt that many other welfare payments do much for Australia or, indeed, the recipients of such welfare. There is money in the system for roads but Australians must be prepared to question the expenditure priorities at present allocated by this Government and by the State governments. The alternative is a declining road system or heavier taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Other inequities do arise in regard to the distribution of Commonwealth road funds. Western Australia, the State from which I come, represents one-third of the Australian land mass. It has a commitment to essential roads unequalled by other States. Past Commonwealth governments recognised this fact and ensured that 17.9 per cent of total Commonwealth funding was directed to this State. This has been eroded steadily to a level of 12.67 per cent. Western Australian road makers face a constant battle to hold this level of expenditure, against the recommendations of the Bureau of Transport Economics that the figure should be more like 9 per cent. The period of decline of these funds has occurred at a time when resource development in Western Australia is at its greatest. Western Australian resources almost invariably occur in remote and underdeveloped areas which require long and difficult road systems. The massive Tom Price iron ore mine, first established in 1966, still requires 270 kilometres of road sealing to connect it to the established highway system. Many resource companies are now making as much as a dollar for dollar contribution to speed up the road making to their facilities. These roads will eventually generate untold future revenue for expenditure upon all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has chosen to recognise the disabilities of New South Wales and Queensland. Yet the members of the Committee of Senior Representatives of Commonwealth and State Road Authorities-MCSR-2-which considered the national highway system decided that if the present level of funds made available for national highways was only maintained, the years required to complete Western Australia's national highway system to a reasonable standard would be 44, whereas the period for New South Wales was 24 years and for Queensland it was 33 years. The fact that all these periods are unacceptably long is one thing but the evidence of the needs of Western Australia is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> States choose to spend their funds in different ways but Western Australia, both through efficiency and expenditure, has established a road system beyond its resources. Other States may have preferred free hospitals or, as with the voters of New South Wales, a government of economic incompetence. Their difficulty should not be visited upon Western Australia. A government dollar invested in that State will still show a return. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the position of local government and, in particular, rural local government in the road making and maintenance area. I have already indicated the huge financial contribution that this sector now makes to roads. I also believe that it generally expends its money wisely attempting at all times to maximise the result in terms of road length and quality. This Government has made serious attempts to ensure that adequate funding from Commonwealth allocations is available for expenditure by local government in the interests of their constituents. My own experience, at a national level, of local government indicated considerable dissatisfaction on the east coast as to the efforts of State governments to divert Commonwealth funds, by one means or another, from local government to themselves. I appreciate the constitutional problems that confront the Commonwealth in this area. However, this matter is of such concern to me that I believe local government would be better served if the Commonwealth extended its personal income tax grants to local government as a trade-off for road funds. The result would guarantee the money to local government and would place the responsibility on the local authorities and people who use those roads . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The interest that resulted from the question that I directed to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) this morning suggests to me that perhaps the concept to which I was referring needs some clarification. In fact, the concept that lies behind that question and the formula which is applied in connection with it, are both essentially simple. The point that I was making was that the growth of the money supply during any period must be sufficient to accommodate both the rate of increase in prices, or the inflation rate, and the rate of real economic growth. If the money supply grows by less than that combined percentage, credit must be tight and the volume of liquidity or money will be too little to do what the economy requires of it; thus, the cost of money, or the rate of interest, must increase. A smaller percentage increase in the money supply may be sufficient if the velocity of circulation of money increases enough to compensate for the lower volume of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting that in relation to these concepts the Budget targets for 1981-82 were for an inflation rate of 10.75 per cent and a rate of economic growth of between 3 and 3.5 per cent. For this reason, to accommodate those two expectations, the money supply during 1981-82 should have been targeted towards an increase of 13.75 per cent to 14 per cent. But in fact the Treasurer and the Government set at only 10 to 11 per cent their target for an increase in the money supply. Therefore, the objectives of tight credit and higher interest rates were built into the budgetary strategy and were deliberately designed and have been persistently pursued by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The volume of money, or M3, at 30 June 1981 was $55,387m. To accommodate the increase in prices and the anticipated rate of real growth, this should have increased by between $7,616m and $7,745m during 1981-82. However, with the Government setting its target at 10 to 11 per cent, only about $5,816m would have been provided for in relation to an increase in the money supply. During the current financial year this would represent a shortfall of between $1,800m and $1,940m. The velocity of circulation of money, that is the number of times each dollar turns over, is currently in Australia about 2.35. For that reason the Government deliberately aimed for expenditure or purchasing power to be curtailed to the extent of between $4,230m and $4,559m during this current year. In fact, during this current year there could have been an additional amount of consumption and/or investment expenditure of over $4,000m. The Government, by the strategy that it adopted in the Budget, made sure that that additional expenditure in the form of either consumption or investment would not be realised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the Treasurer now pretend some degree of disappointment that the economic growth target indicated in the Budget will not reach the 3 to 3.5 per cent which was targeted for. In fact, it is now running at about 2 per cent and over the full year it is most unlikely that economic growth will reach 3 per cent. I hope that someone will bring what I have just said to the attention of the Treasurer. The point about this is that within those Budget targets there never was, from the time the Budget was introduced, any possibility that economic growth would reach that target. I indicated on a previous occasion that in order just to maintain the current level of unemployment, economic growth of at least 3 1/2 per cent each year would be required in order to absorb into employment those people who were joining the labour force. This year the growth rate will be less than 3 per cent. Next year it will be between one per cent and 1.5 per cent. As a result, the level of unemployment must rise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice from the comments of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) that we have another theorist on Treasury matters in the Australian Labor Party. I am not sure whether his comments are an improvement on those which the shadow Minister makes. They are theorists; they are not realists. I want to speak tonight about a commission which in the bush, in country Australia, is much maligned. I refer to Telecom Australia. I have just been shown the results for Telecom for the 1980-81 financial year. Of course, what people look for mostly is the profit. I am happy to say that Telecom recorded a substantial profit of $232.5m. The document goes on to state that that is the return on net assets of $8,198m. Of course, that is not a great return on that amount; it represents a 2.9 per cent return on the assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is often forgotten in the cities of Australia that people in rural Australia face grave difficulties with communications. I understand that Telecom , with the resources that it has available, tries to allocate to rural Australia sufficient funds to expand the network in that very vital area. It is a vital area: it is the producing area of Australia. The development program for last year accounted for $1,164m. That is a plough-back of profits, the depreciation allowances and the borrowings, and probably makes Telecom one of the biggest enterprises in Australia today-probably greater than the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and any of those other large private institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the six or seven years that I have been a member of this House Telecom has provided new facilities for people in the bush. I think those people appreciate those facilities, although they still want more. Radio telephones are now a reality in areas that Telecom can service. Normal reticulation would not have been available for the next 100 years in those areas. That is a start in a marvellous program for inland Australia. Also, concessions have been extended on capital contributions made by people connected to radio telephones. They pay $ 500 a year in rental. I ask honourable members to compare that $500 rental fee with the $120 to $150 that a city subscriber pays for a private telephone. There is still an anomaly and an inequity in that regard. Community Access 80 gave many subscribers access to their nearest community centre and provided for a relaxation in the high cost of trunk calls. The rates for after hours calling have been reduced and also automatic subscriber services are very much on stream . </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I pay tribute to a new body that is being formed in rural Australia, the Rural Telephone Subscribers Association. This movement began at a meeting at Clermont in the Division of Kennedy, which is represented by the Honourable Bob Katter. At that meeting a provisional national council of people concerned about improving communications in that area was formed. The President is Charles Gall. The Secretary is Mrs Pam Pownall, a constituent of mine. She has pushed this matter of rural telephones for the past two years. The Assistant Secretary is Mrs Lindsay Macdonald and the Treasurer is Mrs Daphne Rich. All of these people have an understanding of the difficulties faced by people in rural Australia, particularly in respect of communications. I see this organisation, the Rural Telephone Subscribers Association, as being a latter-day successor to the Australian Inland Mission, the Flying Doctor Service and all of those people who brought a bit of life to central Australia and were concerned about it. The Association has achieved quite a lot already. It has arranged for meetings to be held in eastern Queensland, particularly over the December-January break. </PARA>
<PARA> Big concessions have been granted, particularly on the capital contribution made by subscribers towards the cost of providing a rural telephone service. Three scales now apply, particularly in relation to the rural connection fee. Maximum contributions have been set. A maximum of $1,350 has been set for contributions by people who live 16 kilometres outside the range. For customers seeking a new manual service the maximum is $1,750. All of these factors are a clear indication that Telecom and this Government are concerned for those people . Prior to this those services did not exist. I might mention also that the Labor Government in 1972 to 1975 practically removed this concession completely from the rural customers. These fees are now realistic so that people can avail themselves of the services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 October 1981 and on 18 November 1981 I asked questions on notice of the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) relating to satellite tracking stations in Australia. In those questions I asked for three pieces of information. Firstly, I sought details on the function, designation, orbital parameters and timing of satellites tracked by the Tranet station at Smithfield in my constituency. Secondly, I asked for similar information with reference to other satellite ground stations in Australia. Thirdly, I asked for the location of all satellite ground stations and observation posts involved in operations with United States geodetic satellites.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently I received answers from the Minister. Apart from the information that portable geodetic satellite receivers have operated from over 250 sites-which is an interesting piece of information-in the last seven years, the short and rather trivial answers given by the Minister provided no information not already on the public record. It was certainly not my purpose in asking those questions merely to have known facts reiterated. Having provided rather trivial answers, the Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> To provide all the information sought by the honourable member would require the diversion of significant departmental resources which I am not prepared to authorise. </PARA>
<PARA>First of all, that is a rather cavalier treatment of a member's question. It is peculiary cavalier coming from a Minister who has prided himself on his dedication to the parliamentary system. I point out to the Minister that such a system can work well only when required information is provided without restriction, and this has certainly not been done in this case. It is possible, though not likely, that my constituents in Smithfield could depart this world quite suddenly. My advisers' and my assessment of that possibility is very dependent on the information requested, for the implications for my constituents of having the Tranet station in their midst is closely related to the particular satellite system involved and the regularity, timing and orbits of the particular satellites. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say, first of all, that given the large number of movable geodetic satellite posts involved, I do regard it as perhaps inappropriate to seek the detailed information on that point that I requested. However, I would be surprised if no master list of these locations is on file somewhere in the Department of Defence. But it is my belief that informed public debate in this country requires the information that I requested in detail on the satellites linked to Australian ground stations. To deny it on the ground that it would require the diversion of too many departmental resources is just not good enough . Moreover, that excuse is either transparent or scandalous. It is transparent in the sense that I find it very difficult to believe that the Department of Defence does not have master lists of all satellites tracked by Smithfield and of geodetic satellites tracked by other stations in Australia. Such lists should be readily available. One would expect them to be in the Department, if the Department was doing its job. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the other alternative. If it is not simply a transparent excuse, if those master lists of the satellites do not exist, we have a rather scandalous affair because such lists are necessary for any member of the Department of Defence or any member of this Parliament to make a proper assessment of the role of the Australian tracking stations. I am not personally able to make that assessment, but certainly we have advisers who can make that assessment if we have the information. I am simply not able to accept the Government's assurance about the innocuousness of Smithfield without being given the detailed account of its operations necessary for a proper and independent assessment. I ask, therefore, that the Minister be asked to give a full answer to question No. 3688 and at least answer paragraph (b) of question No. 3444. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to follow up the words spoken by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). I support what he said about what the Government has done in the area of communications. Certainly in the last five to seven years in which this Government has been in office much has been done in this regard for the people of Australia, particularly the people in the outback. We have to appreciate that today a telephone is a most important part of a person's life. I was pleased to hear the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) say today that arrangements have been made whereby quite a number of technicians from other parts of Australia will be working on the North Coast of New South Wales and within the Hunter Valley area. It is essential that this sort of work be carried out because this part of Australia is growing at a tremendous rate so far as population is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those people who know the coastline from a geographical point of view would know, I am sure, that small properties exist in the mountains behind the hinterland right down to the coastline, involving areas 30 to 50 miles long. There are, I suppose, thousands of small properties in the area. Many of these properties have been divided over a period. People from the west, from Victoria and from the metropolitan areas are settling in this area on 5-acre, 10-acre or 50-acre properties. These people are accustomed to having the use of a telephone . In my electorate many outstanding applications for telephones will not be processed for quite a period. That is why I welcome the statement today of the Minister. I feel that a telephone is essential for people who live in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the coastal area from the Hunter valley to the Queensland border one will see, as I have said, that it is an area of Australia that is perhaps growing quicker than any other part of Australia. The people who are coming to this area, the business houses and the industries should have a telephone. I know that the Government is doing everything possible with the available funds. We have to appreciate the fact that Telecom Australia is a statutory authority. I believe it is well geared to meet the demands of consumers. The point I want to make is that in my electorate and the neighbouring electorates of the State there has been a great increase in the population and a tremendous demand for telephones. </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly it costs a lot more to connect a telephone to a property located five miles up a creek or a road than it does to connect one in a town and the cost of laying a cable for the installation of 20,000 to 30,000 telephones in a village or town may be the same as the cost of running a cable to a property way up a road, but the point is that the people on such properties are entitled to the service. Many honourable members will have been to the Forster area. The great lakes area is a very picturesque part of Australia. A large number of city people have recently moved on to blocks of land there. In the Coomba Park area, for instance, over 30 people are waiting for the installation of a telephone. It appears that it will be late in 1983 before their priorities will be reached. That is a typical example of some of the problems in my area. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an increase in the problem of line clogging. Often it takes an hour or so to get through to the Newcastle area by telephone. These problems are due to the greater demand for telephones. I would like to see much more attention than has been announced by the Minister today being given to the allocation of extra funds and materials to meet the demands for telephones within that area of the State. </PARA>

I had the opportunity a little earlier this evening to make a suggestion to the Minister for Transport about the possibility of using the naval aircraft, the Trackers, which have been involved with HMAS Melbourne and which will not be available or cannot be used on HMS Invincible. We have already debated in this House the absurdity of the Government's position on the purchase of HMS Invincible, which is an aircraft carrier which will not be carrying any fixed-wing aircraft. But there is available to the Australian Government the Tracker aircraft that were formerly on HMAS Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make the suggestion to the Government-out of a great sense of generosity, I might say-that the Tracker aircraft formerly used on HMAS Melbourne, and which cannot be used on HMS Invincible, be used for this very important function of coastal surveillance. The Government's record on coastal surveillance is appalling. We must be the only country in the world in which the security of the country is franchised out like a pizza hut franchise to the private sector. This is Malcolm Fraserism gone mad, where the security of Australia is handed over to private enterprise, and not only to Australian private enterprise but also to foreign companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like the Government to think very carefully about this proposition. It is spending vast sums of money on defence, but the very significant feature of low-level incursions-it involves smuggling, and I do not have to go back into the Nugan Hand arguments-threats of smuggling, intrusions by fishermen, and so on, are being left to private enterprise. I do not think that any government in the world, not even the Reagan Government, with its great attachment to the Adam Smith notion of private enterprise, would accept the very fundamental proposition that the security of any country should be left to the private sector. So I now see the possibility, given that our Government has purchased HMS Invincible, which cannot take even the aircraft from the old HMAS Melbourne, that instead of providing funds to the private corporations to buy aircraft-this is a net loss to the Australian community-the Government should reorganise coastal surveillance, with these Tracker aircraft, under the proper and only authority that should be the authority responsible for coastal surveillance, which is our Defence Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that my good friend the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) is coming into the chamber. He has an interest in the Fleet Air Arm. Perhaps he will support me when I say that the Tracker aircraft that will not be used in future by the Navy for the purpose for which they were designed should be used for coastal surveilance. In that way we should be able to maintain a Fleet Air Arm. The Fleet Air Arm would have a very serious responsibility for coastal surveillance. Australian defence and security would be stronger. This action would have much less impact on the Australian taxpayer. I hope that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson), who is at the table, will pass on to the Minister for Transport the suggestion that the Tracker aircraft be used for coastal surveillance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested in hearing the comments of a former Minister of Defence and my university colleague of many years ago, the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison). I regret to say that, although my hair is not quite as white as his, there is not as much of it. The point about the Tracker aircraft is well worth examining, although I would hope that there will still be a use for the Trackers in a defence context, particularly in view of the sophisticated equipment with which they are fitted. But I should like to make a point about HMS Invincible itself, a matter on which I strongly disagree with the points made by the honourable member for St George.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for St George asserted that HMS Invincible will not be carrying any fixed-wing aircraft. At the moment, there has been no decision on whether short take-off and vertical landing aircraft-STOVLs-will be carried by that ship, because the present generation of Harriers, while having been established to be very effective in recent North Atlantic Treaty Organisation trials from HMS Invincible, nonetheless appear to be coming to the end of their effective life, in the absence of a new generation or a major upgrading of them. There is no doubt that the Government has properly said that it will not make a decision on the nature of the aircraft. If there are to be fixed-wing aircraft on HMS Invincible, no decision, naturally, is being taken about the nature of those aircraft until a clearer view is held of the prospects of the development of a new generation of STOVL aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> It intrigues me that a report in a newspaper today, following a briefing by the Navy to the back bench of the Australian Labor Party yesterday, as I understand it, indicated that, after the briefing, there was some criticism by Labor members of parliament about what they claimed to be uncertainty about the naval air station at HMAS Albatross in Nowra, in my electorate. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA> Labor MPs also said the future of the naval air station at Nowra, NSW, was uncertain because the present fixed-wing aircraft used on HMAS Melbourne would not in future be based there. </PARA>
<PARA>There are a few things to be said about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I can remember during the last election campaign the then Labor candidate for Macarthur, quite disgracefully, raising immense uncertainty among the population of Nowra and the Fleet Air Arm in Nowra about the future of that naval air station, saying that it might well be moved to Western Australia or somewhere else because HMAS Melbourne was likely to be involved in exercises off the Western Australian coast. That was utter bunkum, but it served to make some people unnerved and unsettled. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that any statements by any Labor members suggesting that there was any uncertainty about the future of the naval air station in Nowra are mischievous nonsense. There is an immense volume of investment going on there, whether or not there are to be fixed-wing aircraft at Nowra, and that investment is involved in providing the facilities to service the enormously increased volume of helicopters that will be in service with the Royal Australian Navy, because not only will the Invincible carry very large and very effective helicopters in its anti-submarine role, which is its major role, but also will all the frigates, the ships that the Australian Navy is taking delivery of from the United States, be equipped with helicopters as well. </PARA>
<PARA> An immense upgrading program is going on at HMAS Albatross, which guarantees its future. This Government is guaranteeing the future of HMAS Albatross and any attempts by the Labor Party to suggest that that is not so are in the same category as the utter nonsense that was spread around about it before the last election by the monumentally unsuccessful Labor candidate for the seat. I suggest that, if the Labor Party wants to make certain that it never has representations in the Nowra area, it should continue with that kind of rubbish about how there is alleged uncertainty about the future of HMAS Albatross. The only government that will assure the future of HMAS Albatross is this Government . </PARA>

These negotiations were carried on because it was well known by the SEC and the workers in the Latrobe Valley that the system was in great need of much maintenance otherwise it would be breaking down, as it had done in Victoria during last winter.

<PARA> (1) Most Ministers are allocated office space in Canberra in addition to their ministerial offices located in Parliament House. These offices are in the main located with their Departments' head offices. The Ministers who do not have additional offices in Canberra are the Ministers for Trade and Resources, National Development and Energy, Industrial Relations, Social Security, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Housing and Construction and Home Affairs and Environment.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) and (b) I am advised by the relevant Departments that the addresses and floor space areas of each Minister's office outside Parliament House are as per the following schedule.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The practice of successive governments has been not to divulge office rental costs. Questions of maintaining confidentiality of individuals and private organisations in their business dealings with the Commonwealth are involved. This practice is presently under review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Porta Printer units have been or will be installed by three Commonwealth Departments.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) Following the honourable member's earlier Question No. 380 (Hansard , 10 June 1981, pages 3528-9) an examination was undertaken to determine what the Commonwealth policy should be to the installation of Porta Printer type telephones in Central and State Offices of Departments. The conclusions of that examination included:</PARA>
<PARA> the Porta Printer is the only known facility available which meets specification drawn up by Telecom and the Adult Deaf Society. It is understood that the sale price of Porta Printer plus is $996 to Government Departments and commercial organisations, and $846 if sold to disabled persons and their respective institutions;</PARA>
<PARA> the Porta Printer can be of assistance not only to deaf people but also to those with speech impairments;</PARA>
<PARA> the units would be helpful in enabling Commonwealth Departments which have a high public contact role to communicate with clients who have, or who have access to, a Porta Printer;</PARA>
<PARA> usage of such a facility may not be particularly high in initial stages, given the small number of Porta Printers currently available in Australia, but their installation in selected Commonwealth Departments would serve to encourage wider use of the units in the general community and be an added contribution to facilitating communication with deaf persons and those with speech defects.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as Commonwealth Departments are concerned the following position applies :</PARA>
<PARA> Porta Printers were placed in the National Acoustic Laboratories in the 5 mainland States in 1980. This facility is available as a contact point for the Department of Health generally.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the objective of the Department of Social Security to have a Porta Printer installed in a centrally located regional office in each State and Territory. To date, units are operational in Central Office in Canberra and Adelaide. The Central Porta Printer is available for use by the Secretariat for the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped, the Office of the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation, and the Secretariat of the IYDP National Committee for Non-Government Organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service considers the provision of units when assessing clients, although they would only be provided when considered essential in enabling a person to acquire maximum independence in daily living and employment.</PARA>
<PARA> Porta Printers are to be installed in the Regional Office of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs in each State Capital and Darwin and the Sub- Regional Office in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> Consideration will be given to the requirement for Porta Printers to be installed to meet the needs of clients of other Departments which have a wide contact with the public.</PARA>
<PARA> Departments which have installed Porta Printer units already, or are in the process of installing them, will keep under consideration the need to install units in additional locations.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Minister for Social Security has taken up with State and Territory Ministers responsible for International Year of Disabled Persons their support in encouraging the inclusion of a Porta Printer at all major contact points for emergency services. Co-operation in this respect is desirable given the important role played by the States in the provision of services.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The action taken in relation to the more general availability of Porta Printers in Government Offices is designed to provide a special service to deaf people and certain speech impaired members of the community, and is consistent with other measures taken by the Commonwealth to assist disabled persons.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has undertaken many measures to assist disabled persons over the years and will continue to do so after the International Year of Disabled Persons has ended.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) On 24 May 1977, the Prime Minister stated that, prior to a clearer outcome emerging from international studies and consultations including the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (which concluded in February 1980), it would be premature for Australia to adopt a unilateral decision on the detailed conditions under which it might be prepared to agree to reprocessing of nuclear material supplied by Australia. In order to reserve Australia's position on reprocessing for the time being, the Prime Minister added that Australia would wish to make provision in bilateral agreements with countries importing Australian uranium that any reprocessing of uranium supplied by Australia may only take place with the prior consent of the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The Government has not abandoned Australia's prior consent rights in any of its nuclear safeguards agreements including those with Euratom, France and Sweden, as well as that with Japan which was signed on 5 March 1982.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) In formulating its nuclear safeguards policy the Government announced that arrangements for exports of Australian uranium should be such that the uranium will be in a form which attracts full International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards by the time it leaves Australian ownership.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) On 18 July 1979 the then Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that in future the export of uranium would be permitted from Australia without a requirement that Australian ownership be retained until the uranium is converted into a form suitable for fuel fabrication or enrichment. He informed the Parliament of this decision in a statement on 23 August 1979 in which he said that this requirement of the Government's safeguards policy had created unnecessary difficulties unrelated to the field of safeguards. He also explained that the Government had established a framework of control which would prove to be fully effective and maintain the integrity of Australia's stringent nuclear safeguards policy. Safeguards are not a function of ownership. Irrespective of who owns the material, Australian origin yellowcake is subject to controls and is accounted for before it is processed to the level at which it attracts full IAEA safeguards.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) The United States Government has accepted a legally binding Treaty commitment in the bilateral Agreement Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy signed on 5 July 1979 and presented in Parliament on 23 August 1979 that Australian uranium supplied under the Agreement will be used exclusively for peaceful non-explosive purposes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Seasonal adjustment of the former series of quarterly unemployment estimates was suspended in 1977 because problems associated with changes in the seasonal pattern, which had accompanied the higher levels of unemployment from 1974 onwards, had rendered the figures unreliable. Subsequently (in February 1978) the quarterly labour force survey from which the unadjusted data were derived was replaced by a monthly survey.</PARA>
<PARA> Calculation of seasonally adjusted estimates for a statistical series requires an analysis of past figures extending over a sufficient period to enable a seasonal pattern to be identified. The new monthly unemployment and employment series have now been established for four years, which is the minimum period from which a seasonal pattern for a monthly series can be determined. Following an analysis of these figures, the Australian Bureau of Statistics proposes to commence publication of seasonally adjusted estimates of unemployment and employment from February 1982 onwards.</PARA>
<PARA> The seasonally adjusted data will first be published in 'The Labour Force Australia (Preliminary)' (6202.0) due to be released in either late March or early April 1982.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Committee of Reference in its Third Report dated 4 November 1981 were mindful of salary movements in the community following the abandonment of wage indexation and took account of them in its recommendations. Paragraph 12.12 of the report stated-'Including as they (the salary scales) do a component to reflect salary movements which are now becoming manifest in the public and private sectors we see no need to review Service salaries here recommended until the last quarter of 1982.' In regard to any national wage movement the committee also recommended at para 4.17 ' . . . national Wage Case decisions, where appropriate should be continued to be flowed to the Defence Force.' The Committee of Reference has therefore already comprehended in its recommendations the salary and wages movement in which you refer.</PARA>
