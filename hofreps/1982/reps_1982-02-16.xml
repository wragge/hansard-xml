<PARA> 1. the proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to post-graduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich; Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. the proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a 'poor risk' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. in regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans, it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. the proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. the proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) post-secondary tuition fees not be introduced for any courses or for any category of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the TEAS scheme be extended so as to more fully meet the real financial needs of students;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that a comprehensive loans scheme not be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that there be no restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> (v) that the proposal not to fund 30 CAEs unless they are rationalized be rescinded.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Defence Service Home Loans</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That all members of the Women's Services 1939-45 War qualify as 'Australian Soldier' under the Defence Service Homes Act for loans because on voluntarily joining the Australian Forces they took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies making themselves available for combat duty in War Zones, and according to Acts and Regulations of the period the Military women had enlisted for service anywhere, some Naval women to sail in any waters, with all servicemen available for service in Papua New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA> As those members of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force of 1939-45 War who were not sent to War Zones are granted loans, refusal to grant eligibility to all Ex-servicewomen of 1939- 45 War is unjust and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that you amend the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) (b), (c) and (d) of the Principal Act as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War.</PARA>

After all, it was the former right honourable member for Lowe who has just reminded Australians of the wasted years of this Government's leadership and why it was futile for him to stay any longer in the Parliament. It is the gelded colt from Kooyong who is now trying to raise a gallop by adopting the ALP's policies on taxes and interest rates to revitalise his frustrated ambitions to replace the Prime Minister before the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that exactly one year after I made the speech from which I would have quoted if we had had more time, it remains every bit as valid as it then was, and even more relevant. All that is different is that this Government has now squandered another 16 months, to the great cost of the rest of Australians, and grossly abused the mandate it received at the last election. That, Mr Speaker, is what this no confidence motion is all about. It is not just because we are now into the seventh year of the Prime Minister's sick parlour game which he calls 'fight inflation first', when we have not even reached the square marked 'start here'. Neither is it because all the major economic indicators on taxes, interest rates, unemployment, inflation and national growth are worse now than when this Government mugged its way into office in November 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just because 12 months ago this Government had yet another opportunity, at the beginning of a new parliamentary term, to put into practice all the unfulfilled pledges and promises it had lived on for five years, but then simply abandoned at the first opportunity. It is not because, in the three months in which this Parliament has been dormant, inflation has recorded its worst three month increase in five years, unemployment has jumped again, interest rates have climbed still higher to new record levels and the Government 's new sales taxes have begun to bite into families' pay packets. It is not only because, in calling the Parliament together, the Prime Minister plans one of the shortest autumn sittings on record, despite the economic mess into which his tired and failed policies are pushing this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Any one piece of this evidence of the Government's economic mismanagement should be enough to earn the censure of this Parliament. Together, it becomes a wholesale indictment demanding resignation. Like its constituent Ministers, however, this Government would not resign even when caught red handed. It remains self-evident that any board of directors or group of employees who behaved as this Government does would be sacked immediately if not gaoled for fraud, dishonest practices and perjury. The Government condemns itself out of its own mouth. In his election policy speech 16 months ago the Prime Minister fantasised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Today, a new spirit, a new enthusiasm, a new dynamism, is at work in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He was speaking of the only job creation scheme in a 69 page policy speech, and even then it was another Fraser myth. Recent headlines in our national newspapers are bereft of any inkling of this new dynamism that our Prime Minister professed to see working so hard at the time of the election campaign. Those newspaper headlines are the reality of this Government's economic incompetence. All the things that should be coming down-I refer to taxes, inflation, unemployment and interest rates-are going up. All those indicators that should be going up-I refer here to living standards, consumer spending and business confidence-are smartly coming down. The Prime Minister's goebbelising of the truth is endemic in his Cabinet. Four months ago the Treasurer (Mr Howard ) was asked by my colleague the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) about interest rates. The Treasurer replied:</PARA>
<PARA> All of the indications in recent weeks are that the climate for interest rates has improved in Australia. There are a number of very encouraging signs that we have started to turn the corner. All in all, the Budget strategy designed to take pressure off interest rates appears to be working. </PARA>
<PARA>He should be a teacher in a nursery school. The children might believe him. The Treasurer made that statement on 14 October last year. Like the Prime Minister's new dynamism, the Budget strategy was not at work then, and it still is not. Since the Budget, interest rates have increased on large trading bank deposits, trading bank prime borrowings, commercial bills, interest rate futures, finance company debenture raisings and building society mortgages. It is now only a matter of time before bank home loan rates again surge upwards. The Government knows this and so does the financial community. The pressure is simply too great . Australia is being pushed deep into a nasty winter of economic discontent by Government actions. Economic activity is being stricken by a vicious credit squeeze. Bank bills will go beyond 20 per cent and Treasury notes beyond 18 per cent by June if present policies continue. Housing mortgages will go up by more than one per cent, and special overdraft rates for small business and funds for the farm sector will dry up. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has plotted a course which it doggedly pursues and which can be described only as economic madness. What the Fraser Government has achieved has been to establish the age of usury in Australia. Speculators, profiteers, boosters and the get-rich-quick are giggling all the way to the bank. The superannuated, the home buyer, small business and farmers are the bunnies. They pay the cost of the brazen rip-off. Government policies are scourging Australian investors, discouraging them from putting their money and faith in real assets for the benefit of Australia. I repeat that the Government is inexorably propelling the economy along a course of economic madness-more wasted years and more bitter disappointment for the people of this great nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Someone else who understands what is going to happen is the Victorian Premier, Mr Thompson, which is why he has called his scheduled State election for 3 April instead of late May when it is due. Clearly the Premier has been forewarned by his Federal colleagues that the Fraser Government cannot keep the lid on bank home loan interest rates any longer than the first week of April, no matter how far in front in the opinion polls the State Labor Opposition obviously is. In the meantime, Australians can judge for themselves just how accurate and how reliable the Treasurer's Budget analysis is, based on his 14 October statement. Of course, I feel sure the Treasurer has some artful form of words to blame someone else for getting the Budget strategy wrong. If nothing else the Government is expert in blaming others for its own mistakes and failures. For six years the Government has variously blamed the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the trade union movement, its Public Service advisers, the Opposition, weak employers, lazy dole bludgers, timid investors, the State Premiers and any other handy scapegoat for just about everything that has gone sour in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that taxes are at record levels, that interest rates are the highest in our history, that inflation is taking off again, that the deficit is now out of control, that unemployment is 130,000 higher than when the Government came into office, that the value of the dollar is seriously out of kilter with other currencies, that economic growth is slowing markedly, that our balance of payments is in trouble, that living standards are down by an average of $20 a week, that wages are rising sharply and that our manufacturing and home building industries are in poor shape-given all these factors, either the Government is the unluckiest government ever to take office or it is run by a Cabinet in which distortion of the truth is a deliberate instrument of policy. I do not propose to take bets on which option would attract most support in Australia today. It is a theme the Treasurer pursued with vigour on radio this morning, blaming overseas conditions. Yet it was the Prime Minister who, seven years ago, scornfully said:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that men and women are governed by inexorable events beyond their control</PARA>
<PARA> When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped, that it is part of a world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership, when, if they were men of real stature, they would be saying, 'We can overcome.'</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Prime Minister, in line with those loftily declared beliefs, whether he is now ready to express to the Australian people the futility of his own leadership. I mention in passing, Mr Speaker, that you no doubt remember very well the particular speech from which I have just quoted. It was made four months before you were stabbed in the back by the man who delivered it. Australia has now had more than six years of running backwards. We are now in the seventh year of Fraserism and we find that, in spite of all our efforts and all the golden promises from the Prime Minister, we are still in reverse. When the Labor Government went out of office in 1975 inflation was little more than 11 per cent and falling. Now it exceeds 11 per cent and is rising. Unemployment was then 310,000 and falling. Now it is 437,000 and rising. Interest rates on home loans were 10 per cent and falling. Now they are 12 1/2 per cent-if one can find a bank to give one a loan-and rising. </PARA>
<PARA> As for income tax, the family man on average award wages was paying 4 1/2 per cent of his weekly pay packet. Now he has to pay to the tax man more than 11 per cent of his income, or a massive increase of 150 per cent. Nothing illustrates more dramatically or depressingly the persistent failure of this Government than this simple fact: The dollar of six years ago is now worth only 20c. </PARA>
<PARA> As for housing, Australia is now in the unbelievable position where the rate of home ownership is actually falling, many families simply cannot afford even to begin buying a home, and many struggling to pay off a home are being forced to sell out on a falling market. What has been happening is that this Government, with deliberate intent, in the name of monetarist policies, has been making war on ordinary Australians. It has attacked their confidence, undermined their security and, in many cases, destroyed their self-respect. Those who have to bear the full brunt of this assault are those least equipped to bear the punishment-our pensioner Australians, our new settler Australians, our black Australians, our unskilled Australians, our young Australians and the rest of the huge disadvantaged army of at least three million forgotten Australians who now live in poverty, by the Government's own acknowledgment, in terms of its health insurance program. </PARA>
<PARA> But the net now goes much wider, the longer this Government stays in office. More and more in recent years, middle and working class Australians also have become victims of the indiscriminate unfairness of the Fraser Government's failed policies. Our Prime Minister, for all his supposed free enterprise attitudes, has still to learn one simple principle about basic rights in a democracy. It is the principle that a free society is one which has extended to all its citizens not only the democratic right to vote but also the fundamental right to a job, equality before the law, equality of opportunity in education, an adequate standard of living and a clear sense of security for all of its people. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a wealthy country and all our people should share fairly in that wealth. Australians in general are not mean spirited, bigoted or intolerant. They have a great and inspiring sense of a fair go. But they demand, and have a right to, a fair go from their political leaders. In recent years it has been the Australian Government-this smug, self-satisfied Government which sits opposite-which has failed repeatedly in the tests which really count, not the Australian people. It is an appalling indictment of this Government's record of neglect and failure that in one of the wealthiest countries in the world almost a full third of its people are badly housed, poorly educated, ill-clothed or undernourished. </PARA>
<PARA> At this time in our history we need a political revival as much as we need an economic one. We need a government determined to dedicate itself to a sense of the fair go for all our people in bringing about a sense of national renewal. To fail to recognise this, to neglect to offer hope to all those casualties of the past six and a half years of unremitting economic attrition, is not only to betray their future but also to misunderstand their patience. I am talking about taxpayers, parents, young people, small business men and women, small farmers, country townspeople and those citizens on fixed incomes, as well as the unemployed, the blacks, the poor and the migrant minorities. The Fraser Government has to cease the nonsense of behaving as though economic laws are made by nature. They are not. They are made by people, and because of this they are flawed and they can fail. The Fraser Government's record proves that. The problems to be faced will not be solved by constantly blaming other people or persistently dividing the community in the search for scapegoats. Nor will superstitious prattle about market forces remedy the defects, the mistakes and the suffering inflicted on our nation. That requires sensible, fair and creative policies, not gibberish from ideologues with fat salaries, expensive and comfortable homes and a remote indifference to ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> There must be a fundamental commitment by government to make the institution of government work for people-and I mean all of the people. Under this Administration, government has become an instrument of privilege and inequality.</PARA>
<PARA> Our single greatest task, confronted by an economy being consciously driven into recession, is to put people back into work. We accept that this is not going to be easy, but we refuse to accept that it is as difficult and as painful as this Prime Minister claims. We of the Labor Party dedicate ourselves to the restoration of full employment. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Government can afford its hesitant and piecemeal approach to tax avoidance, now variously estimated to be a $7,000m a year industry, then a Labor government, determined to make the rip-off speculators, the interest rate exploiters and the tax-avoiders pay their way in our society, can afford policies of genuine job creation to put our unemployed back into productive work . </PARA>
<PARA> The simple truth is that the great majority of Australians wants this to be done. In terms of broad economic strategy, higher taxes and government cut-backs in spending have retarded the economy at a time when it was already slowing down . </PARA>
<PARA> To regain growth, we need to assist consumer spending by putting money back into the hands of those many thousands of families who need to spend it simply to restore lost living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> This can, and should, be done by income tax cuts which favour low and middle income earners; by abandoning higher and new sales taxes; by reintroducing a universal health insurance program that replaces expensive, fixed premiums to private funds with a low health levy based on an income earner's ability to pay; and by a careful selection of housing policies geared to assist first home buyers still trying to raise housing finance, as well as to help those families caught in the interest rate spiral to meet their repayments on homes now heavily mortgaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot argue that this cannot be done. Two former Ministers recently returned to the back benches-the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom)-have argued vigorously in public in support of what we have been saying for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> These sorts of programs would not only generate economic activity and business confidence; they would also bring down inflation. Abandoning the Government's sales tax measures would take one per cent off inflation. The introduction of our health scheme, announced two weeks ago, would reduce inflation by another 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are now seeking is co-operation from the trade union movement in terms of restraint of wage demands in return for a government commitment to improve the social wage, a restructuring of personal income tax, a rejection of confrontationist industrial legislation, and a commitment to the principle of full employment. </PARA>
<PARA> No government in the present difficult economic circumstances can hope successfully to administer the Australian economy without a credible, practical prices-incomes policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Excessively tight money supply and mismanagement of the exchange rate have worsened our economic problems. Restrictions should be clamped on the borrowing activities of foreign investors and foreign corporations operating in the Australian money market to make more money available. The greatest single cause of the balance of trade deficit is the irresponsible revaluation of the Australian dollar by 10 per cent last year that crushed our manufacturing exports and encouraged large scale imports of cheaper manufactured goods. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why the case for devaluation makes so much sense. More Australian goods would be sold at home and abroad, more Australian jobs would be created, there would be more profitable Australian industry, and we would start closing the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has failed in its material aims and national vision, just as it has failed in the day to day conduct of the nation's economic affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Our fellow Australians are entitled to expect a full and rightful share of the bounty this country produces, and which it can expand with sensible policies. They are entitled to expect that every individual has an equal opportunity to find a productive and satisfying place in our society. They will not find that under Government policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the censure motion. I am amazed that the Government has indicated that this debate will be truncated to about three speakers. It is about time the Government realised that when it accepts a censure motion we expect the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to participate in the debate. We have a Prime Minister who travels the world and talks to people throughout the world but he is unable to debate any matter in this Parliament. That point must be of some significance to our Japanese friends who are present today. When a censure motion is debated in the Diet I am sure at least the Prime Minister would be prepared to participate. But what will happen here? There will be a short debate on the censure motion but later another matter, a statement on industrial relations, will be debated at length.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us come to the issue that this censure motion is about-the leadership of the Liberal and National Country Parties and the leadership of this nation. It is an important matter. It is about time the Government realised what is happening in the community. If Government members talked to their constituents now they would see that business is at a standstill. If they talked to people in the real estate market at present they would find that few houses are being sold , not because nobody wants to buy but because people cannot afford to buy. On first mortgages the interest rate is 20 per cent. Does the Government want to run away from that situation? What did the Government mean when, in its last policy speech, it said: 'Australia is the best place in the world to bring up a family.'? There is not enough housing for families. If honourable members want to look at tax reduction, they will see that families are about $30 a week worse off than when this Goverment came into office. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members look at the housing policies now being implemented by this Government, bearing in mind, of course, that the head of Treasury says that we are overhoused and that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) says that he substantially agrees with that situation, they will see a 30 per cent increase in the Housing Commission queues throughout Australia in the last eighteen months. The Government is giving welfare housing one third of what it gave six years ago. From the point of view of giving money to the States for housing, it is giving one-eighth of what was given six years ago. When the Government talks about what is happening in the community outside it should really be saying to the Australian people: 'We are misleading you. We will try to have a debate on some other issue such as industrial disputation.' But what about the issues and promises made on the basis that there would be full wage indexation? There was to be no objection to that policy. At present the Government has no wages policy at all in this country. It is in a complete shambles. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we find when we look at the tax position that has developed in this country? If honourable members look at the pay-as-you-earn proportion of general tax collected they will see that it is now 66.3 per cent whereas when the Government came into office it was 59 per cent. In other words the low and moderate income earners are paying more tax than ever. This is the Government's policy. In the Government's last Budget it proposed to increase consumer tax by a further 2 1/2 per cent on sales. At that time, luckily for the nation, that idea was rejected in the Senate. I now note that the Australian Democrats have had a change of heart and again will reject that legislation. And so they should . If they had clearly indicated that they would reject it on the last occasion perhaps we could have been having a general election now, following a double dissolution, based on the economic record of this Government. How can any government say that we have a prosperous country, that it is a great place to live and that everybody has a future when we have unemployment of 435,000, with hidden unemployment of perhaps 850,000, an inflation rate of 11.3 per cent and interest rates up to 20 per cent? Nobody in the marketplace is able to tell whether they have a future. Certainly people do not have confidence to invest in any area other than money. </PARA>
<PARA> What was this Government's strategy? It appears to have been to encourage foreign ownership and control. If honourable members look at some of the letters and statements made as far back as 1979 they will see that the Prime Minister wrote letters to the Premiers in this vein:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has noted that a number of projects for electricity -intensive industries such as aluminium smelters have recently been announced and that several State governments are implementing major programs to expand electricity supply capacity to meet their requirements. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole thrust of the 1979 correspondence was based on resource development to assist in the aluminium area at least, and in a number of other areas. I mention the case of New South Wales in the context of Premiers conferences. When New South Wales put up a proposal for accelerated electricity generation for about $ 175m it was deferred in 1980 and then rejected. In other words, the Government has a so-called economic plan which appears in correspondence with the Premiers but is denied at Premiers conferences. Is this not the whole issue and thrust of what this Government is about? We are now virtually owned and controlled by foreign governments or foreign enterprises-foreign governments certainly from the point of view of foreign policy; foreign enterprises certainly from the point of view of economic policy. If people are to move in with their money, which they did following the previous Budget to the extent of $6 billion, they will want their pound of flesh. As Rod Carnegie said 'for every dollar of foreign investment, we pay ninefold back'. That is the position now. </PARA>
<PARA> We have massive competition for funds in the economic climate of this country at present. The small Australian cannot compete with the big fellow overseas or the bankers here. This Government is wedded to deregulation at all levels. One of the foremost planks of the Inquiry into the Australian Financial System espoused by the report of the Campbell committee is the deregulation of interest rates. What does this mean from the point of view of an Australian bidding even to get the chance to buy a house for his family? He is outbid at every level. Big businesses are not interested in housing. They are not interested in the average Australian. They are interested in making massive profits out of what they can get out of this country by way of resource development of the type I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened in the world is the significant issue. The Reagan Administration has put much of its resources into armaments when nine million of its people are unemployed. With the obvious suggestion of a breakdown in community life in the United States, things are in a turmoil and nobody is really confident of what the future holds. This means that our big buyers, the foreigners, including the Japanese, are not prepared now to bid for coal or aluminium. There is a complete downturn from the point of view of the thrust of that policy. Where does this leave the strategy of the Government now? I make the point that in 1979-80 the Government was urging massive development resource projects so we could get a better life, but the projects are not taking off. The money is here to own our resources, but if there is to be some development any local capital we have will be taken. Therefore, in the domestic market the limited amount of Australian capital available is no longer available to Australians. It is picked up by the foreigner and overseas investor. That is why we are paying 20 per cent in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> What should a government be doing in this regard? Certainly, as my leader says, it should exercise some control over these matters and intervene on behalf of Australians. To what level of unemployment have we to go before the Government realises that it will be thrown out of office on the basis of not even abiding by its promises? The record clearly shows that it is now taxing Australians as they have never been taxed before. Also from the point of view of transfer of money away from the resources that should have received more, a table that can be compiled will reveal that the Government has transferred about $47 billion away from the people in both social wage and increased taxation; that is, transferred from the Australian people to the Government or to foreign ownership and control. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no question of debts. The debts are bigger than ever. The Government is trading at a deficit. This is why devaluation is around the corner. The Government is borrowing to try to balance the books and has been doing so for some years. On the point of a social wage, the Government should look at what it has done to the workers in this country. In 1975-76 pay-as-you- earn tax was 41.7 per cent. Today it is over 45 per cent. PAYE tax as a proportion of total income tax has risen from 59 per cent to 66 per cent. For example, a process worker would now have to cover a $37 loss in increased taxes plus a $22.50 loss in the social wage to arrive at the 1975-76 standard. In other words a process worker, because of taxation and social wage losses, is now $60 a week worse off than he was in 1975-76. Does the Government say that that is fair and reasonable? How can any government continue to avoid the issue?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While I am talking about avoiding the issue, let us have a look at what is happening in the tax avoidance area. It must interest you, Mr Speaker, that for the income tax years 1976 to 1979 the amount of unpaid taxes in dispute because of tax avoidance schemes is $1 billion to $1.5 billion. In other words, the Commissioner of Taxation levied taxes to that extent but cannot collect them because of the use of tax avoidance schemes. It is because the Government cannot collect its taxes-I gave as an example the amount of $1 billion to $1.5 billion- that the poor unfortunate slave on PAYE, the low income earner or the small businessman, is being soaked both directly and indirectly so that the Government can try to make up the leeway. It is about time this Government made sure that when taxes are levied they are at least paid. If the taxes are a matter of disputation a determination should be made. But to have outstanding $1.5 billion in three years is an indictment of this Government's administration. By the time the Government seeks to collect those unpaid taxes it will find that most of the companies in question will have stripped themselves of any assets or divested themselves of any means of paying the taxes. Nothing is done about such instances. The only instruction given to the Australian Taxation Office is that it should try to negotiate a settlement with the taxpayers because it is so short of staff. This is the sort of nonsense that is happening at present. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government is sincere about having Australia as a worthy place for families to live in it must do something in the wages area. It should at least have a wages and incomes policy, a policy that guarantees that those who work hard for their living are able to keep more of what they earn. The Government should guarantee also that it will maintain the amount of money it is giving to health, education, transport and the like. It should guarantee the people a constant standard of living, something to which they are entitled. The Government should try to fulfil even some of its election promises whether they were made in 1975, 1977, or 1980. Honourable members will remember the famous ones: Interest rates will fall by 2 per cent; inflation will come down to about 5 per cent. Such promises are ridiculous when one looks at what is happening now . </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has run out of policies and ideas. That may be why it has conceded defeat in the coming by-election for the seat of Lowe. That is a surprising concession, given that the coalition has always held the seat. Of course, if it does not win it will be a clear indication of what the Australian people think of this Government. It is important that this Government have appropriate wages, prices and incomes policies to guarantee that, if there are price increases, at least the wage earner will have his standard of living maintained. The Government has deliberately berated the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission any time it has awarded a wage increase, saying that the economy could not afford it. The Government then abandoned the whole idea of wage indexation. It has been a free-for-all ever since. Is it any wonder that we have industrial turmoil! It is no good the Government touting schemes of collective bargaining on the basis that it will have some enforceable legal sanctions. Nobody will wear that when the Government does not look at what is fair. </PARA>
<PARA> We need a solution. The solution has to be on the basis that Australia can be a great nation and can be led properly. The solution will not be achieved through confrontation or selling out to foreign interests. It will be found by dealing with Australians on the basis of their own talents and their own resources. It will involve talking to the big businessman, the small businessman and the trade unions together about how they see their future. There is concern in the automotive industry. It knows that because of this Government's so-called back- bench policy it has no interest in maintaining the industry-none at all. Who would want to invest in that industry if the Government does not intend to persevere with it?</PARA>
<PARA> The whole gamut of this censure motion is an indictment of this Government. I speak here on behalf of not just the Australian Labor Party, but the whole of Australia. It is about time that this Government, half-way through its term, realised that it has a chance to do something and save something from the wreck. That will require leadership from a Prime Minister. If the present Prime Minister is unable to lead he should get out of the job and give it to somebody else. We are sick and tired of listening to what the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) would do, should do or might have done. Many of the things that he has said are worth while, but he is never here to promote them. Certainly, I do not know what happened in the past in respect of many of his decisions but we welcome the fact that he is raising his voice. This clearly indicates that, the Government, within its own ranks, has much to answer for. </PARA>

The most recent and objective material about the state of the Australian economy can be found in the regular Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development survey of the Australian economy. That particular survey not only gives the lie to what the Leader of the Opposition said about the quality of this Government's economic management but it confirms that the Government's present economic policies are the only way to contain inflation in this country. It records that since 1978 Australia's real growth rate on average has been twice that of the OECD area as a whole.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Overall employment in Australia has risen strongly unlike the experience of most other OECD countries during that period. The report said that Australia is one of the few countries which in recent times has reduced the size of budget expenditure relative to gross domestic product. It said that the substantial reductions in public sector borrowing achieved through expenditure restraint had helped to balance competing demands on domestic financial markets and to dampen inflationary pressures. It states that if wage pressures are to be contained there is little alternative but to adhere to a tight demand management . In other words, the most respected international economic body in the Western world was giving a general endorsement of this Government's policies and was rejecting the alternative economic policies of the Opposition. But the hypothetical economy of the Leader of the Opposition is contradicted not only by that OECD survey but also by the most recent economic indicators that are available in Australia. These economic indicators show that gross domestic product has increased at the rate of 3.6 per cent to the six months to September 1981, that private domestic final demand has continued to grow strongly, that retail sales increased by 13.6 per cent in the year to December and that we are living in an economy in which new fixed capital expenditure shows an expected increase of 24.8 per cent-well over double the rate of inflation for the current financial year compared with the last financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The undeniable economic fact is that in a world of very sluggish economic activity and hesitant, even negative, economic growth, the Australian economy is outperforming just about any other economy in the Western world. I know that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would that it would be otherwise. But this country has continued over a period of years significantly to outperform the economies of the western world. We undoubtedly live in a very difficult world economic environment. If we are to have any objective analysis of the state of the Australian economy it would be quite unrealistic and misleading-we would be living in a complete fairyland-to pretend that this country can divorce itself from what happens around the world.

Does anybody seriously believe that with the impact of those interest rates on interest rates in this country, the cause of interest rates will be assisted by our expanding our Budget deficit? But that is the prescription of the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis).

<PARA> If Labor does not gain office next election then by 1983, when we could next hope--</PARA>
<PARA>Piously-</PARA>
<PARA>to gain office, we would face a mammoth task in rebuilding the public sector-and maybe an equally mammoth task in convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the words of the honourable member for Gellibrand. He may have been rolled on the capital gains tax issue but I doubt whether he will be rolled on the other issue because everybody knows that to finance the expenditure programs of a future Labor government it would undoubtedly be necessary for every Australian citizen to pay a higher level of taxation. Any claim by the Labor Party that it is effectively a party of lower taxation is a false claim.</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition also raised that great area of sensitivity to the Labor Party-the area of tax avoidance. We have heard a lot from the Labor Party over recent days about tax avoidance because the Labor Party is very sensitive about the fact that when it was in office it did very little about tax avoidance . The Labor Party will have a splendid opportunity over the next few weeks to put into practice its professed belief in curbing tax avoidance when we present the legislation to take away the investment allowance which is being abused in respect of funding arrangements involving statutory authorities. The Labor Party , which has said through the words of the honourable member for Gellibrand that it is opposed to that amendment, will have an ideal opportunity both here and in another place to demonstrate to the Australian people, particularly the people of New South Wales, whether it is prepared to stand by and allow some of the largest companies in this country to take $100m to $200m from the ordinary Australian taxpayer. The present stance of the Labor Party on this issue is to oppose that amendment. It will have a splendid opportunity in the course of the next few weeks to demonstrate whether it really stands in stark opposition to tax avoidance. The economic performance of this Government over the last six years has brought to the affairs of this country a degree of stability, a degree of predictability. The economic performance of this country is looked upon with envy by a large part of the industrialised world. This Government is delivering the conditions that brought about this economy and will go on doing so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Wage determination and industrial relations are of the most profound importance to the welfare of all Australians and for the development of the Australian economy . Sound policies in these two connected areas are obviously critical to Australia's growth and prosperity as a nation. It is appropriate therefore that I place clearly before the Parliament the Government's policy regarding wage determination, industrial disputation and industrial relations legislation. I do so against a background of widespread community concern about the marked increase in industrial disputation which has taken place in recent times, against a background of very substantial increases in wages which have been received by much of the work force since the abandonment of wage indexation, and against a background of questioning of the traditional system, and of a desire by the community for action to ensure that a better way is found to resolve industrial matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's wages policy has been firmly established since the abandonment of wage indexation last July. It gives clear expression to the Government's basic philosophy and objectives and it is the product of a number of factors. The Commonwealth does not have direct power over wages. The Commonwealth cannot legislate for any particular wage level. As a result, the Commonwealth's role in wages determination is necessarily more indirect that with policy areas for which it has direct constitutional resonsibility. At the same time, however, the Government has a major responsibility to make sure that the growth in wages does not frustrate the achievement of overall economic objectives. It remains the Government's firm view that the sustained control and reduction of inflation is basic to the achievements of substantial economic growth and the improved living standards all Australians seek. Reasonable wage levels and competitive labour costs are obviously a key element in pursuing these economic and social objectives. The Government's wages policy needs to be seen in that context and in the light of the reasons why wage indexation had to be abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA> From its inception, the wage indexation could operate effectively only as long as the consensus between the parties necessary for its survival remained intact. This required the union movement to remain within the centralised wage fixing system and not to seek additional wage increases outside the system. Unless that condition was met, indexation could not survive. The work value round of 1979 was a clear indication that the system was beginning to falter. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission warned of the threats posed by substantial wage increases outside the central system and the level of industrial disputation associated with the shorter hours campaign. But these warnings were not heeded. Disputation increased and pressures for wage increases outside as well as inside the indexation system continued to mount. The result was the abandonment of indexation in July 1981 and, as the Commission made clear at the time, the long- standing procedures whereby individual claims by unions would be heard by the Commission remained available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission also indicated that any application for adjustment on economic grounds would not be heard before February 1982. The Commonwealth Government moved quickly to consult national employers and unions as well as State governments to determine an appropriate course in the new circumstances. Following the Premiers Conference all governments called on unions to use the established system of wage determination involving Commonwealth and State tribunals. Moreover, they stressed that all governments and all parties involved had a responsibility to make the system work and that it would work if it were allowed to and if it were supported by all parties. Governments foresaw that wage claims would come before the Commission as they were pursued on an industry basis. That view was also endorsed by the Confederation of Australian Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The main elements of the Commonwealth's wages policy in the post-indexation period have been as follows: Maintenance of firmly anti-inflationary economic policies to establish an appropriate economic environment for wage restraint; reliance upon established arbitral tribunals and their processes; support for the more decentralised approach to wage settlements on an industry by industry basis; to emphasise that it is the responsibility of unions and employers to use the existing system in an orderly manner with a minimum of industrial disputation, and to be willing to give maximum commitment to agreements reached and to bring them before industrial tribunals for scrutiny in the public interest; a less direct role for the Commonwealth Government in interventions in individual cases reserving the Government's advocacy for national wage cases and major industry cases; and action in its own sphere of employment to ensure that wages and conditions do not lead the market. Consistent with the overall need for wage moderation, the Commonwealth accepts that its employees' wages and conditions should be maintained in a reasonably competitive position. </PARA>
<PARA> In past months significant wage increases have been gained by a substantial proportion of the work force in both private and public sectors as the industry by industry approach has worked its way through industry bargaining and ratification by the Commission. On top of this there will be a national wage case later this month. The Government's response to this has to be viewed against Australia's present economic situation and prospects. </PARA>
<PARA>What Lies Ahead</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Government's policies over recent years have achieved considerable success in bringing about economic recovery. Let me remind the House that over the last two years living standards have risen and thousands of new jobs have been created-over a quarter of a million in the two years to December 1981. The facts are important to state at a time when the union movement and the Opposition would have the community believe the wage earner has suffered a loss of real value in earnings. This is patently not true. Seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings in September 1979 were $239.10 per week. By September 1981 they were $ 301.10 per week. In the same period the consumer price index increased by about 20 per cent. Thus in real terms average weekly earnings rose by about four and three-quarter per cent over the period. Putting it another way the annual income of a person on average weekly earnings increased by over $700 in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Between fiscal years 1979-80 and 1980-81 real household disposable income rose by 3.42 per cent. That is, the real disposable income of Australian families- their after tax income-increased by nearly $3 billion between fiscal years 1979- 80 and 1980-81. Movements in average weekly earnings in 1981-82 are expected to be broadly in line with the budget forecast of 13.5 per cent. The full impact of recent wage and shorter hours settlements will not, however, be felt until the 1982-83 financial year and may well be greater than for this financial year. The Government has emphasised to employers and unions alike the serious implications of excessive wage increases and industrial disruption for inflation, the competitive position of Australian industry and levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> All Australians should share the benefits of economic growth and the rising standard of living it brings, but there must be a recognition that there are limits to the growth of wages possible in any one year. Wage justice is compatible with moderation in wage settlements. Claims for wage increases have to be balanced against other calls on the resources of the community such as those for welfare beneficiaries and the need for investment funds by businesses. This view was supported by all governments at the August Premiers Conference. It is a view the Government has consistently expressed to the Australian Council of Trade Unions in economic discussions with its President, Mr Dolan, and senior union officials. It is a point of view which should be accepted and acted upon. The Government is firm in its commitment to ensure its broad economic policies work to encourage a climate of wage restraint and to dampen inflationary expectations. Let there be no misunderstanding; the money supply will not be expanded so as to accommodate excessive wage increases. Economic policies will continue to be implemented to achieve this objective. </PARA>
<PARA> Conditions in overseas economies make restraint in Australia all the more important for while our economy has been growing, and our national output and employment have been rising, our major trading partners have been experiencing continued recession, and growing unemployment; and, as a consequence, inflationary pressures in those countries have been falling. There is now a real prospect of inflation rates in Europe and North America dropping below Australia 's. This is a prospect which is compounded by excessive wage claims. Our international competitiveness, the profitability of Australian businesses and the confidence needed to maintain business investment are under threat. Job prospects, both for those already with jobs and for those looking for them, are correspondingly being reduced. Obviously the Government and the community want employers, unions and arbitral tribunals to act responsibly so that such an outcome is avoided. As the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development notes in its latest survey of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> It is to be hoped that progress can be made in developing a better understanding between those who make and those who grant wage claims of the effects of their action, taking into account the relationships between inflation , real wage costs and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been underlining to both employers and unions the broad national consequences of excessive wage increases for investment, economic activity and employment prospects for Australians. It is time then for the ACTU and its affiliate unions to take heed of the consequences of unrestrained wage demands and claims for shorter hours. Employers also have a very real responsibility to keep their work force fully informed of the impact excessive labour cost increases will have in investment, output and employment in their industry or enterprise. Against this background the forthcoming national wage case is of critical importance. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU is seeking substantial wage increases-possibly of the order of a further $25-for those wage and salary earners whose increases since the abandonment of indexation have been for lesser amounts. These increases would apply to a majority of the work force. On top of this the ACTU is seeking the introduction of full automatic quarterly cost of living adjustments commencing with the 4.2 per cent increase in the CPI for the December quarter. There is no way that the Australian economy can stand wage increases of this magnitude.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's submission to the forthcoming national wage case will express our primary concern that existing wage pressures are not exacerbated by any national wage decision. The abandonment of indexation makes no less important the requirements of section 39 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission shall take into consideration the public interest and for that purpose shall have regard to the state of the national economy and the likely effects of any awards with special reference to the level of employment and inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> With substantial industry wage settlements having moved through most of the work force and significant shorter hours agreement made in key segments of the economy, there is no room for any general wage increases to be granted in the national wage case and there should be no return to indexation. Such claims on top of wage increases obtained and being sought through industry-by-industry bargaining run the grave risk of doubling up on union wage demands, putting the health of the economy in jeopardy and causing the opposite of what the ACTU professes it wants to achieve for the work force-lowering instead of lifting their standard of living through accelerating inflation and reduced employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> In the transport workers decision in July last the Commission clearly indicated that the unions faced a choice as to how wage increases should be obtained: either by way of general economic cases-that is national wage cases-or by way of increases at the industry and award level. They have chosen the latter course. The unions cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth will submit most strongly that the industry-by-industry approach best meets the needs of the Australian economy. This approach best meets the needs of all, by offering a real chance of containing the rate of inflation while leaving open to all sectors of the work force the way to pursue their claims by negotiation or, if necessary, by arbitration where matters will be dealt with on their merits. The weaker unions will not be left out in the cold by this approach. It is wrong for the Opposition or the ACTU to say that they will be for the State and Federal tribunals are always there for them to pursue their claims. The union movement itself has a heavy responsibility for the orderly processing of claims and ensuring that the industrially strong do not gain unfair or unreasonable advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the national wage case, the Government will reserve its interventions before arbitral tribunals to major industry cases where agreements setting new standards for wages or other conditions of employment and having significant flow-on consequences are involved. This course was followed in the case of the metal trades agreement where the Commonwealth recognised the special features of that agreement-its 12 months 'no extra claims' clause and the willingness of the parties 'to run the gauntlet of the public interest'. Our submissions emphasised to the Commission the need to avoid flow-on of the agreement to other industries whose circumstances were fundamentally different. </PARA>
<PARA> In some other industries settlements which contain 'no extra claims' clauses have also come forward for scrutiny by industrial tribunals. This development offers the prospect of a reduction in industrial disputation during 1982 provided employers and unions accept their responsibilities to ensure that such agreements are honoured. It is some distance from a true 'no strike' clause but I hope employers will in future bargaining put themselves in a position to push for such a clause. It is the ultimate test of the bona fides of the union movement. If the industry-by-industry approach is to be properly used the distinctive features of particular industries and the circumstances and terms of specific agreements reached by bargain and compromise must be recognised by employers, unions and tribunals alike. Each claim has to be weighed and evaluated by the appropriate arbitral tribunal having regard to the particular circumstances and the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to intervene to oppose ratification of the recent printing trades agreement on wages and hours is based on its concern for a settlement which is out of step with bargaining in other major industries. The agreement, by providing for a 35-hour week from December 1982, could lead to pressures for similar conditions in other industries when the economic situation requires the exercise of maximum restraint. The agreement to implement its terms regardless of whether or not it is ratified by the Commission brings into question the willingness of the parties to accept the obligation of justifying their agreement in the public interest before the Commission in order to render it legally binding on all parties to it. </PARA>
<PARA>Industrial Framework</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising against a background of a high level of industrial disruption that the institutional framework for industrial relations in Australia has been called into question. While arbitral tribunals have been ready to deal with wage claims, and have done so in a number of significant instances, the Government deplores the marked increase in the level of industrial disputation that occurred in the second part of last year. Twice as many working days were lost through strikes in the September 1981 quarter as in the corresponding period in 1980. All Australians have needlessly suffered as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> Of special concern were demarcation disputes and those in major industries caused by relatively small numbers of key employees. Demarcation disputes backed by unions placing bans on certain kinds of work or certain employers have become a blot on the industrial scene. The high point of such disruption has been the activity of the Builders Labourers Federation in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU has adopted rules for self-regulation of inter-union rivalry but the glaring omission from its code is any requirement that industrial disruption cease whilst the dispute is sorted out. Unions cannot shrug off the consequences of their actions upon industry and the community. The right given under the law to organise collectively is not a licence to ravage the trade and commerce of the nation with impunity. As a result of the concern of all governments about recent trends in wage movements and industrial disputation, especially those associated with demarcation issues, it has been agreed that these matters will be a major focus for discussion at the Premiers' Conference to be held on Friday next. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past few months I have engaged in extensive discussions with the major employer and trade union organisations in most States. In addition, representatives of many companies, both large and small, have discussed with me or written to me expressing their concern about such factors as the structure of Australian unions and their heavy dependence on craft unions rather than industry or even enterprise unions; the breakdown of any sense of commitment to bargains made and the spirit and intent of the conciliation and arbitration processes; the constant resort to the indiscriminate use of union power often before the parties have even reached the bargaining table, as an act of first rather than last resort; and the Federal-State division of industrial relations powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of a responsible approach by management and unions to industry wage bargaining is tied up with the shape of union structures and the rights and obligations placed by the law on each of the parties. It has become clear to me that many Australians, not only employers, are concerned at the lack of responsibility demonstrated by the trade union movement in its use of industrial action and the relative weakness of employers in the face of such action. It is now more than a decade since the Clarrie O'Shea case and the major industrial battle over absorption of the metal trades decision of 1967, during which time the union movement has declared itself against any legal restraints on industrial action and for the untramelled right to strike and impose bans in almost any situation. I believe the Australian community is saying that enough is enough, that no section of the community can be above the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Improving the institutional framework of industrial relations is a priority task. It is being approached in a number of ways. The implications of divided jurisdiction and ways of achieving better co-operation and consistency between Federal and State jurisdictions have been under review by Commonwealth and State Labour Ministers and will be canvassed at the forthcoming Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA> During this session I intend to introduce a number of legislative intiatives which I discussed with the National Labour Consultative Council on 4 February and which will be the subject of further discussion at a special meeting of that Council to be held in March. The Government has been accused of seeking confrontation with the union movement because of these legislative proposals. Far from being confrontationist, the three legislative proposals are a responsible and reasonable response, both immediate and longer term, to meet a level of industrial disruption which all Australians recognise as totally unsatisfactory. The Government has a clear obligation to develop legislation which will protect the interests of Australians and provide a sound and balanced legal framework within which employers and employees can conduct industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very much aware of the problems associated with union structures which arise in part as a result of the large number of unions that operate in individual industries and range over particular enterprises. Much of the recent discussion about amalgamation of unions has failed to distinguish between the objective of allowing the creation of industry unions and amalgamations which create big conglomerate unions, such as the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, whose membership straddles a number of industries. Encouragement of the development of unions along those lines would not, in the Government's view, assist in reducing the level of industrial disputes to any marked degree. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's long-standing objective, clearly expressed in its industrial relations platform, is the encouragement of industry-based unions. It is also the objective of the Labor Party and the ACTU. Clearly that objective will take considerable time to achieve. The legislation I intend to introduce this session will facilitate the development of industry-based unions and allow enterprise unions to be formed. The door needs to be opened to movement from within the work force so that the present rigidities and monopolies are loosened and structures created which are more suited to a modern economy and representative negotiations in industrial relations and dispute settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> The multiplicity of the unions involved in individual industries also means that key workers who do not belong to the major union with coverage of a particular industry can create substantial industrial disruption and effectively deny useful employment opportunities to their fellow employees. Recent disputes in the waterfront and coal industries are prime examples of the major costs that such action causes. Increasingly rolling strikes and bans from plant to plant or industrial action by small key groups of workers have been used to put intense economic pressure on a single employer, a whole industry, or the community at large. In those circumstances quite often the employer has no work for the other employees. The employer's capacity to resist a strike is reduced to nothing because his wages bill goes on running. He needs protection in that situation and the Government intends to provide it. Consequently I will be introducing legislation later this session to provide employers with the automatic right to stand-downs. Employees who are unable to be usefully employed because of the effects of industrial action by other employees of the same employer or industrial action by employees of other employers may be stood down. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be clearly understood that the stand-down clauses will operate only if there is industrial action. If unions accept the normal processes of negotiation and conciliation and arbitration instead of taking industrial action , stand-downs will not be required. The Commonwealth will be drawing on the Commonwealth's constitutional power over interstate and overseas trade and commerce and over corporations as well as its industrial powers to support this legislation. The Government firmly believes in the right of the individual to choose to join or not to join a union. We do not believe in giving unions the capacity to exercise monopoly power over the working lives of people. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has broadened legislation to allow individual employees to not become members of unions where they had a conscientious objection to doing so. Freedom of association on which unionism is based should not be distorted by denying the fundamental freedom of the individual. We intend to go further and to legislate to incorporate the principle of voluntary unionism in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and to provide safeguards against intimidation or victimisation for those who exercise their freedom of choice in this matter. Moreover, I will introduce legislation withdrawing from the Arbitration Commission jurisdiction to grant union preference. This will greatly assist in reducing the incidence of the closed shop, which is a total negation of voluntary unionism. </PARA>
<PARA> These legislative initiatives are but the start of our program of reform. The Government, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Confederation of Australian Industry, is currently examining the report submitted by Mr Richard Searby, Q.C., and former Deputy President Taylor on the simplification and streamlining of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I expect that legislative action will be taken on the basis of that report later this year to bring about a substantial restructuring and simplification of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. This should be of major benefit to all those associated with industrial relations in Australia. Ultimately reform of industrial relations in Australia needs to go further than simplifying and restructuring what we now have. I will be pursuing for the Government the work already begun against the bench-mark of what I regard as two basic principles: Equality of bargaining power and the equality of legal responsibility of employers and unions. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislative initiatives I have outlined are essential if better industrial structures and industrial relations are to be achieved. Legislation of course sets the framework and establishes the rights, duties and obligations of the parties to industrial relations. In this sense the law can change or mould the conduct of people but fundamentally, of course, industrial relations is about relationships between people-employees and management. Unions, employers and governments have a common interest in avoiding industrial disputes and providing for a fair and equitable wage determination system. The achievement of those objectives will facilitate the development of the Australian economy which is essential if improvements in our standard of living are to be achieved. The national interest is clearly being damaged by present rates of increase in labour costs so often pursued by severe industrial disruption. Union leadership, business management and individual wage and salary earners, need to recognise this and work to improve industrial relations and to contain the inflation in labour costs. Progress towards this unity of interest and purpose will be to the common and personal good of all Australians. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What this House has just witnessed is nothing less than a tragedy. So that there can be no misrepresentation of the kind in which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) and this Government excel, let me at the outset make abundantly clear the position of the Opposition in regard to this question of industrial relations. We of the Opposition believe that this question of industrial relations is of fundamental importance in this country. We also believe-perhaps this view is not shared by honourable members who sit on the other side of the House-that if one were to analyse sensibly, intelligently and honestly the condition of industrial relations in this country, then one would have to recognise that blame does not soley rest in one quarter. So there will be no doubt about this let me say at the outset-I suppose I can speak on this subject with more authority than anyone else in this House-that I acknowledge that at times the trade union movement or some parts of it have been at fault. They make mistakes and they make mistakes for a variety of reasons. But what we have witnessed today in this ministerial statement by the Minister who speaks on behalf of this Government is a parade of prejudices marked by a degree of myopia which is unbelievable and in which he has purported to have discharged his responsibility of analysis in regard to industrial relations by simply cataloguing charges against the trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go to perhaps a very strange scource to immediately try to get these issues into perspective. I will quote the words of the recent Liberal Premier of Western Australia, a fellow Western Australian, the Minister who has just spoken in this House. I will quote from the transcript of the confidential proceedings of the Premiers Conference held in Canberra on 13 August. It is in the statements made in those proceedings by Sir Charles Court that we can start to get an appropriate context in which we can undertake this honest, intelligent and impartial analysis of industrial relations and wage fixation in this country . Let me first of all go to page 33 of the transcript of the confidential proceedings of that Premiers Conference, which was referred to by the Minister in his speech today. Sir Charles Court refers to the fact that there have been some big increases within the trade union movement. He did not get unduly disturbed about it. But what did he go on to say? He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but in private enterprise we need to consider the literally indecent increases in executive salaries. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Charles Court said that we should take account of the literally indecent increases in salaries of executives. Do we hear a word about that from the Minister for Industrial Relations who is supposed to be giving a balanced and dispassionate analysis of industrial relations? Of course we do not hear a word about it. What did Sir Charles Court go on to say? He made some reference to the fact that some people in the trade union movement have had big increases. If honourable members want one single sentence which underlies the motion that was moved by the Opposition today, and which is the heart of the issue, it is in this single sentence by Sir Charles Court which was said here in Canberra in the privacy of the Premiers Conference. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> A great mass of people today are not getting a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA>Sir Charles Court, the recently retired Liberal Premier of Western Australia, is saying that a great mass of people today are not getting a fair go. What did this man say about this question of how to approach industrial relations? We have had paraded in this chamber by the Minister in the latter part of his speech the proposition that the Government will bring in a number of new pieces of legislation. This portrays again its belief that the way to tackle industrial relations is to bring in tough pieces of law. What was said by Sir Charles Court on this question of whether one can properly approach this question of industrial relations by bringing in tough new laws? Let me again quote from the confidential minutes of the Premiers Conference and what Sir Charles Court had to say on this approach. He can speak with some authority on the subject from the way he has acted in the past. On page 22 he is reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA>After looking at the matter very closely, I am convinced that there is no set of rules which we can devise which will improve the situation if we cannot change the attitudes of people involved in the system. You can lay down the most diabolical rules, the most diabolical laws and attempt to implement them; but if you do not have a spirit of co-operation in the matter nothing will work. </PARA>
<PARA>He went back to the same point very briefly. On page 24 Sir Charles Court said:</PARA>
<PARA>I come back to where I started: No system, no matter how clever the law or how diabolical it might be, will achieve a result if there is not goodwill on the part of everybody. </PARA>
<PARA>We could not have it any clearer. He says that it does not matter how clever one is in bringing down another piece of legislation or how diabolical one is; one has to have goodwill. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask: Is one likely to generate goodwill on the clear understanding of the complexity and the importance of the issues involved if the Minister comes into the House and not only takes this myopic view but also in fact, puts dishonest statistics and arguments before the House? We know, as we have had this sort of problem before-</PARA>

The Government will say: 'Oh well, it is near enough. It is too many'. That is the standard of integrity of this Government. The Minister attempts to excuse a deliberate dishonesty in this matter by saying: 'Oh well, it is too many. It is too much. It is near enough'. That is the standard of honesty and integrity of this Government. It is the characteristic of the Minister, and it is characteristic of the way in which this approach is adopted by the Minister and the Government. It is their approach to say: 'Let us play politics with industrial relations. Do not let us attempt to look at the facts. Does it not sound much better when we say that there is a doubling of industrial disputes? It does not matter that it is totally wrong; let us just use that figure'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not support everything the Builders Labourers Federation does . I certainly do not support everything some of its leaders do. If honourable members want any proof of the occasional relationship between the Builders Labourers Federation and me, I invite them to undertake a careful study of some of its publications. Honourable members will find that one of their favourite hate objects over the years has been none other than me. The fact that I have had these things said about me and that they have expressed contempt for me does not deny the fact that if one were to be honourable and decent in discussing these matters there ought to be certain fundamental rules which apply to both sides. What are they? This Government expressed its concern with the actions of the Builders Labourers Federation to such an extent that it initiated two judicial inquiries to investigate what was happening. We know what they were. One inquiry was the deregistration proceedings and the other, in conjunction with the Victorian Government, was a royal commission. Fair enough; we can have arguments as to whether those were sensible things to do, but the Government made its decision to undertake these judicial processes-two of them, not one. Okay, it did it. What happened while those two processes were still going on before any report had been brought down by them? This desperate Government, knowing that it cannot in any honourable way stand up to public debate or analysis on its economic record, has decided that it is going to make an issue of industrial relations, that it is going to try to whip up in the community an attitude of fear, loathing and apprehension about the trade union movements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What was the first tactic adopted by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)? Just strangely, with his crowded program, he decided he had to go down to Loy Yang to see how the construction of the power station was going there. Of course , in the program of a busy Prime Minister, one would expect that it would be of top priority for him to go down and see how the construction was going at Loy Yang. What did he do there? He deliber- ately went out to see the workers on the job. We know it is a characteristic of the Prime Minister that he is always dying to get out and meet the ordinary working people of this country. On this occasion he particularly wanted to go and see the workers at Loy Yang. What happened when he, in pursuit of this thirst he has to meet with the ordinary people, went to see the workers at Loy Yang? When met by them and when one of them asked 'What are you going to do about the deregistration proceedings', what did he say? He said: 'You can wave goodbye to Mr Gallagher'. Where in this issue are the basic principles of decency and honesty, of a commitment to the concepts of law and order, when the man who has set up two judicial inquiries which are investigating the very question of the tenure of a trade union official, of the likelihood of his staying in office and his capacity to do so, the man who has set himself up as prosecutor and has got the inquiries going, before any report has been brought down and while both inquiries are still proceeding, brings down a judgment before those inquiries have reported? Those are the sorts of standards and the sort of integrity that we have on the part of this Government on the issue of industrial relations. It states: 'Do anything you possibly can to take away the opportunity of proper analysis of your economic performance, of your economic management; get rid of all that and just make sure you try to whip up hysteria on this issue of industrial relations. It doesn't matter that you break every canon of decency about how judicial inquiries should proceed'. It is a wonder that the royal commissioner involved and others concerned did not express their contempt for the contempt of them that had been expressed. How can any honourable member sitting on the opposite side of the chamber, particularly those with legal training, possibly justifying a situation in which they and their Prime Minister have set up their judicial processes to inquire into what is happening in regard to that union and its officials and, while the inquiry is still going on, before any report has been made, the Prime Minister, for his devious political purposes, has gone down there and announced to the people involved what the outcome of those processes will be? Their Government and their Prime Minister and any of them who support and sustain that sort of approach are not deserving of one skerrick of support from any reasonable person in this community. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us get away from that point of the double standards of honourable members opposite. They are talking about law and order. They request the trade union movement to obey the judicial processes. How can they possibly live with themselves when they say what they have said to the trade unions, when they make the demands they have made of the trade unions? The Minister in his speech talked about the trade unions not obeying the law, not abiding by the umpire's decision. How can they live with themselves when they do that sort of thing through the person of their Prime Minister? Of course, what we appreciate is that unfortunately the sort of thing that the Prime Minister has done is a reflection of the basic double standards of this Government and that is at the very centre and core of the problem of industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, if you want a recent starting point which determines the deterioration of industrial relations in Australia I will give you the date: It occurred here in this chamber on 30 April 1981. It was on that occasion that the Prime Minister, speaking for this Government, gave the razor gang speech which outlined the philosophy of this Government. I will do the Prime Minister credit in saying the he was pretty straightforward on that occasion in outlining that philosophy. It was a philosophy which stated that the intrusion of government into industry, into regulation, was a bad thing. At page 12 of the document which was distributed subsequently, in referring to the Prices Justification Tribunal, the following was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This body has outlived its usefulness as a regulatory mechanism and is placing an undue burden on industry. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What a marvellous definition of 'industry' the Prime Minister and this Government have, if I may say so! 'Industry', as defined by the Prime Minister, means not everyone who works in industry, those who employ and those who are employed; 'industry', as defined by the Prime Minister, means simply those who employ. The Prime Minister talked about the strain being imposed on industry, so defined, by interventionary mechanisms such as the Prices Justification Tribunal ; so it was abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply want to say, Mr Deputy Speaker, through you to the Government and to the people of Australia, that I believe an intellectual theoretical argument, if you like, can be created which states that it is best not to have any intervention in industry by government; let the free play of market forces run and let the prices of products that are produced be determined by those market forces; let the allocation of investment resources be determined by the free play of market forces. I believe that such a theoretical argument can be constructed. I do not agree with it; it does not persuade me. But I think that at least such an argument can be constructed. What cannot be done is to construct an argument which states, in respect of those who employ, businesses: 'We will apply a concept of non-intervention. We will abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal. You use your strength in the market to get your share of investment resources to set the prices that you think are appropriate'. The Government cannot say that on the one hand and, on the other hand, come in here and say, in respect of the other part of industry, which it is loth to recognise , that is, those who are employed: 'We will bring in more and more legislation, more and more intervention, to inhibit and regulate you in the way you operate'. The Government cannot have it both ways. If the principle of non-intervention in respect of those who employ is valid and market forces should be allowed to have their run, okay, but it has to be across the board. Now the Government, in its funny sort of way, has very vaguely started to comprehend the truth of what I am saying on this. </PARA>

It does not make sense for them to be able to use their power in the markets to advance their position beyond what is reasonable, any more than it is reasonable to allow strategically placed trade unions or labour the same right. If the strong in the community are allowed to exercise their power in that way the result will be very simple.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Swan said that, not me. The point is this: The strong will inevitably get stronger. The strong people on the side of capital will be placed in a position of having a greater command over the scarce resources of this country in terms of investment. In respect of those who are employed, those who are strategically placed by power and who may have no sense of responsibility, who may be mavericks, will have the capacity to get stronger. In the process of the strong on the side of capital getting stronger and the strong on the side of labour getting stronger, we can equally easily identify those who will suffer. They are these: The people in the work force who either are weakly organised or are not organised at all; the farmers; the small business sector of the community; and those on fixed incomes, be they pensioners or anyone else. That is the inevitable result of the application of the philosophy of this Government. I am sure that the exercising of power is an exhilarating thing for those who have the power to undertake it, but it is not so pleasant for the residuals who suffer when that power is exercised. The Labor Party thinks that it is appropriate that neither strong capital nor strong labour should have an unmitigated right to exercise that power. If they believe that they have legitimate claims upon the scarce resources of the community, there should be an apparatus in place which requires them to justify those claims. That is the policy of my party and I believe it is a policy which will be recognised by the community and will recommend itself to the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said at the beginning of this speech that we are not here to endorse every action that is taken by every trade union in every circumstance. We are here honestly to try to recognise what is the best way of improving the industrial relations situation in this country so that the community as a whole will have the opportunity to best and most equitably utilise its resources. Without understanding the first and fundamental point, we will not begin with any series of punitive band-aids to get within cooee of an answer. That first and fundamental point is that the same principles should apply to both sides in terms of the exercise of power and the strong on both sides, not just one side, should be required to justify their claims. </PARA>
<PARA> In the seven or eight minutes that remain I want to address myself particularly , and necessarily briefly, to some of the other points in the Minister's statement. First of all I remind the House that the Minister created the framework of his speech by lamenting what happened to index- ation. His speech indicated that the culprits in respect of indexation are the trade unions; they did not do the right thing, they looked outside the guidelines. I remind the House of the facts, as indeed the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in some of its judgments has reminded the community of the facts. The Commission has not blamed just the trade union movement. When it has thought the trade union movement has been at fault it has said so in its judgments but it has attached at least as much blame-I would suggest more-to the Commonwealth Government for the attitude it has adopted in the indexation cases. I shall give the House the facts-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not selected facts. I do not operate like the honourable member. I know the facts are unpalatable because they feed on prejudice. Between February 1976 and January 1981 the Commonwealth Government made 10 submissions for no increase in the national wage, two for rises equivalent to only 30 per cent index- ation and three for rises equivalent to between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of the consumer price index movement. No submission in the whole of that period, covering 15 cases, ever supported full indexation, which was the promise on which the Government went to the people at the end of 1975. Finally on that point, submissions for no increase were made at nine of the last 10 indexation hearings to 1981. Who was the culprit in the fall of indexation? What chance did it have when a major intervening party-the Commonwealth Government- went in on nine out of the last 10 occasions and argued for no increase at all. Index- ation failed because the Government broke its pledges and promises. The history of this is contained in the Commission's judgments. It said quite clearly that the structure of indexation depended not only on its decisions but also on tax indexation being in place and on a situation whereby the Commonwealth played its role in respect of controlling inflation. In judgment after judgment it made reference to the fact that the Commonwealth Government had let the side down; it had abandoned tax indexation and had deliberately made decisions which, far from reducing inflation, had in fact increased inflation. We have seen this in the figures for the December quarter as a significant part of the 4.2 per cent increase was the result of deliberate Government decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having disposed of that partial attempt by the Minister to explain what has happened to indexation, I will spend the last three or four minutes on dealing with the specific proposals of legislative intervention which were adumbrated by the Minister this afternoon. What are the changes in the law about which the Minister is talking? The one I must deal with first is the matter of union structure. After listening to what the Minister said we must believe we are in an Alice in Wonderland situation. The Minister said: 'We have had our policy in respect of industrial unions for a long time and we are going to pass laws to give effect to it'. What will the laws be? On the one hand, the law will be changed to make it easier to have enterprise unions; that is to say, if 100 or more people are in an enterprise then those people shall have a union. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable members to the statistics. The latest statistics available on manufacturing establishments-they refer only to manufacturing establishments- show that as of 30 June 1980 2,265 establishments had 100 or more persons. If we start looking at all the other areas of the economy, how many damned unions will we finish up with according to this philosophy? This is put forward in the name of giving effect to the Government's principle of industry unions. The Government is going to wave a wand and say: 'Flower here, flower there little unions, flower everywhere. Let's have a hundred unions here, a hundred unions there and a couple of thousand more over there; in every enterprise let there be a union'. At the same time as it is saying: 'Flower unions everywhere', it will be saying that the principle which has been contained in its policy since 1974 and which it regards as fundamental to good industrial relations is the concept of industry unions. Whom does the Government believe it is having a lend of? It is mutually self-contradictory and is a further reflection of the fact that this Government does not approach industrial relations in terms of a sensible, rational analysis of what is best for this country. It has a haphazard, ad hoc sort of approach to please every passing whim and prejudice with which it may be confronted. That is not the way to handle industrial relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that there are too many trade unions in this country. We have over 300 of them. The employers, the Commonwealth Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, in the National Labour Consultative Council, have recognised that fact as a result of two of three years of mutual, constructive, co-operative work. The legislation prepared on that basis to give effect to the Council's belief was brought into this Parliament but the trogladytes knocked it off. It is time for an end to prejudice on the part of the Government; it is time to recognise that there is blame on all sides, including the Government. Let us recognise this fact-let us not think we exhaust our responsibilities by blaming one side only and see that there is a principle whereby the exercising of power by the powerful in this country, whether they be on the side of capital or labour, is brought to an end and those who claim upon the limited resources of this country have to justify those claims before tribunals where the public interest will be represented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I made a simple request for your indulgence, which appeared to be the appropriate course of action to take, but for people who live on technicalities, I take the opportunity to speak in the debate. The statistics for the relevant period from the September quarter of 1980 to the September quarter of 1981-being the last official statistics available, as statistics for the December quarter are not yet available-are as follows: In the September quarter of 1980 the number of working days lost was 848,600; in the December quarter of 1980, 631,000; in the March quarter of 1981, 656,800; in the June quarter of 1981, 762,000; and in the September quarter of 1981, 1,147,700.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The observation by me as to twice as many working days lost was abviously taken from a comparison of the last quarter for which statistics are available for 1981-the September quarter-when 1,147,700 working days were lost with the December quarter of 1980 when 631,000 working days were lost. It is correct, as the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has said, that if one compares the figure for the September quarter of 1980 of 848,600 with the figure for the September quarter of 1981 of 1,147,700 that does not show a doubling.

The people with the problems are coming to us and asking what the Government is going to do to overcome these problems. It does not matter what market research team the Liberals use or what market research team the Labor Party uses in the run up to by-elections or general elections. The same topics come out on top. People cannot live. They are not able to meet all the bills that are being presented to them, whether by the bank, the local Woolworths, or the local corner store. People have problems in trying to maintain the standard of living that they might have had three, four or five years ago. Those are the real problems. The Minister tells us that the great problem with which the Government is grappling is that of wages. This Government has done more to destroy a wages system in Australia than has any government since Federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1975 the Prime Minister of the day said, 'We will abide by wage indexation'. There was no equivocation. The Government of the day was going to live with it, and in spite of the way the submissions went before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the Government adhered to indexation. It went along to the hearings and said that there should be no increases or partial increases, or ceiling increases-whatever they may have been-but it participated in the indexation hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> It was always mad for the Government to believe that the Commission would be able to minimise disputes, which is its historic role in Australia, by carrying out the will of the Government on this question of wages, by giving no wage increases at all or by giving partial indexation and adding to the insult by ignoring completely the impact of increased productivity. All of those things have been occurring in the last six years, yet Government members wonder why the crippling wage structure of the last six years completely vanished in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> If they believe that the union movement, or even people who are not organised, given the impost of this economic mismanagement in Australia, are all going to sit at home and say, 'The Minister for Industrial Relations has told us that we are all much better off than we were three years ago', they must think such people are slightly mad. One cannot go anywhere in Australia and get the story that people think they are better off. The Minister in his statement, keeps talking about average weekly earnings. Everybody in this House ought to recognise that the term 'average weekly earnings' applies to 33 per cent or 34 per cent of people-the minority of wage and salary earners. If honourable members go into the great working class suburbs of this country they will find that people are earning between $150 an $250 a week. They are the people with the real problems. They are the people who cannot keep up. Even the people who are now going above average weekly earnings have another trap lying in wait for them-the Government's taxation schedules. If they go above the $17,000 income mark now they find themselves being taxed as middle class Australians. These are some of the problems that the Government ought to be attacking. It ought to be going out in the course of the by-election in Lowe and saying to the people of that electorate, 'These are the answers we have to your problems'. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Government do when it comes to the Parliament? It had its first opportunity today, the first day of Parliament after four months. We are told we have now to sit 21 days in this session, the shortest session on record. Under Malcolm Fraser we will be the laziest parliament of all time. He had an opportunity to debate all day the economic policies of this Government, but he put up John Howard who talked about 1968, 1973 and 1978. This is 1982. We would like someone from the Government side to tell us what will happen to the people in 1982, in 1983 and 1984 because it is those people who are facing the problems of today. We have listened to the rhetoric of the Government. The Prime Minister of Australia is telling the people who are paying record high interest rates and who are looking at record high unemployment and a wages system which has totally collapsed: 'The Government is not in the business of hitting the pockets of the working men and women of Australia'. He should tell the working men and women of Australia that the Government is not hitting their pockets. These people are going home with less and less money to carry out the functions of a normal Australian family. People cannot pay off their homes. Those who are clinging to their homes are eating worse and worse food. They are sacrificing the proper food that a family should have in order to maintain a family home. The Government is telling them to forget about the wages system or that it will not allow massive wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and his Minister for Industrial Relations have said over and over again that the real villains are the metal workers, John Halfpenny and Laurie Carmichael, Norm Gallagher and the builders labourers, and Charlie Fitzgibbon and the waterside workers. The system which this Government has now adopted is making heroes of the suppossed villains of the industrial relations in this country and the people, as the honourable member for Wills pointed out, who will miss out are the people who are not organised into trade unions or people who are in very small, weakly organised unions. They are completely dependent upon the good will of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This Government will say to them: 'There will be no increase. Don't worry about what the others have got that have gone before you'. The Minister was not stupid enough today to tell us how many people got the recent increases which he described as massive. However, in a speech which he made outside the Parliament but which did not receive as much scrutiny, he told us that 90 per cent of the wage earners had received the increases. That is an absolute joke. He knows it is a joke and everbody in Australia involved in industrial relations knows it is a joke. This Government does not mind those with muscle getting a wage increase because those with muscle are a minority in the work force. The Government does not mind if one million in six million can leap ahead as long as it can keep control over the other five million. </PARA>
<PARA> This is why the Government has destroyed indexation. Too many people, particularly people in rural areas represented by the other side of the House, who did not have the muscle to keep up with the cost of living will now lose out altogether. This is why the Government has sought to bring about a confrontation on the subject of wages. No union leader in this country-it does not matter whether he is involved with shop assistants, metal workers, wharfies, transport drivers or insurance officers-can go to a general meeting of his members and say : 'We have to stop our claim for wage increases because the Government says it is bad'. The membership of every union in Australia is saying: 'We have to have substantial wage increases to keep up with the additional costs which are being imposed by Government policy'. The Minister tells us about the increase in the consumer price index and compares it with the growth in average weekly earnings. But he does not tell us that interest rates are not included in the CPI. He does not tell us that the latest increase in the CPI-the 4 per cent odd-is inclusive of the injected increase as a result of a decision made by this Government to charge every person in Australia a minimum of $10 a week for health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these things are coming together to bring about a militancy in the work force in this country that we have not seen for generations. Any union leader who tries to put the Government's case to the work force in this country at the moment will be sacked. He will be voted out at the next ballot if he puts forward the sort of proposal put forward in the Minister's speech today. The Minister mentioned a multiplicity of things that this Government intends to do. The honourable member for Wills has told us of the madness of industry unions. There is no real understanding by the Government of what it is attempting to do. Who will do the mass rewriting of the constitutions of all the trade unions? Which unions will agree and which will not agree?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government did everything possible a few years ago to destroy amalgamation , and that is still its belief. It is on a bender, as though it were full of dope, hoping that in some way it can write laws in this country that will weaken the will of organised labour in Australia so that people cannot get the increases in wages to which they are entitled. There will be no let up on the wage front in this country in 1982 and 1983. Everbody tells us, including the Australian Treasury which dictates the policy of this Government, that the economy in Australia in 1982 and 1983 can get only worse. No one can say to the work force: 'You have to make sacrifices which we are not expecting of other sectors of the Australian community'. The demands will be there, and Australia is suffering because this Government has had no policy on wages all the way through from 11 November 1975. Australia will be gratified when it does have a government that can come to grips with the proper relationship between government, trade unions and employers on the wages front. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -After that high flying hyperbole from the honourable member for Port Adelaide ( Mr Young) perhaps we can return in the next 15 minutes to at least one or two of the specific matters on industrial relations which were proposed by the Government and which were not referred to by the honourable member or by the Opposition speaker who preceded him, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Wills say that there are faults on both sides. I was pleased to hear him say that what we need in this country is some sort of consensus on industrial relations. I was pleased to hear him say that in substance there is some merit in some proposals on industrial relations that come from this side of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to give the honourable member for Wills an opportunity to state clearly that he supports the Government on one of these industrial relations matters about which there should be bipartisan agreement and about which there should be no dispute. That relates to the proposal by the Government that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should not have power to insert preference clauses for individual trade unions in awards of the Commission, to take one modest cautious step towards reducing the power and the force of the closed shop. That is important it seems to me, not just because it is a fundamental industrial relations issue but because it is one of those factors that is clogging up and restricting the employment market in this country. It is one of those features of the employment market that must be removed, root and branch, if we are to loosen up the employment market and create more opportunities for employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely, here is an issue in which the Opposition can say to us: 'Yes, we support you. We will vote in favour of that amendment to the law. We will agree with you when you propose to take away from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the power to grant union preference'. The Opposition should be saying : 'We will agree with you because it is wrong for closed shops to exist'. It is wrong that a union can say to an ordinary citizen of this country: 'You cannot work in this industry or get a job in this factory because you do not have a union ticket. If you join our union-not any other union-we will allow you into our shop. We will deny every basic civil liberty, every human right of people in this country and other countries in the civilised world in order to preserve the right of the closed shop'. That position is absolutely indefensible. It is contrary not only to commonsense but also to every basic principle of human rights and law. We invite the Opposition to stand up today and say unequivocally that it will support the Government in removing this restriction. </PARA>

I look forward to the honourable member's support on the same terms as those I have just given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today we are debating industrial relations issues and at the outset it should be made very plain indeed that many of those industrial relations issues have a direct and very substantial impact on employment in this country. To put it very briefly: Our case is that employment growth in Australia, although it has been very substantial over the last couple of years, is now being put at risk by a number of factors. The following are not all the factors but we believe they are significant factors. First of all, excessive wage increases have increased the cost to industry in this country and consequently restricted employment opportunities. Secondly, industrial disputes and strikes are deterring employers from expanding their businesses and starting new businesses. Thirdly, I mention the risk arising from claims for reduced working hours which are not being matched in this country by increases in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> We say it is time that all Australians understood very clearly that the consequences of excessive and continued wage costs, of industrial disputation and the never ending demand for reduced working hours will be that employees will be priced out of their jobs. The result will be that employers simply will not be able to afford to employ either new employees or indeed many of their present employees. We say that the success of our economic policies has been reflected in the employment growth in this country over the last few years. But this success will be jeopardised -we do not deny there is a risk at this moment- if there is not more commonsense and moderation in demands for higher wages and shorter working hours. It will be jeopardised if we continue on our self- destructive course as a nation of strikes and industrial disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> I will look initially at the first of those factors-increased wage costs in this country. I will cite one of the authoritative sources in Australia on industrial relations who has had years of experience and who should know what generates employment and what does not and who should know those factors that militate against employment expansion in this country; that is my friend the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). I will go back to the time when employment growth in this country was strong, a situation at the middle of last year when the honourable member gave, I think, a very enlightening interview on radio 3UZ in Melbourne. I do not say this in a churlish or carping way. I praise the honourable member for what he said on that occasion. I will read what he said because I believe it is one of the major solutions to unemployment in Australia. The honourable member's words were indeed prophetic. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If you want what I think is the real answer, it really follows from what I've been saying, I think that if I were in charge--</PARA>
<PARA>That is not the prophetic part-</PARA>
<PARA> I'd be saying to the Government Departments 'now look, we've got to sit down with the trade union movement and with the employers and really try and explain to them what the state of the economy is, what capacity there is for wage movement, what sort of adverse circumstances are there going to be for everyone- including workers, if wages explode too fast. Because-</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member used very prophetic words when one looks at what has happened in this country over the last six months. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>there's no doubt that if wages do explode too quickly, it can have adverse economic impacts on unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>One can say beyond any shadow of a doubt that wages have exploded too quickly in this country and that not only can they have adverse impacts on employment but also have they indeed had very adverse impacts on employment. In the last few months we have seen employers shed labour. We have seen employers shelve expansion plans. We have seen employers obviously reluctant to take on new employees because simply they cannot afford to do so. The honourable member was prophetic when he made that remark. In the interests of the country, the workers and, above all, of all unemployed, I invite him to go to his old friends in the trade union movement-to Mr Dolan and other union leaders-and to say: 'Look, it is beyond doubt that if wages do increase too substantially the jobs of our fellows will be at risk and jobs for the unemployed will be at risk. Employers will not be able to take them on'. That is what the honourable member should be doing. We invite him in the national interest to do exactly that. We invite him and his party to go further and to say: 'We will join with you in a consensus appeal to unions and to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission'. Perhaps the Opposition would even come with us to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and say: 'This is a joint appeal for some restraint and some reason before even more workers in this country price themselves out of jobs and before this country prices itself out of even more overseas markets'. </PARA>
<PARA> Other features also deserve to have the spotlight put on them. I mentioned them briefly already. One of the factors which is militating against employment growth in this country is it seems the never ending series of industrial disputes and strikes. How can it be reasonably expected that employers will start new businesses and expand their present businesses when they cannot rely on getting goods and raw materials delivered, when they cannot even rely on employees getting to work? I have heard from employers in the western suburbs of Sydney that they will not employ young unemployed people in the far flung suburbs because there is no guarantee they will ever get to work-there are so many rail strikes in Sydney. Likewise is the argument in respect of reduced working hours. The union movement, or some parts of it, seems hell bent to destroy sections of industry in this country. They say: 'We want shorter working hours, the same wages or increased wages and we will do absolutely nothing to increase productivity in this country'. This is the third prong in the formula for disaster. If we do not face up to the situation-I paraphrase the words of the honourable member for Wills-in some sort of consensus way and recognise there is reason on both sides and try to adopt some of the attitudes about which , heaven forbid, there should be no argument whatever, this country is doomed. </PARA>
<PARA> Other honourable members want to speak in this debate. In conclusion I think it should be said in as concise a way as possible that we have achieved a lot in terms of employment growth in this country. We have achieved a lot in getting the rate of unemployment down. Although there was some interpretation from various quarters of the figures on unemployment which came out last week, the simple fact is that the rate of unemployment, in the normal way that full time employment is measured, has come down in each of the last four years. Although we say the problem is by no means over, we say, in fairness to ourselves, that at least that is an improvement and we are getting the rate of unemployment down . We invite the Labor Party to work with us along the lines that I have suggested today to demonstrate its support for the idea that we can do a lot as a nation to increase employment and reduce unemployment. If we accept some of these very basic and elementary propositions, the country will be much better off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is little wonder that the workers of this country are concerned to push for some degree of wage equity because this Government's economic policies and the effect these are having on workers are truly appalling . It was elected on promises that it would eradicate unemployment, support wage index- ation, reduce taxation and interest rates, retain national and comprehensive health insurance, and implement workable industrial policies. Yes, it made those promises to the Australian people. Instead, this Government of graziers, pig farmers, dairy farmers and suburban solicitors-anyone but qualified economists-has presided over six years of record unemployment, record tax levels and record interest rates. It has destroyed the capacity and aspirations of all the young people in Australia to own their own home because of its incapacity to hold interest rates down. It has destroyed its own concept of tax indexation and also wage indexation. It has reduced to a shambles many of the vital industries of this country, including the car industry and, unfortunately, the steel industry. It has proved incapable of implementing a just and equitable wages policy and now, partly as a consequence, it is presiding over a rocketing inflation rate. The people of Australia should note that inflation rose by 4.2 per cent in the December quarter, which is equivalent to an annual rate of 16.8 per cent. It should be also noted that the rate of inflation increased from 9.2 per cent in 1980 to 11.3 per cent in 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To the extent that recent wage increases in a minority of industries may have contributed to a resurgence of inflation, this Government has only itself to blame. It has not kept its promises to the wage and salary earners of Australia in respect of any of the matters that I have enunciated to the House. It has allowed taxes to crush the ordinary wage earner and it has allowed the greedy to pay little or no tax by refusing to implement retrospectivity in anti-tax avoidance measures. It is no wonder that the workers of this country are concerned about lifting their wage levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government came to power on a policy of reducing taxation, yet it has become the highest taxing government in the history of Australia. Income tax collections have risen from $15.3 billion to $18.6 billion in just one year. In six years income tax paid by ordinary people has risen from 42 per cent to 46 per cent of total tax receipts. The rub is that pay-as-you-earn taxpayers pay 83 per cent of that 46 per cent of total tax receipts. Of course, the other 17 per cent consist of people such as small businessmen who can reduce their tax commitments to some degree by all sorts of schemes that are not available to the ordinary wage and salary earners. At the same time as income tax levels have rocketed for wage and salary earners, company tax as a percentage of total income has fallen over six years from 15 per cent to 13.5 per cent of total revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Not satisfied with socking wage earners with increased income taxes, the Government has hit them with sales tax increases although it promised it would not do so. Is it any wonder that wage earners are concerned about their falling living standards and their level of real income? The Government promised that there would be no increases in taxes on consumption. We are still debating the sales tax measures which were proposed in the last Budget. I am pleased at the decision which I am told was taken today by some people in another place to abort some of the inequitous increases. The Government intended to increase by over $500m sales tax paid by people who can least afford to do so. I should point out that the Government promised that it would not impose such a tax. This Government has no coherent policies to restructure tax. It has ruled out tax relief this year, unless it decides to bring about a double dissolution or something like that because of fear of what might happen to the economy next year. But it has said there will be no tax relief this year. It wishes to crush pay-as-you-earn taxpayers with high rates of taxation while it goes soft on the tax avoidance industry from which it is said another $1 billion a year could be collected if proper policies were implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government has broken its promises on interest rates. It is not so long ago-maybe three years ago-that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser ) said: 'We will have interest rates down by 2 per cent before the end of 1979'. What has happened? We have record interest rates for housing loans of 12.5 per cent if one is lucky enough to get a loan from banks and 13 per cent to 15.5 per cent from building societies. The semi-government authorities are borrowing money at 15.5 per cent plus. That is the situation faced by workers who want to own their own homes or who are already paying off home loans. The Government will find to its regret that many workers in the electorate of Lowe face this problem. Workers have faced increased repayments of between $66 and $70 a month on an average housing loan over the last two years. Is it any wonder that there are problems with regard to wages policies in this country in the light of the Government's broken promises and that workers, given the fact that the Government destroyed wage indexation as I will prove in a moment, are concerned about maintaining their present living standards? They are faced with the payment of an extra $11 to $20 per week in tax as a result of being pushed by the Government into higher tax brackets, $4 per week in increased sales taxes and at least another $15 per week if they are paying off housing loans. In addition, they are faced with rising prices generally. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has no wages policy. I cannot stress this point enough. The Government has destroyed wage indexation. After promising to maintain wage indexation, between February 1976 and January 1981 the Government was involved in 15 hearings of the court for wage indexation increases. In the first five hearings the Government argued for an increase which was less than the consumer price index increase. In the seven hearings from May 1977 to June 1979 the Government argued for no wage increase whatsoever. In January 1980 it argued for less than the CPI increase and in January 1981, the Government argued for no increase whatsoever. I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard a table prepared by the Parliamentary Library that sets out the Government's record with regard to its destruction of wage indexation. </PARA>

<PARA> It might be noted that the Australian Council of Trade Unions policy, as decided at its last congress, provides in broad terms for the right of unions to fight for increases on an industry basis outside the Commission. It also decided that it should run a national wage case and, also, seek quarterly adjustments. Whilst that is the policy of the ACTU, it does not necessarily happen to be exactly the policy of the next Federal Labor Government. At least we will put forward a rational wages policy which will be based on giving equity to working people. It will not be based on a return to the jungle. It will not be based on a return to collective bargaining. It will not be based upon urging those unions which have a capacity to struggle to fight outside the court and telling those unions which cannot afford to struggle to go to the court and ask for something that will not be forthcoming in the present economic climate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine what this futile, bumbling Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) proposes. He said that his Government will no longer support wage indexation. That is no surprise to us. He said that the Government will urge for no increase in the next national wage case. That is no surprise to us either. But the question I put to the Government is: What about the lower income earners , those people in the weaker unions? The Government is advocating a return to collective bargaining. It is saying that the weaker unions will be able to go to arbitration. Yes, they will be able to go to arbitration but the question is: Will they be able to get a result or will it be the strong unions such as those in the mining and resource development industries and some of the major manufacturing industries that will get the increases? Will the increases go to the workers in the unions which are best able to pay and most able to fight in a dispute? What will happen to the workers in the manufacturing and secondary industries who are consistently and increasingly exposed to the failed economic policies of this Government? I refer to workers in industries such as the car industry, the steel industry, small businesses and the ancillary metal industries. The Minister is really arguing for a polarisation in wage levels in this country. He is saying: 'Let the weak go to the wall and to the strong shall go the benefits of industrial struggle'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me examine what passes for an industrial relations policy. The Minister in the statement said that the Government would legislate to make it easier for employers to stand down workers who, whilst not involved in a dispute, might be affected by it to the extent that there is not work available for them. He should understand that such a policy is anathema to the trade union movement. It will inevitably widen disputes. If there is one thing that the Government should learn, it is this: The standing down of workers who are not directly involved in the strike decision making process can have only one result and that is inevitably to widen the dispute. The Minister said that the Government would give workers the choice of whether or not to join a union and to end the closed shop situation. </PARA>

The Minister supports a closed shop situation inasmuch as he will not and cannot go to the Bar to argue a case unless he has a junior counsel. The Minister is a member of an association which is one of the great closed shops of this country. The Minister is able to command outside this place a salary in one day which is more than an ordinary worker is able to get in one week because of their monopoly yet he has the audacity to come into this place and talk about closed union shops. I want to cite an example in the retail industry. A Woolworths shop in my electorate has decided it will have its very own closed shop because it has said to its workers -this is relevant to the Government's proposed legislation-that they must be members of the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association. Woolworths is sacking women who for 20 to 30 years have been members of another union, the Storemen and Packers Union of Australia, because they will not become members of the employers closed shop union.

Having listened to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) one could be forgiven for believing that we might be discussing a paper on taxation but I wish to assure the House that we are not; we are discussing an important paper on wage determination and industrial relations. I am not one who would ever shy away from discussing any topic and in relation to those matters the honourable member for Cunningham raised I would have to say that taxation is an issue upon which the Government parties have no shame at all. We are the party that is committed to low levels of taxation in Australia, and remain so. We are not the party that is committed to high levels of government involvement and high levels of government expenditure. We are the only ones who recognise that if we reduce government expenditure we will have a capacity to reduce taxation. If we want to maintain expenditure at an excessively high level we will have no such capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to lose much of my debating time so let me look quickly at some of the matters upon which members of the Australian Labor Party recently indicated their adherence to the view that expenditure must be maintained at high levels. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And increased, of course, as my colleague points out. One need only look at one of the related areas. The honourable member for Cunningham was one of those people who opposed attempts by this Government to reduce expenditure by making substantial savings in the area of so-called welfare benefits that are paid to the wives and perhaps husbands of strikers-benefits that are paid to strikers' spouses. The fact of the matter is that that adds a significant cost and members of the Opposition want the Government to continue paying unemployment benefits to the spouses of those who by their own choice want to go on strike. Not only that but also members of the Labor Party rejected important legislation to impose fees in relation to those people who might seek to pursue professional courses such as postgraduate degrees, for instance my colleagues in law who might want to do a Master of Laws degree to help improve their capacity in advising people on tax avoidance. In respect of people who want to increase their income in that way the Opposition said: 'No, we should not put fees on them' and that second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth degrees on some occasions that people might want to pursue should still be paid for by the taxpayers. There is no way a course like that can be sustained. Yet the Opposition would have us believe that we can maintain these sorts of extravagances and a host of others and we can commit ourselves to reduce the levels of personal income tax as well. It is a nonsense and the arguments put by the honourable member for Cunningham are a nonsense and he knows them to be a nonsense. It is about time he committed himself to lower levels of government expenditure. Then we might believe some of the rhetoric on taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In pursuing the debate I wish to make it very clear that I strongly support the positive program that has been outlined by the Minister for Industrial Relations to improve our wage determination system. The fact of the matter is that not so long ago members of the Opposition were criticising the Government for having no stated policy in this area. It is quite clear that there is a very determined policy in this area and one which is there for everybody to see and read and one which we are here to debate. One could be forgiven for believing that today the opposition wanted to debate anything at all except wage determination and industrial relations. I listened with a great deal of interest to the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). He said he did not believe anything the Minister had to say in debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Minister said 'Today is Tuesday', members of the Opposition would not believe him. We on this side understand the way they think. The fact of the matter is that they are basing their arguments in this debate only in prejudice. The fact of the matter is that they ought to have listened to the policy statement because if they had they would understand that there are clear issues which could be discussed and not simply brushed over by the sort of rhetoric that we have heard to date. The honourable member for Port Adelaide wanted us to believe that the Government parties wanted to avoid discussing any other questions but industrial relations. The fact of the matter is that whilst members of the Opposition might want to discuss taxation and all sorts of other things the people of Australia are interested in industrial relations-the people of New South Wales are interested in industrial relations. I wish to point out to the honourable member for Port Adelaide that Mr Wran is interested in industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have here a newspaper cutting. It might have been useful if the honourable member for Port Adelaide had had a look at it before he entered this debate. He would have seen the comments of the President of his own party. What did Mr Wran , the President of the Australian Labor Party, have to say? I read from the Sydney Morning Herald of Monday, 15 February 1982. Perhaps the honourable member for Port Adelaide has not caught up with his reading yet. The article is in Monday's paper if he would like to have a look at it. It is headed: 'Wran's lash at unions; a tinge of ''lunacy''.' If I used such terms I would be accused of union bashing. The fact of the matter is that this is what Mr Wran was saying. One can understand it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there was a 'tinge of lunacy' about strikes which have halted all trains in New South Wales and threatened supplies of petrol and power. </PARA>
<PARA> Describing today's rail strike as 'unnecessary and unjustified,' he said that some elements of the trade-union movement appeared to be inviting the type of draconian industrial legislation that the British Government was enacting. </PARA>
<PARA>I have not had a close look at the legislation yet. I will have a close look at it because Mr Wran may have something there. These were the comments of the Labor Party President. Industrial relations are an issue. The people of Australia are concerned. During this debate people have attempted to avoid discussion of who the real culprits are for the breakdown of the important industrial principle of comparative wage justice. I must admit that I have been persuaded that in the past comparative wage justice was an important principle. I believe that while wage indexation was in place there was a prospect of that being achieved. The fact of the matter is that through a determined campaign by the trade union movement of this country comparative wage justice has been destroyed. This has not happened through the actions of this Government, not by attempting to say that the Government did not want full wage indexation and by suggesting that was some promise of the Government. But by steadily making statements of that sort, the Opposition and the trade union movement undermined the very credibility of the wage indexation system which the Government supported in its entirety. Because members of the Opposition had never read the guidelines that were to operate in that area and were totally unfamiliar with them, they always wanted to argue that indexation was something other than what the Commission itself had said indexation was. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the reason that system was put aside was because a large number of unions were unwilling to accept indexation as a principle and were unwilling to accept the principle of comparative wage justice and went outside that system, sought over award payments outside the system and defeated the objectives of the system. We know also that others, through anomaly arguments, sought to advance their case. Ultimately the number of anomalies became so numerous that they were , in fact, the rule. Employers, of course, in some cases acquiesced in that matter. The shorter working hours campaign of a number of unions in New South Wales was in direct contravention to the spirit of wage indexation, a campaign that brought about its end. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that if employees argue for shorter hours and then expect when that has been achieved still to work the same number of hours but at overtime rates, they are arguing for a higher salary than they would otherwise obtain under the indexation system. That has put intolerable pressure on the system. The system did not end because the Government went out and argued against it; the system came to an end because the people in the trade union movement who had no conscience, no concern-the people who, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke ) called them the strong trade unions, when he made an analogy with the strong capital-were prepared to put aside the system of comparative wage justice. The shorter hours campaign initiated by the metal and power industries in New South Wales in particular were a direct cause of the end of indexation. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will call me short in a moment for the suspension of the sitting. I intend to resume my speech by discussing the particular disputes that brought this system of wage indexation to an end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting, I was endeavouring to erase once and for all the myth that the Australian Labor Party has endeavoured to perpetuate that in some way this Government was responsible for the end of indexation. That is a myth. Earlier in my speech I made a large number of points . I do not intend to reiterate them, but I do note what today the President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Wran, said. He also has endeavoured to perpetuate that myth and to put on to somebody else the blame for his difficulties in New South Wales and the difficulties he obviously has got himself into with his colleagues, particularly colleagues such as the honourable member for Port Adelaide, who no doubt does not see industrial relations as any sort of issue, but of course Mr Wran does. Mr Wran said that in his view it was Mr Fraser who got rid of wage indexation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know that union pressures led to the demise of indexation, in particular four cases that were under way in July last year. I refer to the Telecom Australia disputes, of which there were two. One involved the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association and the other involved the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union. There were also disputes within the Overseas Telecommunications Commission involving a union claim. There were also disputes in Australia Post and disputes involving the Transport Workers Union of Australia. We know that a significant settlement was made in June and the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission failed to ratify that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> When wage indexation was abandoned in a decision handed down on 30 July, the Commission stated that it abandoned the system because of the lack of commitment of the participants to the system and the high level of industrial disputation. I do not know how anybody can dispute that it resulted from agreements people were negotiating outside the Commission. The decision to abandon comparative wage justice was made by the trade union movement. Wage indexation was put to death as a system for delivering comparative wage justice when the unions were not prepared to accept the decisions of the Commission and wanted to go outside the system to settle their claims. I do not intend to pursue that issue any further. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statement by the Minister for Industrial Relations, which we are debating this evening, some important legislative reforms were highlighted. I endorse all three of them because I believe they will be important reforms, reforms that will be welcomed throughout Australia. Interestingly enough, no honourable member on the Opposition benches, except the Opposition spokesman on industrial issues, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), directed attention to those legislative proposals. The honourable member for Wills in his discussion mentioned only one of those reforms and that was the first of the legislative proposals, that which seeks to provide for the formation of industry -based unions and to allow enterprise unions to be formed. He did not discuss the proposal in any detail; he simply heaped scorn on it by suggesting that there is a large number of manufacturing enterprises in Australia and if all manufacturing enterprises were to have an industry-based union that would mean that an enormous number of unions would be created. By heaping scorn on the proposal in that way, he endeavoured to suggest that it was not a viable proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Minister was not saying that all enterprises ought to have a union or that such unions ought to be compulsory. What he was saying was that the relevant legislation would allow for enterprise unions to be formed. Clearly there are a number of situations in which to have such unions would be a positive advantage. One need only think of the very major manufacturing enterprises in the motor vehicle field, for instance. I refer to firms such as the Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd, for which such a union would be appropriate. One need only think of, say, some of the firms that operate in the ports areas, where our overseas trade has been held up significantly because of the very significant demarcation disputes that have been taking place there. I think the reasons I have advanced highlight the fact that that reform, the first one mentioned by the Minister, is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> The second one mentioned by the Minister is, in my view, more important, namely , the proposal to establish a system whereby employers can invoke stand downs when a selected number of employees-I use that word advisedly-go out on strike in order to bring a firm to its knees in an endeavour to further a particular industrial situation. The honourable member for Wills mentioned in his speech-I thought wisely-that there were strong unions in this country and, of course, there was strong capital. He mentioned the reasons that for a long time legislation advanced the cause of the industrial trade union in this country and throughout the world against strong capital. It did so because strong capital was acting in a way which was not altogether appropriate for the membership of the unions. Equally, when the bargaining situation has changed there is a need to review that balance. That is what has happened in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a pathetic attempt we have heard tonight from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) and the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) to defend what they called the Government's wages policy. The truth is this Government does not have an incomes policy, a wages policy. In fact, one of the biggest problems in Australian industrial relations today is the Minister for Industrial Relations. I think if one were to take a straw poll in Australian industry one of the first steps that most employers would think would be advantageous to improved industrial relations would be the removal of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Viner) from the industrial relations portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says I am talking rot. I am not talking rot. I see as many people in industries as he does. They probably do not have the courtesy to say to him that he is not wanted. I am telling him what they say to me. Perhaps it would be good if a few other people told him that. His Government destroyed indexation. It took a Labor government to sell indexation to the unions after the wages push of 1974. A sensible government coming to power after that period of using indexation for wages would have tried to maintain that system by making certain that any decisions it took did not have a detrimental impact upon the index. In other words, if that government were able to contain inflation it would impact positively upon the index, which would mean that there would be a lower rate of increase in wages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People have argued, I do not think persuasively, that indexation just generates more inflation. If we had had a sensible government sensitively making certain that its decisions did not impact detrimentally upon the index, we could have reduced the rate of inflation in Australia, had much more stability in industrial relations and wage fixation, and when there were real productivity gains they could have been spread to the joy of everybody concerned. Instead of that what we have is a government which has run out of all its election promises . It promised to maintain wage indexation, it promised to maintain tax indexation, it promised to maintain Medibank-it promised to do all those things. In fact, what we have seen in the past is impost levied upon the work force which the Government has argued through its counsel at the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission hearings should not be passed on by way of indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we heard the term 'partial indexation'. Indexation is either real or imaginary. It is either real, full indexation or no indexation. Partial indexation is a misnomer. The unions, to their credit, even tolerated partial indexation for a very long time before it became quite clear to everybody that the Government was bent upon destroying it, as the honourable member for Wills ( Mr Hawke) pointed out earlier in the debate this afternoon. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, in judgment after judgment, called upon the Government to stay with the sense and the spirit of the indexation policy and to try to contain itself in terms of the kinds of decisions that were being made by the Government which had a detrimental impact upon the index. The Government obviously was not playing the game. The Commission knew this and so did the unions. Finally, the system broke down. The actions of the Government illustrate that it never learns. It is still adding to the index by its own actions. In the December quarter of last year the index climbed substantially-by 4.2 per cent. Almost half of this increase was due to Government decisions. In the area of health it was 1.3 per cent, of sales tax it was 0.4 per cent and of State and local taxes it was 0.4 per cent. The increase in State and local taxes was occasioned by increases by State and local government bodies because of cutbacks in Commonwealth funding. Those figures account for over 2 per cent of the increase for that quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the costs the Government is asking wage earners to bear. Family allowances have not been indexed since their inception in 1976 and are probably worth less than half of what they were worth then. Pay-as-you-earn taxation is increasing markedly. The great burden of Australian taxation is falling upon pay -as-you-earn taxpayers while other classes of individuals and corporations are being exempted from contributing to this massive growth in tax revenue. Sales taxes are increasing all the time. This year the crude oil levy will raise $3, 500m, most of which will come from the motoring public. At no stage did the Government have a mandate to increase petrol taxes but it did so. The petrol tax is a completely new tax and a real impost on wage and salary earners. In the last two years rising interest rates have cost persons with a mortgage of $30, 000 about $15 a week or $60 a month, yet the Government has the temerity to say that these increases should be borne by wage and salary earners and that wage increases should not be pursued. This Government's wages policy is basically to screw the economy to the floorboards, to hold back the rate of growth in the money supply so that it is difficult for employers to pass on any increases in wages. The Minister said in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA> Let there be no misunderstanding; the money supply will not be expanded so as to accommodate excessive wage increases. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, at the moment the money supply is growing at about 7.7 per cent and inflation is running at 11.2 per cent or more, so we can be certain that the money supply will not be expanded to accommodate anything; it is actually contracting. The point at issue is that this Government has no wages policy whatsoever. There is no point in the Minister coming in here and trying to tell us otherwise. Average weekly earnings are expected to move from the 34c in the dollar tax bracket to the 42c in the dollar bracket later in the year. This will add to the burden on wage and salary earners and they will seek a resolution of that problem. The situation can be alleviated only by the Government bringing in some taxation relief. The Minister spoke in very contradictory terms. I will read a passage of his speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> On top of this the ACTU is seeking introduction of full automatic quarterly cost of living adjustments commencing with the 4.2 per cent increase in the CPI for the December quarter. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no way the Australian economy can stand a wage increase of this magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the page, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The weaker unions will not be left out in the cold by this approach. It is wrong for the Opposition or the ACTU to say that they will be for the State and Federal tribunals are always there for them to pursue their claims. </PARA>
<PARA>On the one hand the Minister talks about an industry by industry approach to unions and the capacity of industry to pay and on the other he says that the employees in weak industries who are not able to extract those kinds of wage movements can go back to the State and Federal tribunals. When the Australian Council of Trade Unions puts a case to the Arbitration Commission for the introduction of full automatic quarterly cost of living adjustments for those very people who are in weak unions and weak industries and who are seeking a 4.2 per cent increase as compensation for the December quarter consumer price index, he says that there is no way the Australian economy can stand this. One cannot believe that that kind of inconsistency could be argued within one page of a ministerial document which purports to be a serious attempt to look at the problems of industrial relations and wage fixation, yet we find that in this document. The Government obviously is just kidding itself if it thinks it has any kind of wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We come then to this new concept of enterprise unions. That is a joke. As the honourable member for Wills pointed out very capably before the suspension of the sitting, statistics in regard to the categories and levels of employment about which the Minister was talking show that there are 2,265 such enterprises in the manufacturing industry alone. That means 2,265 individual unions. Obviously there is no way one can get any union management structure in enterprises of that size. There is no way that one can get the kinds of efficiency that should be seen in union managements, particularly in relation to wage fixation, movements in inflation or the economy and the things for which union managements are responsible. There is no way that 2,265 unions could afford the sort of advice or expertise required. They cannot be compared to the local unions in the United States because those unions are parts of much larger unions. The Government intends here to have individual small unions in an enterprise. That is no solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Whenever we have looked at the amalgamation of unions to try to get away from the proliferation of unions in Australia we have always had opposition from the present Government. Amalgamation was opposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when he was the shadow Minister for Industrial Relations and he has continued that opposition. In the first couple of pages of the speech the Minister laments the fact that the Commonwealth does not have direct power over wages. When the last Federal Labor Government proposed a referendum giving the Commonwealth a wages power, the present Government as the Opposition of the day vociferously attacked and opposed the proposal. At no stage has it sought to clothe the Commonwealth with adequate constitutional power over wages. At every turn it has opposed the amalgamation of unions. That has been done basically on advice given by the National Civic Council to the Prime Minister on the basis that the amalgamation of unions ends up in big left wing unions being formed. That does not have to be the case at all. It would be very much in Australia's interest to have an amalgamation of unions rather than the proliferation of unions which are part of our history and which produce so many demarcation problems within industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the Government is now desperate to try to light upon a wages policy to save its political hide. However, nothing will save its political hide. The Budget is now in tatters. The heavy levels of capital inflow upon which this Budget is premised are not arriving. The money supply is growing at a very slow rate. A major credit squeeze is running and the Commonwealth is offering 16.5 per cent for securities. In this morning's newspapers the institutions are offering 17 per cent interest and are on-lending at 19 per cent, 20 per cent and 21 per cent. Who in this country believes that enterprises can be financed with interest rates of 21 and 22 per cent and still maintain growth. Growth is plummeting. The only growth left is that which comes from mining sector investment and that is receding as well. The economy is going deeply into recession. Prices and inflation are going up, unemployment is rising, pay-as-you -earn taxation is increasing and sales taxes are increasing. All of these imposts are rising. In this climate, with a very pessimistic community and a declining economy, wage and salary earners are looking for compensation to try to keep kith and kin together and to make ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has completely run out of ideas. It has had it. It is ready to leave power. It will lose office very soon because there is nothing that it will be able to do now to resuscitate the Australian economy. It is doomed to languish for some time and we will see a change of government in this country. When we see that we will see some industrial relations with sense, based upon the respect between the ALP and the Australian trade union movement. There will be some real meeting of minds in arriving at a sensible wages policy based upon a mutual understanding of problems and not the bash and barge sessions we have had from the talking head, the honourable member for Stirling, the present Minister for Industrial Relations who represented the unions when he was a barrister. He would do anything to make a quid. He is now on the other side of the House belting the hell out of them whenever he gets a chance in fulfilment of the philistine views of the Prime Minister. This Government will never make the grade in industrial relations. This document is a joke. It will be regarded as a joke by any sane commentator on industrial relations. It gets no respect from the Opposition. We completely oppose the sentiments contained in the document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement this afternoon by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) on wage determination and industrial relations outlined the Government's very clear and succinct policy on this important issue . It must be recognised from the outset that the Commonwealth does not have direct power over wages, nor can it legislate for any particular wage level. But it does have a very heavy responsibility to make a contribution to the proper processes in this important segment of the welfare of the Australian nation. This afternoon we listened to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in what could be described only as a ranting and raving session about the problems of the Australian economy and about the trend of the situation in this country in many respects. One can assume only that this was really deliberately designed to overshadow one of the major considerations that has to be debated by this Parliament, that is, the statement made this afternoon by the Minister for Industrial Relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is patently clear that the Opposition is floundering on this matter. It is patently clear that the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has failed to put forward any constructive proposition. Likewise, his one and only admission was made during the contribution by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs ( Mr N.A. Brown) when he reminded the honourable member for Wills of a statement he made last year on the importance of some reality in the determination of wage levels. That was the only sane admission made by the honourable mumber for Wills today in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deprecate the approach, which we have just witnessed, of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) who, above anyone else, ought to be the last person to engage in personalities in this Parliament. He asserted that there was some underlying campaign against the Minister for Industrial Relations in the arena of the industrial sector of this country. What he does not admit, of course, is that it is just part of a campaign on the part of the Opposition to try to denigrate the approach by the Government to these very important questions of where we go on wage determinations, what policy should be proposed and what processes should apply in order to bring some sanity into what is really a runaway situation at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a responsibility to make a major proposition at all times in this matter. It has that responsibility because it is the responsibility of the Government. We were told this afternoon in no uncertain terms to accept responsibility for the economic climate and for those matters of administration by government that affect the economy. It remains very clear indeed that one cannot divorce this question of the processes of wage fixing from the overall question of management of the economy. So the Government since it came to office , has made a very clear proposition-certainly it has in this statement-as to the ways and means by which these things should be approached. We deprecate the collapse of the system as it has operated for several years past. We do so on the grounds that the parties involved did not honour their word in many respects and did not accept the reality of sticking to agreements or to some form of arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the militant sections of the trade union movement a belief has grown up that if they go out in support of a single cause for some section of the work force of this country it does not matter about the rest and that if they gain what they want to hell with what happens to the rest of the country. It is little wonder that we have heard the honourable member for Wills this afternoon quoting some statement made by the then Premier of Western Australia six months ago. It was equally interesting to find that he made no reference at all to the statements made this week by the Premier of New South Wales, who also happens to be the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party. I ask whether he forgot or whether he was deaf when the Premier of New South Wales, in very clear terms, said that some union leaders are showing twinges of lunacy, are being bloody- minded and are kicking the public in the face with their unjustified bout of strikes. If we look State by State at the industrial situation today it is little wonder that the statement made this afternoon by the Minister underlined in particular the importance of having some cohesive approach to this matter when the Premiers Conference takes place later this week. That is the venue that should follow the enunciation of policy by this national Government on behalf of the respective parties which constitute this Government. At that Premiers Conference there ought to be reality about where we are going economically, what the needs of this period are and what will be required if we are to keep this country out of dire economic trouble in which wage fixation could be the Achilles' heel to a dilemma that we just do not want to see occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the Premiers will show reality when they meet at the end of this week because the expressions from the majority of them indicate very clearly that they understand the problem and recognise the needs. Certainly what they are saying individually is very different from what we have heard from the Opposition in this House today. I put it to the House that a course can be followed which will accommodate the aspirations of those who represent the workers of this country, which will accommodate a sane approach on the part of industry, which will provide the jobs and the economic climate and which, at the same time, can be taken as part of an overall encompassing approach based upon the statement that has been made today. It was a reasoned statement and not one that is one-sided. It was a reasoned statement which states the facts as to what has occurred, what has put us into the position we are now in in this country and what moves can be made to further us along the track of getting a fair deal for all sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us remember that under the present trend there is a consistent and, unhappily, a non-rewarding approach by sections of the trade union movement to avoid at all costs, the proper processes of arbitration and to use the strike weapon and all of the other devices which are many and varied today. Let us remember that the damage being caused to the average Australian citizen is now really far beyond what is reasonable and far beyond what the average Australian citizen can understand. I refer to the impact at all levels. It is well known and well understood, certainly in most of the States. In New South Wales-my own State-we face the most drastic effects upon the economy because of industrial blackmail in the electricity industry. I refer to the bans which have been placed on the bringing into service of 25 generators needed to carry the load in the electricity field in the coming winter. The ban was deliberately imposed in respect of those 25 generators ordered by the New South Wales Labor Government. What is the Opposition saying about that? What did the honourable member for Blaxland say about that? He said nothing. There was deathly silence as far as he was concerned. Of course he, as one of the executives of the Australian Labor Party, would work, I expect, in very close liaison with the President of the Australian Labor Party, the Premier of New South Wales. Surely those two men recognise the damage done to their party, to their Government in New South Wales and to the people of that State; yet we have heard not one word of condemnation in this debate concerning this major issue. That is but an example of what we are witnessing in this period. Obviously, it is part of the price paid by the respective sections of the Labor movement in trying to accommodate the extreme Left in many instances, extreme groups in many instances and, overall, the price for failing to recognise that if political expediency alone is taken into account in the matter of industrial relations we jeopardise the chance of saving this country from what can only be described as real disaster-disaster for the future of employment, disaster for a fragile economy and certainly grave hardship for those sections of the community which are less able to withstand the effect of these things. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to those on fixed incomes. I refer to those who are participants in small business. I refer to the farming community. I refer to all of the sections which, under no circumstances, are in a position to pass on the drastic effects of cost increases which must flow as a consequence of the kinds of things that are occurring at present-unless we adopt a sane approach of the sort that has been suggested today, the kind of approach which would put the Arbitration Commission back into business on a sensible basis in regard to wage determination, one that would provide a chance of restoring some equilibrium in the matter of industrial disputes. Time does not allow me to explore some of the proposals that the Government is putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA> What a tragedy it is for this country that Opposition spokesmen, in particular the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), should condemn any suggestion that some change might be made. The honourable member, who was for so many years the leading advocate for the trade unions as the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, had never-ending trouble-which he has admitted and which in saner moment he refers to in slightly more practical terms as the impossibility of managing the system as we have it today. Despite this, any suggestion that a move be made towards making a change that might bring about a better balance is immediately attacked, without even the chance being given to see what its terms are on the excuse that the Government is making a deliberate move towards confrontation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wills, as does the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who has just interjected, knows clearly that it is absolute kite- flying on the part of those who express that view. They know perfectly well that the proposals for amending legislation-thus far outlined in general terms, with the details to be given at the appropriate time for debate in this House-will provide an opportunity to overcome the real difficulties that all sections face today and that, in fact, they represent the real reason for the statement to which I referred earlier by the Premier of New South Wales. It is not the first time that that kind of statement has indicated very positively that there is a problem, that there is a need for a sensible approach to the updating of the system as we have it today.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI4">Mr IAN ROBINSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is necessary to go back and look at the rest of the circumstances. One then sees that the statement made by the Premier of Western Australia was made in the context of a discussion at a Premiers Conference and that a range of other issues related to it. It has been quoted out of context this afternoon, and in no way can stand on its own if one makes a comparative assessment of the situation-if one looks at the whole picture of industrial relations in Australia today, State by State, remembering that about 50 per cent of the responsibility in the matter rests with the States because of the break up of the unions and awards that come under State jurisdiction, as distinct from those that come under Federal jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, I support strongly the Government's policy as outlined this afternoon by the Minister for Industrial Relations. I believe it offers us some hope to resolve major issues which this nation faces at present-the great problems of unrest and discontent, the great problems which, as I said earlier, are affecting every section of the community-problems which must be remedied. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The timing of the statement on wage determination and industrial relations by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) has not really much to do with industrial relations at all, but it has a great deal to do with the Lowe by-election. In that by-election voters will have an opportunity to express their outrage about interest rates, housing shortages, excessive rates of taxation on people receiving less than average weekly earnings and the savage imposition of sales tax. On 13 March voters will pass their own vote of censure on the Fraser Government. However, the one issue that the Government hopes it can use to its own advantage to reduce the expected margin of defeat is that of industrial relations or, as practised by this Government, and this Minister, the art of union bashing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been one of the traditional stocks-in-trade of Liberal governments since 1949, and their United Australian Party and National predecessors dating back to the 1920s, to blame the trade unions for everything that goes wrong in this society and this economy. The trade unions, the siren voices shriek, are too strong-and by implication the industrial-political oligarcy must be too weak. The reactionaries of our society, like the Minister, call for a basic redistribution of wealth and power, a redistribution which will strengthen those who are already strong and weaken those who are already weak. </PARA>
<PARA> The Poverty Commission report, actually published under the aegis of this Government, found a basic distribution of wealth in Australia in which, so far as income was concerned, the top 10 per cent had 22 per cent of all income, the middle 40 per cent had 47 per cent of income and the lowest group, the 50 per cent at the bottom of the socio-economic pyramid, had less than 30 per cent of the total income. </PARA>
<PARA> The view of the Government is that if only you could change this, if only you could reduce the income received by that 50 per cent, if only you could cut it down to 20 per cent, everything would be all right; if you could only redistribute up. It is like a diversionary tactic-someone crying, 'Fire, fire!' Once it was the Reds under the bed. Now it is, 'Too much power for the trade unions'. It is miraculous that they have been able to get away with it for so long but, in fact, they will say anything. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the genius of the Liberal Party-I refrain from using that word about the National Party because it would not be appropriate-to teach lower income people to lack confidence in themselves and to feel that if anything goes wrong it must be people like themselves who are to blame. It is extraordinary to compare the kinds of things that the Minister was saying this afternoon, when he talked about trade unions with their excessive power holding up the nation to ransom and so on, with what was said by an authority who would certainly be respected by members of the National Country Party. I quote from a speech given in January 1981 by the Right HonourableJ. D. Anthony, the Minister for Trade and Resources and Deputy Prime Minister. The speech about industrial relations in Australia, was given in Japan on Australia Day. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is one aspect about Australia that is sometimes raised . . . and indeed was raised at last week's discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the industrial relations situation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge there are too many strikes in Australia but the position in Australia is not as serious as the position in the U.S., Britain or a number of other large industrialised countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia strikes are generally of a short duration compared with other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, in terms of man days lost the impact of strikes in Australia is small compared with that of public holidays and normal holidays of workers. </PARA>

<PARA> Despite industrial disruption, Australia has remained a reliable supplier to Japan and still offers advantages of price, quality, transport costs and stability . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Even though we have strikes, Australia is a very stable country and strikes do not lead to fundamental changes in the social and political order. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to take up one or two of the points made by the Minister for Industrial Relations this afternoon. I will follow up the point made so eloquently by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) about that fallacy of average weekly earnings. The Minister said that in September 1979 average weekly earnings were $239.10 a week and in September 1981 they had risen to $301.10 a week. The implication was that such an enormous rise must be attributed to the trade union movement, and that it must have a terrible effect on inflation. It has to be remembered that 66 per cent of all wage earners, and that includes the overwhelming bulk of people in the trade union movement, receive less than average weekly wages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the Government does not want to know about that. We have to remember that the average wage is not the same as a median wage. The Government talks as though that figure of $301.10 is a median wage. I dare say that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) thought that the two figures were the same, but they are not. Let me illustrate how this comes about. Let us imagine a group of five people. One earns $1,000 a week, two earn $250 a week and two earn $100 a week. Between them their gross earnings are $1,700 a week. Therefore, the average wage, dividing $1,700 by five, would be $340 a week ; yet four of the five earn less than that average figure-two of them marginally less and two substantially less.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, honourable members opposite do not understand at all. There is a tremendous fallacy about average weekly earnings but there is no fallacy about one of the things for which this Government deserves the severest censure, and that is the way in which the income tax squeeze penalises lower and middle income earners, particularly in marginal seats such as the seat of Isaacs and many others throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. The income tax squeeze is the result of course of tax rates which were set basically many years ago. They were then appropriate enough because an income 10 years ago of, say, $200 was comparatively significant.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The tax rates set are quite oppressive and middle and low income earners are paying far too much tax. Our taxation system which was designed to be progressive has in fact become regressive in practice. The glib assumption is often made that wage rises are a unique contributor to inflation as though the wage rise was the base figure on which all other charges were added leading to a total inflationary figure which is far greater than the wage rise itself. To use a phrase that used to be hurled around a lot by the Minister for Industrial Relations, it is as though the wage rise has a kind of multiplier effect. In other words, if we have a wage rise of 5 per cent we might expect double that figure as the total inflation figure. In fact it does not work out like that. The conventional economic wisdom certainly links the growth of inflation in the 1970s, especially in Australia, with wage rises and deficit budgeting. However, a comparison of inflation-as measured by consumer price index figures-increase in average weekly earnings and the size of domestic budget surpluses or deficits for the 1970s suggests that the links are apparent in some years, but not always, even allowing a time lag of 12 to 15 months for flow-on to occur. I seek leave to incorporate a table prepared by the Parliamentary Library on the comparative impact of wage rises and budget surpluses or deficits upon inflation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The final point that I want to make before I conclude is that I thought the Minister gave an extraordinarily simplistic explanation as to why one of the problems in this economy of ours was that people were reluctant to start new enterprises, and that was the line which was also taken up by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown). I can tell them why people do not start up new enterprises in Australia. </PARA>

We have a list of major enterprises in Australia dealing in coal, copper, aluminium , uranium, motor manufacturing, food processing, computers, drugs, chemicals, plastics, petrol and advertising.

<PARA> There is one other point I want to make in the minute that remains. I want to say something about the Minister's advocacy of enterprise unions. I think that this is a crazy idea. I agree completely with the honourable member for Wills. The idea is based essentially on the Japanese model; but, as honourable members know, Japan has a very different industrial history. It comes out of the feudal tradition-in fact it comes out of the bushido or samurai tradition-in which there is the tradition of lifetime employment and national enterprises such as Sony and Toyota are owned by the Japanese themselves. There is no corporate raiding. Also there is company involvement in education, housing and health none of which are part of our tradition. I think to suggest that we could simply pick up the Japanese tradition of the enterprise union and simply graft it onto the Australian social environment is talking nonsense but it is exactly the kind of nonsense that one would expect to hear from the Minister for Industrial Relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bills that I now re-introduce into the Parliament will impose sales tax of 2 .5 per cent on a range of goods that are at present exempt from the tax. The measures represent the last of three groups of sales tax changes proposed as part of the 1981-82 Budget. The other two-an increase of 2.5 percentage points in sales tax rates and the correction of a number of anomalies and inconsistencies in sales tax classifications-are now law, operative on and after 19 August 1981. In my Budget speech, I drew attention to the clear advantage that lies in effecting some change in the mix of direct and indirect taxes. I spoke about the potential that such a change generates for desirable reductions in direct taxes, particularly personal income tax, as economic and budgetary conditions permit. The prospect of doing that depends very much on a broadening of the indirect tax base. In particular, the measures in these Bills must be brought into effect. One simply cannot discard measures designed to raise some $ 300m a year without jeopardising the capacity to accommodate other desirable measures in the Budget. Despite some things which have been said against these Bills, the Government, after full consideration, is of the view that there is a clear balance of advantage in proceeding with them, and I therefore resubmit them for passage. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members know, it is for constitutional reasons established practice to enact nine separate Acts when imposing sales tax. Constitutional considerations also lead to these Bills being in exactly the same form as the Bills of the same title that were last year passed by this House but not the Senate. The Government trusts that on this occasion the Bills will be approved by both Houses. The delay in their passage means that it will not be practicable to adhere to the planned commencement date of 1 January 1982 and, as I have already indicated, a new operative date of 29 March 1982 has been set. It is the Government's intention that, as soon as these Bills have been passed by both Houses, a further Bill will be introduced to change from 1 January 1982 to 29 March 1982 the date on which these Bills come into operation. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach in each of the nine Bills now before the House is to impose tax of 2.5 per cent on goods that are identified by reference to items in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, and which at present exempt the goods from tax. The technical effect of the Bills will be to levy the tax on goods that are at present exempted by items 51, 53, 54, 58, 60, 82 to 90F inclusive, 96, 105, 107, 113F, 120 and 120A in the First Schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The broad classes of goods concerned are books, magazines and newspapers, building materials, packaging and wrapping materials, hand tools, clothing, footwear, drapery, soft furnishings, manchester goods, motion picture films, servicing equipment and construction equipment. I emphasise that goods falling within any of these categories will still be exempt from sales tax if they are sold in circumstances in which an overriding exemption in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act applies. By way of example, where a school entitled to exemption under item 63A purchases books for the school's use, the books will remain exempt from tax. Similarly, where a manufacturer purchases hand tools for use as 'aids to manufacture', as defined, the tools will remain exempt under the 'aids to manufacture' head of exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity of clarifying further my announcement of 18 December in which I said that arrangements had been made to extend to schools, universities and other organisations exempt from sales tax the operation of the regulation which already permits some tax exempt bodies to reclaim from the Commissioner of Taxation a rebate for the sales tax component where goods are acquired at tax inclusive prices from retail suppliers. Some education authorities have read my statement as a compulsory alteration of existing arrangements under which suppliers provide goods without charging sales tax on production of a sales tax exemption certificate. I wish to stress that this is a misreading of my statement of 18 December. The extension of the regulation to cover organisations not previously covered is an option available to them, and there is no compulsion upon these organisations to change the arrangements they have with their suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA> An explanatory memorandum covering technical aspects of the Bills is being made available to honourable members and, as this sets out more fully the goods affected by these measures, I think that I do not need to provide further detail at this stage. The net result of the changes will be an increase in revenue estimated at some $330m in a full year. The original estimate of the increase in revenue in the current year from those proposals was $132m. The delay in implementation means that only some $53m will be collected in the current year, a shortfall of $79m from that projected in the Budget Papers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier, the present Bills complete the Legislative framework for the sales tax changes announced in the Budget, and it is desirable that they soon become law. It is now some six months since these proposals were announced in my Budget Speech, and Bills in the same form as the present Bills were introduced into this place. I therefore trust that the Parliament will now give these Bills a speedy passage. I commend the present Bills-the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) 1981-to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to talk about this statement I, like the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), go back some time to seek a point at which to start. I select as the point the principle that used to be one of the main planks of the trade union movement, namely, a fair day's pay for a fair day 's work. Unfortunately even the honourable member for Wills, with the great intellect which I acknowledge he possesses, would be hard stretched to try to relate the unions' present attitude to that principle. In fact the principle today possibly could be amended to read 'as little work per day for as much pay per day as can be forced from the employer'. It is unfortunate that the word ' productivity' is not in the vocabulary of either the trade union movement or the Australian Labor Party. To back up that statement one has only to look at Australia's abysmal record. One need only quote some of the latest International Labour Organisation Figures which are current to 1979. The International Labour Organisation figures compare the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees in the mining, manufacturing, construction and transport industries in some 19 countries. The International Labour Organisation series shows that, in terms of working days lost Australia's industrial disputes performance puts it sixth highest in the world. On the basis of an average over the five years from 1975 to 1979 the countries with higher averages than Australia were Spain, Canada, Italy, Ireland and India. After Australia the next highest were the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The statistics show that by any standard Australia is at the top end of the list in respect of industrial disputation. What is not readily apparent from the statistics is that our disputation is highly visible internationally. Our disputes impact on other countries because they often occur at the point of export or in respect of an export commodity. Of course, added to that is the effect that those strikes, those industrial actions, have on our own businesses, perhaps not the ones directly connected with the particular strike situation but the flow on to the actual manufacuter, the rural industry of the other sectors that suffer so badly . Then, of course, we have a chain reaction in that the more strikes occur in this country, the more industrial disputes we have, the more there is a lack of job opportunities because employers just cannot cope with the cost of running a business and trying to keep a business going when so many hours are being lost because of strikes and still put on extra people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> New South Wales, which is under a Labor Government, is now known as the strike capital of Australia. The figures I have, which no doubt the honourable member for Wills will verify are correct, indicate that in the year to September 1981 almost half-approximately 45 per cent; I said 'almost'-of the working days lost in Australia were lost in New South Wales. Almost twice as many working days were lost in New South Wales as were lost in Victoria over that period. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="037">Mr BOURCHIER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Victoria, under a Liberal Government, is doing better. The comment can be made, of course, that Labor gives in to strikes because the unions own the Labor Party. Perhaps they do not own it but they finance it, they direct it, and they state the policies and force them home. Of course, when there are strikes of more or less national importance or concern we never hear from the honourable member for Wills or the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), and I have put them in their right order. They have been very silent on strikes called in New South Wales by key Telecom and postal employees and by employees in the coal and power industries, as well as the on-going waterfront and seamen disputes. We never hear any complaints from them about that. That is a quite acceptable factor for the ALP. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown) addressed himself to the belief that the people on the other side of the House should begin at some time to say that there should be equality, there should be some levelling, some meeting ground. They should be able to come to taws with us and go to the employers as well as to the unions and try to get some balance in the whole situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), on behalf of the Government, has announced that he will introduce certain legislation. Some of the proposed legislation will effect stand-downs. It is absurd that in a work place of some 500 or more persons an employer should have to pay wages to keep 480 people employed when he has no work for those people simply because some demarcation issue or some industrial action has resulted in 20 people staying on strike and frustrating the whole effort. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) make a comment which I thought was rather interesting. He said that if the people on this side of the House feel that by bringing in stand-down clauses that will have a positive effect they would be totally wrong and that in fact it would create a widening of a strike situation. I do not totally disagree with that concept but I put to the honourable member for Cunningham-I am sure the honourable member for Wills would agree with me-that there is a danger in the situation which I have cited where a large number of employees have to be paid at a time when there is no work, in other words when there is no productivity and no money coming into the company. The employer might be forced to go out of business and that would be far worse than a widening strike situation because there would be no work place to which the workers could return. That situation is fast being approached and that is why some action of a positive nature has to be taken by this Government to try to break this constant stream of strikes that is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that the Minister is looking at is industry unions. It is hopeful that one thing can be achieved in this area. There are many problems in this area. I accept that. I am not closing my eyes to the problems that occur because of industry unions but there is no doubt that one of the greatest problems we face-I believe that some honourable members on the Opposition side would agree- is demarcation disputes which are the most frustrating industrial issues that we have in this country for the simple reason that they are created between two union bodies of employees. The employer suffers, the employees suffer and the public suffers. In many cases it is not a dispute over wages; it is purely a dispute as to which is the king union in the area. There is also that very touchy subject of voluntary unionism. I am sure that many of us have seen the effect on people who have been forced not to take a job because of the principle in which they believe and that is that they do not wish to join a union. There is a closed shop and they cannot get a job. I think we have a right to protect the people against that sort of discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier in my speech I did mention the rather interesting statistics by way of comparison between New South Wales and Victoria. Victoria is, I think, considered to be the major manufacturing State in this country. One-third of Australia's employees in manufacturing industry work in Victoria. Some 418,000 as registered in November were employed in Victoria. Victoria produces about 60 per cent of Australia's motor vehicles. Victoria is a major force in engineering , chemicals, textiles, food processing and so on. The reason Victoria, from where I come, is a major State in these areas is that it has a good government and that good government has taken actions in the past to try to stop industrial unrest. If I may compare the industrial relations situation in the two States just briefly, New South Wales as the strike capital under Chairman Wran lost almost twice as many working days-again I use the word 'almost'; one has to be so careful-as Victoria through industrial disputes. From January to September 1981 the working days lost in Victoria amounted to 584,000 and in New South Wales the number of days lost was 1,151,000. There is quite a difference. Victoria with some 20 per cent of the Australian work force had 22 per cent working days lost and New South Wales had some 45 per cent. It can be seen that the good performances in Victoria are at risk because of two factors. Firstly, the trade unions in the area are definitely trying to cause industrial unrest. They are being led by militant left wing unionists who are the backbone of the Labor Party in Victoria. Secondly, in Victoria we have the Labor Party which is notably controlled by the extreme left wing and which promoted a man named Cain as their leader. </PARA>

The Leader of the Opposition in Victoria who was promoted by the extreme left wing and who has the backing of the militant left wing trade union movement has committed himself to taking action that, if the Labor Party were unfortunately elected to the Parliament in the forthcoming election in Victoria, he would repeal the positive measures which have already been introduced by the Victorian Government, such as the Vital State Projects Act. That legislation was used for hastening the completion of the Newport power station. I would like to add that the present Premier of Victoria in his earlier capacity as Treasurer and Deputy Premier was the man who, acting as Premier, took the action that allowed this absolutely essential power station to proceed despite the threats and the actions of the unions.</PARA></TALK.START>

Another piece of legislation introduced in Victoria related to secret ballots which enables the new industrial relations commission to order a secret ballot on its own initiative. This legislation has already displayed a marked degree of success with the speedy resolution of the strike at the Ford Broadmeadows plant. Another Act that the Labor Party Leader Mr Cain in Victoria would try to delete is the Essential Services Act. That Act was invoked by the Premier, Lindsay Thompson, in July 1981 to end the transport workers strike. If my memory is correct, that strike is the one which affected milk deliveries in the State. The unions were absolutely heartless as was the Australian Labor Party in respect of concern for the mothers of young children who needed milk, hospitals and so on. It did not worry them one bit as long as they went out on strike and achieved their aims.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that if we had a Victorian Liberal government in New South Wales it would be a much better State. The people of New South Wales are obviously starting to learn that because unfortunately I did have to make a visit to New South Wales. It always used to be a pleasure to stop over at Sydney for a night. It was quite a pleasant place to stay. Now when you go there you cannot even stay in a hotel because it is so hot and you are not allowed to have the air conditioning on because of the power strikes in Sydney. Not only will people be leaving Sydney but also the business people will be leaving New South Wales in droves unless there is a change of government in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Getting back to the positive State of Victoria under the control of Lindsay Thompson, the Victorian Government introduced another Act called the wrongs Act- the Public Contracts Act. It was introduced in December 1981 to get the Builders Labourers Federation bans at Loy Yang lifted. That Act enables Ministers or statutory authorities to recover on behalf of the people of Victoria losses for damages caused by workers being induced to break their contracts of employment. I hope we can do something along that line in this place because obviously that is one of the great problems that face industries when they have to suffer great losses incurred through no fault of their own. They have done nothing wrong and they have tried to co-operate but because the union has a demarcation strike or some sort of action industry loses and great damage is caused to a company and ultimately to the people generally. Mr Cain has stated quite clearly that if he is elected this legislation which he has said is provocative and a threat to the conciliation and arbitration system as long as it is on the statute books will be removed. It goes without saying that if he were unfortunately to be elected he would get rid of that legislation, that so-called threat. To suggest as he has that legislation to protect the community from union anarchy is pointless, provocative and stupid I think almost puts him in the same bracket as some honourable members from the Opposition side tonight from whom we have heard comments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister referred on page three of the ministerial statement to wage indexation. The honourable member for Wills and certainly the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) made some comments about that point. I would like to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Port Adelaide because he honestly believes that the Australians in the street and in the work shops, the ordinary Australians, will tell everybody including us-they tell us loud and clear-that they are not the slightest bit concerned about the number of strikes that are occurring in this country. I have got news for the honourable member for Port Adelaide. He ought to get out into the streets. He claims that people come to his office. Obviously the people who go to his office are only his bunnies because the genuine people are fed up to the teeth over the strike situation in this country. They want the Government to do something about it and this is the Government that will do it. As the Minister said in his speech, wage indexation could operate effectively only as long as the consensus between the parties necessary for its survival remained intact and that has not occurred because the unions kept pressing for increases inside and outside--</PARA>

They kept pressing, hammering, threatening and cajoling until they got wage increases outside the guidelines and of course that broke the whole of the arbitration commission system. The unions were warned time and again that the system could not work unless they stopped that. That is exactly what happened. The ultimate result was that disputation increased, as did pressures for increased wages outside as well as inside the system. As a result, there was an abandonment of wage indexation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Make no mistake, Mr Deputy Speaker; today this Government, through the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), has set or attempted to set the ground rules for the next federal election. This has not been a statement about good industrial relations but, in fact, it is the first salvo in an attempt to rescue this Government from the economic mess it finds itself in. If we are to give any credence to the remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), I think it is the first salvo in the lead-up to the next State election in Victoria. For one minute I had to think about whether I was in the Federal Parliament or the Victorian State Parliament. All I heard about was Mr Thompson and Mr Cain and what the dreaded Labor people are going to do to the State of Victoria. No mention has been made of the economic mess the Victorian people are in after 27 years of conservative government. On 3 April the Victorian people will sweep the Liberal Government out of power because of the mess in education, transport, industrial relations and the like right throughout the Victorian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the statement of hot air rhetoric that we heard today. All we have heard about is how the workers and the unions are to blame for everything that is bad and for every industrial dispute. How ridiculous can one be? Are all disputes caused by unions? Every reasonable thinking Australian will have to think for only one second to come up with the answer, no. No one group, as the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) pointed out quite correctly and succinctly earlier today, is responsible for all disputes. However, this Government continues to portray the picture that no matter what it is, the unions are to blame. I do not think it will hold much credence any longer because the people of Australia are starting to wake up to that situation. They are starting to ask themselves the questions that I am asking and coming to the same conclusions. Of course, it cannot be the fault of the unions all the time; other factors must be causing this situation. It is not always the employers. One can go back over the last few years and cite a number of disputes, one after the other, that have been deliberately inflamed by the actions of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In general, Australian management would be among the most inefficient in the world as far as industrial relations are concerned. I do not include all management, but to put it in plain English some do not have a clue about how to handle any industrial problems whatsoever. If the hot air rhetoric from the statement of the Minister for Industrial Relations was bad enough, we then had to put up with 10 minutes before the suspension of the sitting for dinner with the speech of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). I am glad he is in the chamber because his speech was absolutely unbelievable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One could say that. That would be a mild expression. He actually had the audacity and the affront to attack the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) for talking about taxation. According to the honourable member for Dundas these matters had nothing to do with industrial relations. Little does he know that he needs some teaching from some decent people like the honourable member for Wills. He will tell the honourable member that there are a number of issues such as taxation, interest rates and health that have not just an indirect but a direct effect on industrial relations in the country. One cannot separate them all and say: 'We will not talk about that or we will talk about this dispute here'. It does not work that way and it cannot work that way. Let us turn to page 7 of the Minister's statement. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Movements in average weekly earnings in 1981-82 are expected to be broadly in line with the Budget forecast of 13.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>There must be some mistake because he has left out a line. He has left out the line that pay-as-you-earn taxation will rise by nearly 22 per cent. I will quote from page 230 of Budget Paper No. 1. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . gross pay-as-you-earn receipts are estimated to increase by 21.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Average weekly earnings are going up by only just over 13 per cent. One might say that there is a slight gap there. If that is not bad enough, we find that the health situation has been in a complete mess since 1975 when we had that great quote from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that we will maintain Medibank Private. In the latest concoction there is a minimum payment a week. In Victoria one can get a basic cover for $10 a week. The average family has to front up with that amount. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to two other areas that are not included in the consumer price index . The first one is in the forgone money that families should have. I refer to family allowances. I think the responsible Minister at the time was Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. She said that that was the greatest social innovation in our history, or words to that effect. The latest statistics show that because of the failure of the Government to index family allowances-including the latest Budget figures-a family with two children today is $25.75 a month worse off in forgone money; a family with three children is $30.75 a month worse off; and a family with four children is $35.75 a month worse off. We can go right through to a large family of six children who would be $47.85 a month worse off in forgone revenue. These amounts are not taken into account in the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA> We come now to another area that is not in the consumer price index; that is, interest rates. A lot of people do not realise that this does not come into the CPI figure. Interest rates are the highest in Australia's history. That is not a political statement; it is a fact. Honourable members opposite know that as well as I do. As has been mentioned here today, they are ranging to over 20 per cent. It is absolutely wonderful for people with money to lend because they can get over 20 per cent interest on their money, but we, the vast majority of the population, are the ones who have to pay those high interest rates. In the area of housing, 14 per cent to 15 per cent would be a common figure for interest rates so far. I think that will rise in the time ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I estimate that the average family-compared with three years ago-is now paying anything between $50 and $150 a month more in mortgage payments. Of course, that varies according to the size of one's loan, but many people are having to take out sizable loans and $150 a month is not an outrageous figure to cite. One will find many, many thousands of people paying much more a month now than they were three years ago. We find a lot of families do not get to that situation because they cannot afford to take out home loans. The reason rental charges are rising is because the rental market has been flooded. All these matters have an effect on industrial relations. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) pointed out earlier that many people come into his office, as they do to mine and I think the offices of most Labor members, and say 'we just cannot live because the economy is in such a depression that the Government is really squeezing every last drop out of the average worker and his family'. All these things I have mentioned come together to squeeze family budgets. When people are , in fact, eating minced steak and minced sausage one day instead of the steak that they were able to afford, the real standard of living is dropping. That is why workers-not union officials as is the great myth-are asking for and demanding more money. While that may happen in some circumstances, a multitude of ordinary workers are puting a great deal of pressure on their officials and saying: 'We just cannot live; we must have wage increases'. One cannot step back and argue against wage increases as a government, without taking into account all the government policies connected with the economy and the pocket of the average Australian person. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said in this House before, the attitude of this Government to industrial relations has been one of confrontation. It has been one of confrontation since 1975 when this Government took office. Here we are again. The Government is in trouble electorally. It will find itself in trouble leading up to the 1983 general election. Lo and behold, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations have now got together in this wonderful concoction of 20-odd pages of drivel to tell us that they are going to bring wonderful peace and some wonderful things to the industrial relations area that will make Australia a great country again. It just will not work. People cannot be bashed over the head to win a dispute time and again. It has not worked before and it will not work now. </PARA>
<PARA> On amalgamation, as the honourable member for Wills pointed out last year, amalgamation legislation was ready last year but the Government refused to bring it down. I am sure that when it is brought down in this autumn session of Parliament we will find it not in line with the original amalgamation legislation. I point out at this stage that the honourable member for Dundas and the honourable member for Bendigo, who spoke previously in this debate, voted against amalgamation legislation when it was brought before this House by the Labor Government. Mr Clyde Cameron was the responsible Minister at the time and the honourable members for Dundas and Bendigo, who were then members of the Opposition, voted against the amalgamation legislation. Now they are saying: 'We will have amalgamation and we will have enterprise unions'. What a lot of drivel . They are not serious and they are not being honest. </PARA>

Whilst individuals have a right not to join a union, people who have a right to join a union and do so also have a right to decide whether they will work with the non- union members. If there are 100 people in a work place, 95 of whom decide to join a union and five of whom decide they do not want to, each of the 95 has a right, which honourable members opposite support, not to work with the five who do not want to join the union. Honourable members opposite talk about democracy. They come into this place, with the support of a fraction over 50 per cent of the voting Australian public-let us not forget that 49 per cent of the people voted against them-and say: 'This is the will of the people of Australia.

This issue will not be the big election issue the Government is going to try to make it out to be. The Government will not be able to bash the New South Wales Government into defeat. The Government will not be able to save the Victorian Government from being swept away, as it should be after 27 years of inept and incompetent government.

There has been a bit of talk about a lack of constitutional powers, that the Federal Government does not have constitutional power in several areas so it is doing its best under the circumstances. But why has it not done anything about the situation? The Government parties have been in government for 30 of the past 33 years. It cannot blame anyone else. It has had ample opportunity-30 years-to sit down and work out some constructive policies and to put them to the people. We will put constructive policies to the people when we become the government after the Federal election in 1983, or whenever the Government calls the next election. The attitude of this Government will not work. The situation is rather disgraceful. The economy is in a mess and undoubtedly people will pass judgment on the Government at the next Federal election. After that election, we will have a Federal Labor government and sensible consultation in the industrial relations area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ministerial statement which has been put before the House by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) deals with two topics: First of all, the Goverment's wages policy which moves towards a greater decentralisation in wage fixing; and, secondly, specific legislative proposals dealing with preference clauses, stand down by employers and enterprise or industry-based unions. Having listened to the debate this evening, one might be pardoned for thinking that this was the Budget debate we were engaged in rather than a debate on that ministerial statement and on those proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look first of all at wage fixing. On 10 September in this House, in the course of the Budget debate, I advocated the view that the centralised wage fixing system had come to an end. There are many reasons for that. One of the reasons is the failure of the parties concerned to adhere to the system and the absence of any sanctions to enforce such a system. That view, I am glad to say, has in effect been accepted by the Government. What is the answer given by the Opposition? Opposition spokesmen have said that the centralised wage fixing system somehow came to an end as a result, it would seem, of some plot. It has been put-sincerely put I assume-by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) and the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) that submissions made by the Government in the course of wages hearings somehow affected or worked to the destruction of the centralised wage fixing indexation. Also, according to the honourable member for Wills, the Government broke promises. </PARA>
<PARA> That demonstrates two things: First of all, a complete misunderstanding of the functions that submissions have in wage cases; and, secondly, that neither of those two gentlemen has either read the very short statement of reasons handed down in the national wage case of 31 July or, if he has, he has not understood them. A submission made in the course of a case is simply a view that is put and the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission either accepts or rejects it, or it accepts it partly or rejects it partly, or it discards it entirely and comes to an independent view. It has no effect other than that. It is something said in the course of argument. The decision in the national wage case of 31 July 1981 was referred to by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to have a copy of the reasons for decision in that case incorporated in Hansard. Leave has been given by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) for that course to be followed. </PARA>

<PARA>Commissioner Griffin</PARA>
<PARA>Reasons For Decision</PARA>
<PARA> Since April 1975 the Commission has operated a centralized system of wage fixation based on indexation. It was expected that such a system would be more orderly, more rational, more equitable and less inflationary and would therefore reduce industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential feature of such a system was the need to regulate and limit wage increases outside national wage to allow high priority to be given to the maintenance of real wages. It was accepted by all that a set of rules would be necessary to achieve this priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The viability of the system depended on the voluntary co-operation of all participants in industrial relations including those not directly represented at National Wage hearings. Monitoring of sectional claims through the processes of conciliation and arbitration was fundamental to its operation. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time since 1975, the Commission has pointed to the fragility of the package and in June 1979 the Commission came to the brink of abandoning the system. A decision about whether we should persist with the system was given as recently as April this year. The Commission refashioned some of the principles to strengthen the priority for the maintenance of real wages but the essential requirements of the package were otherwise unaltered. </PARA>
<PARA> The events since April have shown clearly that the commitment of the participants to the system is not strong enough to sustain the requirements for its continued operation. The immediate manifestation of this is the high level of industrial action in various industries including the key areas of Telecom, road transport, the Melbourne waterfront and sectors of the Australian Public Service. In many cases action was taken on the pretext that the claims could not be processed because of the principles. Some of these disputes have resulted in substantial increases being agreed without regard to the test of negligible cost or the implications of flow-on. </PARA>
<PARA> To accommodate these strong pressures the ACTU and the Commonwealth proposed widening the safety valve provided by the principles dealing with anomalies and inequities. The belief that the answer lies in greater flexibility of the kind proposed is illusory. Such flexibility would resolve sectional claims at the expense of national adjustments and destroy the priority expected of a centralized system. It cannot be otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons we have decided that the time has come for us to abandon the indexation system. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that we have taken this step the guidelines will no longer apply in proceedings before the Commission or the Public Service Arbitrator. The Commission will deal with applications as filed, members of the Commission will sit alone or on Full Benches and the various provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act will apply. For instance the concept of the 'interests . . . of society as a whole' (section 4) will still permeate activities of the Commission and of course Full Benches will still be required pursuant to section 39 to have regard to the state of the economy with special reference to likely effects on the level of employment and inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Any application for adjustment of wages or conditions on economic grounds will not be heard before February 1982. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JJ4">Mr SPENDER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As was pointed out by the honourable member for Dundas, there is nothing in that decision to support either of the two propositions advanced by the Opposition speakers, particularly the honourable member for Wills. The Government, having accepted the decision in the national wage case, has sought to place major responsibility for fixing wages with employers and employees. Given the system we have, given the division of powers between the States and the Commonwealth and given the limitations on the Commonwealth power-they are there and cannot be overlooked-it is eminently sensible that those directly concerned should have more responsibility for wages and conditions of pay. After all, if employers and employees do not as a general rule know what their interests are, who does, and who is the Government to give them a better view of what their interests are? What does the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) say to this. Insofar as he addressed himself to the Minister's statement-he managed to spend about three or four minutes on this topic-he said, amonst other things, that what is proposed favours the strong, that the strong would get stronger and the weak would get weaker, and that the Government had no wages policy. I am sorry to say that I missed the first few minutes of his remarks, but I could not discern from his speech what wages policy he proposed. From listening to members of the Opposition address the House, it is perfectly plain that they will conjure up their wages policy at some propitous occasion shortly before an election, or else it will be their old policy which has been rejected by the commission itself. It seems that they are really saying that there should be quarterly adjustments, a national wage case, industry bargaining and, as well , shorter hours. That is what has been put in the national wage case and that kind of approach which has been discarded. Given that situation, given those facts, they have the effrontery to say the Government has no policy when all they advocate is a return to a policy which they helped to sabotage, and sabotage most effectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not suggest that what is proposed is the perfect system. Of course it is not. Any system involving relations between employers and employees is bound to be imperfect and to remain imperfect because it is inherent in dealings with human relations that the problems which arise will constantly need fresh views and fresh answers. But it is important to remember that, against the criticism which has been made of the Government, the conciliation and arbitration system remains in place. It is suggested that the weak will have no answer. In a decision of 31 July 1981, the Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission will deal with applications as filed, members of the Commission will sit alone or on Full Benches and the various provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act will apply. </PARA>
<PARA>The conciliation and arbitration system remains in place as well as the system of State tribunals which, as it so happens, deals with a greater percentage of awards binding on the Australian work force than the Federal system. As well as that, features are built into our wage system which can only assist the weak. I refer specifically to the concept of comparative wage justice, of people in the same jobs getting the same pay and the flow on which we always experience from major wage settlements and major award decisions. Those will remain to help, so far as they need it, the weak. Of course the weak always do need help. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the specific proposals that have been put by the Government as foreshadowed legislation. I refer firstly to provisions allowing employers to stand down employees for whom they have no work as a result of industrial action . The fact is that technology has advanced so far that strikes or industrial action by a small number of people can effectively immobilise very large areas, communities and factories. One has only to throw one's mind back to what has taken place in Victoria with the power blackouts and the transport strikes in New South Wales. If, as a consequence of strike action, an employer has on his hands 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 people, perhaps 90 per cent or 95 per cent of his work force, for whom he has no work, what is he meant to do? Is he to keep on paying them? Is that the answer? Who is to pay? What is the justice in that? Is that the kind of industrial society the Australian Labor Party proposes. What are the economic effects for the future? What does this mean? It means that the objective of the Labor Party in that area is to ensure that the employer carries the cost of industrial action and has to pay people for standing around because he has no work for them. That is an Alice in Wonderland view of the way in which the economy should work. The honourable member for Cunningham said that is anathema to the trade union movement. It may be but it is common sense and it is just. The reverse proposition is simply a recipe for economic suicide. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the question of preference clauses. The honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles) objected heatedly to the proposal to get rid of preference clauses. Is it not fundamentally wrong that the right to work should be conditional on membership of a union? Is it not just as fundamentally wrong that the right to work should be conditional on race, religion or political views? Is it not a basic right that a man or woman should be able to compete in the industrial market place equally with all others for his or her livelihood?</PARA>

Is it not absolutely wrong that a person who objects to being a member of a union for a conscientious reason, because of objections to the leadership or political objectives of that union or for any other reason should be told that either he joins a union or does not work?

I am glad that that proposal will be put before this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the subject of enterprise unions, I merely refer to what the Minister said in his statement. Page 19 refers to the fact that this would facilitate the development of industry based unions. Undoubtedly enterprise unions would present some problems, particularly in smaller organisations. Maybe those problems could be overcome, as they have been in Japan. The move towards some more coherent and rational form of organisation is welcomed. In conclusion, it is a pity that the honourable member for Wills, with his wide experience, had nothing to offer on the details of the proposals that have been put forward. If he has a position on these matters he has skilfully avoided revealing his thoughts. Given his long experience in industrial relations, it is a pity for this House and for his country that he has done nothing but present to us a collection of empty and irrelevant generalisations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it fascinating that to date Government spokesmen expounding upon the merits or the demerits of the trade union movement have thrown into the list to support their somewhat notorious Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) two Queen's Counsel, one solicitor and a member of the National Country Party who solved his problems with industrial relations in an electorate which has one of the highest numbers of female unemployed in the Commonwealth by putting his wife on the payroll. That is the level of it. I will not sit here and be lectured on the problems of closed shops by members of a profession, which constitutes the most closed shop in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sorry that the learned Queen's Counsel who represents North Sydney is about to leave. It is all very well for him to say that he takes a certain view of the legal profession. But will he give the House an undertaking that the next time he is briefed he will say to the Bar Council: 'Because I do not believe in closed shops I insist that I will appear without a junior'? Will he say: 'I will take that well-known solicitor, a fellow member, and he can be my junior'? The honourable member knows as does the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs ( Mr N.A. Brown) that they operate on very high salaries and that they maintain one of the greatest closed shops of the professions. What we are talking about are not just wages and conditions. We are talking about real living standards. I should also say that amongst the distinguished lawyers who spoke on behalf of the Government the only one who has any background at all-I acknowledge it-in industrial affairs is the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs who is sitting at the table. He has been a consistent and, I must say, able advocate in the industrial courts, but always for the employers. </PARA>
<PARA> If one goes to the heart of this statement what it comes down to is simply this : This Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), who has been in office for longer than any Prime Minister since Robert Gordon Menzies-longer than Holt, Gorton, McMahon and Whitlam, and for most of that period has had control in both Houses- has been in a situation where, on behalf of all the gentlemen opposite, was going to solve the problems of inflation and provide full employment. On 16 February 1982 we have had the spectacle in this Parliament which I doubt has ever been seen in any parliament which espouses the Westminster tradition. The Westminster tradition is not the Speaker getting dressed up in nineteenth century robes and walking in through Kings Hall. It is members of the Government discharging their obligations to this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Has there ever been a prime minister in the Westminster system whose total fabric of economic policy was under attack in a censure motion in which it was pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden)-I will not repeat all the points-that inflation, which was going to be brought down, is now 11.2 per cent? The people who were going to provide full employment are now presiding over the highest level of unemployment in our history and interest rates are at an all time high. Confronted with that situation this Prime Minister sat mute and stony faced and relied upon his numbers in the Parliament to avoid any effective debate. Of course, later in the day he sent in the Minister who, as has already been pointed out, we have some difficulty in believing. I think only his mother believes him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not want to name him. It might be unparliamentary. I simply say that the Minister who is the author of this document walks into the Parliament and he has the answers. Despite the Government's record period in government and despite the fact that in the latter years of the Whitlam Government there was not a Minister who now sits opposite who did not say that control of the economy was the responsibility of the government of the day the position is different now. The then Opposition would not hear any arguments about inflation being caused by overseas pressures. We could not blame the employers or the trade unions. We had to accept responsibility as that was the Government's responsibility. Today we have heard a statement. When we go to the heart of it, what does it say? It says that all the economic problems in Australia can be put at the door step of the trade unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is another aspect about this debate which I think needs to be canvassed because I for one am concerned about a situation which is a permanent feature of the approach of this Government when it is dealing with the trade union movement . The Government continually speaks about unions as though it were speaking about a group of martians, a group of people who live and operate outside Australian society. When I hear the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) say that he wants to start at the level of a fair day's work for a fair day's pay-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many of them not getting a fair day's work when most of them want work. There is no attempt in this statement to meet what I believe is a genuinely felt need amongst the trade union movement, employers and most sections of our society to see a new approach to industrial relations and a lessening of industrial confrontation. This statement promises an increase in industrial confrontation because it is promising the trade union movement more pains and more penalties. I find it extraordinary. How is it that since I have been a member of this Parliament a single strike has never taken place anywhere which this Government has said had some merit. The only strike I have ever heard praised and the only section of the union movement I have ever heard praised is the strike in Poland and Solidarity. It is all right if a person is a Polish unionist. It is oppressive if one attempts to strike. There has never been a single occasion when this Minister, the Prime Minister or any member of the Government who sits opposite, has ever been prepared to stand up in this Parliament and say that there is some merit in the action of unionists and because of the merits in their claims they were forced to take industrial action .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been conceded by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) as it would be conceded by responsible trade union spokesmen throughout Australia that the history of unionism in Australia shows that there have been a number of strikes which have been without merit, but they are by far the minority. When we are talking about unionists-this is something that I think needs to be said-we are not talking about some alien enemy. We are talking about average Australian citizens who are trying to maintain their living standards. Let me say to members of the great party of private enterprise, that when they say that they believe in the private enterprise system, they believe in a competitive system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, every New Year's day and around the Queen's birthday I await my daily newspapers with great eagerness and excitement , only to find out, after I open the newspapers with great expectation, that our far-away monarch has omitted to include my name in the honours list. It is some consolation that, since the Order of Australia was introduced, one's chances are somewhat enhanced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year, if you are a Victorian and a migrant, you might be entitled to a consolation prize, as the Victorian Minister for Ethnic Affairs has introduced a special list of Australia Day honours. Although it is true that it is somewhat second-grade honour that our good Minister has introduced under the name of Victorian Voluntary Service Awards, and although this innovation came in an election year, it still may be considered as an attempt at belated recognition of those who are not usually found on our hospital or charity boards, thus forever forfeiting their chance for an O.B.E. or a damehood. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is not the award itself that I wanted to talk about tonight, but about the two recipients of Yugoslav origin that the Victorian Liberal Government found so meritorious. It just cannot be a coincidence that both gentlemen, if I might so call them, belong to fascist organisations. It is true that they belong to two different fascist organisations. Nevertheless, they are fascists all right. </PARA>
<PARA> One, Jozo Pavlovic, who was presented with the award by the Deputy Premier of Victoria, Mr Borthwick is, according to the Spremnost, a Croatian weekly, the secretary of H.O.P., the Croatian Liberation Movement for Australia and New Zealand. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PH4">Mr KENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a flippant point of order, but I will go ahead. We find from the same copy of Spremnost that Jozo Pavlovic was one of the speakers at the commemoration service to Ante Pavelic which was held in Gippsland, Victoria, last December, to pay tribute to the wartime Croatian Fuehrer. H.O.P., the Croatian Liberation Movement, was established in 1948 by Pavelic in Argentina. Pavelic was the most notorious war criminal in Yugoslavia, probably the second most brutal killer in Europe, after Adolf Hitler.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pavelic was installed by the nazis on 10 April 1941 as the Fuehrer of the Croat puppet state during the occupation of Yugoslavia. His government declared war on Hitler's enemies, including Australia. He was the leader of the Ustasha and responsible for the brutal murder of more than one million innocent men, women and children in wartime Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to bring up the past. I was one who suffered from nazi persecution and it is painful for me to talk about those times but I am, like other Australians of Yugoslav origin, incensed by the cynicism of the Victorian Liberal Government in honouring types such as Jozo Pavlovic, who are glorifying brutal murderers and advocating that further atrocities be committed against the Yugoslav people. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the other recipient, Borislav Petrovic, he is known in the Yugoslav ethnic community as the former president of the Ravna Gora movement, and a supporter of Chetnik Draza Mihailovic, a Serbian quisling. </PARA>
<PARA> The Yugoslav community in Victoria is understandably incensed by the action of the Thompson Government in choosing, amongst the 150,000 Victorians of Yugoslav origin to honour, even with an award of dubious value, two fascist scoundrels. Of course, such a choice will defeat the Liberal Government's cynical exercise in introducing these second-rate awards for vote-catching purposes. The Yugoslav community of Victoria, the third largest migrant group, is well aware of the Liberal Party's manifested connections with the Ustasha and other fascists. </PARA>
<PARA> A party that chooses to nurture, support and honour people who are preaching hatred and who glorify fascist leaders such as Pavelic and Mihailovic-who between them were responsible for the brutal face-to-face killing of well over a million people of wartime Yugoslavia-cannot expect any support from the Yugoslav community in Victoria. Indeed, their demise at the next State election will be welcomed by all Victorians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not believe that we in this House would ever forget that living in the Australian community today are several thousand survivors of one of the most monstrous crimes in history, the nazi holocaust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of these survivors is a constituent of mine, Mr Nicholas Melkman. Mr Melkman, who is of Dutch-Jewish origin, was imprisoned in concentration camps between 1942 and 1945. He was, for most of that period, a slave labourer. According to the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation-I have a copy of the documentation before me-Mr Melkman was arrested on 3 September 1942 in Amsterdam and was deported to Germany, where he had to work as a forced labourer in the camps of Niederkirch, Siebersdorf and Flossenburg. During the same period his wife and family were murdered by the Nazis. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Melkman came to Australia in 1951 and since 1970 he has received a Dutch Government pension-paid out of West German reparation payments to Holland. These payments, and the Dutch Government payments arising out of them, are designed to give some monetary compensation to the victims of Nazi crimes. In Mr Melkman's case, this compensation can only cover most inadequately years of torment, as well as the anguish of the loss of his family. I should also mention that Mr Melkman has told me that he has suffered from epilepsy, which he believes to be due to the ill-treatment he received in Flossenburg concentration camp. </PARA>
<PARA> However, because this sort of pension would be taxed in the Netherlands, and because of the provisions of a double taxation agreement between Australia and the Netherlands, since 1975 Mr Melkman has been taxed on his pension by the Commonwealth Government. Is it not understandable that Mr Melkman and others in his position feel that this particular piece of revenue raising shows a serious lack of generosity towards the victims of nazism? They are also distressed at the peculiar situation whereby pensions such as Mr Melkman's are taxed in Australia while pensions paid by the West German authorities to Australians are not. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Melkman's case, and cases of the same sort, have been taken up on several occasions. In replying to these representations, Treasury has said that to exempt such pensions as Mr Melkman's from taxation would be to make such payments stand out in contrast to Australian pensions which are not exempted from tax. It is also pointed out that the West German pensions that are exempted from taxation in Australia obtain such exemption because they are exempted from taxation in the Federal Republic of Germany itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise the force of these arguments and, in particular, the argument that to exempt the pensions of Mr Melkman and other such victims of nazism from taxation might create serious anomalies in the operation of the double taxation agreements between Australia and several other countries. However, the fact is that we are here confronted with a unique situation which is without clear precedent and one, we hope, that is not likely to give rise to any precedents. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Melkman and others-his estimate is that there are in Australia about 200 of them-are the survivors of something that is almost unique in the annals of the human race-the institutionalised insanity of an attempt at the genocide of the Jewish and other peoples. Surely those who have suffered in this most terrible of massacres are justified in their pleas that they should receive some special measure of our compassion. The number involved is not large, nor is it increasing. </PARA>
<PARA> It must continue to be an agonising question for our civilisation whether more could have been done to prevent the crimes of nazism. Let us not also have to agonise over whether more could have been done to help and compensate the victims of nazism. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that such recognition on our part will be to the detriment of our double taxation arrangements with other countries, for we will only be applying unique redress to unique injuries. It is wrong to talk of anomalies when we are faced with one of the most horrible anomalies in history and are trying to sort out in some small degree its aftermath. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the case of Mr Melkman, and those of others in his situation, to the attention of this House and this Government as deserving of their fullest compassion. I hope that before long some acceptable reply can be made to the victims of nazi persecution who have made their homes in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to address the House tonight and present a case for millions of Australians who are finding it increasingly difficult to keep their heads above the financial waters . Two weeks ago I listened with interest to the replies of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in a Sydney television interview to questions relating to the difficulties facing Australians on low and middle incomes. His response was essentially that Australia is still a lucky country. That is small comfort to 17 -year-olds on the dole trying to survive on $36 a week or to a family forced to sell its house because it cannot afford the interest rates. I believe the statements by the Treasurer pointedly reflect the general attitude of the Government. They clearly demonstrate how out of touch with the real world it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When so many of the Government members are near millionaires who own not only their main houses but also holiday houses and whose only financial troubles are how to maximise their investment returns and avoid tax, how could we expect them to understand what it is like for those people who move home every few months because rents keep rising or, as we know, who eat pet food because that is all they can afford? When the Treasurer talks about it still being a lucky country, he means it is a lucky country for himself, his friends and his associates because they are the ones who are enjoying the rising company profits, the capital gains and the tax loopholes. They are the ones who are enjoying the substantial shift in national wealth away from pensioners and beneficiaries and wage and salary earners. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate in the inner city of Sydney I am confronted time and again by the results of the Government's elitist policies. I see a community being gradually uprooted and scattered towards the outskirts of Sydney where housing is cheaper. I see families breaking down under the strain of the rising cost of living. Just last week an unemployed constituent, Mr Bert Ekholm, burned himself to death in his tiny flat rather than face eviction through his inability to keep up rent payments. Finally, last week pensioners decided that they had had enough of the Government's iniquitous policies and called a mass meeting in Sydney Town Hall and invited the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, to hear their complaints. More than a thousand of them told him in no uncertain terms that they were not happy with the $69 to $70 a week that they receive on a pension. They told him that this amount was not enough to live on with dignity. They told him that the income test was unreasonable and had fallen well behind rises in average weekly earnings. To all this the Minister replied that they were better off than they were 10 years ago, which was met by hisses and jeers from the pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government has been blatant in its disregard for the welfare of Australians on low incomes. Just look at who has borne the brunt of the razor gang cuts. With the cutbacks in staffing of government services, the selling of government properties such as the Glebe Estate and the proposed increases in indirect taxes, it is the lower income earners who are most affected. I believe a country can be judged by its treatment of its elderly. In Australia the Government's approach to people, once they cease to be economically useful, is to give them a pittance and to let them fend for themselves. I think this is scandalous. It is particularly scandalous when the Government refuses to increase pension rates but at the same time enables elderly millionaires to receive a full pension and entitlements by the use of tax avoidance schemes and property trusts. When will the Government begin to apply some justice? Many of my constituents are elderly and in receipt of age pensions. Those paying rents are now finding it impossible to compete for housing with the middle class professionals moving into the inner city. With little bed sitter accommodation available at a cost of less than $45 a week, they are forced to spend in excess of 65 per cent of their pension on accommodation, leaving very little for food and other necessities. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people fortunate enough to own their own homes are finding it increasingly difficult to keep them in repair. For many of them Techelp is the only agency able to help but it is unable to keep up with the demand because of its shoestring budget and no assistance from the Federal Government. Other domiciliary services such as home help and home nursing have likewise suffered funding cutbacks and are unable to satisfy completely the demand. If the elderly are not able to be supported in their homes, nursing home and hostel accommodation is all that is left. However, in this area, too, the Fraser Government has implemented cuts, leaving not enough beds to meet the needs. The grim picture I am painting is the reality that exists in Australia, and it is particularly visible in my electorate of Sydney. In my electorate a sharp contrast is developing between the haves and have nots. A wave of gentrification is occurring in many of the suburbs. Those houses not being renovated are obviously owned by the elderly or rented by a low-income family. Is this the type of divided society that we want Australia to have? If not, we should be moving quickly to reduce the wealth imbalance. </PARA>

The difficulties which are buried by the rhetoric which is facing many Australian families are difficulties which one would have hoped governments would be concerned about. We are all aware of the difficulties of employment. In fact, in my area it has been a problem for a long time and the government has now found a means by which that problem can be minimised. It has stopped publishing or collecting statistics and has refused to give that information even to the Geelong regional commission which is the planning authority and which, in seeking to cure or to minimise the problems of unemployment, is not able to use basic information which should be available and which is vital to any consideration by a planning authority or an expert body.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with a number of other matters. We are all being inundated with publicity about wage rises and about how if wages did not go up all the problems of the world economy would disappear. If I may say so, this is just plain rubbish spoken by people who refuse to face up to the facts or the problems. They are not in a position to deal with or to solve them. What is the effect of a continual reduction in the disposable income of a large number-the majority-of Australian families? Every person in the Australian community and every family which has an income of less than $13,000 a year is currently paying a higher proportion of income in taxes than was the case a year ago. This pious Government came into office on a promise not to tax by stealth but to be honest about tax and index the scales so that governments would have to increase them when they wished to raise revenue. Not now. This year the Government will accumulate large amounts of taxation revenue by forcing people into higher tax brackets when their incomes relative to the general cost of living have not increased.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Another area in which there are serious problems and which may be tinkered with is the area of home loan repayments. It affects not only those who are first home buyers but also many families in which four years ago husband and wife were working and their income levels were such that they could meet home loan repayments. Those income levels have been destroyed either because one partner has not been able to work because of family commitments or unemployment or because the major breadwinner's status in the community has disappeared because of lack of opportunities in the work force. Those people are in desperate trouble. The once proud boast of this country of the dream of home ownership has under this Government in the last 12 months become a nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I want to mention those least able to defend themselves in the community. While the large income earners walk away with tax avoidance, the Government is progressively reducing the relative level at which tax is applied so that this year a pensioner will have $6 above his pension in taxable income. Above that level, the Government will confiscate one-third of every dollar over $6 that a pensioner earns. That rate is higher than any other section of the community is asked to pay. The Government has really scraped the bottom of the barrel, and now we learn that it cannot even pay its bills. </PARA>

It is not my intention to be part of an Opposition in this Parliament if I can do anything about it. I am tired of hearing arguments to the effect that, because things are not as everybody would wish and because things are quite difficult around the world at the moment, it necessarily follows that by reversing existing policies one would do any better. It is absolutely not on to stand up in this Parliament every day and to suggest increases in government expenditure in every conceivable area, which is what the Opposition does. The Opposition says that expenditure by the Government in this area, this area and this area is insufficient, implying that government expenditure should be increased. At the same time the Opposition suggests that taxes are too high and should be reduced and that interest rates are too high and therefore--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the honourable member for Chifley that everybody in Australia would be in agreement on two things: One is that taxes are always too high. And the second is that interest rates are always too high. The honourable member and I would agree on this. The sums are as follows: If it is wished to increase government expenditures in each of the areas suggested by the Labor Party, one either increases taxes or expands the deficit. If taxes are increased , the results of that action are quite obvious. If the deficit is expanded, that has an upward pressure on interest rates. If interest rates are too high at the moment, under government by the Labor Party and with increased expenditure and a higher deficit, interest rates would increase.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. That is kindergarten economics as the honourable member for Corio said, and the example is correct. If the Opposition wishes to increase government expenditure-Opposition members are suggesting increases in every area of expenditure even including defence, which is the area that the honourable member for Corio worries about in this Parliament-it must increase taxes, deficits and interest rates. Tax avoidance is the other matter raised by the honourable member for Corio. One treasurer has done more in terms of trying to reduce tax avoidance than any other treasurer in the history of Australia. That treasurer is not one of the many put forward by the Labor Party when it was in office. I cannot recall quite how many Treasurers it had-I think it was at least three. Not one of them introduced a single tax avoidance measure in this Parliament. Since the present treasurer has been in office, extraordinary tax avoidance Bills have been brought in which have been designed to reduce the incidence of tax avoidance. I do not know of any way one could totally eliminate this practice. But there has been only one treasurer I can recall who has done anywhere near as much as has been done by the present treasurer. Not one of the three Labor Government Treasurers did a single thing. When the present Government came into office what tax avoidance measures were on the book for it to use?</PARA></TALK.START>

When we talk about tax being high, people avoiding tax and interest rates being high, let us understand that the Labor Party wishes to increase Government expenditure in almost every area that will result in higher taxation and higher interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's policies are bleeding the pensioners of this country white, as I have indicated by practical examples on a number of occasions in this House. Tonight I wish to describe the financial circumstances of one of my constituents, Mr Robert Luff, who, as a result of spinal injuries, was forced to retire at the early age of 50 years with a weekly workers compensation payment for himself and his wife. He also receives a war veterans pension representing 40 per cent of the service pension. Whenever possible I will use extracts from Mr Luff's letter to me as I cannot improve on his graphic description of his position, a position which is being experienced by thousands of pensioners all over Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Luff refers to a $11.35 a week workers compensation cost of living rise as paid from 1 September 1981. He points out that he suffers a 50c in the dollar deduction in his veterans pension. While his cost of living rises, he is taxed at 32c in the dollar leaving only a balance of $1.98 out of the original $11 cost of living adjustment. In effect Mr Luff has suffered a tax rate of 82c in the dollar on his $11 cost of living adjustment. Mr Luff stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At this point, it would be right to assume that most Australians expect to be taxed by some means or other, and don't mind contributing to the running of this country, it is a personal contribution, although it is demanded of him, he pays up . . . When you look at the over all complexities of the Taxation scheme one is utterly confused and bewildered at the systems and above all the percentage of tax demanded of the man in the street, it sounds so small just a mere 32 percent, for the sake of the argument one could say a third of a wage is taken in tax. Where the basic wage is paid in some cases $203 approx $63 is taken as tax leaving a balance take home of $140. In the case of a married man he could take home $160, pay $75 home loan, run a small car, bring up 2 children, have a few of the necessities of life that the Western world offers us . . . Is that living??? No way . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> It is stated that the Australian form of Taxation is the second highest in the world . . . You know looking at those rates of taxation, you get absolutely NOTHING . . . no medical relief, no future pension schemes, or hospital benefits just a plain 32 per cent take. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is not concerned how frustrated I am, whether I am in debt, I have ceased to progress, suffer pain and immobilisation, and be further aggravated by ILL CONCEIVED plans of taxation and other means of well engineered rip offs by Government Departments . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There are thousands like me so effected, having recovered a bit I take up the challenge and appeal to those in command to hear the appeal especially from those who are too aged, too ill and dissillusioned to appreciate just what is happening to them . . . A certain respect seems to have been lost for these people, especially the Ex Servicemen who's services both Australian and Overseas were once readily accepted in the time of war, and now so readily forgotten . . . his valiant effort faded so conveniently into oblivion . . . just another story how we are taken for granted, the old and sick, their effort, deeds, and contributions all swept under the carpet . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Back to DEMANDS . . . At 65 there is another crunch . . . I am 63 been retired over 13 years with spinal injuries, having survived several operations, I rank among the more fortunate as I am mobile . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I ask where are these 'Golden Years of Retirement' for those who want to grow old gracefully and financial . . . Let them do it . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There are repercussions all along the line, I and those whom I represent hope for a better deal . . . There is no need for banners and protests . . . all we need is a fair hearing, I don't think that is too much to ask for . . . </PARA>
<PARA>During the meeting of the Estimates Committee D on 16 September I referred the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to the real hardship suffered by the hundreds of people in my electorate as a result of the low threshold levels for taxation and the low threshold levels for fringe benefits. In effect, the Treasurer's reply was that if the Government had the capacity the raising of such levels would be considered. It is appalling that in Mr Luff's compensation payments of $143.85 per week he should only receive, in effect, $1.98 of his $11 cost of living adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote once again from Mr Luff's letter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There are thousands of people in this situation, forced into early retirement due to accident or ill health, it is sudden, one minute you are working, formulating your families destiny, then crash, your out, in most cases no planning, like normal retirement, it is then that your troubles really begin . . . most can't cope with the complexities that arise, some are more handicapped than others, then comes the Migrant he is so confused, he is soon lost in the confusion of it all . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer must know that the Government has the capacity to redress the appalling financial situation of many thousands of Australian pensioners and should immediately lift the threshold levels for taxation payments, fringe benefits and full pensions. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Section 18 of the Health Insurance Act provides that Commonwealth Medical Benefits may not be payable, wholly or in part, in respect of professional medical services related to injuries or diseases which attract compensation or damages. Hence sports men or women, whether paid for their sporting activities or not, may be refused payment of part or the whole of Commonwealth Medical Benefits in regard to treatment of compensable sporting injuries.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My understanding is that all States and Territories have legislated to exclude professional sports persons from workers' compensation cover. In the case of Victoria, legislation was enacted in 1978 to exclude persons engaged in sporting activities from coverage under the Workers' Compensation Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Commonwealth benefits may be precluded under this section of the Act where a person has received, or established his right to receive a payment by way of compensation or damages. This in effect means that where a person has an entitlement to claim compensation or damages, it is expected that the claim should be pursued fully. However, departmental practice in this area has regard to the considerable period of time that may elapse between the date of the action giving rise to a claim and the date of completion of any subsequent litigation. To avoid any unnecessary hardship, provisional payments of Commonwealth benefits are usually made in respect of treatment expenses incurred during this period, providing the patient gives an undertaking that all such benefits will be repaid upon completion of any claim for damages. My Department is currently formulating guidelines to be used in assessing Commonwealth benefit claims in compensation cases. Although the Department has received legal opinions, it is considered inappropriate to publish such opinions furnished by the Government's legal advisers. My Department is willing to explain to persons affected by the operation of section 18 the reasons behind the Department's decision in such cases, but the basic reason is to avoid the Commonwealth or insurers with registered medical benefits funds having to meet medical expenses for which third parties have a legal liability.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As indicated in (1) and (3) above, if people are eligible to receive payment by way of compensation or damages under the Workers' Compensation Act of a State or Territory (or other eligibility) in respect of professional medical services related to an injury or disease, Commonwealth Medical Benefits may not be payable under section 18 of the Health Insurance Act. In other circumstances, provided the person has eligibility for Commonwealth Medical Benefits and/or fund benefit through being in possession of a Pensioner Health Benefits card or Health Care card or being enrolled in a registered health fund, medical benefits will be payable for services, provided they fall within the ambit of the Medical Benefits Schedule.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Have total appropriations for the Family Planning Program grown from my initial grant as Minister for Health of $750 000 to $837 962 in 1980-81 including approved carry over of $57 962 unexpended from 1979-80.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What were the increases or decreases in real terms during the lifetime of each government concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Are clinical services under the program funded (a) on a no growth in health services policy so that clinics and services cannot be expanded and (b) on a deficit basis so that self-help fund raising has negative effects except to reduce government contributions.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Do clinic attendances reflect this policy despite growing demands.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Do health services in Western Australia perform sterilising operations and use Depo-Provera injections for illiterate patients without ensuring that patients (a) are aware of the risks and implications and (b) have full opportunity to be trained in the use of alternatives by adequate employment of persons of their own language and culture.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Has his Department monitored the performance of subsidised family planning in providing adequate access for Aborigines to the services as required by my original conditions of approval of the program.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Does Australia subscribe to World Health Organisation and United Nations principles which provide that all parents should have the right to choose the number and spacing of their children.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Is he able to state whether evidence anywhere in the world suggested that a dearth of family planning information increases rates of (a) abortions, (b) unwanted birth, (c) child abuse or (d) problems of health, family and social adjustment, education and employment, at greater cost to society than the alternative of more adequate family planning.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Family Planning Program appropriations since 1972-73 were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>$ '000  1972-73  75  1973-74  350  1974-75  1,125  1975-76  1,225  1976-77 750 1977-78  750  1978-79  750  1979-80  750  1980-81  780</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member refers to an approved carry over of $57 962 unexpended from 1979-80 allocations. Included in this amount was a sum of $36 432 which was , in fact, a carry over relating to revised accounting procedures, in the case of one Family Planning Association, for Health Program Grant payments and payments from the Family Planning Program.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Two statistical series have been used to 'deflate' the annual appropriations for the Family Planning Program from 1972-73 to 1980-81 using the 'Average Weekly Earnings' and 'Gross Fixed Capital Expenditure-Public' as a basis for the calculations. Accordingly, the pattern of appropriations for the Family Planning Program is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Current 1974-75  prices prices  $ $  '000 '000  1972-73  75 106  1973-74  350 433  1974-75  1,125 1,125  1975-76  1,225 1,066  1976-77  750 583  1977-78 750 531  1978-79  750 493  1979-80  750 449  1980-81  780 *(421)</PARA>
<PARA>*This estimate assumes a 10 per cent increase in Average Weekly Earnings over 1979-80.</PARA>
<PARA> Any appreciation of the Family Planning Program, however, must recognise that by far the major element of patient education in this area is through the ongoing activities of medical practitioners, particularly general practitioners, throughout Australia, and in the course of the clinical programs of the Family Planning Associations which, as indicated in respect of question (3), have been funded separately through Health Program Grants.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) and (b) Clinical services are funded under Health Program Grants. These grants have been subject to a no growth policy since 1976. However, some minor expansion in clinical activity has been approved and funded where special justification has been demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA> The basic approach to the funding of clinical activities of Family Planning Associations under the Health Program Grant arrangements is one of deficit funding; income generated by the Associations' clinical activities (sale of contraceptives, health insurance payments, etc.) is deducted from the amount of grant payable. However, the Health Program Grants for associations have provided a considerably higher level of funding than would be received from bulk billing for eligible patients under the Health Insurance Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Although Health Program Grants arrangements are operating under a 'limited funding' policy, trends in all States imply an increasing number of clinical attendances. For example, in the honourable member's own State of Queensland the details are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Year No. of attendances  1975-76  17,877  1976-77  27,812  1977-78  36,621 1978 -79  43,530  1979-80  48,292</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) and (b) No. The State health services in Western Australia advise that they do not perform sterilising operations without full counselling of the concerned parties by such persons as hospital staff, community health workers, Aboriginal health workers, and health workers from other ethnic groups. The operations are then only proceeded with if they are both warranted and wanted.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Depo-Provera injections, this drug is still considered to be investigational, and is not generally available as a contraceptive. Where it is used in individual cases, there is a responsibility on the part of the doctor to adequately inform the patient or the guardian, of any possible adverse consequences of the therapy. Aboriginal and migrant women, like any other Australian women, should have access to Depo-Provera where its use is considered to be in the best interest of the individual patient.</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal health workers and health workers from other ethnic groups are trained and employed by the Western Australian Public Health Department to assist in the delivery of health care to their own people, including the interpretation of language and culture in the sets of circumstances referred to.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Since the introduction of Health Program Grants for Aboriginal Medical Services (AMS), family planning for Aboriginals has been integrated with the health services provided by AMS. Consequently, there has been no specific monitoring of the family planning services provided by AMS. Family Planning Associations co-operate wherever possible in training resource personnel working with Aboriginals, and the education and information programs the Associations conduct are available to the general community.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) (a), (b), (c) and (d) There is evidence that a comprehensive family planning education program can be an important factor in reducing the number of unwanted births and abortions. Other social factors, such as education and social status of women, are also involved, It is reasonable to assume that a decline in the birth rate represents a decline primarily in unwanted and unplanned births. There is evidence that 'unwantedness' is one factor in the aetiology of child abuse. There have been several studies in Australia and overseas which have shown that there are cost-benefits, through family planning programs, in medical and social health terms.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) In Australia, most family planning advice is provided by general practitioners in the course of day-to-day consultations. However, the Family Planning Program seeks to improve the level of community awareness and the quality of family planning advice generally, including that given by Family Planning Associations, private medical practitioners, and natural family planning organisations. Through the Family Planning Program, the overall policy of the Government is to provide better methods of dissemination of family planning information to both men and women.</PARA>
<PARA> This has been demonstrated by the fact that, notwithstanding the government's economic strategy of continuing financial restraint, it was possible to increase the amount provided under both the Family Planning Program and Health Program Grant arrangements to enable, broadly, the continuation of existing levels of activities during 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) See (3).</PARA>
<PARA> (11) I assume that the honourable member is referring to subsidised and government family planning services.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) State and Territory Family Planning Associations conduct internal peer reviews of their clinical staff and evaluation of their training programs. In 1975-76, a comprehensive review of the teaching and practice of natural family planning methods was funded under the Family Planning Program. In 1979-80, a survey of characteristics of clients attending Family Planning Association clinics and the Adolescent Counselling, Treatment and Information (ACTION) Centre, Melbourne, was carried out by the Australian Federation of Family Planning Associations, with funding from the Family Planning Program.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Commonwealth Government has no direct responsibility for providing family planning services.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) Smear tests, i.e. the cytological examination of smears for evidence of pathological change, are referred by Family Planning Associations to government or private laboratories equipped to perform this specialised work. Most of such referrals would be to the various State Government cytology laboratories which are established for this purpose. In the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory, cytology laboratory services are provided by the Capital Territory Health Commission and the Northern Territory Health Department, respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, pregnancy tests are available from State, Commonwealth and private pathology laboratories: urine specimens would generally be referred to such laboratories for initial or confirmatory testing.</PARA>
<PARA> Supplies and counselling services are not provided at Commonwealth laboratories .</PARA>
<PARA> No direct cost comparisons are available. However, for privately insured patients, Family Planning Associations charge the Schedule fee for these services. Costs for patients such as pensioners and their dependants, and people in special need, are met under the Health Program Grant.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department is concerned that these costs are more than if the Family Planning Associations bulk-billed the Department. This matter is currently under review.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) In 1979-80 and 1980-81, a Family Planning Program grant of $10,000 and $20 ,000 respectively, was allocated to Action for Family Planning, a Melbourne- based organisation which provides family planning information and education services specifically to migrant women at their places of work. The provision of education and information services by Family Planning Associations, at the work place, varies from State to State.</PARA>
<PARA> (14) The provision of hospital services is the responsibility of State and Territory Governments and arrangements vary. However, I understand that the major public hospitals provide outpatient family planning clinics, mainly for patients confined in those hospitals. In some hospitals, clinics are run by Family Planning Association staff, as required, while in others, family planning is integrated into general medical and gynaecology outpatient services where these exist.</PARA>
<PARA> (15) (a)Yes. However, the range of services provided at the hospital concerned is primarily a matter for the Queensland Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The needs of the Queensland Family Planning Association will be considered carefully, together with other requests for financial assistance under the Family Planning Program made by other organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (16) The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has, since 1975, endorsed a policy of recognition and support for Family Planning Associations. The College's Family Medicine Program, funded by the Commonwealth under the Community Health Program, has worked closely with Family Planning Associations in each State and Territory in conducting training courses in family planning for general practitioners and medical undergraduates.</PARA>
<PARA> University postgraduate medical education programs include segments on family planning, in co-ordination with family planning and specialist organisations. Restrictions on the level of support for training programs funded under the Family Planning Program must be seen in the context of the general constraint on Commonwealth Government expenditures.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The first unconfirmed report of the suspected vesicular disease in New Zealand was received by officers of my Department at 10.30 am on 12 February 1981 Australian Eastern Time (AET).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Quarantine Division of my Department placed a telephone call to New Zealand authorities at 10.40 am (AET) to seek confirmation of the report. Telephone contact with Wellington was established at 11.13 am (AET) when the presence of the suspected vesicular disease was confirmed by the New Zealand authorities. Quarantine arrangements which Australia would implement forthwith were conveyed to the New Zealand authorities during the course of the telephone conversation. In summary, these arrangements covered measures to ensure that animals and animal products of concern would not enter Australia from New Zealand; upgrading of quarantine screening arrangements for passengers and baggage to levels equivalent to those in routine operation for passengers and baggage from FMD risk countries; quarantine of any New Zealand consignments received of animals or animal products pending identification and source of the infection in New Zealand. New Zealand authorities undertook not to certify animals (except cats and dogs) or animal products of concern for export to Australia until further notice.</PARA>
<PARA> At the conclusion of the telephone call at 11.30 am (AET), Chief Quarantine Officers (Animals) in all States and the Northern Territory were advised immediately by telephone with confirmation by telex. Telex advice was also sent to the Commonwealth Directors of Health in each State (Chief Quarantine Officers (General));the Department of Transport, The Bureau of Customs and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Close liaison was maintained throughout with the Bureau of Animal Health.</PARA>
<PARA> All necessary quarantine precautionary measures were in place by 12.30 pm (AET) , that is, one hour after completion of the confirmatory call with New Zealand authorities. At Kingsford-Smith Airport, Sydney, these measures were in place at approximately 11.50 am (AET) (that is, approximately 20 minutes after confirmatory call).</PARA>
<PARA> It was essential for the initial media reports of the suspected disease outbreak to be confirmed with New Zealand authorities before Australian quarantine measures, with their substantial implications for both countries, were implemented. In previous months simulated foot and mouth disease exercises in both Australia and New Zealand had been incorrectly reported by sections of the media as actual outbreaks.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Advice of the suspected outbreak was first made public in New Zealand at 0930 New Zealand time on 12 February by way of a statement by the New Zealand Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. The Australian High Commission in New Zealand advises that, after obtaining a copy of the press release, officers in the High Commission contacted the Department of Trade and Resources, the Bureau of Animal Health and the Department of Health on 12 and 13 February to confirm that the relevant authorities in Australia were aware of the suspected outbreak, to inquire about what steps were being taken by the Australian authorities and to seek press guidance. The steps being taken by Australia were confirmed by cable despatched to the High Commission by the Department of Health on 13 February.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The High Commission in New Zealand has advised that it has no record of any contact with the honourable member on this matter, nor can any officer recollect such contact. The High Commission's information section, after telephone contact with Canberra, informed all callers that there had been a temporary halt to all imports of meat and meat products from New Zealand into Australia and that this would last until such time as the matter had been resolved.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Present quarantine screening procedures for postal articles are based on the declarations of senders; on the experience and intuition of screening officers and on other information which becomes available from time to time. Bearing in mind the large volumes of postal articles involved and other measures in operation, these arrangements are regarded as a cost-effective method of quarantine screening for these items. All practical measures are taken to screen out illegal and dangerous imports.</PARA>
<PARA> Following receipt of the Report referred to, screening procedures were reviewed . Whilst it would have been difficult and costly to fully implement the recommendation, action was nonetheless taken to amend the relevant legislation to increase penalties. Further, a major public awareness campaign was developed. It was felt that action envisaged in the Report would not necessarily lead to improved quarantine security particularly in view of the large volume of unsolicited material reaching Australia and the large numbers of recipients of postal articles.</PARA>
<PARA> In practical terms it is considered that the most effective way in which quarantine screening arrangements can be enhanced is by the development of a well informed responsible and co-operative Australian public. The current quarantine publicity campaign has this as its major objective.</PARA>
<PARA> This campaign and the increasing penalties for quarantine infringements introduced in 1979 are positive elements of the total approach to this and other problems of quarantine security. Information received from recipients of unsolicited articles of possible quarantine concern from overseas consignors is used as a basis for ongoing review of the intelligence base available for screening officers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The National Acoustic Laboratories' (NAL) role in the identification of significantly hearing impaired infants is to provide testing and other evaluations, including ear nose and throat Specialist examination, of referred children suspected of being hearing impaired. Referral is accepted from any source which has reason to suspect a hearing impairment in the infant. This includes parents, medical practitioners and the State health authorities. NAL encourages early identification and referral, and provides statistical coverage of achievement. Further, NAL has devised and/or developed for local use, most of the test techniques in use in evaluating infants in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The estimated average waiting time for individual pensioner clients at the end of September 1981 was 6 months.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Average number of visits per pensioner fitted including new and replacement fittings, during the year ended 30 June 1981, for testing, fitting, follow-up, and orientation, rehabilitation and aftercare was 3.25.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The cost of each NAL aid dispensed is $219.58. This is the latest available figure as determined by a cost survey over the period July to December 1979 the results of which are shown below. All costs relative to the manufacture, issue and repair of aids were included in the survey as well as those costs specified by the honourable member, namely, all salaries and related costs including superannuation, payment of clinical and related development personnel and the provision and maintenance of clinical and support facilities.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) The most recent figures on hearing aid use by adults in Australia appear in the Australian Bureau of Statistics 1978 Survey entitled 'Hearing and the use of hearing aids (persons aged 15 or more).' This survey showed aid use rates as at September 1978.</PARA>
<PARA> A use rate of more than four hours per day by elderly clients is regarded as a very successful fitting, one of less than once a week as unsuccessful. The following figures, quoted as percentages of total persons with aids, show NAL distribution use rates.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The absence of statistics of the values used by primary producers in the valuation of natural increase in their livestock and information on the true value of natural increase makes it impossible to provide a reliable estimate of the cost involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The cost of the 20 per cent prime cost depreciation allowance provided under section 57AH of the Income Tax Assessment Act was estimated at $20m in the first full year. It should be mentioned that the estimated revenue forgone took account of the change in the method of allowing depreciation whereby a full years' deduction at 20 per cent replaced the deduction that otherwise would have been allowed pro rata from the date of purchase of the asset. The allowance of accelerated depreciation does not confer greater deductions over the life of the asset than would otherwise have been allowed. There is, however, a cost in the sense that the concession confers on the taxpayer the equivalent of an interest- free loan resulting from the postponement of payment of income tax that, in the absence of the concession, would be payable at an earlier time. Estimates on this basis are not available.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The amounts of income deferred under section 26B, sub-sections 36 (3) to 36 (7) and section 36AA of the Income Tax Assessment Act are not tabulated and it is thus not possible to provide estimates of the revenue forgone through the operation of these sections.</PARA>

<PARA> (c) Section 36AA first applied to assessments in respect of income of the year of income ended 30 June 1961.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) Before the introduction of section 26B it had been found in many instances that, where the whole amount of an insurance recovery was assessable in the year of receipt, the amount absorbed by taxation could mean that an insufficient sum remained to finance the restocking of the property.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Information on which to make reliable estimates of the effect on income tax revenue of the averaging provisions has only become available since the provisions took the form of a rebate in 1979-80 and 1980-81 was estimated at $ 180m and $215m respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is no benefit to be gained by a taxpayer opting out of averaging because, since the introduction of the rebate system, averaging can only operate to benefit the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) From 1921 to 1937, income averaging applied to all taxpayers except companies. For the income year 1937-38 and all subsequent years, the general averaging provisions have applied only to individual primary producers.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Primary production income is subject to a relatively high degree of fluctuation from year to year, largely because of sharp swings in seasonal and world market conditions. Fluctuating incomes, combined with progressive rates of tax, would normally result in excessive tax burdens in high income years which would not be off-set in times of low income. The averaging system is designed to ensure that, over a span of years, a primary producer does not pay any more tax than other taxpayers with the same average income.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Information is not available to enable estimates to be made of the cost to revenue of the Income Equalization Deposits Scheme for all years from the date of its introduction.

These figures reflect only the immediate impact of the scheme on income tax revenue. As the deposits will bear tax on withdrawal the main effect of making them is to provide a postponement of payment of income tax. The amount of tax deferred, the effect of the deposits and withdrawals on the application of the averaging system and tax payable on the interest yielded by deposits are all matters that affect the cost of the scheme.

<PARA> (1) The cost of providing the rebate for moneys paid on shares for the purpose of petroleum exploration under section 160ACA of the Income Tax Assessment Act is not known. However, it is estimated that the revenue forgone in 1980-81 when the rate of the rebate was 30 per cent amounted to $28 million. This estimate related only to the immediate impact of the rebate on income tax revenue. However, the rebate is conditional on the company concerned forgoing deductions at the appropriate rate of tax in respect of the relevant expenditures, thus reducing the cost of the concession. An estimate that has regard to such factors is not available.</PARA>

The deductions allowable under this section are less than would normally have been allowed over the life of the asset, having regard to the fact that the taxpayer would forgo any investment allowance.

<PARA> (3) Under the income tax law in force from 1915 until 1923 all companies were allowed a deduction for the amount of profits distributed as dividends to shareholders. In other words, companies were taxed only on the profits which they retained. In 1923, this deduction was discontinued and companies were taxed on the whole of the profits earned, irrespective of the amount distributed to shareholders. It was, however, accepted that this basis of taxation placed a heavy burden upon the many small co-operative societies and a return to the earlier basis was adopted for these bodies.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The revenue forgone in the years from 1975-76 to 1980-81 as a result of the deduction allowed under section 73A of the Income Tax Assessment Act for expenditure on scientific research were estimated as follows:</PARA>

<PARA> These amounts are not a measure of the total cost borne by the revenue in respect of expenditure on scientific research, since scientific research expenditure is in some cases not readily distinguishable from other business expenditures which are allowed as losses or outgoings necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income . The figures relate to the deduction of capital expenditure allowable under section 73A but not the ordinary provisions of the income tax law. Revenue was also forgone to the extent that certain deductions for the cost of plant were allowed over shorter periods of time than would have been the case if the plant had been subject to depreciation allowance at normal rates.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. I understand that there are about four different types of electronic cardiac pacemakers used in Australia which range in price from around $1,500 to $2,500 each. I also understand that the most common type of replacement hip prosthesis costs about $200.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. Under the new health funding arrangements which were introduced on 1 July 1981 in all States other than South Australia and Tasmania, the Commonwealth provides an identifiable health grant within general revenue grants to the States in lieu of specific funding for public hospitals, the Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme. The grants are calculated at the same level as the funding provided in 1980-81 plus 10 per cent less a share of the revenue that the States can reasonably be expected to raise by the application of appropriate inpatient and outpatient charges from 1 September 1981. To the extent that electronic cardiac pacemakers and replacement hip prostheses were provided by public hospitals under the cost sharing arrangements they are included in the base figure for the allocation of Commonwealth funds to the States under the new arrangements. For South Australia and Tasmania hospital cost sharing arrangements continue and Commonwealth payments include components for these services as provided by those States. The Government therefore continues to contribute towards the cost of these services for all States and the Northern Territory. All States will, under the new arrangements, be required to provide pensioners having Pensioner Health Benefit (PHB) entitlements and persons in special need (as defined) and the dependants of those people with public hospital services without charge. These would include surgically implanted prostheses.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Specific benefits for cardiac pacemakers and hip prostheses are not provided from basic tables of insurance benefits. They may be provided from ancillary tables. The nature and extent of benefits provided from ancillary tables and, up to a point, the terms and conditions relating to such tables are usually determined by the organizations themselves. Most funds provide some level of ancillary benefits towards the cost of these items. In some cases such benefits are limited to surgery carried out in private hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The information available to my Department on the proposed supply of medical and surgical aids and appliances generally under the new health arrangements from 1 September 1981, is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria-In Victoria all registered inpatients of public hospitals will receive without charge all internal splints and prostheses; artificial, mechanical and electrical devices placed internally.</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland-Charges raised for prostheses in respect of private and intermediate patients.</PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania-Charges are not raised for surgical aids and appliances provided to inpatients and registered outpatients of recognised hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Electronic cardiac pacemakers and replacement hip protheses are not available under the Program of Aids for Disabled People.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr Moore</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I understand that the main object of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1980 was to implement the directive of the European Economic Community known as the Second Directive on Company Law Harmonization. (Second Council Directive 77/91 of December 13, 1976 on Co-ordination of Safeguards which, for the Protection of the Interests of Members and Others are Required by Member States of Companies within the Meaning of the Second Paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, in Respect of the Formation of Public Limited Liability Companies and the Maintenance and Alteration of their Capital, with a View to Making such Safeguards Equivalent.)</PARA>
<PARA> This Second Directive and the U.K. Companies Act 1980 contain provisions which I expect will be considered in due course by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities in its on-going assessment of proposed amendments to the initial legislation under the co-operative companies and securities scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that the first series of substantive amendments to the co- operative scheme legislation will be included in the proposed Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1983. Current planning within the Ministerial Council is that a draft of this Bill will be exposed for public comment for about three months during the second half of 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As requested by the honourable member, the text of the articles he has referred to is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Second Council Directive 77/91 of December 13, 1976 On Co-ordination of Safeguards which, for the Protection of the Interests of Members and Others are Required by Member States of Companies within the Meaning of the Second Paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, in Respect of the Formation of Public Limited Liability Companies and the Maintenance and Alteration of their Capital, with a View to Making such Safeguards Equivalent.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 6 (Minimum Capital) 1. The laws of the Member States shall require that, in order that a company may be incorporated or obtain authorisation to commence business, a minimum capital shall be subscribed the amount of which shall be not less than 25,000 European units of account.</PARA>
<PARA> The European unit of account shall be that defined by Commission Decision 3289/ 75. The equivalent in national currency shall be calculated initially at the rate applicable on the date of adoption of this Directive.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. If the equivalent of the European unit of account in national currency is altered so that the value of the minimum capital in national currency remains less than 22,500 European units of account for a period of one year, the Commission shall inform the Member State concerned that it must amend its legislation to comply with paragraph (1) within 12 months following the expiry of that period. However, the Member State may provide that the amended legislation shall not apply to companies already in existence until 18 months after its entry into force.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Every five years the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall examine and, if need be, revise the amounts expressed in this article in European units of account in the light of economic and monetary trends in the Community and of the tendency towards allowing only large and medium-sized undertakings to opt for the types of company listed in Article 1.</PARA>
<PARA>General Note Article 6 requires a major amendment of British company law which at present does not prescribe a minimum subscribed capital for any type of company.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 7 (Non-cash Consideration) The subscribed capital may be formed only of assets capable of economic assessment. However, an undertaking to perform work or supply services may not form part of these assets.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 10 (Non-cash Consideration-Valuing Assets) 1. A report on any consideration other than in cash shall be drawn up before the company is incorporated or is authorised to commence business, by one or more independent experts appointed or approved by an administrative or judicial authority. Such experts may be natural persons as well as legal persons and companies or firms under the laws of each Member State.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The experts' report shall contain at least a description of each of the assets comprising the consideration as well as of the methods of valuation used and shall state whether the values arrived at by the application of these methods correspond at least to the number and nominal value or, where there is no nominal value, to the accountable par and, where appropriate, to the premium on the shares to be issued for them.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The experts' report shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Member States may decide not to apply this article where 90 per cent of the nominal value, or where there is no nominal value, of the accountable par, of all the shares is issued to one or more companies for a consideration other than in cash, and where the following requirements are met:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) with regard to the company in receipt of such consideration, the persons referred to in Article 3 (i) have agreed to dispense with the experts' report;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) such agreement has been published as provided for in paragraph (3);</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the companies furnishing such consideration have reserves which may not be distributed under the law or the statutes and which are at least equal to the nominal value or, where there is no nominal value, the accountable par of the shares issued for consideration other than in cash;</PARA>
<PARA>Article 11 (Promoters) 1. If, before the expiry of a time limit laid down by national law of at least two years from the time the company is incorporated or is authorised to commence business, the company acquires any asset belonging to a person or company or firm referred to in Article 3 (i) for a consideration of not less than one-tenth of the subscribed capital, the acquisition shall be examined and details of it published in the manner provided for in Article 10 and it shall be submitted for the approval of the general meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> Member States may also require these provisions to be applied when the assets belong to a shareholder or to any other person.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Paragraph (1) shall not apply to acquisitions effected in the normal course of the company's business, to acquisitions effected at the instance or under the supervision of an administrative or judicial authority, or to stock exchange acquisitions.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 15 (Payment of Dividends) 1. (a) Except for cases of reductions of subscribed capital, no distribution to shareholders may be made when on the closing date of the last financial year the net assets as set out in the company 's annual accounts are, or following such a distribution would become, lower than the amount of the subscribed capital plus those reserves which may not be distributed under the law or the statutes.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Where the uncalled part of the subscribed capital is not included in the assets shown in the balance sheet, this amount shall be deducted from the amount of subscribed capital referred to in paragraph (a).</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The amount of a distribution to shareholders may not exceed the amount of the profits at the end of the last financial year plus any profits brought forward and sums drawn from reserves available for this purpose, less any losses brought forward and sums placed to reserve in accordance with the law or the statutes.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The expression ''distribution'' used in sub-paragraphs (a) and (c) includes in particular the payment of dividends and of interest relating to shares.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. When the laws of a Member State allow the payment of interim dividends, the following conditions at least shall apply:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) interim accounts shall be drawn up showing that the funds available for distribution are sufficient,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the amount to be distributed may not exceed the total profits made since the end of the last financial year for which the annual accounts have been drawn up, plus any profits brought forward and sums drawn from reserves available for this purpose, less losses brought forward and sums to be placed to reserve pursuant to the requirements of the law or the statutes.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not affect the provisions of the Member States as regards increases in subscribed capital by capitalisation of reserves.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The laws of a Member State may provide for derogations from paragraph (1) (a ) in the case of investment companies with fixed capital.</PARA>
<PARA> The expression 'investment company with fixed capital,' within the meaning of this paragraph means only those companies:</PARA>
<PARA> the exclusive object of which is to invest their funds in various stocks and shares, land or other assets with the sole aim of spreading investment risks and giving their shareholders the benefit of the results of the management of their assets, and</PARA>
<PARA> which offer their own shares for subscription by the public.</PARA>
<PARA> In so far as the laws of Member States make use of this option they shall:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) require such companies to include the expression 'investment company' in all documents indicated in Article 4 of Directive 68/151;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) not permit any such company whose net assets fall below the amount specified in paragraph (1) (a) to make a distribution to shareholders when on the closing date of the last financial year company's total assets as set out in the annual accounts are, or following such distribution would become, less than one-and-a-half times the amount of the company's total liabilities to creditors as set out in the annual accounts;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) require any such company which makes a distribution when its net assets fall below the amount specified in paragraph (1) (a) to include in its annual accounts a note to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 17 (Serious Loss of Capital) 1. In the case of a serious loss of the subscribed capital, a general meeting of shareholders must be called within the period laid down by the laws of the Member States, to consider whether the company should be wound up or any other measures taken.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The amount of a loss deemed to be serious within the meaning of paragraph 1 may not be set by laws of Member States at a figure higher than half the subscribed capital.</PARA>
<PARA>General Note Article 17, which follows German company law, requires again major change in British company law. This provision affords protection to shareholders and creditors and should be welcomed.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 25 (Authorisation of New Share Issues) 1. Any increase in capital must be decided upon by the general meeting. Both this decision and the increase in the subscribed capital shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Nevertheless, the statutes or instrument of incorporation or the general meeting, the decision of which must be published in accordance with the rules referred to in paragraph (1), may authorise an increase in the subscribed capital up to a maximum amount which they shall fix with due regard for any maximum amount provided by law. Where appropriate, the increase in the subscribed capital shall be decided on within the limits of the amount fixed, by the company body empowered to do so. The power of such body in this respect shall be for a maximum period of five years and may be renewed one or more times by the general meeting, each time for a period not exceeding five years.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Where there are several classes of shares, the decision by the general meeting concerning the increase in capital referred to in paragraph (1) or the authorisation to increase the capital referred to in paragraph (2), shall be subject to a seperate vote at least for each class of shareholder whose rights are affected by the transaction.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. This article shall apply to the issue of all securities which are convertible into shares or which carry the right to subscribe for shares, but not to the conversion of such securities, nor to the exercise of the right to subscribe.</PARA>
<PARA>General Note British, Irish and Netherlands law know the concept of the authorised capital but that concept in unknown in French and German law.</PARA>
<PARA> It would appear from Article 2 (c) that the system of the authorised capital will be allowed to be continued in the countries which at present adopt it but that an issue out of the authorised capital will require a resolution of the general meeting (Article 25 (1)) unless the increase falls under Article 25 (2). The five years limit in Article 25 (2) is taken from French and German law. The authority given by the general meeting to the directors to issue shares to the stated maximum amount can be renewed.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 27 (Non-cash Consideration) 1. Where shares are issued for a consideration other than cash in the course of an increase in the subscribed capital the consideration must be transferred in full within a period of five years from the decision to increase the subscribed capital.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The consideration referred to in paragraph (1) shall be the subject of a report drawn up before the increase in capital is made by one or more experts who are independent of the company and appointed or approved by an administrative or judicial authority. Such experts may be natural persons as will as legal persons and companies and firms under the laws of each Member State.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 10 (2) and (3) shall apply 3. Member States may decide not to apply paragraph (2) in the event of an increase in subscribed capital made in order to give effect to a merger or a public offer for the purchase or exchange of shares and to pay the shareholders of the company which is being absorbed or which is the object of the public offer for the the purchase or exchange of shares.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Member States may decide not to apply paragraph (2) if all the shares issued in the course of an increase in subscribed capital are issued for a consideration other than in cash to one or more companies, on condition that all the shareholders in the company which receive the consideration have agreed not to have an experts' report drawn up and that the requirements of Article 10 (4) (b) to (f) are met.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 29 (Pre-emptive Rights to New Share Issues) 1. Whenever the capital is increased by consideration in cash, the shares must be offered on a pre-emptive basis to shareholders in proportion to the capital represented by their shares.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The laws of a Member State:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) need not apply paragraph (1) above to shares which carry a limited right to participate in distributions within the meaning of Article 15 and/or in the company's assets in the event of liquidation; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) may permit, where the subscribed capital of a company having several classes of shares carrying different rights with regard to voting, or participation in distributions within the meaning of Article 15 or in assets in the event of liquidation, is increased by issuing new shares in only one of these classes, the right of pre-emption of shareholders of the other classes to be exercised only after the exercise of this right by the shareholders of the class in which the new shares are being issued.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Any offer of subscription on a pre-emptive basis and the period within which this right must be exercised shall be published in the national gazette appointed in accordance with Directive 68/151. However, the laws of a Member State need not provide for such publication where all a company's shares are registered. In such case, all the company's shareholders must be informed in writing. The right of pre-emption must be exercised within a period which shall not be less than 14 days from the date of publication of the offer or from the date of dispatch of the letters to the shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The right of pre-emption may not be restricted or withdrawn by the statutes or instrument of incorporation. This may, however, be done by decision of the general meeting. The administrative or management body shall be required to present to such a meeting a written report indicating the reason for restriction or withdrawal of the right of pre-emption, and justifying the proposed issue price. The general meeting shall act in accordance with the rules for a quorum and a majority laid down in Article 40. Its decision shall be published in the manner laid down by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/151.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The laws of a Member State may provide that the statutes, the instrument of incorporation or the general meeting, acting in accordance with the rules for a quorum, a majority and publication set out in paragraph (4) may give the power to restrict or withdraw the right of pre-emption to the company body which is empowered to decide on an increase in subscribed capital within the limits of the authorised capital. This power may not be granted for a longer period than the power for which provision is made in Article 25 (2).</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Paragraphs (1) to (5) shall apply to the issue of all securities which are convertible into shares or which carry the right to subscribe for shares, but not to the conversion of such securities, nor to the exercise of the right to subscribe.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The right of pre-emption is not excluded for the purposes of paragraphs (4) and (5) where, in accordance with the decision to increase the subscribed capital, shares are issued to banks or other financial institutions with a view to their being offered to shareholders of the company in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (3).</PARA>
<PARA>General Note Article 29 provides that, where on increase of capital there is a new issue of shares for cash, the existing shareholders shall, on principle, be given a pre-emptive right to acquire the new shares in proportion to their holdings. The directive attributes great importance to this pre-emptive right which, in the circumstances laid down in the article, will enable the shareholder to maintain his proportionate holding in the company if he so desires. Article 29 (2) (b) allows, in the circumstances stated therein, a first pre-emptive right to be given to shareholders of the class affected.</PARA>
<PARA> The right of pre-emption is derived from German company law which, however, does not restrict that right to issues for cash consideration. The rules of the London Stock Exchange require a right of pre-emption to be granted in the case of issues of shares of listed companies for cash consideration but allow dispensation with that right by a prior resolution of the general meeting.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 35 (Maintenance of Capital) Where the laws of a Member State authorise total or partial redemption of the subscribed capital without reduction of the latter, they shall at least require that the following conditions are observed:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) where the statutes or instrument of incorporation provide for redemption, the latter shall be decided on by the general meeting voting at least under the usual conditions of quorum and majority. Where the statutes or instrument of incorporation do not provide for redemption, the latter shall be decided upon by the general meeting acting at least under the conditions of quorum and majority laid down in Article 40. The decision must be published in the manner prescribed by the laws of each Member State, in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 68/ 151;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) only sums which are available for distribution within the meaning of Article 15 (1) may be used for redemption purposes;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) shareholders whose shares are redeemed shall retain their rights in the company, with the exception of their rights to the repayment of their investment and participation in the distribution of an initial dividend on unredeemed shares.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K4">Mr Wilson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In May of this year the OECD Council considered and adopted resolutions relating to three aspects of a harmonised international approach to management of hazardous chemicals. The resolutions concerned standard guidelines for testing of chemicals, principles of good laboratory practice for chemicals testing, and the mutual acceptance between OECD member countries of test data on chemicals. Australia abstained from voting in the Council on the resolution.</PARA>
<PARA> A fourth resolution has been framed, concerning the obtaining of a minimum pre- marketing set of data (MPD) adequate to allow an initial environmental assessment of a new chemical. This resolution has yet to come before OECD Council for consideration, pending agreement amongst member countries upon a common interpretation of the draft text.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government is giving consideration to its attitude to the specific resolutions which have followed from the work of the OECD Chemicals Program. Australia actively supports the objectives and work of this Program. However, it is the practice of the Commonwealth to consult State Governments in the process of establishing its position on international agreements which may impinge upon States' interests. This consultation has been initiated in respect of the OECD resolutions on hazardous chemicals. In due course the Government will advise the OECD Council of Australia's position on all four resolutions. Meanwhile, the Australian Environment Council's Interim Notification Scheme for new industrial chemicals, which commenced on 1 October, has been framed in a manner consistent with the OECD testing guidelines, principles of good laboratory practice and minimum pre-marketing set of data.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Is it estimated that there will be an inflow of foreign capital into Australia of between $7,000m and $8,000m in 1981-82; if so, will a high proportion of this sum be speculative capital over which the Government will have little control and no measure of its cumulative effect once it is within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Has the Government deliberately abandoned the regular compilation of all statistics in this field, including the periodic surveys that played an important role in monitoring the levels of foreign ownership and control in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is any consistent collection of data being undertaken relating to foreign ownership and control within the many sectors of the Australian economy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) A net inflow of capital (whether public or private) to Australia of the order of $7,000-$8,000m in 1981-82 would be broadly consistent with the outlook for the balance of payments which was set out in the papers accompanying my 1981 -82 Budget Speech. It is not expected that a high, or even a significant, proportion of such a sum would be so-called 'speculative' capital, however the honourable member may define that term.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Periodic surveys on foreign ownership and control by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) were discontinued in 1978, following an assessment of the relative priorities within the Bureau given available resources.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) The ABS collects and publishes a substantial amount of information on inflows and levels of foreign investment in enterprises in Australia. These data cover, in broad terms, the country of origin and the industry in which the investment is undertaken, as well as the magnitudes and forms of such investment . The ABS also regularly publishes balance of payments statistics which incorporate data on capital inflow. In addition to this information, the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) also compiles statistics on foreign investment proposals. These statistics are released on a quarterly and an annual basis and relate to the proposed activities and expenditure of foreign investors.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I refer the honourable member to my response to his earlier question concerning the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council on 3 August 1981. (House of Representatives, Daily Hansard, 13 October 1981, p. 1933)</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Government is of the view that foreign interests should not engage in real estate investment that is of a speculative nature or that is intended purely for capital gain or investment income without accompanying benefits to Australia. Accordingly, proposed acquisitions of real estate of this nature are not approved. Information on foreign acquisitions of Australian urban real estate is contained in my press release of 16 November 1981 (No. 203). This press release, which places in some perspective the relative importance of the foreign investment that has occurred in Australian urban real estate in recent years, does not support the views which appear to be implicit in this part of the honourable member's question.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) and (8) There can clearly be value in having more statistical information on many subjects, including that of foreign investment in Australia. However, as the honourable member will be aware, in the interests of sound economic and financial management the Government has had to review very carefully all demands upon public expenditure, including the costs involved in the collection and dissemination of statistics.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (3) Sydney, 9; Melbourne, 6; Hobart, Nil; Newcastle, 2; Wollongong, 1; Adelaide, Nil; Perth, Nil; Canberra, Nil.</PARA>
<PARA> In Adelaide, Hobart, Perth and Launceston, senior ambulance officers are trained to provide intensive and coronary care, and ambulances are fitted with defibrillators and cardiac monitors.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Survival rates from cardiac infarctions are influenced by many factors, an important one being the length of delay before assistance is sought after the onset of symptoms. This factor is generally outside the direct control of health authorities. To date, the impact of coronary care ambulances has not been clearly isolated and quantified.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The ACT ambulance service has one of the fastest response times of any service of this nature and has the advantage of a road system which enables ambulances directed to such calls to be very quickly at the point of need. Likewise it enables patients to rapidly be transferred to one of the major hospitals in a very short time. The ambulances are all well equipped and the staff have a developing and comprehensive program of continuing in-service training to maintain skills at a high level for all forms of trauma including that associated with heart attacks. Whilst the provision of a separate coronorary care ambulance has been considered from time to time it has been noted that it would involve a high capital and maintenance cost for this type of facility as well as the need for separate and additional crews of officers. As it would be stationed at only one location its response time to calls would in many cases be longer than the present method of directing the closest ambulance to the call and it is estimated that the longest trip to a hospital in the ACT is only likely to be nine minutes after resuscitation.</PARA>
<PARA> However, perhaps one of the most important factors which has had to be considered is that a population of around 225,000 is not sufficiently large to provide the level of workload necessary to maintain optimum skills in this specialised area. Finally, there is no evidence that a special intensive care ambulance would alter the outcome of coronary patients given the present excellent service available in the ACT, the level of its officer skill, the short travel time to major hospitals, and the likely level of demand for the specialised service.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (2) and (3)</PARA>
<PARA> A tax on inflows and outflows of foreign capital along the lines proposed would reduce these flows and thus have an adverse effect on the rate at which Australian resources and industries were developed. This, in turn, would imply a lower growth rate of the economy and living standards would be lower. A substantial proportion of foreign capital flows represents the overseas borrowings and debt redemptions of Australian-owned enterprises; the tax would significantly increase the cost of these borrowings to the detriment of Australian enterprises. As the imposition of a tax on foreign capital would adversely affect foreign and Australian investors' perceptions of the potential for investment in Australia and seriously disrupt foreign capital inflows and outflows, a reliable estimate of the amount of revenue that might be collected from if could not be made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation (AMLC) has undertaken a number of steps to encourage and promote consumption and sales of beef in Australia as specified under the AMLC Act. It has regularly and frequently run advertising campaigns through the mass media in Australia to reach consumers and potential consumers of meat. The major media for these campaigns have been television and women's magazines. In addition, promotion through shows, exhibits , school programmes and other avenues which permit the distribution of printed matter, exhibition of film and video materials and other means of communication, have been organised. Publicity materials have also been supplied regularly, for use by print and audio/visual media in Australia, which deal with methods of buying and consuming meats.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Corporation from time to time recommends amendments to the Exports ( Meat) Regulations regarding quality, standards and grading of meat for export. For example, two recent recommendations have related to: (a) the creation of an Australian approved lamb brand to be applied to lamb carcases at slaughter in order to guarantee that product described as lamb is lamb and, (b) the creation of a special product description, 'Grainfed Beef', to meet Japanese market requirements for high quality beef and permit Australian producers and exporters to compete with USA high quality beef.</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation is involved in commercial field testing of carcase classification proposals and if a satisfactory commercially acceptable system is developed, the Corporation would make recommendations on amendments to the Exports (Meat) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation, in consultation with meat processors and exporter representatives, is currently reviewing the Exports (Meat) Regulations with a view to recommending to the Minister amendments considered to be commercially desirable.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Corporation has owned two cattle properties in Queensland for many years. These are utilised by the CSIRO and Queensland Department of Primary Industries for research into cattle breeding and nutrition.</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation has also accepted managerial responsibility for the national Beef Recording Scheme (NBRS) which aims at production improvement by performance recording.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, through involvement in the administration and joint membership of the Australian Meat Research Committee, the Corporation can influence the initiation and funding of research in various organisations. Much of this research is aimed at improving the quality and productive capacity of Australian livestock.</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation is also encouraging the implementation of technology to improve the eating quality of beef, e.g., tenderstretch, electrical stimulation and ageing, through technical extension to meat producers and co-operation with other organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) the Corporation has current directions in regard to qualities of beef that can be exported to:</PARA>
<PARA> A. European Economic Community-as high quality beef (Direction to Exporter DM 37)</PARA>
<PARA> B. Japan-as high quality beef (Direction to Exporter DM 42)</PARA>
<PARA>The Corporation is not involved in grading of beef for domestic use. This is a State function although at present no State grades beef for the domestic consumer. One State (Queensland) has had a consumer identification system for beef for several years.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Gradings of beef for export are included in the Exports (Meat) Regulations administered by the Department of Primary Industry through the Bureau of Animal Health. Bone-in meat is required to be exported in accordance with these Regulations. Boneless meat does not have to be packaged in accordance with the grade of the carcase from which it was derived as boning techniques may alter the original grading determinant (e.g. fat cover).</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation's policy regarding exports is that the buyer should receive product which complies with an agreed contract specification and it has issued a Direction (DM 13) to exporters covering this matter. The application of descriptive grades, First, Second, etc., can lead to marketing problems. What is first quality in some markets is totally unacceptable in others.</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation favours the use of descriptions for domestic comsumer protection such as lamb branding and hogget branding. It is expected that this will extend into domestic beef which may be described as yearling, lotfed and electrically stimulated. The Corporation has recently agreed to jointly investigating and promoting such a system with the Queensland Meat Industry Organisation and Marketing Authority as a pilot study in 1982.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) This information is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As the profits available for distribution as dividends could be reduced by the above-the-line payments, such payments might, in particular cases, tend to reduce dividend withholding tax received by Australia in respect of dividends paid to an overseas parent. If the Australian subsidiary is owned or controlled by a non-resident company, however, there would be little or no effect on the primary tax payable by the Australian company because any above-the-line payments are deductible in arriving at the subsidiary's taxable income only to the extent that they are on revenue account and do not exceed arm's length prices, or are otherwise allowable deductions under the income tax law. Moreover , to the extent that above-the-line payments constitute royalties, as defined for taxation purposes, they are taxable in the hands of the parent company at the rate of 46 per cent after deducting allowable expenses incurred in deriving the royalties.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The normal company tax rate, 46 per cent of taxable income, is payable by Australian subsidiaries of overseas parents. Dividends remitted by an Australian company to overseas shareholders are, in the absence of an Agreement between Australia and the country of residence of the foreign shareholder, subject to withholding tax at the rate of 30 per cent of the gross dividends. However, dividend withholding tax is, as a general rule, limited to 15 per cent of gross dividends where the dividends are remitted to a resident of a country with which Australia has entered into a double taxation agreement. Interest remitted to a foreign lender attracts Australian withholding tax at the rate of 10 per cent of the gross amount.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Statistics are not available of the tax value of such above-the-line payments as are allowable as deductions in determining the taxable incomes of subsidiaries of overseas companies.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Government expects to be in a position to introduce amending legislation in the near future. Consideration of the appropriate amendments to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 are being treated as a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As the various domestic liability levels that are embodied in the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act are currently under review by Government it is inappropriate to comment on proposed levels at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> International air carriers' liability limits for death or injury to passengers and for loss or damage to cargo and passenger baggage were established by the Warsaw Convention of 1929 and amended by the 1955 Hague Protocol to that Convention. Australia is a party to both treaties and the liability limits applying for carriage between Australia and a country which is a party to the Warsaw Convention are 125,000 Poincare gold francs per passenger, 250 Poincare gold francs per kilogram in the case of registered baggage and cargo, and 5,000 Poincare gold francs per passenger for cabin baggage. For carriage between Australia and a country which is a party to the Hague Protocol, the liability limit per passenger is 250,000 Poincare gold francs and the other limits are unchanged. However, since the abandonment of an official gold price, free market fluctuations in the price of gold have introduced a degree of uncertainty as to the present currency equivalents of these liability limits.</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, specified liability limits have been introduced on a voluntary basis by some airlines and on certain routes national governments have directed airlines to set a fixed limit.</PARA>
<PARA> Qantas has voluntarily accepted on all routes a limit of US$75,000 per passenger, inclusive of legal fees and costs, except that in case of a claim brought in a State where provision is made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum of US$58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs .</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to the high cost of pharmaceutical items related to the day-to-day control of diabetes and the enormous financial burden of the disease on those who suffer from it.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In particular, is it a fact that diabetics must to a large extent be their own physicians, involving expensive Diabetic Association subscriptions to keep abreast of new developments in diabetic control, the purchase of expensive books , additional food and dietary expenses, extremely expensive blood and urine monitoring equipment for daily use, insulin and syringes for daily life support, constant doctors' visits and fees and expensive health insurance premiums, which do not cover most of these expenses.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The severity of diabetes, however, varies from case to case and some patients with diabetes do not have an enormous financial burden because of the disease.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Most patients with diabetes would be under the continuing surveillance of their medical practitioners or would be receiving advice from an appropriate diabetic clinic, dietician and/or other medical or paramedical personnel. It is unlikely that the majority of diabetics are 'their own physicians'.</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the honourable member's comment about expensive blood and urine monitoring equipment, there is some quite expensive equipment marketed to assist in the control of diabetes. I understand that there is also some Australian-made equipment, which is much cheaper, available on the market.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Insulin is available on prescription under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme but syringes are not.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Although insulin is available on prescription under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, insulin can be sold by pharmacists in all States and the Northern Territory 'over the counter' without a doctor's prescription. In the Australian Capital Territory insulin is available on prescription only. Syringes and needles are available 'over the counter'.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) Consideration has been given to ways and means by which Government assistance can be given in meeting the cost of syringes required by diabetics. The Government is sympathetic to the needs of diabetics and is mindful of the costs to the patient in the management of diabetes. However, the current economic situation has necessitated policies of restraint in public expenditure. In view of this, it is not possible for the Government to commit itself at the present time to additional programs, such as assistance with the cost of insulin syringes. Nevertheless this matter will be kept under review.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Items are made available as pharmaceutical benefits only after a recommendation to that effect by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). In accordance with a recommendation of the PBAC the two blood testing reagent strips most commonly used by diabetics in Australia are both currently listed as pharmaceutical benefits. The PBAC, which bases its advice on medical considerations, has not recommended that other blood-glucose reagent strips be made available as benefits.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) See (1).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Venison is included in Schedule A of the New Zealand Australia Trade Agreement (NAFTA), according it duty free entry to both markets from either source. Any moves by either Government to introduce new import duties or restrictions on goods which are currently included on Schedule A of NAFTA would be inconsistent with the objective of a gradual and progressive liberalisation of trade across the Tasman. However, the principle of equality of trading opportunity is an essential element in the Government's present consideration of a possible new economic relationship with New Zealand. In this context, the impact of incentive schemes on trans-Tasman trade will be an important element in the Government's consideration of the final package of measures for a closer economic relationship.</PARA>
<PARA> Should assistance be provided to New Zealand exporters through Government incentives and subsidies, it would be consistent with NAFTA, and with the current proposals for closer economic relations, for the Australian deer industry to seek countervailing or anti-dumping action against imports of subsidised or dumped venison from New Zealand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Officers of my Department were not able to determine if this was so, however it is improbable that an engineer from another company could determine unserviceabilities on a Trans Australia Airlines aircraft. Department of Transport Airworthiness staff monitored Trans Australia Airlines performance at capital city airports including inspection of Maintenance Reports, AMD18's, and there was no evidence of carriage of unauthorised defects or of incorrect use of the Schedule of Permissible Unserviceabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Maintenance was performed by a number of experienced but unlicensed aircraft maintenance engineers as well as third and fourth year apprentices. This work was supervised and/or checked by a foreman who then certified to the maintenance as he is qualified to do.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) This matter relates to ground handling. There was an instance at Cairns where tarmac space was required and the flight crew taxied a DC9 under direction from the traffic department and the Assistant Airport Manager. In Sydney aircraft ground handling was carried out by foremen on tow vehicles with the Maintenance Supervisor in the cockpit as is permissible. In Brisbane an Assistant Airport Manager was used as a communicator to man the telephone in the foremen's office while the foremen were engaged on ground handling duties.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Officers of my Department were unable to determine if this was so, however it was determined that defects were recorded by the aircrew in the normal manner in the Maintenance Report, AMD18. The only recorded defects that were cleared were those covered by the Schedule of Permissible Unserviceabilities and which did not require any physical labour to acquit.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) This is correct. The result of this was to make the flight crew responsible for pre-flight requirements as they are at non-maintenance bases. In view of the provisions of the approved system of maintenance for the aircraft, the action of Trans Australian Airlines in withdrawing ports from the listed locations for maintenance was of no safety significance in view of the limited maintenance capability at such ports. Officers of my Department are satisfied that when aircraft developed defects or required scheduled maintenance beyond the capacity of the particular base, they were removed from service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is not possible to confirm that the emergency locator carried by the missing aircraft chartered by the German tourists, was in fact activated.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Beacons are designed to operate for a minimum period of 48 hours.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In the first instance all aircraft on the busy Melbourne-Canberra-Sydney routes and others in contact with the Melbourne centre were alerted to listen for a signal on the ELBA frequency.</PARA>
<PARA> No signals were heard by any aircraft other than the weak signal for a period of five minutes by the aircraft at low level enroute from Moorabbin to Tyabb. An Ansett Electra aircraft was diverted from its route near Eildon to carry our an aural search of the general area. This aircraft reported several fires, which were checked, but no ELBA signal was heard.</PARA>
<PARA> Homing procedures cannot commence until a signal is received. Consequently there was no requirement to supplement the already extensive listening coverage with a search meter equipped aircraft until a further signal could be identified .</PARA>
<PARA> (4) All departmental aircraft with the exception of one PA28 Cherokee aircraft based at Townsville are fitted with equipment which can be used in the search for ELBAs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1981-82 estimate of income from rental of Department's residences was based on December 1980 rentals. Rentals are based on the economic rental or 10 per cent of the occupant's salary, whichever is the lesser; other factors which affect the total revenue include disposal and/or acquisition of residences, and officers of different salary classifications progressively occupying the same house.</PARA>
<PARA> I therefore would not expect changes in the level of receipts from rentals to relate directly to movements in the consumer price index.</PARA>

No penalties have been imposed. However, available records indicate that the following flights were operated in accordance with dispensations given on the general grounds of exceptional passenger hardships, from 31 October 1976 to 31 October 1981.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I arrived at this conclusion firstly from discussions with senior officers of my Department, and secondly from appeals to the Grievance and Appeals Bureau of the Public Service Board from departmental officers during 1980-81. An analysis of those appeals shows that most are unrelated to morale as such, but go to matters relating to the functions of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I have spoken to a number of officers whose Divisions are based in Melbourne and I appreciate that there are some officers who for a variety of reasons do not wish to transfer to Canberra. It is a matter of opinion, however, whether this could be called a morale problem.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The new provisions relating to seafarers' qualifications will come into force on 1 January 1982. Other provisions relating to international conventions will come into force progressively as subordinate legislation and administrative arrangements necessary to give effect to those Conventions are completed.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A number of technical officers have left the Marine Standards Division over recent months. The reasons for persons taking other positions are not always clear, and I do not rule out the possibility that some departures have been due to the impending transfer of the Division to Canberra. As in all previous moves to Canberra, there will be some officers who will decline to transfer.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I expect the changes to exacerbate some of the staffing and work load difficulties my Department has experienced in this area over a period of time, but not to an extent that will cause serious problems.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am convinced that the Marine Standards Division can provide an equally satisfactory service to industry from Canberra as it does from Melbourne, and that no good purpose would be served in deferring the transfer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) An income tax deduction is allowed for amounts paid by a resident taxpayer for thermal insulation materials, and for the cost of their installation in a dwelling, if the dwelling is the sole or principal residence of the taxpayer in Australia. A further condition is that the taxpayer or, in the case of married couples, the taxpayer or his or her spouse, has not previously owned another dwelling in Australia that he or she used as a home. For these purposes, a married couple includes persons living as husband and wife or on a bona fide domestic basis although not legally married.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not a condition of the deduction that the thermal insulation materials be installed in a new dwelling. Subject to the specified requirements, the deduction is allowable for the cost of insulating a dwelling purchased by the taxpayer on or after 1 October 1980 or, if a dwelling is constructed by the taxpayer, where the construction started on or after that date. Amounts paid for the insulation of extensions to dwellings qualify for the deduction under the specified conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The question of extending the concession to the cost of insulating all homes after 1 October 1981 has been considered. However, having regard to the other demands on the Budget it was decided not to depart in this respect from the announcement made by the Prime Minister before the 1980 election.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Zeranol, marketed under the tradename Ralgro, is not marketed in Australia for the treatment of any human condition. The product, in the form of a subcutaneous implant, is used for growth promotion in steer cattle in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There have been no reports of suspected adverse reactions in humans to either the Australian or the World Health Organization Registries of Adverse Reactions, nor in the recognized texts on the side effects of drugs. Extensive data on zeranol have been examined by expert committees of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and Council has made recommendations for maximum residue limits of zeranol in the meat of cattle and sheep.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The Department of Primary Industry's National Residue Survey includes monitoring for zeranol residues in samples of beef liver from animals killed in registered export abattoirs.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) At its 83rd Session in April 1977 NHMRC recommended that certain antibiotics including penicillins and sulphonamides be prohibited as growth promotants in animal husbandry in Australia. Council was of the opinion that the continued use of therapeutic antibiotics as growth promotants in animal feedstuffs could lead to an impairment of their efficacy in the treatment of human disease. These recommendations have been substantially adopted by the States in Australia. Hypersensitivity reactions resulting from prior contact with antibiotic feed supplements have been reported in the literature. At the present level of usage reactions in hypersensitive individuals from residues in food are not considered to be a problem of consequence. The Antibiotics Committee of NHMRC has under consideration the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and this matter is being kept under review by both the Poisons Schedule (Standing) Committee and the Pesticides and Agricultural Chemicals ( Standing) Committee of Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The National Residue Survey of the Department of Primary Industry includes a monitoring for antibiotic residues in cattle meat and it is intended to extend such monitoring, from 1982, to sheep and pig meat. Aside from zeranol, which has hormone-like properties, true hormones are not approved for growth promotant purposes in Australia and are not the subject of routine residue monitoring.</PARA>

<PARA> Procedures for which benefits were paid under Items 274/275-'Induction and Management of Second Trimester Labour', and 6469-'Evacuation of the Contents of the Gravid Uterus . . .' would generally constitute an abortion. Items 6460/6464 -'Uterus, Curettage of, with or without dilatation, including curettage for incomplete miscarriage' and 6483-'Uterus Curettage of, with Colposcopy, Cervical Biopsy and Radical Diathermy' would cover curette operations. There are other procedures in the Medical Benefits Schedule which may result in the termination of pregnancy, but as the principal purpose of these is not the performance of an abortion they have not been included.</PARA>
<PARA> The following table shows the estimated number of fee-for-service procedures for which benefits were paid under the above items in the years 1977 to 1980.

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to a study undertaken by Professor L. J. Opit and others, of the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Monash Medical School, Prahran, Victoria in January 1981 of the relationship between age and the number of general practitioner consultations of members of the Mutual Health Association in Adelaide referred to on page 16 of New Doctor, April 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) If so, does this study suggest a peak of consultations in the 40-50 age group and the second lowest rate for those over 70.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Are there any figures available from Pensioner Medical Service usage or from other studies which either support or oppose the findings of this study.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Are the figures obtained in this study, if applied to the general population, surprising and can they be explained on a rational basis.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="145" SPEAKER="MacKellar The Hon M.J.R." NAMEID="014" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="PROSPECT">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. Professor Opit's study needs to be seen in context. It analysed data relating to a random sample of members of Mutual Health Association (MHA), i.e. it relates only to insured persons. No account is taken of the use of medical and hospital services by persons eligible to receive treatment under pensioner and disadvantaged arrangements, and uninsured persons. Clearly, then, Professor Opit's study does not include a large number of services used by people in older age groups where eligibility for Pensioner Health Benefits (PHB) services is most concentrated, or those by people who chose not to insure because they considered themselves relatively healthy-this group is likely to include many relatively younger people.</PARA>
<PARA> The data drawn from the Australian Health Survey and presented by Dr Powles in the article 'Over-Indulgence in Private Medicine' (New Doctor, April 1981, p. 16 )-Figure 1-show quite clearly the distortion that results in the upper age groups by the exclusion of uninsured persons.</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, while consultations rendered in hospitals and nursing homes were deleted from the pool of consultations counted by Professor Opit, these members in respect of whom consultations were rendered were not deleted from the pools of people in each age group. This procedure would have had the effect of selectively depressing the general practitioner consultation rates for the higher age groups in Professor Opit's study, since these people are more likely to have consultations in hospitals or nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The results of Professor Opit's study for general practitioner contact rates for persons insured with MHA in Metropolitan Adelaide, classified by age, are:</PARA>
<PARA>Contact</PARA>
<PARA>rate/1,000 Age (years)</PARA>
<PARA>persons</PARA>
<PARA> 0-9  2,140 10-19  1,340 20-29  2,220 30-39  2,760 40-49  2,950 50-59  2,860 60- 69  2,340 70 or more  1,840</PARA>
<PARA> However, when the services to other persons are added to these, it is considered most unlikely that the peak of consultations would be for the 40-49 age group.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, in 1979-80 there were 14,281,100 direct-billed general practitioner consultations by eligible pensioners (Director-General's Annual Report, 1979-80, Table 107). At 30 June 1980 there were 1,551,888 persons eligible for PHB services, of whom 67 per cent were age pensioners (Annual Report, Department of Social Security, 1979-80, Table 41). This means that PHB services by general practitioners are an estimated 9.2 per eligible pensioner annually. To this would have to be added general practitioner pensioner services processed through the private health insurance funds and general practitioner services to disadvantaged persons and uninsured persons, and certain primary- contact services at outpatient departments of hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In respect of that part of the question relating to other studies, in the Australian Health Survey, 1977-78, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the reported consultation rates by age group in the two weeks before interview were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Consultation</PARA>
<PARA>rate per 100 Age (years)</PARA>
<PARA>population</PARA>
<PARA> 0-4  30.5  5-14  14.6 15-24  21.8 25-44  24.6 45-64  29.3 65 or more  47.2</PARA>
<PARA> These estimates include consultations with general practitioners, specialists and hospital doctors. They serve to show that the peak in total consultations is not in the 40-50 age group, but in fact in the 65 and over age group, as would be expected.</PARA>
<PARA> An analysis of Medibank data for the year ended in June 1976 for all medical benefit services paid in that year (see table below) shows that the average number of services per head of population at that time increased with rising age groups. The conduct of such an exercise on medical benefits data has not been possible since the introduction of amended health insurance arrangements effective from 1 October 1976.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) No. The figures obtained in this study are not surprising when they are seen for what they really are-a study of insured persons. For reasons outlined above, they cannot be applied to the general population. They can indeed be explained on a rational basis in that they illustrate the effect of community rated medical insurance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Prime Minister, I provide the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. On 30 April 1981 the Prime Minister announced, as part of the Government's decisions arising out of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, that the Government would be asking all States to share the operating costs of the Australian Institute of Criminology. All of the States declined to contribute to the Institute's running costs but indicated they were most anxious that the Institute should continue its work. The Government has decided to continue funding the Institute but will be assessing its current and future projects. The Government's decisions on the future of the Institute were announced by the Attorney-General on 10 September 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As at end October 1981, approximately 270 of the Government's decisions relating to the Review had been implemented or were close to final implementation, of a total of some 350 decisions. Implementation of the remainder is being pursued by responsible Ministers and is oversighted by a Cabinet Committee chaired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. To answer the question in the precise detail sought by the honourable member would entail a major commitment of staffing resources which I am not prepared to authorize.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Further to the supplementary information provided by his Department relating to a question raised at the Estimates Committee D hearings on 15 September 1981 (Hansard, House of Representatives Estimates Committees C, D, E and F, page 252) in which I asked (a) do rural industries or rural associated industries, for example, the processors of rural products, qualify for export development grants, (b) what is the total amount that has been paid to rural associated industries under the Export Development Grants Scheme and (c) what implications do the payments have for calculating Government assistance to rural industries, particularly rural exports, was his answer, as recorded in Hansard, correct, that in the broad, about 40 per cent of the grants are for rural associated industries and that he would get the details.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0N7">Mr Nixon</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Based on the 1980-81 growth of export trade by broad industry classification, about 40 per cent of Export Expansion Grants (EEG) for that year could be expected to accrue to rural and associated industries. Similar estimations are not able to be made for the Export Market Development Grants ( EMDG) scheme as those grants are not dependent on the levels of exports achieved but on individual claimants' expenditure on eligible promotion.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Export Development Grants Board has not maintained statistics of grant distribution by industry. The proportion referred to in (1) above is an estimation only and was made by the Department of Trade and Resources. There is no inconsistency between the answer I gave to the question on 15 September 1981 and the supplementary information provided by my Department in Attachment D.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) See (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No contracting party to the GATT has requested consultations or taken action against the EEG or EMDG schemes under the provisions of Article XVI ( Subsidies) of the GATT.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the United States has considered applying countervailing measures against two products (wool tops and lamb) allegedly benefiting from the EEG and EMDG schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of wool tops the investigation concluded that the level of subsidisation was insignificant and therefore not countervailable. The investigation of lamb exports was terminated when the complaint of alleged subsidisation was withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The difficulties of precisely determining the effects of incentives on the level of exports are obvious. Nonetheless the Government has accepted the worth of operating export incentives, a policy endorsed by a wide spectrum of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The whole question of export incentives is presently before the Industries Assistance Commission. In looking at the forms of incentives to be made available after June 1983, the Government will consider, inter alia, the likely impact of particular schemes on particular industries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Insofar as the Commonwealth's responsibilities are concerned, three projects providing pregnancy support services received Commonwealth funding during 1980-81 under the Community Health Program to the extent shown:</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria: Caroline Chisholm Pregnancy Support Service-$60,850</PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales: Preparation for Parenthood-$5,400; Pregnancy Help-$28,600</PARA>
<PARA> These Commonwealth Funds were paid to the projects by the relevant State health authorities from the Commonwealth's block grant for community health services. In each case, the State authorities determined the level of the grant to individual projects.</PARA>
<PARA> Community Health Program funding was absorbed into general revenue funding with effect from 1 July 1981. For the current year the States are receiving, within general revenue grants, a component equal to the total Community Health Program block grant in 1980-81, plus 10 per cent.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="155" SPEAKER="MacKellar The Hon M.J.R." NAMEID="014" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="CAPRICORNIA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKellar</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. It appears that the figure of over $1,000m refers back to the year 1972-73 when an estimate of alcohol costs of $1,177m was made.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Figures have not been calculated for each of the last 5 years. However, using the same approach as was adopted in the estimate of $1,177m for 1972-73 an estimate of $2,051m has been derived for 1977-78, and an estimate of $2,238m has been derived for 1979-80, the last year for which sufficient figures are available upon which to make a reasonable estimate.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The estimated Government income for each of the last five years, at constant prices, (1976-77 representing the baseline) was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Customs and Excise on beer,1976-77-$745m, 1977-78-$692m, 1978-79-$800m, 1979-80 -$770m, 1980-81-$696m.</PARA>
<PARA> Customs and Excise on spirits, 1976-77-$188m, 1977-78-$183m, 1978-79-$213m, 1979-80-$211m, 1980-81-$213m.</PARA>
<PARA> State Government and local authority liquor taxes, 1976-77-$123m, 1977-78-$128m , 1978-79-$131m, 1979-80-$134m, 1980-81-Not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Commonwealth Government has, over the last five years, contributed significant funds, under the Community Health Program, to projects which specifically and primarily relate to alcohol and other drug problems, mostly with a preventive or rehabilitative emphasis. It is estimated that the amounts, (at constant prices, 1976-77 representing the baseline) the Commonwealth Government spent on such projects over the last five years were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1976-77-$4,076,000, 1977-78-$3,998,000, 1978-79-$3,064,000, 1979-80-$2,974,000, 1980-81-$3,202,000.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition further Commonwealth Government expenditure was directed at alcohol problems through the general health services. It has been calculated that at least 10 per cent of all general hospital costs can be attributed to alcohol related problems, and that a significant proportion of private health care is also directed towards persons with alcohol problems. However in many cases the involvement of alcohol in causation is apparently unrecognised. It is thus impossible to ascertain how much if this care could be said to be preventive or rehabilitative or to assess the amount of Commonwealth Government funding which could be allocated to such provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) An estimate of need can be based on average alcohol consumption and alcohol-related deaths. Average alcohol consumption rose only marginally between 1974-75 and 1979-80. There is no indication of significant change since June 1980. Estimated death rates per 100,000 population for alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver increased from 3.9 in 1974 to 4.6 in 1979; estimated death rates for alcoholism decreased from 3.3 in 1974 to 2.8 in 1978 (the last year for which comparable statistics are available); and estimated death rates for alcohol- related traffic accidents decreased from 13.6 in 1974 to 13.1 in 1979. Overall death rates from alcohol-related causes remained almost constant between 1974 and 1979.</PARA>

<PARA> (c) No formal assessment has been made of change in demand for services.

<PARA> (3), (4) and (5) It would be inappropriate for me to speculate on how the findings of the specific case cited might apply in other, hypothetical, situations.

I also indicated that this practice of extended credit terms would be considered by the Government with a view to amending the Insurance Act 1973 to circumscribe dependence by brokers on this form of remuneration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Patents in respect of the immunisation procedure to increase fecundity in livestock were applied for provisionally in Australia by CSIRO in February 1980. Final specifications were filed in January 1981, in Australia and other countries including United States of America, United Kingdom, New Zealand, France, South Africa, and Argentina. Prosecution of these CSIRO patent applications is currently proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the agreement between CSIRO and Glaxo (Aust.) to develop immunisation procedures for increasing livestock productivity, there have been two additional filings of provisional patent specifications in the joint names of CSIRO and Glaxo to protect inventions regarded by the two parties as their joint property.</PARA>
<PARA> These filings follow the normal procedures used by CSIRO to secure ownership of its technological discoveries and to provide the licensees of its processes with the protection needed to bring innovative products to the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As a result of a collaborative agreement entered into after public tender, Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd is providing $145,000 in the financial period 1981-82, $ 120,000 in 1982-83, and $120,000 in 1983-84. These funds are to assist CSIRO in a collaborative research and development program with the specific aim of transferring a laboratory process into field application. Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd has been granted an exclusive licence with respect to the commercialisation of the CSIRO patents.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The research referred to in the question was a preliminary experiment, carried out during 1977. Major changes in technique occurred during 1978-79 and these modifications produced much improved results. As a consequence, a decision was made to call tenders on 23 and 25 February 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The decision to call for tenders was made at the level of Chief of Division after consultation with CSIRO's Commercial Group, in accordance with CSIRO Executive policy.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) For Australian farmers to benefit from research, promising innovations such as the immunisation process have to undergo commercial development and evaluation. The high cost of developmental research, the necessary toxicological studies for registration of biological materials, and necessary marketing expertise, is outside the scope of CSIRO's resources. CSIRO's policy is to encourage industry to commercialise the Organization's research findings-the ultimate benefit is that Australian farmers will be provided with a major new technology for increasing the reproductive efficiency of their livestock.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) In the case of the Army, where until earlier this year acting rank may have been granted pending completion of a course, officers may now be promoted substantively and undergo that course after promotion. This contrasts with Air Force, where substantive promotion is withheld pending completion of an examination. However, a recent decision to waive the examination requirement will cause a reduction in the number of promotions to acting rank in the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (3) The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, with five classes and a Medal, the B.E.M., was founded in 1917 chiefly to recognise service by civilians in the First World War. There are two divisions, military and civil. It became the Order most widely conferred on civilians and service personnel for meritorious service. Until July 1974, when the Queen's Gallantry Medal was instituted, the Order including the B.E.M. could also be used to recognise acts of gallantry. On the occasions when the B.E.M. was awarded for gallantry, the wearing of a silver emblem of crossed oak leaves on the ribbon distinguished the wearer. In addition, the citations accompanying awards indicate clearly those made in recognition of bravery. Since the Government re-instituted the practice of making recommendations for Imperial honours in 1976, awards of the British Empire Medal have not been recommended for gallantry. The Government instead has recognised acts of bravery by the award of Australian Bravery Decorations which are part of the Australian Honours System.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In the House of Representatives Estimates Committee D on 17 September, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The people who will not be transferred are those who are operational staff responsible for carrying out the day- to-day operational functions of the Department of Transport. Those people who are being transferred from the Marine Division happen to be central office planning and policy staff. They are not the day-to-day operational officers. So the Industry will still have opportunities to meet with the operational people face to face in the marine areas and other areas at the regional offices'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Marine Standards Division is responsible for formulating, promulgating and supervising implementation of technical and safety standards to facilitate safe shipping operations in Australian waters. This is quite commonly referred to as a policy function and this usage is reflected in the duty statements of senior officers of the Division requiring participation in policy formulation on marine operational and survey matters. It was in this sense that I used the expression 'planning and policy', to make clear the distinction between the Central Office responsibility for planning, formulation and promulgation of standards and the day-to-day Regional responsibility for the implementation and practical operation of those standards. The distinction made in the Australian Government directory is a strictly formal one. It distinguishes between those Divisions responsible for policy in the purest sense and those responsible for operational policies.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The honourable member has referred to four aspects under this question:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The approval of plans and submissions: This is done through the Regions except where some Central Office guidance is required. The industry contact, however, should be at the Regional level.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Manning of Ships: This involves setting the level of manning required for Australian ships. Day-to-day contact with industry to ensure that prescribed manning standards are met is a Regional responsibility.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Australians who died during World War II as a result of service with the Merchant Navy, the RAF and similar forces are not named on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Menorial. The reason for this is that at the time the Roll of Honour at the Memorial was compiled and erected the Australian War Memorial Act provided only for commemoration of Australians who died on or as a result of active service with the armed forces of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Act has been amended to provide for commemoration of Australians who have died as a result of any war or warlike operations in which Australians have been engaged on active service. A bronze plaque commemorating Australians who died serving with armed forces of allied countries, merchant marines, philanthropic organisations, and as war correspondents, photographers and artists has been erected adjacent to the Roll of Honour at the Memorial. Work has been proceeding on the compilation of a list of names of Australians in those categories to be incorporated in a Commemorative Book which will be exhibited at the Memorial.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The present and past health insurance arrangements are based on the community rating principle which provides that contributors pay the same rate of contributions regardless of such factors as state of health, age, family size etc. It is accepted within this principle that single persons (without dependants) pay half the family rate.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It could be argued that one parent families may subsidise two parent families but, equally, it could also be claimed that couples without dependent children, young single persons, families with some alternative health cover, e.g . Repatriation or Defence, etc., also subsidise other persons. This is the nature of the community rating principle which the Government adopts as a measure to keep contribution rates within reasonable reach of all persons.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Because of the attractiveness and simplicity of the community rating principle I do not see merit in negotiations that could give rise to a conglomeration of contribution rate arrangements.

<PARA> The cost of connection of services to individual manufactured homes would be the same as the cost of connection for any other detached home provided that the same number of connections to services and the same allotment size are used in each case. Costs would depend on the particular site characteristics such as topography, soil and location of the services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2843) Mr Giles asked me a question , without notice, in my capacity as Minister for Primary Industry. His question concerned a new high yielding variety of wheat called Roseworthy College 311 and the difficulties this variety was encountering in being registered in Queensland and Western Australia. Mr Giles asked that the matter be listed for consideration by the Australian Agricultural Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am now able to supply you with the following additional information:</PARA>
<PARA> The registration of a crossbred variety such as RAC.311 requires endorsement by the Wheat Advisory Committee in the State concerned, followed by agreement by all co-operators in the wheat registration scheme (i.e., all wheatbreeding organisations in Australia). The crossbred wheat RAC.311 is unique in that it is a mixture of two components, one hard grained and the other soft grained.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of this dual characteristic the Western Australian Department of Agriculture objected to the principle of releasing what was in effect two varieties each of which could be unsuitable when grown on its own.</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Department of Primary Industry had similar objections as well as objecting to the overall quality of the mixture, maintaining it was inferior in certain regards to the varieties it was planned to replace. The Department contended that crude selection within the variety could change the composition of the mixture in an unpredictable manner reducing quality even further. In particular it could reduce the quality of ASW in South Australia, leading to a decline in returns to all growers in Australia including those in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wheat Board has indicated that RAC.311 was intended in South Australia to replace Halberd because it had superior quality characteristics as regards hardness, dough properties and baking quality.</PARA>
<PARA> Although being marginally superior to Halberd in quality it is of lesser quality to other recommended varieties in South Australia and if RAC.311 replaced Oxley, Condor or Aroona, the AWB considers the quality of South Australian ASW would decline.</PARA>
<PARA> Regarding other States, the Board considers that where quality standards are generally higher (for example, Queensland and New South Wales) RAC.311 would be unlikely ever to be released. The low test weight of RAC.311 further increases the likelihood of it failing to meet the ASW standard of 74 kg/hl minimum.</PARA>
<PARA> The Board has concluded that the South Australian Advisory Committee did not fully appreciate the implications of releasing a mixed variety at the time. The Board believes that Roseworthy College should now seek registration of only the hard component of RAC.311 and the South Australian Committee should limit the extent of its recommendation of this hard component to higher protein areas of that State.</PARA>
<PARA> After considering the information supplied by the Australian Wheat Board I consider there is no basis to take the matter to the Australian Agricultural Council for further consideration. I consider that adequate arrangements already exist in each State for comprehensively examining the registration of crossbred varieties based on criteria and standards applicable to that State.</PARA>

<PARA> As indicated in my answer to question on notice No. 1792, the Canberra Showground Trust Ordinance 1976 requires the Trust to account for and report separately on its commercial and non-commercial operations rather than on particular activities within each category of operations. For the three relevant financial years the Trust has recorded losses for its commercial operations. These have been:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 1977-78-$47,272</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 1978-79-$194,397 (Note: This includes extraordinary items of expenditure incurred, and revenue received, by the Department of the Capital Territory on behalf of the Trust for the period 1 April 1976 to 30 June 1977 and some capital expenditure. The loss excluding extraordinary items was $74,000).</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 1979-80-$57,670</PARA>
<PARA> In 1978-79 and 1979-80 the Commonwealth made cash advances to the Trust of $116 ,000 and $112,000 respectively for cash shortfalls in the Trust's commercial operations. The advances are repayable to the Commonwealth if and when demanded.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="179" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="LILLEY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Income tax is payable on interest yielded from savings accounts in banks and building societies and from savings invested with finance companies where the interest is received by a taxpayer whose income, including the interest, exceeds $4195 and who is not otherwise non-taxable by entitlement to rebate. An increase in rates of interest, causing interest received to increase, also results in increased income tax becoming payable.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As interest received from savings through banks, building societies and finance companies is not distinguished from other interest in the income tax statistics, it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the increased income tax revenue that would result from an increase in interest rates on these types of account. Statistics are, however available of the total amount of interest included in individuals income tax returns for the 1979-80 income year. If half of this amount had related to such savings, and if the relevant interest rates had been 1 per cent higher for that year, the resulting increase in tax would have been an amount of the order of $50m.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV4">Mr Hodgman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Board was established in August 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) 1979-80-$200,000 (a); 1980-81-$325,000.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Board was not operating for the full year. The salary of one officer ( Level 1, Second Division) was met by the Department of the Capital Territory. The Executive Director was on staff for only seven months.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) 1979-80-$33,600; 1980-81-$48,400.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) From the outset it has been widely recognised that the Board would probably not achieve anything significant during its first three years because of the time it takes to organise resources, establish the name, and sell the product, and for industry to assess the situation, finalise the decision, plan the operation and begin work in the new location.</PARA>
<PARA> In circumstances, as can be seen from the following information, the Board has achieved a remarkable response to its efforts and it can be expected that it will go from strength to strength.</PARA>
<PARA> During 1980-81, the Board has been instrumental in bringing the discussions with Natsemi to the stage where that company sent three of its senior technical personnel to Australia to collate information on which to conduct a feasibility study.</PARA>
<PARA> Duntech International opened here, from United States of America, in 1981 as a consequence of the Board's efforts.</PARA>
<PARA> Techway, an Australian high technology company, has announced publicly that it is negotiating through the Board to establish in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian office of the European Economic Community was established in Canberra in 1981, largely through the efforts of the Board-in fact, if it had not been for the Board, those offices would not yet be in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> A furniture assembly plant will soon begin operations in Canberra following considerable assistance from the Board.</PARA>
<PARA> The Board has devoted a lot of resources to the development of projects to attract visitors to Canberra. Apart from the proposed international hotel/ convention centre, the Board is developing some very exciting proposals which will become public knowledge in the near future, and when constructed will provide both entertainment for the Canberra population and a significant boost to the visitor industry.</PARA>
<PARA> National Associations are now establishing in Canberra at the rate of one per month and the Board has provided assistance to many of these.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the European mission, representatives of three large Italian groups, one major French group of companies and a German company have already visited Canberra, and the discussions indicate that there is a very high chance that facilities will be established here.</PARA>
<PARA> Discussions are continuing for potential joint ventures between six Australian companies and three overseas companies to form three new companies in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Statistics showing the number of jobs created by the Board are not available. The Board does not have the resources to collect and update such information.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Board was established following the clear recommendation of the Committee of 22 (now CARD) representing a large segment of the Canberra community and the decision was widely welcomed throughout Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Board has clearly attracted serious interest in Canberra from so many major companies, and in particular, has brought the Natsemi proposal so far so quickly, justifies its establishment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Board has achieved more than any other group of its size and resources, and it's already significant achievements will continue despite the activities of its critics and opponents both inside and outside Canberra.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr Sinclair</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) STD calls to some destinations are currently experiencing abnormally high failure rates due to congestion especially during the evening STD concessional periods. Failures on local calls in the Brisbane telephone network, due to both congestion and plant defects, are within Telecom Australia's objective of no more than 2.5 per cent of call attempts.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) On local calls the acceptable failure rate due to congestion only is 1 per cent. On STD calls Telecom Australia's objective is that no more than 2 per cent of call attempts during the STD full tariff period be unsuccessful due to congestion. The objectives during the STD concessional tariff periods are that no more than 7 per cent and 10 per cent of call attempts be unsuccessful due to congestion in the measurement periods of 6 p.m.-9 p.m. and 9 p.m.-10 p.m. respectively. These latter objectives recognise the need for economic provisioning of trunk circuits and exchange switching equipment, in ensuring that the system is not dimensioned solely for a relatively short evening traffic peak which incurs cheaper rates.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In September 1980, service quality at the Thornlands exchange as measured by artificially generated STD calls recorded 16.9 per cent congestion. This high figure reflected a fault condition rather than the standard of performance of the Thornlands exchange.</PARA>
<PARA> Existing call failures in the telephone network are mainly due to circuit underprovisioning on some STD traffic routes. Shortfalls have arisen in some parts of the network due to the traffic stimulus that has been generated by the cheaper call charges after 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. creating differing traffic dispersions from those which prevailed during the day time busy periods.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes-A modern mobile radio service was established in Melbourne in September 1981; to be followed by Sydney in December 1981. Provision of these mobile services is a long term project extending over several years. Planning is now in hand for the provision of similar types of services for the other capital cities .</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Telecom Australia is giving high priority to the provision of relief on the congested traffic routes in the network, and this action is not prejudiced by the progressive implementation of new facilities like the mobile radio service.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The petroleum and mineral exploration industries have acknowledged the importance of the Bureau of Mineral Resources' (BMR) role in providing the basic scientific framework in which private exploration efforts are undertaken. However, it is not generally possible to attribute specific mineral discoveries to basic geological work published by the Bureau.</PARA>
<PARA> The link between BMR's geophysical surveys and discoveries of particular mineral deposits is sometimes more specific. BMR's magnetic, radiometric, and gravity surveys, and subsequent publication of maps, have resulted in some of the indicated anomalies being drilled and deposits outlined by private enterprise. Examples include the Savage River (Tasmania) iron ore deposits, the Galilee Basin (Queensland) coal deposits, Olympic Dam (Roxby Downs, South Australia) copper-uranium-gold deposit, the Nabarlek and Ranger (Northern Territory) uranium deposits, the Yeelirrie (Western Australia) uranium deposits, and the Agnew-Mount Keith (Western Australia) nickel deposits. In 1968, BMR identified, by a marine seismic survey, most of the petroleum structural trends on the North West Shelf and the Exmouth Plateau, subsequently tested by private companies and, in the case of the North West Shelf, now in the process of development. A large number of Australia's petroleum discoveries were also assisted through subsidies paid under the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act which operated from 1957 to 1974. The BMR was responsible for examining and recommending applications for subsidy under the Act and for oversight of subsidised operations.</PARA>
<PARA> Major mineral and petroleum discoveries are shown in the table below together with estimates of reserves prior to commencement of production. No 'category (D) -BMR provided other assistance' has been shown on the table because the use of basic information provided by BMR would be a factor, directly or indirectly, in most Australian discoveries of minerals and petroleum. The value of the petroleum and mineral deposits, in the discovery of which BMR has had some involvement, is difficult to quantify, and depends on factors such as location, grade, size of orebody or reservoir, production and initial treatment costs, world metal and fuel prices, and the world political and economic situation. However, with the 1980 production of minerals and petroleum alone valued at 7.5 billion dollars, the overall value of such discoveries can conservatively be placed at several billion dollars.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr Street</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The reference is to a reprinting of a document first published by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in February 1979 (INFCE/SEC/11) for the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation which stated that as of the date of the document's preparation the IAEA had had no actual experience in safeguarding uranium enrichment plants because such facilities had only just begun to come under IAEA safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The article further stated that the IAEA had defined in detail a safeguards strategy applicable to all types of enrichment plants. Most of the study effort to that time had centred on centrifuge facilities of the type the IAEA was immediately faced with safeguarding.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Since the entry into force in 1970 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the progressively wider acceptance of that Treaty, international efforts to develop IAEA safeguards have largely been focused on IAEA document INFCIRC/153 (Corrected), which elaborates the system of IAEA safeguards to be applied in non-nuclear-weapon states which are party to the NPT . Safeguards agreements of the INFCIRC/66/Rev.2 type apply only to States which are not parties to the NPT. It has not been found necessary to include special safeguards procedures for enrichment plants in INFCIRC/66/Rev.2 because there is no enrichment plant at present subject to safeguards under an agreement of the INFCIRC/66/Rev.2 type.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The IAEA conducts inspections of the enrichment plants subject to its safeguards. The IAEA has for some time been giving detailed consideration to the question of further developing procedures for safeguarding uranium enrichment plants and has held a number of meetings on this subject. The IAEA is also currently participating in a six-party study of the safeguarding of enrichment plants of the centrifuge type. As noted in the article referred to, IAEA safeguards are not static, but are continuously evolving.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Government is participating actively in the ongoing consideration of developing procedures for safeguarding uranium enrichment plants by the IAEA and is participating in the six-party study of the safe- guarding of enrichment plants of the centrifuge type referred to in (2). Australia also has a program to assist the nuclear safeguards capability of the IAEA which lays emphasis on the development of safeguards techniques and instrumentation for uranium enrichment plants.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) In accordance with the Government's nuclear safeguards policy, Australian uranium exported under new contracts must be subject to a nuclear safeguards agreement between Australia and the importing country. Each of Australia's nuclear safeguards agreements incorporates a treaty commitment by the government of the recipient country not to use nuclear material subject to the agreement for nuclear weapons, nuclear explosive devices or other military purposes. Each agreement also provides for nuclear material subject to the agreement to be covered by IAEA safeguards in accordance with the recipient country's safeguards agreement with the IAEA. Verification that Australian origin nuclear material may not be diverted to non-peaceful or explosive purposes is carried out under the arrangements set out in these agreements.</PARA>

<PARA> Corporate income tax payable by overseas-owned companies is not distinguished from that payable by Australian companies in the income tax statistics, except that separate statistics of non-resident companies are tabulated. As resident companies include subsidiaries of overseas companies the statistics do not cover all overseas-owned companies. Income tax payable by non-resident companies for the 1978-79 income year (the latest for which statistics are available) was $ 472m and that for resident companies was $2,961m. Also it is thought that the greater part of withholding tax collected from dividends and interest, which totalled $161m in 1980-81, was payable in respect of dividends and interest paid to overseas company investors.</PARA>

These grants to the States comprised $150,000 for each financial year from 1970-71 until 1979 -80. In 1980-81 this grant was increased to $153,000 to include an amount payable to the Northern Territory. The grants to be payable in the present financial year will also be $153,000.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member will be aware that untied revenue to the States has increased substantially under taxation sharing arrangements and that the States can devote part of such resources to road safety.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (a) Some overseas countries have taken steps to promote re-refining, notably New Zealand, South Africa, West Germany and Italy. I understand the United States of America is also seeking to encourage re-refining.

<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes, provided sufficient volumes of suitable feedstock can be collected to make re-refining economically viable. It should be noted, however, that blending of waste oil with fuel oil for burning as an industrial fuel also reduces our dependence on imported oil.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) I am advised that some oil companies are offering a higher price for waste oil delivered to their refineries than the re-refiner operating in Sydney is prepared to pay. One of the consequences of this is that a larger volume of waste oil from a wider geographic area is now being collected, and waste oil that might otherwise become an environmental hazard is being recovered .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I understand so.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Used lubricating oil, as well as being blended with fuel oil and burnt, in which case the full energy value of the oil is recovered, is also used for other purposes such as a wood preservative, as a weed-killer, and for laying dust on country roads.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. It should be noted, however, that blending of waste oil with fuel oil for burning as an industrial fuel also reduces our dependence on imported oil.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) By way of example, measures taken in the following countries are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) United States of America-The United States Department of Energy is seeking to encourage re-refining to conserve energy and lubricating oil, and to reduce degradation of the environment. Heavy emphasis is placed on re-refining but not to the exclusion of processing for use as a fuel or other acceptable uses such as in asphalt.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Japan-Present annual consumption of lubricating oil is 2000 megalitres of which 500 megalitres is recovered. Of this 95 per cent is blended with fuel oil for burning while the balance is re-refined by the acid clay process. The Environmental Control Service Corporation assists industries in the disposal of all wastes by low interest loans covering up to 30 per cent of the cost of construction of waste disposal and treatment facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) New Zealand-It is Government policy to encourage the re-refining of waste lubricating oil. A subsidy, believed to be 2.5 cents per litre, is paid on used oil collected and delivered to re-refiners. Re-refined oil is exempt from the 20 per cent sales tax that is levied on virgin lubricating oils.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) EEC-The EEC Council adopted a directive on 16 June 1975 relating to disposal of waste oil by a compulsory collection system. The emphasis is on collection as an environmental measure but, with the exception of Italy, I am not aware of any special emphasis on re-refining. In Italy a Bill has been introduced requiring that waste oil be re-refined. Taxes on re-refined oil are one third of those on virgin oil but it is intended that the differential tax system will eventually be eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) South Africa-I understand that in South Africa regulations prohibit the use and disposal of waste oil other than by delivery to a re-refiner. The regulations cover metropolitan and urban areas only. All lubricant sellers are obliged to receive waste oil from the public. Waste oil collection is handled entirely by private operators within the framework of the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The premise on which this part of the question is based is incorrect. Large oil companies do not own waste oil unless they buy it from waste oil collectors. New oil is sold to consumers as a normal part of the oil industry's operations but the industry has no control over what happens to it once they have sold it.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) I have no such evidence.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Prices paid by major oil companies to collectors for waste oil are determined by commercial negotiation between the oil company and the waste oil collector. I am not privy to these negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) I am aware that major oil companies in Sydney have recently increased the price they are prepared to pay to collectors for waste oil. I am advised that this is to encourage the collectors to sell the waste oil to the oil companies in preference to other purchasers, including enterprises which use it as a direct substitute for fuel oil. The oil companies at present blend the waste oil with fuel oil controlled quantities to prevent environmental problems. A viable re-refining industry requires substantial volumes of feedstock. Thus a potential re-refiner must be prepared to pay the market price of the waste oil's alternative use, i.e. burning as a fuel. I know of no justification for the suggested investigation.</PARA>

<PARA> (b) While private capital inflow (net) contributes to the growth of the domestic money supply, it does so only as one component of the private sector's foreign exchange transactions (PSFET); moreover, private capital inflow is not independent of other components of PSFET and hence could not be considered an independent source of changes in the domestic money supply any more than could, say, export receipts from the sale of wheat or (on the debit side) import payments for the purchase of motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget documents indicated an expectation that the contribution of the external transactions of the private sector to money supply growth during 1981- 82 might be of a similar order of magnitude to the $2802m recorded in 1980-81.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. There are currently 292 vessels eligible to operate in the Declared Management Zone (DMZ) of the northern prawn fishery which includes the Gulf of Carpentaria. Full details of the share holdings of all companies operating in this fishery are not available, however, information available to my department indicates that three companies, which are entitled to operate a total of 63 vessels in the fishery, have significant foreign ownership. In addition, approximately 100 vessels are operated by individual persons or private companies.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Since 1977, 10 vessels have been built under the Ship-building Bounty Scheme for operation in the DMZ by the three companies having significant foreign ownership. Of these, eight are replacement vessels (three being replacements for vessels lost in Cyclone Tracy) and two were constructed to complete obligations under a joint venture arrangement entered into prior to 1977. Original operators in the fishery paid no premium on licences and market prices for licences have varied widely in recent years. The extent to which Government assistance, such as the ship-building bounty and investment allowance , offsets the costs of licences and other expenses incurred in operating in the Gulf of Carpentaria cannot be readily determined.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) To my knowledge Queensland officials have not made such a statement and I believe it is not appropriate to compare prawning in the DMZ with mining. Although banana prawns in the Gulf of Carpentaria have been fully exploited since the early 1970's research has shown that environmental conditions during recruitment to the fishery are the major determinant of their abundance. Catches of other species in the DMZ have increased steadily since 1970-71, however, research to assess the status of these resources is not yet complete.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Details of individual sales of prawns to Japanese commercial interests are not available and I am therefore unable to comment on the statements concerning disposal of the 1980 banana prawn catch. Should firm information concerning practices of this nature become available I shall ensure that it is investigated by the appropriate authorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In 1980-81 the co-operative housing societies of New South Wales approved housing loans totalling $103,753,000, compared to loans totalling $2,820,831,000 approved to individuals in New South Wales by all significant lenders. While banks and permanent building societies are the major sources of housing finance, providing $2,224,187,000 in 1980-81, the co-operative housing societies in New South Wales have traditionally directed lending to home seekers in the lower income brackets.</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1956, co-operative housing societies of New South Wales have been the principal agents of the home purchase assistance program. To date some $692m in Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement funds have been channelled through co- operative housing societies for on-lending to low income earners. Societies received $59.6m from this source in 1980-81 and were able to approve 1753 loans, approximately 2 per cent of all housing loans approved in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> Home purchase assistance program loans made by co-operative housing societies of New South Wales are regulated on the basis of means tests with the objective of providing assistance to those most in need. For applicants to be eligible, they should not be able to obtain finance in the open market or from other sources. Available funds are allocated on the basis of the Loan Request List which was introduced in June 1978. This list includes all applicants and ensures that assistance to those with an immediate need is first priority. Classification of applicants takes account of each family's circumstances including income, dependants and net assets. The specific need test adopted is a matter for the State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Traditionally, co-operative housing societies in New South Wales have relied on a mixture of government and private funds. The main sources of funds in 1980-81 were:</PARA>
<PARA>$ Government funds</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement  59,610,000 Guaranteed private funds</PARA>
<PARA> Banks  8,120,000  Insurance companies  100,000  Other lenders  6,000,000 Non- guaranteed funds  37,018,000</PARA>
<PARA>110,848,000</PARA>
<PARA> Private savings banks provided $2,500,000 of the total of $110,848,000 available in 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In recent years contributions by the traditional institutional lenders such as private savings banks have decreased.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is a matter for the private banks to determine their own investment decisions within the prevailing economic circumstances.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because HIFAR was not to be located in or close to a major fault zone, resistance to earthquake damage was not a specific requirement in its original design. However, the conservative design of the reactor and containment building provides inherent protection against earthquakes.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to give a specific level on the Richter Scale which the reactor and buildings are capable of withstanding as this is dependent on the location of the earthquake, the propagation path between it and the reactor and the geological conditions at the site of the reactor.</PARA>
<PARA> The seismic safety of the reactor was reviewed in 1972, and calculations showed that the containment building could withstand predicted seismic activity in the region of the Sydney Basin.</PARA>
<PARA> As the data, knowledge and techniques used in such reviews are continually evolving, they are normally updated at intervals. Accordingly, in May 1980 the Commission requested the Department of Housing and Construction to independently review the seismic risk at Lucas Heights. This study is still in progress.</PARA>

It would have been hazardous for personnel to have attempted to retrieve the booms during the prevailing weather conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In rough seas, oil spillage is generally dissipated by wave and wind action . Equipment presently held by the National Plan is designed to be most effective during moderate weather conditions. Developments currently taking place overseas in equipment technology are being closely monitored. Should suitable equipment become available for use during adverse weather conditions, then its procurement will be considered.</PARA>

<PARA> The Heads of State and Governments concerned about terrorism and the taking of hostages declare that their Governments will intensify their joint efforts to combat international terrorism. To this end in cases where a country refuses extradition or prosecution of those who have hijacked an aircraft and/or do not return such aircraft, the Heads of State and Governments shall take immediate action to cease all flights to that country. At the same time, their Governments will initiate action to halt all incoming flights from that country, or from any country by the airlines of the country concerned.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) Information in respect of all matters referred to in the honourable member's question is not readily available.

<PARA> When the Commonwealth acquires title to land by voluntary transfer it acquires the mineral rights if the vendor owns them and if the instrument of transfer so provides.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question is phrased in general terms but I understand that it relates to comment made by Mr Chatterton, MLC, South Australia, following a visit he made to certain North African and European countries, and in particular to Algeria. Mr Chatterton asserted that during his visit he was subject to surveillance by the Department of Foreign Affairs and that reports on his visit were sent to his political opponents.</PARA>
<PARA> These allegations are not true. What is true, and what appears to be a source of concern to Mr Chatterton, is that advice was passed to the South Australian authorities of a planned visit by Mr Chatterton to an agricultural development project in Algeria for which the South Australian Government has contracted to provide expertise. While it is the case, as Mr Chatterton has stated, that it is for the Algerians rather than the South Australians to say who visits the project, I do not regard it as improper that a State government should be advised of planned visits to what we in Australia would regard as a State project. There was no request by Mr Chatterton that his visit be concealed from the State authorities responsible for the project.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Porta Printer, like many other devices available for use by the disabled, is but one of a wide range of products approved by Telecom for connection to the network and marketed by private enterprise. In the case of the Porta Printer, Telecom is acting as a distributor for the importer-Intercept Communications Pty Ltd-to make it easier for deaf people throughout Australia to obtain and utilise this new product.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has advised me that it has given consideration to the suggestion of making the Porta Printer available on a rental basis but regrets it is not in a position to include in its range of customer facilities special equipment of this type, for which at this stage there is a fairly limited demand.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is understood that the sale price of a Porta Printer Plus is $996 to Government Departments and Commercial Organisations, and $846 if sold to disabled persons and their respective institutions.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) during the period 1976-1981, 5,569 annual surveys or routine inspections were conducted by radio surveyors of my Department. The figures for each year were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>1976-77  896 1977-78  1,212 1978-79  1,308 1979-80  1,289 1980-81  864</PARA>
<PARA> Separate statistics have not been maintained categorising visits as routine inspections or surveys. However, over the period the ratio would be approximately 10: 1.</PARA>

<PARA> Records of surveys and inspections are only maintained for a sufficient period to ensure that reported deficiencies are resolved. Consequently, I am unable to say how many surveys or inspections were conducted on ships from each of the countries mentioned.</PARA>

<PARA>1980-81  450  (estimate)</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of faults were not disclosed during routine inspections.

<PARA> Equipment deficiencies have been revealed in some ships from all of the nations mentioned, although no particular country's ships have been found to be markedly worse than others in respect of such deficiencies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Amateur fishermen requiring maximum safety radiocommunications carry a radio transceiver capable of transmitting and receiving on at least 2182, 4125 and 6215.5 kilohertz. Such equipment enables around the clock communication over substantial distances via Coast Radio Stations of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. Though permitted, it is considered that carriage of either or both 27 megahertz inshore boating radio service or citizens band radio service equipment, provides a more restricted measure of safety.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department's technical specifications pertaining to equipment used by small craft vary according to the frequency bands for which the apparatus is designed. The specification for the inshore boating radio service is not compatible with the requirements of the citizens band radio service. Consequently manufacturers do not produce equipment capable of such multi-purpose operation.</PARA>
<PARA> It is considered essential, in order to ensure orderly operations of the various radiocommunication services, that equipment is not authorised which would enable licensees of one radio service to participate in another service as distinct from the service in which they are authorised to operate.</PARA>

<PARA> * The asterisk signifies those persons on the Committee who are also members of the Scientific Sub-committee.</PARA>
<PARA> The first part of the question implies a wider role for the Committee than it actually possesses. The terms of reference call upon the Committee to assess whether new biological hazards are likely to be associated with the application of recombinant DNA technology and to see that this new technology is used only under safe conditions. No other form of biomedical manipulation or biotechnological process is to be monitored by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Members were chosen because of their technical expertise relevant to the terms of reference of the Committee. Except for the nominees of the three Commonwealth departments, members were not chosen as representatives of particular groups or organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee includes scientists some of whom have particular knowledge of recombinant DNA technology and others who are expert in fields relevant to the safety of the technology. The businessmen on the Committee are able to advise on existing manufacturing practices and on the practicality of the industrial guidelines now being developed. The social scientist on the Committee is familiar with the issues surrounding this technology including such aspects as risk assessment.</PARA>
<PARA> The representative of the Department of Health will be concerned with any public health implications. He will be able to draw upon the expertise of his Department as the need arises. The representatives of the Departments of Primary Industry and of Science and Technology have similar roles and capacities in their areas of concern. Thus the Committee draws on a wide range of expertise.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Similar committees overseas vary considerably in both their terms of reference and membership. Many do have representatives drawn from the 'broader community'. Such committees were set up at a time of considerably greater speculation as to future hazards.</PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate to note that in the eight or so years since this technique was first developed no novel hazard has been shown to be associated with the technique. This is despite an extensive series of experiments, conducted primarily by the National Institute of Health in the United States, which tried to produce the hazards postulated.</PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference of the Australian Committee relate primarily to the physical and biological safety of the technology, both in research and industrial usage, and the composition of the Committee is well balanced and capable of monitoring the safety of this technology in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) Yes, Mr Justice Kirby sent me a copy of a speech in which he made comments to that effect. The application of these techniques to humans may well raise significant moral and ethical questions in the future. Resolution of such questions lies outside the terms of reference of the Recombinant DNA Monitoring Committee. I believe there will have to be general discussion of such matters by the community at large before a consensus view is reached. However, I am sure the Committee members will be sensitive to such issues and bring them to my attention, contribute to that discussion, and provide advice on scientific aspects when required.</PARA>
<PARA> I find Justice Kirby's comments valuable and will take them into account when making future appointments to the Committee.</PARA>
