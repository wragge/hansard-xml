<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Prime Minister recall his 1975 election promise in which he said: 'We will reduce the tax burden'? He repeated this in 1977 when he said: ' The Government would bring taxes down further-not increase them'. Is it a fact that since 1975-76 the total tax payments by wage and salary earners have risen by almost 150 per cent while wages and salaries have risen by only two-thirds as much? In view of the Prime Minister's repeated promises to cut taxes, when can the great bulk of Australian men and women expect relief from the extra $1,500m in income taxes which they have had to pay this year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last several years we have paid off the Australian Labor Party's deficit, firstly by expenditure restraint in all of our Budgets. We have exhibited greater expenditure restraint than most other governments, not just governments in Australia, and certainly much greater expenditure restraint than was exhibited between 1972 and 1975. There was none then. We have paid off that deficit by expenditure restraint and also by an approach to taxation which people understand means that as a country we have to pay our way as we go. It is also worth noting that if we were taking as much out of each dollar as Labor did we would be spending $3.7 billion more this year. We are taking 2 1/2c less out of each dollar that people produce. In the financial year 1980-81 the real household disposable income of Australian families increased by $2.9 billion after tax. On top of that of course there have been very substantial wage claims , in addition to the reduction in hours which has occurred as a result of settlements over the last six to 10 months.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I would like to report in some detail on my visits to New South Wales last week and this week with respect to the Lowe by-election, but rather than go into detail can I simply say that I am impressed by the public response to matters being put to the public during the Lowe by-election campaign, particularly matters relating to the Wran Labor Government. I have the fortune to be the Minister for the Capital Territory which in geographical terms is an island surrounded by New South Wales. The two matters raised by the honourable member, that is, daylight saving and electricity rationing, are matters which concern one quarter of a million Australians who live in the national capital. Last year, as a result of a motion passed in the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, I wrote to the New South Wales Government seeking its views with respect to a possible extension of daylight saving. The New South Wales Government, giving very little weight to the views of the quarter of a million Australians who live in Canberra , rejected out of hand the proposal which I put on behalf of the elected representatives of Canberra. I heard nothing further until February of this year when Mr Greg Turnbull of the Sydney Morning Herald informed me that the Wran Government in New South Wales had unilaterally determined that daylight saving was to be extended. I believe that as Minister for the Capital Territory I am entitled to place on record my utter abhorrence of the way in which this decision was implemented by the New South Wales Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since 1977 Australia has had a firm and consistent policy regarding the import price of crude oil. That policy has been to adjust the price according to the price of Saudi light crude oil. That adjustment takes place every six months, on 1 January and 1 July. In making the adjustment we take into account also any freight differentials, and exchange variations that might occur . The price of Saudi oil is based on the United States dollar. Therefore, changes in the relationship between the Australian dollar and the United States dollar are taken into account. In most cases the price of imported crude oil has gone up in line with the price of Saudi oil, but a precedent was set in 1978 when the price actually came down as a result of exchange variations and other factors such as I have mentioned. In that case, the price was reduced from $13 to about $12.65 a barrel. To forecast what the changes on 1 July will be is very difficult. There will be changes because of the factors that I have mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have said before and I will say again that we do not propose to be stampeded into making a decision.

Insofar as the issue is concerned-namely, salaries-the Teachers Federation is well aware that the Public Service Board will make an offer, and that offer will be backdated, I think to a date in last week, as soon as the tribunals in the eastern States have completed their reviews of teachers' salaries in those States. So the action that is being taken now and is disrupting Australian Capital Territory schools and causing great concern to parents-and to students, I might add-is irresponsible and uncalled for. The Public Service Board, on behalf of the Government, has indicated to the Teachers Federation that we will cease collecting union fees and that the practice that has prevailed in the past will not be restored at the end of the dispute.</PARA>

There had been an adjournment to enable the parties to try to find the basis for some agreed facts upon which the case would proceed. I particularly welcome the hearing today because I have noticed that the ACTU seems to be trying to justify its claim by engaging in a great deal of media activity.

It is a fact that, on the basis of what the President of the ACTU has said publicly and outside the Commission, however the claim is framed it would result, if granted, in significant increases in wages throughout Australia. I point out that not only is there the claim for what is called a community catch-up to be based on a community wage standard but also there is a claim for a return to automatic indexation and that in particular the automatic adjustment for cost of living increases should include an adjustment for movements in the six capital consumer price indices for the quarter ending December 1981.

We believe that the capacity of the economy is not sufficient to bear any significant or general wage increases over and above those which have been granted on the industry by industry approach.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports that Indonesia is requiring those companies which have contracts with the Indonesian Government to also arrange exports of a quantity of Indonesian non-oil products. The requirement is that any contract worth over $700,000 will have to be associated with other exports. I am having my Department watch the situation closely to see what the implications might be for Australian trade. I am told that most of Australia's trade is in relatively small items. It is believed that the policy will not have any immediate consequence for Australia. Certainly I think that any aid programs will be exempt from the provisions of that requirement that Indonesia is putting on the Government contracts. At this stage it is a bit early to be able to define just what the consequences will be for Australian trade but I hope such a requirement will not have any consequence at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first two parts of the question is yes. I would like to make the point that the advice was economic advice. It is obvious from the report in the newspaper that having said what the Department thought was proper economic advice it went on to outline a variety of options which could be examined. I emphasise the words 'economic advice' because there are obviously social objectives, objectives for Australian families, which are not entirely economic. The honourable gentlemen has recognised that in his question. I do not think it is helpful when reports of this kind are published. But I want to make the point that I expect my Department and indeed all departments to give the advice that they believe to be right and if that happens to be something which they think Ministers may not want to hear or to accept, so be it. Ministers and governments have to make up their mind on the basis of advice and I am very grateful that my Department never fails to speak its mind on whatever issue I ask questions of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

The interpretation of the restraints that are imposed as a result of any extensive coverage is a matter for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, to whose attention I will draw the honourable member's question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, a look at the 'Finance and Business' page of one of Australia's major daily newspapers this morning tells the story. Let me quote some of the headlines. Here is one: 'Fraser's gloomy picture indicates depreciation will go unchecked'. That headline refers to the value of the Australian dollar and it leads to another headline, relating to the relationship between the Australian dollar and the United States dollar, which reads: 'returns to the level of 1976'. Here is another headline: 'Interest crashes through 20 pc-new highs feared'. Why the fuss about Neville Wran's 18 per cent when we see in the Sydney Morning Herald 'Finance and Business' page headlines such as 'Interest crashes through 20 pc-new highs feared'? Another headline reads: 'The patient: take as prescribed'. The story reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government is facing a balance of current account deficit of about $8,500m this financial year according to its major economic departments.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, on the same page of the same newspaper this morning there is this headline: 'Unemployment to rise-bank' with the story underneath stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The National Bank has painted a bleak picture for unemployment in 1982 in its latest monthly summary. </PARA>
<PARA>Referring to a greater incidence of industrial disputation and an acceleration in wages growth-to an enormous extent both are the result of Government policies , or a lack of them-the article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Together these developments suggest that the year ahead will be a difficult one . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, I have not yet referred to the headline covering the relative collapse in the share market. But what I have read, I repeat, from one page of one of today's newspapers, is sufficient to show that my language in this discussion of a matter of public importance in this House is temperate. Is it any wonder that there is a deterioration, indeed a grave deterioration, in business confidence? This fickle thing called confidence is enormously important . It governs to a great extent the level of investment in jobs. To be responsible for a reduction in confidence, as this Government is so responsible, is a serious matter of public importance. It involves the livelihood of thousands of people and their standard of living; indeed, the standard of living of thousands in addition to those who are unemployed because of insufficient investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Business confidence is inextricably linked with consumer sentiment. Out today is the Roy Morgan Research Centre's index of consumer sentiment for the month of January 1982, prepared in association with the University of Melbourne's Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research. I am told that that document shows that consumer sentiment fell by between five and six points from November last year to January this year. I understand that the result is by far the lowest January result ever measured-nearly 17 points below the average index result for January since the survey commenced. January is a month which is known for its comparative optimism. In previous surveys that the Roy Morgan Research Centre and others have done around the community they have found that optimism is great in January. </PARA>
<PARA> A firm interpretation of this document is that consumers are comparatively at their most depressed level for the over nine years since this survey got under way. Why is this so? Honourable members need not take my word for it. The objective assessment of the surveyors, Roy Morgan and the Institute of Applied Economics, is that the unseasonable gloom is understandable in the light of increasing and new taxes, together, of course, with a cancellation of promised tax cuts, which is just another of the messages of yesterday's 'great' statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Of course, it is also due to a quickening of the rate of inflation and is no doubt the result of record levels of interest rates, particularly for home purchases, and of the devastatingly high rate of unemployment. All of these grave factors are the result of inept Fraser Government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I will give in greater detail some of the indicators of our level of business activity, that is, the low level of which I am complaining. According to the index of business sentiment of the Australian stock exchange's all ordinaries index, at 31 December 1980 the level was 713.5. At 31 December 1981, after six years of this Fraser Government which was to lead us back to economic recovery, it was down to 595.5, a fall of 16.5 per cent. Yesterday, 9 March, the figure was down to 463.6, a further fall of 22.1 per cent over the nine and a half weeks of 1982 and, of course, a fall of 35 per cent since the beginning of 1981. What does this mean? It means that investors have wiped off more than one-third of the valuation of the Australian corporate sector-and more than a half of this collapse has occurred in the past two months. That is just one indication. If we look at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd index of factory production, the situation, in one word, is languishing. According to its figures , in December 1981 the production index was 113 and in June 1981 it was 112. That represents virtually no growth for the first half of 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the same story with retail sales. As at January 1982, in seasonally adjusted terms they had grown only 0.2 per cent from the December 1981 figure. That represents an annual rate of growth of 2 1/2 per cent compared with inflation of 11.3 per cent. What is the conclusion we can draw from that indicator? Of course, it is that retail sales, as is the case with production and as we heard in the story from the Australian stock exchange all ordinaries index, are now stagnant. The story could be told in this Parliament; I have the details to do so but unfortunately too little time in which to give them. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an 8.8 per cent fall in building approvals in the private sector . Production statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics tell the same story as did those of the ANZ Bank series. I wish to quote from a recent information booklet from the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia which has hit the desks of all honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> To give but one example, the following statement appears:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is an appalling lack of real effort being made to ensure that the inequities suffered by small business . . . are removed. </PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, the Metal Trades Industry Association, in its pre-Budget submission, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the relatively high value of the Australian dollar remains a major factor in Australia's poor trading performance, the year ended June 1981 being the first annual trade deficit Australia has experienced since 1968. </PARA>
<PARA>The Association is putting the blame where it is due, of course-with the managers of this economy, one of whom, the Minister for Industry and Commerce ( Sir Phillip Lynch), is presently at the table ready to answer for the Government in this debate. I believe that he will not be able to provide a credible answer to the facts that I have related. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child), who is to follow me from this side , will be illustrating the deterioration that has occurred in business confidence by drawing attention to the plight of small business, by citing bankruptcy statistics, and by saying something about the problems of the housing and motor vehicle manufacturing industries, with which she is familiar. Therefore, if I do not mention them further it is because their case is in competent hands. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the sad facts that I have given fly in the face of the rhetoric with which we have been pounded by the present Prime Minister at elections in 1975, 1977 and 1980. I propose to quote only one or two of the promises that were made then. I have many examples before me. In relation to taxes, this sort of promise was made in 1975:</PARA>
<PARA> We will no longer be able to rely on the secret tax increase of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1977 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has brought the largest and fairest tax reforms ever made. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1980 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have fulfilled our commitments to reform the tax scales. </PARA>
<PARA>We heard a similar story in relation to small business. In 1975 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Small businesses and private companies in particular are in a desperate state. We will change the tax rules which operate against them. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1977 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian people will not accept a return to high taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1980 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The tax laws will be altered to make it easier for small business to build up their reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>That is mere rhetoric. These things have not happened. The promises have not been fulfilled, and after six years of this Government we are in a worse mess than we were in when it took over. I have cited just some of the misleading promises that were made. Let us examine again the performance which has led to this deterioration in business and consumer confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation is back into double figures and is running ahead of the average for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. One major cause and effect of this inflation is, of course, spiralling rates of interest. Rates will continue to rise unless we in Australia change our approach to economic management. With higher inflation and interest rates, there is inevitably a fall in demand and a rise in the level of unemployment. The rate of job creation in Australia has now fallen well below the rate of growth of work force numbers. The labour market has deteriorated over the last 12 months, and that trend is continuing. </PARA>
<PARA> It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to be so gloomy, but when we fail to face facts squarely and recognise that the Fraser Government's policies have been a woeful failure, we merely postpone the day for changing those policies. It is only when we face the facts squarely that they will be changed. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday's Prime Ministerial so-called speech to the nation was an example of how vulnerable we are to deception. The theme of the speech was: 'These are tough times internationally, but you can trust us. We are not to blame. We are responsible economic managers. More blood, sweat and tears will get us through. Batten down the hatches. Stay with our hard-line monetarist policies and we shall pull through these times together.'</PARA>
<PARA> To use a colloquialism, that is just balderdash. It is a deception. We must not be vulnerable to that sort of talk, particularly from a prime minister in a parliament. Yes, we know that the international climate is not healthy. No one denies that, least of all those on this side, but it is all the more reason why we should not pursue the stagnation-creating policies of the past six years. We do not want any more of the stop-go recipes for disaster of the monetarist marketeers-the sorts of policies that we have had in recent years. We want no more threats that inflationary wage demands will be met by squeezing credit and thus generating even higher interest rates. It is just not a viable economic policy. As soon as the economy gets going, what happens? This Government puts another clamp on it. I am not talking about an industrial relations policy; it is the Fraser Government's instinctively confrontationist formula for industrial war instead of achieving peace. </PARA>
<PARA> We need instead a prices and incomes policy. Only Labor can negotiate this. We need what can follow from such an anti-inflationary strategy-a more expansionary budgetary policy creating greater demand leading to more production and to more jobs-and an easing of the monetary restraints in place at this time. I refer to the credit squeeze to which I drew attention in Question Time today. We would not let these restraints go altogether but would ease them so that interest rates would come back down through the roof. They have gone right through the roof as a result of the disastrous policies of Labor's political opponents. </PARA>
<PARA> Speeches such as the one we had to endure yesterday from the Prime Minister are the last things this country wants. We can see the international realities; we do not have to be told again about them. We want policies which will promote investment, production and employment-policies which will restore higher living standards to this country. In short, we desperately need a change of government. While we have this present collective leadership-I do not blame just the Prime Minister; the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) is equally culpable and to blame for the ideology which is permeating this Government and the wrong policies which follow from that ideology-the same wrong ideology will prevail. Instead of new hope it will mean more pessimism, more deterioration of confidence. I can illustrate that deterioration of confidence by reading from Australian Business magazine, which suggests that liquidators are saying that other Associated Securities Limited types of crashes will occur in the near future. That grave expectation follows the present Government's monetarist policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I have indicated that the Labor Party, when it gets the chance following 1982, after six years of disappointment, will pursue different economic policies for this country. I have given some indication of the way we will go with our more expansionary policies built on a prices and incomes policy. We intend to proceed in that way. That is in marked contrast to the failed policies of the Fraser Government which have lead to the sad deterioration in confidence and performance of recent months and years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It ill becomes the Opposition to raise this matter of public importance today because the Australian Labor Party, as would be well known throughout the community, is anti-business in its philosophy and anti-business in the development of those policies which directly reflect that philosophy. Let us be under no misapprehension as to what the real issues are. The Australian Labor Party is committed to socialism and not to free enterprise; the philosophy which sees the 'profit' motive, the very heart of business incentive, as a dirty word. The Australian Labor Party has as its objective the extension of public ownership, not the development of enterprise based on individual initiative and individual incentive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is committed to additional government spending, support for excessive wage increases, a bourgeoning bureaucracy, increases in the Public Service and a reduction in the size of the working week. These are the policies which would so detrimentally impact upon the business community that they would significantly erode the strength of the private sector and prospects for industry and commerce in this country, as was so lamentably manifest in the difficult Labor years of 1972 to 1975. But the Labor Party would go further. It would withdraw significant business incentives-I refer to the investment allowance-which are an essential part of that economic and industrial policy which encourages industry to invest, to grow and to be self-reliant and strong. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the Australian Labor Party and the matter of public importance which has been raised in this House. If any further exemplification is required of the truth which I have identified today, then certainly it must be clear in the policies of the Australian Labor Party Opposition in Victoria. Let me say that those policies are anathema to what this State requires and would not enable Victoria to take advantage of the many opportunities of the 1980s and beyond. The Victorian Labor Opposition, following the same policies which the Federal Opposition pursues directly in this House, would destroy the investment prospects of the most significant manufacturing State in the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The true index of business confidence is the rate of business investment taking place both from domestic and international sources in the Australian economy. This index demonstrates beyond doubt that business has complete confidence in the Fraser Government policies and puts paid to the veracity of the assertions made by the Opposition today. Investment in Australia has shown remarkable growth in the last few years after plummeting in the post-1973 period. Last financial year real business invesment rose 21 per cent to almost 12 per cent of gross domestic product after being around 10 per cent of gross domestic product or less for several years. Investment expectations, on all major surveys, point to further real growth in 1981-82. It has been estimated that real business investment will grow by 15 per cent in 1981-82. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics' survey of business expectations indicates that investment will grow by at least this amount. In current dollar terms, manufacturing investment is expected to increase by 26 per cent in 1981-82 following the growth of 46 per cent during the course of the past year. For the mining sector preliminary ABS data shows that investment in 1981-82 is expected to be 65 per cent up on the result of 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that if there is any real index of confidence by the Australian business and commercial community it is the confidence of manufacturers, large and small, and of businessmen and women prepared to back their business judgments with significant dollar investments of the type that are taking place at present. In the September quarter 1981 the real value of manufacturers' sales rose by 0.6 per cent to be 2.9 per cent above the September quarter 1980. The ABS statistics indicate that output in manufacturing rose over 1981, with good gains recorded in the three months to January 1982. But if we seek, as surely we must in this debate, to place Australia in the international perspective one can, of course, state that among the economies of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries Australia has stood out over the past two years in terms of growth and stability. It is this record of growth and stability, engendered by the Government's economic and industrial policies, that has made Australia an attractive investment prospect for overseas investors . The Foreign Investment Review Board recently reported a 10 per cent increase in proposals put before it in 1980-81 compared with the previous financial year. Private investment capital inflows in 1981 totalled $6,406m, a very substantial increase over the 1979-80 level of $1.840m. </PARA>
<PARA> Confidence is also reflected in the number of business formations now taking place. For example, actual new business registrations in Victoria in 1980-81 were 31,000, an average of around 125 per working day. This is a 6 per cent increase on 1979-80, when 29,000 new businesses were registered compared with 688 business bankruptcies. Furthermore, almost 19,100 new companies were incorporated in Victoria in 1980-81, 30 per cent more than four years ago. Similarly, there were 19,000 new business registrations in Queensland in 1980-81 , which is again an increase of 6 per cent on the previous year. This is, of course, a reflection of Australia's strong economy, a further indication of our fiscal and monetary policies and of Australian business confidence in them. There is no doubt that more Australians are finding it worth while to go into business for themselves and that more are making a success of it. </PARA>
<PARA> These clear signs of confidence demonstrate the success of this Government's economic record, despite the current international economic uncertainty to which I referred in this House yesterday. Since the Fraser Administration came to office in 1975 our consistent objective has been to correct the gross economic distortions of the Labor Government and to re-establish a stable economic environment. The record shows that we have been successful in restoring economic growth in this country. Real gross domestic product rose 3 per cent in 1980-81 and is expected to grow by 3.5 per cent in the current year. Inflation rates have been generally below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average in recent years. Private consumption rose by 3 per cent last financial year and we expect a similar rise in the current year. </PARA>
<PARA> This record is most encouraging but it could not have been achieved without the Government's consistent and disciplined approach to the economic management of Australia. It could not have been achieved if we had not pursued with vigour and determination policies aimed at bearing down directly on inflationary pressures- policies which have involved restraint on government expenditure and on the money supply; policies directed towards the resistance of pressures for excessive wage and salary increases and shorter working hours at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Budgetary programs have concentrated on reducing the growth in government expenditures, which in real terms increased by 21 per cent in 1974-75 and which as a share of GDP reached a peak of over 30 per cent following the Budget brought down by the then Treasurer Hayden. Over the past five years Budget expenditures have risen by only 1 1/4 per cent a year in real terms and as a share of GDP are now less than 28 per cent. These policies entailed the elimination of deficit spending. As a share of GDP the Commonwealth deficit has been reduced from 5 per cent to a very small proportion this year. As a result we have been able to staunch the inflationary creation of money which results from spendthrift government policies. Lower inflation and the knowledge that there is a government firmly committed to combat inflation are the greatest incentive that firms can have in committing the very significant sums necessary to bring about Australia's growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The restoration of an optimistic environment for investment has been one of our prime objectives. Australia continues to attract very strong interest from investors around the world. Australia's continued growth rests squarely on the fact that since 1975 this Government has provided Australia with stability and economic policies based upon a belief in the free enterprise system. We stand for growth and the opportunities and security which non-inflationary growth provides in this country. I believe the way of life that we enjoy in Australia to be the best in the world. It is interesting for me simply to refer in passing to a statement made recently by Emeritus Professor A. H. Pollard writing in the February Australian Economic Trends newsletter. Professor Pollard said:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian families are taking home higher incomes, paying proportionately less tax, and enjoying better health and more overseas travel, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Our policies have helped Australians to build a better life for themselves. This is what our philosophy is all about. The living standards and vibrancy of the life which we take for granted today are the great legacy of the Liberal Party of Australia, a sure guarantee that this philosophy can keep Australia moving in the period ahead. If one had any doubt as to the credentials of what the Opposition is putting forward in this House today, let me say that it is not this Government's policies that concern Australian businessmen and women, but their bitter experience of Labor policy. In government the Labor Party took a series of steps which crippled and demoralised Australian industry. It withdrew the investment allowance and allowed inflationary wage increases to take place. Australian manufacturers lost the capacity to compete internationally. Now those policies are more radical than ever before. They propose a comprehensive range of new taxes and disincentives to industry and investment-unprecedented income tax rates, a wealth tax, a resources rental tax, withdrawal of the investment allowance and specific regulatory action to impede productivity growth. These policies would encourage unions and further price workers directly out of jobs because of support by the Australian Labor Party for excessive wage and salary increases at present. </PARA>
<PARA> Of particular and immediate concern is the fact that these Labor policies are currently being put forward to the people of Victoria. The policies that Labor has announced would destroy business confidence utterly and would bankrupt that State. They would plunder the State's financial reserves and drive investment away because of the very significant influence of the socialist left throughout Victoria. The Labor Party does not have a business blueprint to lead this country effectively into the 1980s and nor do the policies which it pursues and supports have the confidence of the business community. This Government is committed to a vigorous free enterprise economy with incentive for achievement. This commitment and the policies put forward by the Fraser Government have the confidence of the Australian business and commercial community. The Government rejects the matter of public importance which is before the House. </PARA>

Why does the Minister mislead the House? Is it because he cannot win an argument on the facts as they stand? He has strung together a lot of figures but nothing else. That is about all we have ever had from his side of the House. As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) pointed out yesterday in his state of the nation address to the House, the international economic climate is bad. We would all agree that the world economy is worsening and will, in fact, continue to do so. We in Australia have not yet felt the full impact of the economic difficulties which are being experienced overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why then, if the worst is still to come, are we in Australia in such a deplorable state? Interest rates are rising, inflation is rising, unemployment is rising, money is getting tighter and more and more businesses are going bankrupt. Regardless of overseas trends business confidence in Australia is at an all time low. The Prime Minister cannot, with a few words in this House, sheet all the blame elsewhere. He, his Government and his Government's ill- judged economic policies are the greatest threat to our domestic economic welfare. It is obvious, and we on this side of the House have repeated the fact over and over again, that the hard line monetarist policies that this Government has followed have been disastrous. The policies are not working. The Prime Minister has in turn blamed Labor's three years in office for all of our ills. He has blamed the trade union movement and now, finally, he says that the health of the Australian economy will depend entirely on the health of the international economic climate. That horse will not run. The Prime Minister, through his confrontationist attitude to the unions, has exacerbated industrial problems. If we are threatened with a wage explosion, the blame lies with this Government, through its failure to support wage indexation, its failure to control inflation and to protect interest rates and through its failure to inspire confidence in business houses throughout Australia. The blame lies with the Government also in its failure to restructure the taxation system and give some relief to the pay-as- you-earn taxpayer, who is faced this year with a massive 22 per cent increase in tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Typical of the Government's failure to inspire the business world with the confidence necessary in these difficult times is its handling of the plan for the car industry, an industry in Australia that is an enormous employer in areas in which employment is scarce. The Government has made a complete mess of this industry, but to compound the errors with a plan that goes up to 1990 is extraordinary. The plan announced in December 1981, after months of unease among car manufacturers and component manufacturers alike, will make it more difficult for the Australian car industry to remain in existence. The plan does not come to grips with the biggest single manufacturing problem in Australia, or with the needs of a manufacturing industry in current or future Australian conditions. It will not increase employment in the industry. It will create uncertainty-the first enemy of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> As usual, when this Government has to operate in a difficult economic climate- albeit one of its own making-it lacks the courage and ability to plan realistically for the future. Having no confidence in itself, it fails to inspire confidence in others. Even its own back benchers reacted angrily to the car plan, and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) was reported in the Age on 22 December as having said that it was 'a ludicrously complicated plan which would cost jobs and would not benefit consumers'. </PARA>
<PARA> The complete lack of confidence that this Government inspires can be pinpointed accurately by the state of the building industry. This has long been accepted as the economic indicator in Australia, and at present it is sick. Fewer and fewer private and public buildings are being started, and confidence in any improvement in this area is at an all-time low. As each month's figures come through, they are worse than the previous ones. We need desperately to rejuvenate the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere is the lack of confidence and the disastrous economic climate having more effect than on small business. Estimates by both government and private researchers show that there are between 350,000 and 400,000 small businesses in Australia. Leaving government employment aside, it is estimated that small enterprises account for between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of total employment in the private sector. One could rightly assume that small businesses must flourish and look to the future with confidence if we are to have a healthy Australian economy. Their success is intrinsically linked with our prosperity and employment. Unfortunately, anything that this Government has done to assist our thousands of small businessmen is of a token nature. This Government responds to lobbying from big business and from multinationals, but its record with the very heart of our nation is deplorable. </PARA>
<PARA> Relatively little specific data about the small business sector and its many component elements is collected, even though resources provided by the Federal Government enable facts and figures to be gathered, assessed and reported. Most other advanced countries, such as West Germany, Japan, Sweden and Canada, have sophisticated specialised small business programs and policies. Considering the size and economic importance of the small business sector, governments ought to be prepared to commit resources comparable with those dedicated traditionally to the rural and manufacturing sectors. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a letter that I recently received from the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>

<PARA>Chairman</PARA>
<PARA>D. M. Gibbons</PARA>
<PARA>8 March 1982 Dear Member,</PARA>
<PARA> I invite you to study and think carefully about the contents of the enclosed booklet. </PARA>
<PARA> It discusses the most Government neglected but possibly the most economically important sector of the Australian economy SMALL BUSINESS. </PARA>
<PARA> Until a few years ago Governments were totally disinterested in our economic ' Cinderella'-she was quite subservient to the big ugly sisters in industry, commerce, mining and rural/farm production. </PARA>
<PARA> Then suddenly the potential political significance of small business dawned in certain key election campaigns!</PARA>
<PARA> Since then small business has enjoyed some occasional glitter and attention by our 'Charming' Governments but they've made no real effort to ensure the slipper fits and that support and assistance comparable with that given the big sisters is extended to the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business doesn't expect nor want magic wandwaving Fairy Godmother Treatment or any other hand-outs-it simply wants equitable and just consideration and treatment along with the other traditionally pampered sectors in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Will you give your support to the achievement of that objective?</PARA>
<PARA> In particular please support the mounting of a full inquiry into small business in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours Faithfully, (D. M. GIBBONS)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The letter clearly illustrates the disenchantment of the members of the organisation. The results of the lack of confidence evidenced among the manufacturing and business sector of the nation are clearly illustrated by the fact that bankruptcies during the early 1970s averaged about 2,000; in 1979-80 they had increased to 4,979; and in 1980-81 they had increased to 5,154. That is about a 250 per cent increase in the number of businesses that have failed in this deplorable economic climate. The bankruptcies are highest in Victoria, which has easily won the unenviable title of 'Bankruptcy Capital of Australia'. The introduction of legislation for a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on many more items has almost been the last straw for many of our beleaguered small businesses. Even the Treasurer admitted in this House that it would put increased strain on their limited resources. That is part of the reason why the Australian Labor Party, both in this House and in the other place, is determined that that sales tax legislation must be defeated. It is the last straw to businesses that are staggering under the burdens they have already.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has the extraordinary record of presiding over the worst economic recession since the 1930s, with a promise only of more of the same to follow and a reiteration that the Budget strategy is working. If that strategy was to bring the country to its knees, then yes, it is working. If it was to destroy the confidence of the business sector, yes, it is working there also. What this country is really looking for at the moment is a government that is prepared to have enough confidence in itself, in its industry and in its people to admit that the Budget strategy is wrong and that the last six years have been six of the worst years the country has faced. While this Government has another 18 months or so of governing it should have the courage to admit that it is wrong. Before it capsizes our economy it should turn back and take a different direction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance brought on by the Australian Labor Party is closely allied to many of the arguments put forward yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his speech on Australia's economy. That speech clearly identified the fact that in a difficult international situation Australia is in an outstanding position compared with other countries. That position is due to the policies of this Government and it could not have developed if there had been a lack of business confidence in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia is in a position today that is envied by many of those countries that were considered to be the economic leaders, such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Deep down they would have loved to have adopted some of the economic policies that this Government adopted some five or six years ago when it came to office. There are many indicators that clearly show that this country is progressing and does have the confidence of the business community. This is a free enterprise government. It is a government that relies very heavily on the business community and on the confidence of that community. When we look at some of the statistics we find that since this Government came to power the number of people employed has increased by 500,000-half a million people. In 1975 those employed in Australia stood at 5.9 million. Today that figure is 6.4 million. Without business confidence that progress cannot happen. The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) mentioned in his speech the words of Professor Pollard, who said that Australians have never had it so good. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 24 February 1982 Professsor Pollard is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the six years to 1981, average household income had risen in real terms by 5.4 per cent, while the purchasing power of average weekly earnings had risen by 6.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>The Professsor also said that statistics revealed that the number of registered motor vehicles per 1000 people had increased by 18.6 per cent, from 419 to nearly 500. I mention that particularly because both members of the Opposition who spoke in the debate mentioned the motor vehicle industry as an indicator that shows a lack of business confidence in Australia today. Yet if we were to look at the current sales of new motor vehicles we would find that they are stable and showing confidence. If honourable members want to move on to some other statistics to back up our claims they should look at the latest bulletin issued by the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association Ltd dated February 1982. It starts off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Between 280 and 300 petroleum exploration wells are expected to be drilled in Australia in 1982. This is double the 1981 exploration programme . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If there was not business confidence in Australia would such predictions be made , predictions that entail such massive investment? I do not think so. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) also quoted from the ANZ Bank's latest publication dated 23 February 1982. Yet the opening remarks of that publication, addressing retail sales, also state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . retail sales-. . . in 1980-81 rose strongly, being nearly 5.0 per cent higher than in 1979-80. This was the first significant recovery since the 1974- 75 recession. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1974-75 recession was at a time when the Australian Labor Party was in government in this country. The article goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The accompanying chart shows real retail sales growth recovering in 1980-81 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Once again, if there is a lack of business confidence is it possible for retail sales to grow? The answer, of course, is no. Yet Labor members stand here and, throughout all their speeches, talk about the gloom and doom of the economy of this country. They are doing this country a great disservice in endeavouring through their talk in this place to influence people to think that somehow or other some great economic disaster is happening here. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has been forced to take many unpopular decisions. It is unfortunate that the correct economic decisions are not always popular. We have had policies to restrain government spending, to restrict the money supply, to bring down the rate of inflation and to achieve a balanced Budget. We have not adopted these policies because somehow or other in a temporary way they hurt people. It would be lovely if we could govern the country and do everything that is popular, but that is not the way to do things. We have adopted these policies over the years to put Australia, as we have done, in a most favourable economic condition. If honourable members look at the record, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has pointed out, they will see that over the last six years of this Government Australia has become more competitive internationally. Businesses have increased their profitability. The greatest factor of all is that other countries have shown their confidence in Australia by their willingness continually to subscribe overseas capital in this country. Australia today offers sound opportunities. Certainly changes will be necessary for our industry and our business people because the world is changing, the demands of people are changing. Of course we must always keep this in mind to make sure that our businesses can prosper along the right lines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition continually uses as an indicator the number of bankruptcies in a country. It is completely incorrect to use bankruptcies as such an indicator. There will always be bankruptcies in business. Bankruptcies are a cleansing implement in the business world; they do not allow an inefficient business to continue in operation. Without bankruptcies we would only be thrusting upon the community economic businesses which would be supplying products at a stupid price to Australian consumers. Bankruptcies will always be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment there is a tremendous drain of funds into resource development in this country. The level of investment is set out in the statistics which I have cited. I know that the drain of funds into the capital intensive industries has caused temporary problems in this country but Australia will benefit from this resource development. This investment in resource capital intensive industries will reap a great reward for all Australians in the future. I know that Australia is affected by overseas happenings. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, we cannot ignore what happens overseas but through the sound economic policies of this Government, often unpopular policies, Australia is in a sound position to go ahead and benefit from them. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will be aware that clauses precluding spouses of persons involved in industrial action from receiving unemployment and special benefit were deleted by the Government from the Social Services Amendment Bill 1981 during its passage through the Parliament. Those clauses were subsequently introduced into the Parliament, in the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981, which the Senate failed to pass last November after it had been passed by this House. This Bill reintroduces that Bill. Before October 1979, the Social Services Act precluded payment of unemployment benefit to a person who was a direct participant in a strike. However, it enabled unemployment benefit to be paid at the married rate to the spouse of a person ineligible for unemployment benefit on those grounds. The Act was subsequently amended to provide that unemployment benefit payable to the spouse of a person engaged in industrial action was to be at the single rate. A further amendment precluded payment of special benefit to a person who, because of industrial action, was not qualified to receive unemployment benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill proposed that, for so long as a person's spouse is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit because of involvement in industrial action, unwillingness to undertake suitable work, or failure to take reasonable steps to obtain such work, that person will also be ineligible for unemployment benefit. Additionally, a person will be ineligible for unemployment benefit for so long as payment of that benefit to the person's spouse is postponed because of that person's misconduct as a worker, because he has become voluntarily unemployed or because he has failed to accept an offer of suitable employment. Consistent with this approach, special benefit will also be withheld from persons not eligible for unemployment benefit in these circumstances. The Government has decided, however, that if a person is precluded from receiving unemployment benefit and special benefit, in a case of extreme hardship and where there are no other means of support, that person's spouse may be eligible for special benefit at the single rate, with additional benefit for any children. This will ensure that cases of actual hardship can be assisted, in contrast with the present position in which the social security system can be called upon in circumstances in which there is no actual need.</PARA>
<PARA> We are not here concerned to discuss the merits of strike action as contrasted with other means open to employees in dispute with their employers to resolve these disputes. What we are concerned with is how the cost of strike action is to be borne. The Government holds strongly to the belief that these provisions should become law. In the case of the provisions relating to industrial action, we do not believe that Australian taxpayers should be asked to subsidise strike action through the social welfare system. The policy underlying this Bill is that a person, when he chooses to take strike action, should act in the recognition that he takes responsibility for the consequences of his action, both for himself and for his family. Strikers make the decision to strike against the rest of the community, and they, not the rest of the community through the welfare system, must bear the financial consequences. Trade unions, whether acting through their officials or by the vote of their members, should equally recognise that a decision to initiate industrial action will have consequences for all members and their families which the community should not be asked to bear through the welfare system.</PARA>
<PARA> This is the proper perspective from which to consider the measures proposed in this Bill. The Government is not swayed by emotional and misleading arguments which seek to deflect attention from and misrepresent that fundamental concern. The issue is quite clear, and we do not intend to be drawn into the kind of fruitless debate which seeks to direct attention away from the issue. The Bill is not an anti-strike Bill, but one which aims at restricting the community subsidisation of strikes. The legislation, as it stands at the moment, permits a situation in which trade unions can choose to strike, knowing that through the operation of the social security system their members can be largely insulated from the financial effect of their actions. The benefits sought in many industrial disputes are ones which to the striker are economic, such as increased pay, a shorter working week, or special allowances. Not infrequently, strikes are settled on a basis that effectively compensates those who have gone on strike for pay lost during the duration of the strike.</PARA>
<PARA> The point to be emphasised is that to strike is a matter of choice. Generally, it is one taken by the membership of a union to promote its own interests and only its own interests. It is taken against the interests of the employer and, what is directly relevant to this Bill, it is not taken in the interests of the community as a whole. Indeed, the effect of strike action is often in conflict with the interests of the community as a whole or some part of it. Frequently, the community suffers as a result of strike action. This may be reflected simply in inconvenience or in terms of direct economic cost. Furthermore, in a larger sense, it may be said that in the longer term the community always suffers as the cumulative result of the strike action is to decrease the availability of goods and services, and sometimes to do great damage to particular sectors of the economy, or to particular employers. These matters need only to be mentioned to make clear the absurdity of any argument that benefits should be paid to strikers or their families, and should be paid by the community at large. It is the community at large that provides through taxation the funds from which strikers are currently paid the benefits that this Bill proposes to eliminate.</PARA>
<PARA> There have been numerous cases in which the wives of strikers, who have appeared to have no genuine intention of joining the work force themselves, have registered for work in places such as mining and construction towns where there is no real possibility of employment for them. This has enabled them, under the existing legislation, to obtain unemployment benefit, and so transfer to the taxpayer some of the real cost of the industrial action taken by their husbands. The burden so thrust upon the community is far from light. For example, honourable members will recall that from 15 July 1981 to 28 September 1981 some 600 people were involved in a strike concerning the use of apprentices during industrial action at the Utah Development Co. mine in central Queensland. Four hundred and seventy-one wives claimed unemployment benefit at a cost of around $ 40,000 per week, making a total cost of some $450,000. The Australian public is attacked from two directions. First, it has to bear the personal disruptions, inconveniences and associated costs that result from the strike. In addition, it is then called upon to meet the cost of providing income support for the families of those involved in the strike.</PARA>
<PARA> To act to correct this situation is not to punish or to penalise the families of strikers, but to ensure that people accept the financial consequences of their own actions and do not look to the rest of the community to bear the costs of workers and their families. Similarly, there is no good reason why the community should automatically and immediately be expected to assume, through unemployment or special benefit payments, the normal financial responsibilities of people who are not willing to work, who voluntarily and without good reason give up their job, or who are dismissed through their misconduct. This is happening at present because the spouses of such people can register for employment in their own right and, if they are unable to obtain employment, can claim unemployment benefit both for themselves and for their 'dependent' spouses .</PARA>
<PARA> In this situation, however, as with the strike situation to which I have earlier referred, the Bill also provides that, if a person is precluded from receiving unemployment or special benefit, that person's spouse may receive special benefit at the single rate, with additional benefit for any children, in a case of extreme hardship and where there are no other means of support. The very existence of this provision belies the quite false charge that the Bill will in any way 'punish' or 'penalise' families.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, we believe that whether people refuse to work because of industrial action or whether, in some other way, they show themselves unwilling to enter or remain in the work force, there is no reason why the rest of the community should shoulder their financial responsibilities. This Bill prevents them from manipulating the social security system to shift the consequences of their actions. I commend the Bill to the House.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Act 1962 to provide for the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority to restrict the use of electricity in the Australian Capital Territory following the declaration of a state of emergency by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Territory currently derives 60 per cent of its bulk supply of electricity from New South Wales, the balance coming from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. Due to the significant amount of total bulk supply of electricity that is purchased from New South Wales the Authority is particularly vulnerable to emergency situations occurring in New South Wales. Shortages of electric power and energy in New South Wales have resulted in emergency situations and requests to the Authority to reduce load. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the Authority has sought to achieve this reduction by means of public appeal to its customers for voluntary restraint, coupled with reduction of the supply voltage. These methods have not, however, resulted in a reduction as significant as that achieved in New South Wales by means of legislation enabling the supply to be restricted. In order for the Authority to respond effectively to emergency situations and to provide an equitable distribution of the available supply, it is absolutely essential that the Authority have power to impose restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, it is indeed unfortunate in the extreme that this action is necessary. New South Wales has supplied a large part of the electricity requirements of the Territory since 1929. With the exception of the early post- war years and a short period in 1973, the Government has been able to rely with confidence on a continuation of adequate supply. This, unfortunately and regrettably, is no longer the case. Since June last year, the supply of electricity from New South Wales has been uncertain. We cannot be confident that the situation will improve. </PARA>
<PARA> The power supply problems in June 1981 were due to a combination of factors, the principal one being the shutdown caused by plant difficulties in two large generating units combined with major industrial problems. This is, in fact, what the Electricity Commission of New South Wales has itself admitted in so many words. The failure of two more large units at Liddell power station in November 1981, exacerbated again by industrial problems, caused the imposition of restrictions yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> Some relief was expected with the commissioning of the first generator at the Eraring power station but this too has been delayed for months-again due to further industrial disputes. The Government believes that the chain of events is such that it must be fully prepared to deal with future emergencies-for the welfare of the national capital and its residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes provision for the Minister to declare, by notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, that an electricity supply emergency will exist during a period, not exceeding 28 days, specified in the notice. The Minister may make such a declaration where he is satisfied that the supply of electricity available in the Territory is, or is likely to be, so inadequate for the needs of the Territory as to require restriction of use. The declaration may be revoked by the Minister by notice in the Gazette if the need for restrictions cease. </PARA>
<PARA> During a period of emergency the Authority may, by order in writing, restrict the use of electricity in the Territory. Details of the emergency orders to be made will be published in the Gazette and in a newspaper circulating in the Territory. Details may also be published by radio or television broadcast if the Authority considers it appropriate to do so. The orders will come into force on the date of gazettal or such later date as is specified in the Gazette. The orders will be subject to disallowance. They will be laid before both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days of their making and either House may then disallow them within a further period of 15 sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that on 26 May 1981 my colleague the Attorney- General (Senator Durack), avowed the Government's commitment to the principle that delegated legislation and the like should be subject to review by parliament. In accordance with this principle, provisions for the disallowance of instruments of a legislative character should, unless there are good reasons for variation, incorporate the substance of certain traditionally accepted safeguards, such as requirements that they be laid before each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of their making and that a motion for disallowance must be dealt with within 15 sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA> While, in accordance with this principle, emergency orders will be subject to disallowance, the very nature of emergency orders and the time constraints which an emergency imposes, necessitate, on this occasion, the incorporation of a further procedure in the Bill to make parliamentary review more effective. Accordingly, in making the emergency orders, the Authority will comply with guidelines made by instrument in writing by the Minister, which have themselves been subject to disallowance by the Parliament. The guidelines will be laid before both Houses of Parliament and either House of Parliament may, within five sitting days after a copy of the guidelines has been laid before it, pass a resolution disallowing them. If neither House disallows the guidelines, they will come into force at the expiration of the five sitting days. The Authority cannot make an emergency order unless the guidelines are in force. </PARA>
<PARA> The period for disallowance has been limited to five sitting days because it is considered essential that the Authority be in a position to impose restrictions this winter. This might not be possible if the disallowance period were the usual 15 sitting days. In addition, it may be necessary for the Minister to amend the guidelines quickly if they prove inadequate to deal with the emergency at hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Persons, including bodies corporate, who without reasonable excuse contravene or fail to comply with an emergency order shall be guilty of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> During an emergency a justice of the peace may, where he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a contravention of, or a failure to comply with, an emergency order has occurred, grant a search warrant effective for a specified period, to an officer or employee of the Authority, authorising that officer or employee to enter and search the land or premises for the purpose of ascertaining whether such a contravention or failure has occurred. The Bill will bind the Crown. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Financial Institutions (Share Increase) Bill concerns two international financial institutions-the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation. They are two of a number of international financial institutions that have played a steadily growing role in the world economy since the end of the Second World War. They began with an international conference in 1944 at Bretton Woods in the United States where it was agreed to create a World Bank and an International Monetary Fund. The Bank was intended primarily as a source of long term loans for the reconstruction of war devastated countries and subsequently for assistance in economic development in what are now called the developing countries. On the other hand, the International Monetary Fund was designed for the stabilisation of international payment arrangements, providing short term credits for that purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The World Bank is a group of three institutions-the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association and the International Finance Corporation. The annual report of the World Bank notes :</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the common objective of these institutions is to help raise standards of living in developing countries by channeling financial resources from developed countries to the developing world. </PARA>
<PARA>The World Bank is owned by the governments of 135 countries which subscribe its capital. The Bank finances its lending operations primarily from its own borrowings in world capital markets. The Bank loans generally have a grace period of five years and are repayable over 20 years or less. They are directed towards developing countries at more advanced stages of economic and social growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Development Association was established in 1960 primarily to provide assistance to the poorer developing countries on terms that would bear less heavily on their balance of payments and bank loans; that is, its lending is on concessional terms. The International Finance Corporation was established in 1956 to assist less developed countries by promoting growth in the private sector of their economies and helping to mobilise domestic and foreign capital for that purpose. The International Monetary Fund is a type of relatively weak international central bank. Its main functions are to help maintain order in the international money market and to provide short term loans to member countries to tide over temporary balance of payments deficits. Each member of the Fund is assigned a quota expressed in special drawing rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Special drawing rights are a form of international money created by the International Monetary Fund and distributed to each member in proportion to its quota. New allocations of special drawing rights are made from time to time when the membership of the Fund decides a new issue is required. This quota is determined partly by economic criteria such as the size of the country's gross domestic product and international trade, and partly as an outcome of political negotiations. The size of a country's quota largely determines its voting strength in the Fund, as well as its allocations of special drawing rights and the amounts of credit it can obtain from the International Monetary Fund's facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> There are now 140 members of the IMF including most non-communist countries as well as some from the Eastern bloc. The Western industrial countries command a large majority of the votes in the International Monetary Fund's decision-making bodies. Over 60 per cent of total votes are controlled by Western industrial countries. The oil exporting, less developed countries have 10 per cent of the vote and other less developed countries have just under 30 per cent. The principal distinction between the two main international financal institutions is that the World Bank makes long term loans to member governments for the purpose of economic development and the International Monetary Fund provides short term balance of payments support to its members. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to increase Australia's shareholding in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and in the International Finance Corporation. In 1980 the Bank's Board of Governors adopted a resolution which increased the authorised capital stock of the Bank by approximately $US40, 000m. The resolution provided for the portion of the shares to be subscribed by each country and for payment arrangements. Insofar as they affect Australia, these arrangements are embodied in the Bill and involve a payment by the Australian Government to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development of $US54.62m to be paid over four years. Similarly, the International Finance Corporation approved a resolution in September 1977 authorising an increase in its capital. This resolution was supported by Australia and the Bill under debate authorises the purchase and payment of $ US10m for the addition of shares to which Australia is entitled. The Opposition supports the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The effective functioning of these international financial institutions is vital for the efficient and equitable functioning of the international economic sysytem. It is to that matter that I now wish to turn. The prospects in all areas of world trade, whether in commodities or manufactures, in energy or in the activities of multinational corporations, are greatly influenced by the functioning of the world monetary system. Predictable rates of exchange encourage investment as well as trade; erratic and fluctuating rates discourage both. Stable rates increase the confidence of asset holders, whether surplus oil producers or other potential investors. Likewise, an adequate flow of international liquidity smooths out cyclical fluctuations, makes protection of domestic markets less necessary and enables commodity producers to ride out deteriorating terms of trade. Yet throughout the 1970s the international financial system was in disarray. There have been massive balance of payments imbalances, exchange rates have fluctuated wildly, there has been explosive growth in the debt of developing countries and the international financial institutions, particularly the International Monetary Fund, have been seen to be relatively ineffective and subject to growing criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> An international conference of organisations concerned with the North-South debate, regarding the international monetary system, was held at Arusha in Tanzania in mid 1980 and concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> The post-1945 monetary system has broken down. The ensuing inflationary and speculative disorders inflict serious damage on the majority of peoples and countries. It is imperative to conceive and negotiate new monetary structures and procedures. </PARA>
<PARA>The defects of the International Monetary Fund were clear throughout the 1970s. Those of the World Bank are becoming clearer, particularly through the manipulations of the United States under President Reagan. I will discuss the two institutions in turn. I refer first to the International Monetary Fund. The Fund is controlled by a Board of Governors which normally meets once a year, the members of which are normally Ministers of Finance or Treasurers. Under the Board of Governors is an Executive Board responsible for everyday business, which is composed of full time representatives meeting weekly in Washington. Six members of the Executive Board are permanent representatives of the countries holding the largest numbers of shares-namely, the United States, the United Kingdom, West Germany, France, Japan and Saudi Arabia. The other 15 members are elected by groups of countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States holds about 22 per cent of the votes and since major decisions require 75 per cent to 85 per cent of the votes, the United States has a virtual veto. Western industrialised countries together hold 61 per cent of the votes, the oil exporting countries 10 per cent and other less developed countries 29 per cent. This voting pattern has been little changed since its adoption in 1945 and is therefore outdated. It is clear that with this pattern of control the interests of the North, the developed countries, are likely to predominate over those of the South, or the less developed countries. Thus President Nyerere of Tanzania has accused the International Monetary Fund of exploiting Tanzania's economic difficulties in order to interfere with the management of its economy, of being a device by which 'powerful economic forces in some rich countries increase their power over the poor nations of the world' and of trying to impose on them an anti-socialist ideology of economic and social development. </PARA>
<PARA> The IMF failed to make much contribution to easing the oil crisis which began in 1974 even though one of its principal tasks is to provide financial assistance to members suffering from balance of payments disequilibria. For example, while the aggregate current account deficit of non-oil, less developed countries from 1974 to 1979 amounted to $233 billion, net IMF credit financed less than $10 billion of this. Commercial bank recycling loans were far larger, even with interest rates of up to 20 per cent per annum-far above the charges of the IMF. Even in the crisis years of 1974-75-I am referring to the international crisis years-there was no increase in the number of standby agreements with the less developed country members and the real value of these credits was well below that of the 1970 to 1973 level. In 1978-79 there was actually a net return flow from less developed countries to the IMF. The consequence of this was that many of the less developed countries could manage their balance of payments only by cutting the volume of imports and their development aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there have been absolute increases, aggregate quotas in the Fund have fallen dramatically as a percentage of the total volume of international trade, from 14 per cent in 1950 to 4 per cent in 1978. It is therefore not surprising that governments complain that the Fund seeks to influence policies to an extent which is out of proportion to the limited assistance it can offer. Many less developed countries would have made fuller use of the Fund's facilities had they not feared the short term conditions which the Fund would have imposed on them. </PARA>
<PARA> Many legitimate criticisms are made of the IMF's approach, even after discounting for the criticisms which are naturally applied to any central bank attempting to maintain financial discipline. For instance, President Nyerere said that he naturally expected that the IMF would lay down certain conditions for using any of its facilities, conditions which he expected to be not ideological and relating rather to the honesty and efficiency with which the money was used. He even accepted that Tanzania could justly be asked how it was planning to deal with its problems in the medium or longer term. However, he continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Tanzania is not prepared to devalue its currency just because this is a traditional free market solution to everything and regardless of the merits of our position. It is not prepared to surrender its right to restrict imports by measures designed to ensure that we import quinine rather than cosmetics, or buses rather than cars for the elite. . . . Cuts may have to be made in our national expenditure, but we will decide whether they fall on public services or private expenditure. Nor are we prepared to deal with inflation and shortages by relying only on monetary policy regardless of its relative effect on the poorest and the less poor. . . . When an international institution refuses us access to the international credit at its disposal except on condition that we surrender to it our policy of self determination, then we make no application for that credit. </PARA>
<PARA>Such comment gives a clear indication of the concern that Third World countries have as to the conditions for assistance laid down by the IMF. It is clear that the predominantly Western or Western-trained staff of the IMF hold values which are in conflict with those of many of the developing countries with which they deal. It is clear also that there is a similarity in the Fund's approach to each of the countries with which it deals which gives inadequate attention to the individual conditions of those countries. The package of policies required of countries seeking a high level of credit often includes ceilings on credit to the public sector, the liberalisation of trade and payments, a currency devaluation and cuts in real wages. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of the fund's inadequacies from the start has been its preoccupation with balance of payments of deficit countries and the lack of sanctions against surplus countries. For example, so long as members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries earn large surpluses and add to their reserves and the industrialised countries continue to shift much of the burden of this to non -oil less developed countries, these countries must continue to show deficits. Their deficits are simply the accounting counterparts of OPEC's surpluses. Whilst adjustment appears feasible for an individual country, the same is not possible for less developed countries considered as a group so long as the rest of the world remains in surplus. The international monetary system thus induced the South into deflationary policies in pursuit of an adjustment which, considered collectively, is impossible to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, the International Monetary Fund is seemingly insensitive to the aspirations and political imperatives of its less developed country members. The limited ability of private international banking flows to meet the needs of less developed countries at a time of massive global imbalances adds further urgency to pleas for reform of the Fund. Greater flexibility in the conditions the Fund imposes is required, especially to reduce the deflationary bias of an international financial system that exerts no comparable leverage on persistently surplus countries. The power structure within the IMF should be changed and conditions for its lending relaxed. If the Fraser Government is as concerned about Third World countries as its Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) makes out, it should be actively supporting such measures. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time as the IMF has sometimes exerted too much power over individual countries' economic policies, it has also too little power over international currency markets. The IMF is dwarfed by the vast totals of largely uncontrolled money in national currencies which make up the sum of world liquidity. The world monetary system of the 1970s is, in a real sense, out of control and a global catastrophe could be brought about by the maverick whim of market opinion or the malice of a substantial group of holders of reserve currencies. The Brandt Commission noted that the first requirement for international monetary reform was that full account must be taken of the great expansion of private international money and capital markets, such as the Euro- currency and the Euro-bond markets and the Asian and Middle Eastern currency markets. The Brandt Commission recommended reforms including improvements in the exchange rate regime, the reserve system, the balance of payments adjustment process and the overall management of the system to permit fuller and more equiable participation of the whole international community. </PARA>
<PARA> The first specific recommendation by the Brandt Commission is for the issuing of an improved special drawing right on a much larger scale. New special drawing rights should be issued in a way which favours the developing countries which presently bear high adjustment burdens. This is consistent with the amended articles of the IMF which were accepted in Jamaica in 1976 and which enjoin each member to collaborate with the IMF and its other members in 'making the special drawing right the principal reserve asset in the international monetary system'. In view of this article, which Australia supported, the opposition of the United States of America and Australia at the annual IMF meeting last September to the proposal from less developed countries for a modest issue of special drawing rights is incomprehensible. At present SDRs are about 2.5 per cent of global reserves. A modest new issue of such special drawing rights would have contributed significantly to easing payments problems of less developed countries without being inflationary. Australia's opposition to this issue of special drawing rights was completely inconsistent with the Prime Minister's rhetoric at the time, for it came at the same time as he was attempting to portray himself as a sympathetic advocate of the South in preparation for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne last October. So much for the genuineness of this Government's concern for the South. </PARA>
<PARA> The World Bank has some of the same deficiencies as the International Monetary Fund. Its structure of management and control is the same as that of the IMF, giving it a strong western bias. The values generally shared by its staff are those of Western economics departments of the post war period. Like private banking loans, its credit creates debt repayment problems for borrowers and strictly commercial criteria are applied to its loans. Yet since the election of the Reagan administration it has been the subject of an astonishing assault by the United States Government attempting to impose even more conservative policies. The United States Treasury, headed by Donald Regan, as distinct from Ronald Reagan, has stopped just short of accusing the Bank of encouraging socialism. The Administration failed to budget for the United States contribution to the sixth replenishment in International Development Association funds which was expected for the three-year period 1981-1983. With the retirement of the previous President of the World Bank, Robert McNamara, President Reagan appointed Tom Clausen, previously President of the Bank of America, which is one of the banks most heavily involved in loans to the Third World. Such an appointment is indicative of President Reagan's concern to ensure that the World Bank operations were even more in accord with United States interests than had previously been the case. Thus the Washington Post towards the end of last year reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Influential Reagan advisers charge that although the United States has the biggest single money stake in the World Bank, management is not sufficiently influenced by the United States and that Bank is not an efficient agency for carrying out US strategic policy abroad. </PARA>
<PARA>From that report it would appear that the objective of the World Bank should be to pursue United States strategic policies but that is certainly not its formal charter. Furthermore, the Under-Secretary of the United States Treasury has publicly expressed the view that the Bank should serve United States interests and that instead of encouraging 'socialism through the government-to-government mode of operations' it should 'lend to the private enterprise system'. It is clear that the Reagan Administration plans to use United States aid even more intensely as a foreign policy weapon. Thus an increasing proportion of aid from a total decreasing level of aid is to be channelled through the Unites States Agency for International Development. Bilateralism rather than multilateralism is the dominant theme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Reagan Administration is cutting away even those limited gains for justice and equity which were made during the previous decade. For example, global negotiations about the principal issues involved in prospects for a new international economic order were expected to start under United Nations auspices at the beginning of 1981. Some delay was accepted as inevitable when a new United States President was elected. However, it was not until the Ottawa economic summit held in July last year that President Reagan gave any indication of willingness to participate in the global negotiations. Despite this agreement at Ottawa the United States continued to delay commencement of global negotiations at the United Nations, which was the forum through which they were to be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> At the meeting of the heads of government in Cancun, Mexico, in October last year, which was held to discuss the Brandt report, the United States again agreed to participate in global negotiations but in the most general terms. The most optimistic observers wrote about the 'spirit of Cancun', indicating that the process towards negotiations had taken a leap forward. However, when the United Nations resolution to convene a conference for global negotiations was reactivated after Cancun, the Americans submitted a draft response which merely noted the original resolution and sought to convene a preliminary United Nations conference for global negotiations. In the United Nations semantics 'noting' amounts to giving a proposal the diplomatic cold shoulder. Calling for a preliminary conference rather than for the negotiations proper sets the clock back pre-Cancun and pre-Ottawa. So one year of waiting and high level negotiation has achieved absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> President Reagan has developed a remarkable ability for convincing other participants at international meetings that maintaining the status quo is a major concession. For example, the preliminary meeting to the Cancun conference was hailed as a great success simply because President Reagan had agreed to come , despite the fact that the meeting had reached no agreement about an agenda or even about the issuing of a communique at the end of the Cancun conference. </PARA>
<PARA> Three months after the Cancun meeting the joint chairmen, President Portillo of Mexico and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, wrote to all participating heads of government emphasising the importance of translating the 'spirit of Cancun' into action. They said:</PARA>
<PARA>Three months after Cancun your co-Chairmen are not convinced that this translation is taking place to the extent we had all hoped at Cancun. </PARA>
<PARA>United States intransigence is moving the North-South dialogue backwards at an increasingly rapid rate. The tragedy is that despite some sympathetic posturing about the North-South dialogue the Fraser Government has acted very little differently. Despite speaking in more sympathetic terms, the Fraser Government's actions have been little different from those of the Reagan Administration. The support by Australia for the position of the United States in opposing a new issue of special drawing rights has already been mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been no public comments by the Fraser Government to the United States protesting against the distortions and neglect of World Bank and International Monetary Fund policies. The Fraser Government has made no constructive proposals for reform of the international financial system. The share take-up which is authorised in this Bill is no more than Australia's absolute minimal duty. Until Australia takes a leading role in initiating proposals for change to create a more just and equitable international order we will be failing lamentably to take the implications of our location as a Northern industrialised country which is situated in the south sufficiently seriously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has explained, the International Financial Institutions (Share Increase) Bill provides for Australia to take up increases in its capital subscriptions to two international financial institutions-the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance Corporation. In the course of my remarks I will rebut some of the suggestions that the honourable member made in the latter part of his speech in reference to this Government, but I am pleased to see that he, on behalf of the Opposition, does support this measure. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is an institution of very long standing. It goes right back to 1947, the beginning of the post-war era of development aid to the poor, the underdeveloped countries of the world. Its primary business is the provision of loans on semi-commercial terms to developing member countries. Up to the end of June 1981 about $US68.2 billion had been provided for projects in all major sectors of economic development. There can be no doubt that this institution is an important and efficient institution for the provision of development assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill, which gives effect to Australia's additional contributions, will, I am sure, command the support of all members of this House. It is an important component of our general multilateral aid effort, which in turn is part of our total overseas program of assistance to developing countries. Incidentally, this assistance is provided mainly by way of a grant, which is in contrast with many other countries. This overseas aid in total amounts this financial year to in excess of $650m, an increase of the order of $100.6m over the previous year. This is an indication of the increasing priority that the Government has given to this area. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I am confident that all members of this House will support the measure. I hope also that it will command the support of all Australians. Sometimes we come up against the view that we-Australia, the Government-should not be involved in this area; that we have a duty to our own first and that we should not get involved in such a diverting of resources to overseas countries when there is so much yet needed to be done in this country in respect of the poor in education, health, development and so on. The answer is that it is very much in all our interests to be involved in this process of aid to the developing and poor countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In the ultimate the case for doing so can be summed up in the words of former United States of America President Carter. He said: 'You cannot have a peaceful world one-third rich and two-thirds hungry'. In a word, it is the very peace of the world which is, in the not-so-long term, at stake in this area. For the circumstances of underdevelopment-the poverty of the South vis a vis the rich North-and exacerbated in many cases by great power intervention, are a potential source of conflict with the possibility of escalating to world conflict, as assuredly as are the arms race and tension between the East and West. The 'East' refers to the Soviet Union, its allies and proxies such as Cuba and Vietnam, and the West to the United States of America, Western Europe, Australia and so on. There is as great a potential threat to peace in this North-South context as there is in the other. The concern for world peace is overriding and universal. There is also a compelling case, on humanitarian grounds, for the provision of this aid-the obligation of those to whom much is given to help those with much less. Beyond that there is the mutual interest of both donor countries-advanced countries such as Australia-and the donees, the underdeveloped countries in other ways. In particular, there is an interdependence in economic matters. There is a great and increasing mutual dependence as between the developed and the developing countries. It is a matter of straight long term economic self- interest that we be involved in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was saying that the International Financial Institutions (Share Increase) Bill authorises an important component of our overall overseas aid effort to developing countries, that is countries of the so-called South-in Africa, the Middle East, Southern Asia, Central and South America-which are poor in comparison with the industrialised developed countries most of which are in the north, of Western Europe, the United States of America, Canada and Japan. Australia is an exception, being a rich country in the south. It is customary to refer to this context as the North-South context. The fact is that living standards generally are very high in developed countries. We think in terms of an income per head of upwards of $8,000 per annum whereas in developing countries income per head may be as low as about $250 per annum. Alternatively one can look at this in terms of parameters such as infant mortality rates. In developed countries, the infant mortality rate is of the order of 15 to 20 deaths per thousand births, whereas in Africa it is about 150 to 200 deaths per thousand. In Latin America it is up to 170 deaths per thousand. In these countries 800 million of the world's population live in the hunger and desolation of absolute poverty. The total population in these countries amounts to approximately two-thirds of the world's population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said that this measure should commend itself to the support of all Australians, on humanitarian grounds, on the grounds that the circumstances of underdevelopment are as great a threat to world peace as are the arms race and tension between the Eastern bloc and the Western bloc, and on the grounds of plain long-term economic self-interest-recognising the economic interdependence of the developing and developed world, the South and the North as I have just referred to them, the great and increasing mutual dependence of one on the other . There are various ways of expressing that point. </PARA>
<PARA> The dependence of the poor countries, the developing countries on the advanced countries for markets, not only for commodities but also for their new manufactures, for development aid and assistance-as provided for in the Bill now before the House-plus private lending from the advanced countries, is well known and obvious. What needs stressing is that the markets of developing countries are absorbing an ever larger share of advanced countries' exports to the point where the demand of developing countries, or Third World countries, is seen by many as the new growth frontier of the 1980s. Over the past five years or so there has been a massive trade deficit on the part of the non-oil developing countries. This was referred to by the honourable member for Gellibrand who led for the Opposition. There can be no doubt that this order of international deficit-financed spending, so to speak, has been quite crucial to the underpinning of world demand and thus to holding up world economic activity to the extent that it has held up over recent years. Unemployment, already very high in many industrialised, advanced countries as was pointed out yesterday, higher than in Australia-of the order of 8.5 per cent in France and the United States and 11.5 per cent in the United Kingdom-would otherwise have been higher still. So I say again, when we talk about aid to developing countries-I concede they are a diverse group of countries but I am taking them together for this purpose-there is a very compelling case on humanitarian grounds, but the case rests also on straight, long-term economic and political self-interest, the interest of all of us in a more stable, workable and peaceful world system. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spent a good deal of time in recent years, particularly as a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union-during the Thirty-first Parliament I had the privilege of being leader of the Australian Parliament's delegation to that body -talking with Third World people, members of parliament and others, and working to devise positions on international economic issues. One becomes profoundly impressed with their point of view when one is engaged in this way. One becomes impressed also with the immensity, the massive proportions, of the problem. Far be it from me to disparage in any way the activities of voluntary organisations such as the Freedom from Hunger Campaign and others. They are of the utmost importance in getting people involved in these great issues in a personal way and in helping to achieve the necessary political will for action by governments . But the magnitude of what is required is such that only governments and large scale commercial activity can come up with the resources on the necessary scale. Hence the importance of this Bill before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Two resolutions were adopted at the sixty-seventh and sixty-eighth conferences respectively held in Berlin in 1980 and Havana in 1981 and I will seek leave to incorporate them in Hansard at the end of my speech. When honourable members have an opportunity to read these resolutions they will, no doubt, detect something of a slant towards the aspirations and policies of the developing countries. But, as I have argued, the problems and the economic and political implications for Australia and the developed world generally are nonetheless real for that. They do convey, I think , something of the gravity of the issues and the concerns of those most affected . </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will particularly note the great store that is put on getting meaningful, global negotiations under way. The Cancun summit meeting which was held last October-it followed the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Australia-has come and gone and still nothing very much has happened. The honourable member for Gellibrand, when leading for the Opposition, disparaged this Government's activities in this area. In that respect it should be said that Australia has given conditional support to global negotiations and that is in contrast to the United States Administration's unwillingness to involve America in such negotiations. Even more so, I might add, in recent years Australia was out in front in relation to the Common Fund, an institution or a proposal which developing countries have set a great store by. In point of fact, we played a significant role in bringing to the point of conclusion in June 1980 draft articles of agreement in relation to the Common Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> We, of course, are a rich developed country. In that sense we belong to the North. But we are also a commodity exporter, and that we have in common with most of the countries of the South. Having something in common in this way with both the advanced countries and the developing countries, this has often meant that in international negotiations Australia has been able to play the role of effective intermediary. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, these issues in the so-called North-South context mesh closely with the other great context of issues threatening the peace of the world-the East-West context, as it is referred to, namely, the confrontation between the Soviet Union and its allies, on the one hand, and the West, on the other hand. The cost of maintaining the nuclear, the military balance, on which the general peace of the world directly depends, is enormous. In toto-this includes expenditure on the awesome nuclear arsenals of the super-powers-the world spends about $450 billion annually on arms, which works out at about $1 million a minute. It is an enormous dead weight of cost which inevitably acts as a brake on what can be achieved in the North-South context, what can be done to assist the poor, the developing countries, and to lift their living standards. The complexity, the challenge, the utter frustration, in this area is perhaps no more graphically underlined than by the statistic that in 1980, which is the latest year for which figures are available, the non-oil developing countries, which are generally the poorest, received in official development aid some $US33 .5 billion, whereas those same countries spent $US38.4 billion on military spending-a sum greater than what they spent on education, health and welfare put together. </PARA>
<PARA> One would like some sort of formula which linked the receipt of aid with effecting a decrease in spending on arms in these countries. Indeed, the Germans , in recent dealings with some Latin American countries, tried just that. But, generally speaking, that is a Utopian approach-a dream world. What must not happen is that this sort of pattern of things should paralyse our resolve to press on with policies to assist the developing world. The only realistic approach is to keep pressing ahead simultaneously on both fronts to which I have referred. That is, we must pursue actively, as this Government does, the objective of arms control and disarmament. We must do what we can-we cannot do much in this first area-to encourage further strategic arms limitation negotiations between the super-powers, we must encourage the negotiation of a comprehensive test ban treaty, and-here we can be effective-the further reinforcement and commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, these things in the nuclear area, and other restraints in the area of conventional weapons. We must do those things as well as give support for effective peace processes, as, for example, in the Sinai as this Government is doing. We must do those things, on the one hand, and at the same time, enter into meaningful negotiations and commit adequate resources for the purpose of assisting the development of the Third World. There is no other course open to us. I commend this important measure to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this legislation is to implement the changes in the application of the coal export levy introduced in last year's Budget-one of the many changes that the Government has made to coal levies in recent years. This time it is to extend the application of this tax, at a rate of $1 a tonne, to coals previously exempt. This will apply mainly to steaming coals but also to some low quality coking coals. Given the increased profitability of steaming coal ventures in recent years, the Opposition supports this measure as we believe that the Australian public should receive some return from the development of our natural resources. The Opposition, though, does not support the form of this tax-the way in which it is structured, the way in which it is continually being changed, and in fact the Government's whole ad hoc approach to taxation of the coal industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since its introduction in 1975, the coal export levy has been changed five times despite a commitment by the Government to remove the levy entirely. In 1976 the then Treasurer, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) announced that the levy would be phased out over a three-year period. During this time the Government changed the rates twice but the levy remained. Once again, as we have seen on many occasions, the Government failed to honour its commitments. Two years after breaking this promise-that is, in last year's Budget-the Government announced that it was 'no longer considered appropriate' to phase out the levy. Those were the Treasurer's words-'no longer considered appropriate'. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry had to wait two years before it was told what was going to happen to the levy. Now we see the application of the levy being extended. This ad hoc approach to policy is absurd. The coal industry is Australia's largest mineral export industry and is currently going through a new phase of development. It needs and deserves a consistent approach to policy and in particular a more predictable taxation policy. The industry should have a tax regime which does not change simply in line with the Government's revenue needs. Not only is the levy system unacceptable because of its many changes but also it is indiscriminate in its application. It fails to take into account the profitability or cost structure of a venture. It is important to recognise that there are long lead times involved in bringing a coal mine to production. </PARA>
<PARA> How are potential producers supposed to plan for a mine and mining development when the tax regime is unpredictable, indiscriminate and changes at the whim of the Government? This problem arises not only at the Federal level; the State governments are guilty of the same behaviour, but on a far worse scale. In recent years we have seen a proliferation of State taxes, royalties, excess freight rates, up front charges, et cetera, most of which are not economically sound and certainly do nothing to provide consistency in policy. Current taxation arrangements are not satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> The coal industry should have a tax regime which permits the economic potential of this industry to be realised while also providing a fair return to the Australian public. One means of doing this is through the introduction of a resource rent tax, or tax over and above company tax, as advocated by the Opposition and other bodies in this nation, such as the Federal Treasury, the Government's interdepartmental committee on economic policy and, of course, most leader writers in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> For this reason the Opposition will be moving the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the legislation:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not declining to give this Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the existing coal export levies are indiscriminate and calls upon the Government to introduce legislation to abolish the coal export duty and replace it with a resource rent tax which takes into account the real level of costs and profits'. </PARA>
<PARA>We will not oppose this legislation if the levy system is the only way of ensuring some return to the Australian people. But the Government must wake up to the reality of the situation and replace this draconian tax system with a properly structured resources tax. That is a far preferable system to flat rate levies. It would apply only to highly profitable ventures and not discriminate against high-cost producers. The amount of tax paid would be a function of a project's profitability. Certainly there are two levy rates; $3.50 and $1 a tonne depending on the quality of the coal and the type of mining operation. But the same rate applies within each category of coal irrespective of profitability although rates of return within the industry vary considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures for 1978-79 show that the rate of return of funds employed in that year range from 25.9 per cent to a negative rate. The coal levy has imposed a major burden on those marginal producers at the bottom of this range. Under a profit-related tax these operations would pay no tax of this kind. Such a tax would also take into account the fact that costs are high in the early years of developing a mine. In these years when a high cash flow is needed to service debt commitments little or no tax would be payable because of the large capital expenditures incurred. But in latter years, once the major production costs have been written off, the Australian people would share in the benefits if profits proved to be of an exceptionally high order. It is only reasonable that companies should pay more than just company tax when a project has been operating for long enough to write off its capital costs and when it starts to make large profits, particularly if profits occur as a result of changes in world commodity prices or unforeseen changes which virtually bestow a very high opportunity value on the product. After all, the ownership of Australia's resources is vested in the Crown. The right to mine deposits is given to a company by the state. It is therefore reasonable that resource projects be treated differently for tax purposes than, say, a manufacturing business to which the state makes no contribution whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason for introducing such a tax is to maximise the benefits flowing to Australia from coal production, given the high level of foreign ownership in the industry. A recent study by Dr M. Folie from the Shell Company of Australia estimates that the present level of foreign ownership of the steaming coal industry is 38 per cent and he predicts that this will rise to 59 per cent over the next 10 years. In the case of coking coal he estimates that it is already as high as 60 per cent. Because of this high level of foreign ownership, profits earned by many companies in the industry are repatriated to parent companies overseas. If the companies involved were Australian the bulk of the profits would be retained in this country. In the light of this, if the benefits from developing Australian resources are to remain in Australia a resource rent tax should be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for a new tax regime is particularly evident at the moment given the new phase of development that our coal industry has entered, at least with respect to steaming coal. Australia currently exports about 39 million tonnes of coking coal a year and over 9 million tonnes of steaming coal. In the case of steaming coal, this compares with exports of only 3 million tonnes in 1976-77. So the figure has risen by 300 per cent in just a few years. Although estimates of future coal demand vary considerably, a recent study by the Department of Trade and Resources estimates that steaming coal exports will grow to 30 million to 40 million tonnes in 1985 and 50 million to 70 million tonnes in 1990. In the case of coking coal, the Department estimates exports of between 48 million and 55 million tonnes by 1985 and 50 million to 60 million tonnes by 1990. In other words, between 1976 and 1990 we should see the Australian steaming coal industry develop on such a scale as to rival in size and in volume the coking coal industry which, of course, started 15 years earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, factors operating to limit the growth of coal exports in general. Increased competition can be expected from South Africa, Canada, China, Alaska and other parts of the United States of America. Also, stable international oil prices have slowed the movement away from oil-based energy. Domestic factors such as insufficient infastructure-transport and port facilities-will also act to limit expansion in this industry. Despite all this the industry will continue to expand, particularly in steaming coal. This has already been reflected in recent steaming coal price increases. The average price for steaming coal exported from New South Wales increased from $28 a tonne in July 1980 to $38 a tonne in July 1981 and to recent contract prices of between $42 to $48 a tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> If coal prices continue to increase the ensuing profits should be shared between the producers and the public. If they do not, a resource rent tax would take this into account. It would therefore levy no tax, unlike the existing levy system which levies a tax whether or not companies are in a profit situation. If large profits are to be earned in the coal industry, in many cases by foreign companies, some mechanism must be established to share the benefits. A future Labor government would certainly seek to apply a resource rent tax to the coal industry. The tax would be carefully designed in consultation with the industry so that the objectives of such a tax would be met without some of the distortional effects which can arise from taxes which are ill-designed or hastily implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Some sections of the coal industry can afford to pay more than just company tax and should be obliged to do so. No sensible person believes in penalising companies to the point where development is stymied or where exploration is discouraged. What is needed is a sensible approach by both industry and government to determine the appropriate nature and incidence of tax. We believe a resource rent tax is the appropriate mechanism. For the Commonwealth to vacate the field of mineral taxation is only to encourage a lack of uniformity. As we have seen with the continuing proliferation of State taxes, in the end the possibility is that the goose that laid the golden egg will be killed off by the greed, particularly of the States. The whole prospect of the establishment of a resource rent tax has, of course, been cast under a cloud by the fact that, with a few profit centres excluded, the industry is not in a position to make a substantial contribution because of the taxes levied in freight rates, up-front royalties and the like. Before very much longer we are going to have to get to the stage where the Commonwealth says to the States that if they continue to proliferate taxes on mining, the Commonwealth will reduce reimbursements to the States by the amount of any new mining taxes. The alternative will be a hotch potch of State taxes. The opportunity for uniform Commonwealth mineral taxation will be diminished. This will be bad for Australia, bad for the mineral industry , bad for the coal mining industry and, of course, bad for the public revenue. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No one supports a tax which, in general terms, attacks an industry which is making continual losses. There is no doubt that at the moment the situation affecting many underground coal mines in New South Wales is one of losses, for a variety of reasons. If there is to be an export levy obviously it is important to be able to export the product. At the moment there is great difficulty in various sections of New South Wales in making sufficient exports to earn profits. The profitability of some underground mines in New South Wales is being undermined by their inability to export their coal. Substantial losses have certainly been suffered by the coal mines in the Burragorang Valley, for example. At the moment they are facing a transport crisis in their endeavours to get their coal on to the ships which queue off Port Kembla, as do many others queue, up to 40 or so at a time, off Newcastle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that because of a number of problems this tax is having an impact on companies that are not making a profit, and that is a concern for us all. A matter of equal concern is the fact that when the suggestion was made some time ago that the Federal Government should remove this export levy, representatives of the State Government of New South Wales intimated that they would favour the State Government imposing such a levy to replace it. In other words, there would be no net benefit to the coal mining industry. It seems to me that this legislation dramatises the serious problem that has emerged in this industry because both State and Federal governments want to get a slice of the action. Apparently they want to get as much money as they can out of this industry. It seems to me unfortunate that the industry is in the middle, particularly at a time when losses are the order of the day rather than the profits that the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) seemed to be looking to so enthusiastically. </PARA>
<PARA> I am intrigued at the use of the words 'resource rental tax' by the honourable member for Blaxland. In fact, he is not proposing such a thing at all. He is proposing a special super tax. If it were a resource rental tax mining companies would be paying a cost on the resource whether they were making a profit or not. The honourable member is simply talking about a specific tax on companies making what are held to be, in the view of the Labor Party, excessive profits. This is a specific tax which would hit a specific group in our economy. This kind of discrimination against any industry certainly raises questions and it particularly raises questions when one wonders who will be the people who will determine what is a super profit. Will these people take into account the losses that corporations may well have suffered in establishing their mining operations ? It seems to me that once we set out on a discriminatory course, picking out one industry for a special rate of income tax, we are putting at risk the approach of people to investment in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what is happening now in this industry. In New South Wales, for example, the industry has at last learned from Queensland. In Queensland the railway system is the secret taxing device, the hidden taxing device, that is used by the State Government to extract very substantial amounts from the mining industry. There is nothing any Federal Government can do about that. It seems to me that the slow learners in New South Wales have at last got the message and the Wran Labor Government is now endeavouring to do to the New South Wales underground coal mines in revenue terms what the Queensland Government has done to the Queensland coal mines. The only difference is that the Queensland coal mines can afford the huge rail freights. The New South Wales coal mines cannot afford them and are being sent to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intriguing to hear the honourable member for Blaxland tell us how important it is that the Government should levy a tax that relates only to profitability. After all, he is the President of the party in New South Wales which is endeavouring to impose through the railway system this insidious tax which bears no relationship whatsoever to profit. A rise of almost 50 per cent in rail freights in just over two years is being imposed on this industry by the party that is led in New South Wales by the honourable member for Blaxland. In this House the honourable member wears a different hat and speaks with a different tongue. He forgets that the coal export levy, which we are now debating and which now stands at $1 for the underground coal mines in New South Wales, was introduced back in the Labor government days by the then Labor Minister for Minerals and Energy, the late Rex Connor, and set at $6 a tonne. It is intriguing that not only does the present Labor Party spokesman on minerals and energy deny what the Labor Party did in those days-it was not good sense-but also he pretends that he does not support what his State colleagues are doing in having this insidious railways tax which is now quite properly being fought by the coal industry in New South Wales. An injunction is outstanding. I hope that the industry will be able to prevent the New South Wales Government from bringing about the destruction of several coal mines, the closure of several coal mines-certainly in my electorate-as a result of this device. </PARA>
<PARA> It is bad enough that the transport situation in New South Wales has been rendered chaotic by the Wran Government. The Transport Workers Union of Australia in conjunction with the mining unions, has now put to the State Government a proposal to buy the Port Kembla coal loader from the State Government. Let us face it, anyone could run that coal loader better than the State Government. There is no doubt that the Transport Workers Union, which has an interest in achieving some results in the getting of coal onto ships, in the transporting of coal from the Burragorang area, for example, to the Port Kembla coal loader, recognises what a disgraceful job the Labor Party in New South Wales has done in getting coal into ships. That is why there are huge queues off our ports. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it is of no use having a coal export levy if we cannot export the coal. It is of major significance to this Parliament and to this Government that these enormous delays in shipping coal out of Port Kembla and Newcastle have led to an immense reduction in potential levy revenue. They have worsened the profit situation of many of these companies. Because of their fixed overheads their costs of production tend to diminish as their volume of production increases. Certainly in many instances their costs can be spread over a much greater volume of production and therefore result in a smaller unit cost. It seems to me that the State Government in New South Wales, as a result of its policies, has not only done its best to limit production but also it is now doing something that is even more disgraceful. It is banning the transport of coal by road from my electorate, for example, to Port Kembla. It requires all the coal to go by rail through Sydney. The coal goes from the Burragorang Valley into Sydney and then down to the South Coast. That is an enormously long journey involving hundreds of trips by coal rail trucks through the suburbs of Sydney every week. It is interesting that the State Labor Government should be forcing coal rail trucks to rumble through the suburbs of Sydney when, as happened in the past, that coal can be transported directly from the Burragorang Valley to Port Kembla by coal trucks. The former system would work very well if there were a continuation of the upgrading of the road system; if the New South Wales Government supported the initiatives of the Federal Government in upgrading the coal roads which link Port Kembla with the Burragorang Valley and if the State Government allowed the proposals for the linking of those two areas with a major road to proceed. In fact the State Government has, in its usual dictatorial way, said that there will be no major link between the Burragorang Valley and Port Kembla for the purpose of carrying coal and that the new coal loader will be limited to only 2 million tonnes per year in terms of the amount of coal that can be received by road. That total amount will be taken up by coal mines that are in the immediate vicinity of that coal loader. In the Burragorang Valley there will be no opportunity whatsoever to send any coal by road, because that limit will be taken up. </PARA>
<PARA> It is intriguing to see this kind of assault on the coal industry by the New South Wales Government, an assault which is now proceeding via the rail freight scandal in which the State Government, having said to the industry 'you cannot take it by any means other than the railway' has in two years increased rail freight by almost 50 per cent. As I have said in this House once before, that is a real Chicago gangster standover tactic. I know of no other industry in Australia to which a State government has said: 'You cannot transport this material by any other means. We dictate to you that you will take it this way'. It seems to me that while we have State governments and Federal governments both competing for the coal industry's dollar, for revenue from the coal industry, we will have to face a very serious problem. I hope that the Federal Government will be able to lift this coal export levy and I want from the State Government of New South Wales an unequivocal guarantee that if the Federal Government, say in the next Budget, lifts this export levy-in other words to lift it entirely having already lifted $5 a tonne from Labor's export levy; it has now gone down from $6 to $1-the Labor Government in New South Wales will not reimpose its $1 a tonne or $3.50 depending on what kind of coal it is. Generally, in my area, it is $1 a tonne for the coal coming out of the underground mines. It seems to me absolutely essential that we get that assurance because, if the Federal Government were to lift this present export duty--</PARA>

He was a supporter of the government which introduced the $6 a tonne export levy which we have reduced to $1. Can I take any notice of that kind of interjection? If in fact the coal mines of New South Wales are to have to rely on the word of the State Labor Government, or its apologists in this House, they will end up with the $6 a tonne levy which they had when the Labor Party was in government in this country .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Cunningham mentions the Queensland Government. I would have thought he would have the wit to understand this. The Queensland Government is taking taxes from a group of coal mines that are making a lot of money. I recognise that the honourable member for Cunningham does not understand that in his electorate and mine there are coal mines which are not making money and where the coal miners have had their incomes savagely reduced, mainly as a result of the fact that they cannot meet their export contracts. They are way below their export contract level because they cannot export the coal because the unions who support the honourable member for Cunningham have had non-stop strikes and industrial disruption in the port of Wollongong. He knows all about the industrial disruption in Wollongong; he is an expert at it. We have had non-stop industrial disruption at Wollongong with the result that there are queues of ships out of that port and the coal loader seldom seems to work. Over the last two days there has been a tug strike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For heaven's sake, if the union movement in the Port Kembla area-which is employed in this case by the State Government, at least on the coal loader-has this sort of reckless indifference to the welfare of both the nation and the coal miners in my electorate, it seems a wonderful idea that the Transport Workers Union should take over that coal loader. I strongly support the proposition to be put to Mr Wran next week that the Transport Workers Union and the local coal miners, together with the new company they have formed, the Workers Port Kembla Coal Loader and Conveyor Co., should take over the coal loader. I hope that Mr Wran will agree to sell the coal loader to them and that they will be able to keep this old coal loader going in order to earn revenue for the State of New South Wales, and in fact to earn revenue for the Federal Government. It will enable the coal miners in my electorate to earn a decent sort of a wage again when they get back to higher production levels once they succeed in frustrating the negative anti-coal mine attitudes of the State Labor Government which are at present limiting their capacity to mine and to export their coal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is utterly disgraceful that in New South Wales there is an inability to meet contractural commitments to Japan because of the negative policies of the New South Wales Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague says, that would have been paid for by private enterprise. It seems to me a wonderful proposition. I hope that in the first place Mr Wran will accept this offer from the Workers Port Kembla Coal Loader and Conveyor Co. It is absolutely vital to the survival of the Wollondilly mines in the Burragorang Valley area of my electorate. I challenge Mr Wran now, through whichever member of the Opposition is prepared to listen, to say whether he would keep out of the area of an export levy or an alternative system of raising money if we remove the levy. I do not mean that he should have the opportunity to have another insidious transport tax. What is absolutely vital is that the coal miners in my area, in particular those in the underground coal mines of New South Wales, should be given a fair go. I must say that I do not like the existence of this coal export levy and I do not like the existence of the insidious State taxes. Until I get an assurance from Mr Wran that he will not reimpose a State charge if the Commonwealth lifts the levy I have to accept the view that the State government of New South Wales, and that of Queensland, will rip off the Federal revenue. At the moment the levy seems the only way for the Federal Government to raise money from this industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia's coal reserves are considerable, but are only about 4 per cent of world reserves and consist of about 18,000 million to 25,000 million tonnes of recoverable coal. Although we have only 4 per cent of world reserves, at the moment we control 18 to 20 per cent of the world trade in export coal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that any major Australian export-based resource industry should be based effectively on three criteria. It should provide for a gross profit and certainly not return an operating loss. It should offer maximum employment opportunity. It should also make a significant contribution to government revenue by way of taxes, levies and, if necessary, some form of public participation, to ensure that non-renewable resources are not consumed without an adequate return to the Australian people. Labor, when in government, perceived that this was not happening. Thus, in 1975, a $6 per tonne levy was imposed upon high quality coking coal. That situation was changed by the present Government in 1976 when the levy was reduced to $4 per tonne and then, in 1977, by a further 50c to $3.50. We had a further change in 1979 when the Budget provided for the retention of that figure for existing open cut mines of a depth of less than 60 metres, but reduced it to $1 for new open cut mines, underground mines and existing open cut mines of a depth of more than 60 metres. We have now moved to a situation in which the $1 levy will be extended to steaming coal. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Opposition-I will explain the reasons in a moment-would much prefer a resource based rent tax, it certainly would not oppose, in the absence of such a tax, the imposition of a $1 levy on steaming coal. However, although this Government will not admit it, a tonnage levy presents major problems. I will give two examples to explain what I mean. In the 1981 calendar year the Utah Development Corporation, despite industrial disputes, made an after-tax profit of $132.6m. Utah is a large open cut mining operator in the Bowen Basin of central Queensland. In the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), which adjoins my own, there is a small underground mine, South Bulli, which is run by the Bellambi Coal Co. Ltd. In the year in which Utah made its $132m profit, Bellambi Coal Co., which is now owned mainly by Shell, returned, amazingly, a $5.8m operating net loss. </PARA>
<PARA> This levy is discriminatory. Utah paid $3.50 per tonne, and Bellambi Coal Co. paid $1 per tonne even though the latter suffered a $5.8m loss. Labor's proposal is that a resource rent tax be imposed after company tax has been paid, on a project by project basis if necessary. The principle is very simple. It is applied at a certain threshold percentage of profit to capital investment and thus is aimed at giving a viable return to the investor. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us compare the return to federal revenue from Utah that would have been achieved in 1981 if a resource rent tax at a threshold level of 15 per cent and, for purposes of comparison, 100 per cent thereafter, rather than the current levy, had been imposed. Let me again explain, put simply, a resource rent tax can be applied at a predetermined threshold percentage of profits to fixed capital investment. Such a tax allows a viable return to investors. It can then be applied to company or project profits above that figure according to a predetermined percentage. Let us, then, compare the return to federal revenue from Utah at the current tonnage levy with what would have been raised if a resource rent tax had been imposed at a threshold level of 15 per cent and 100 per cent thereafter. For this purpose I ask that the relevant figures from the annual report of the Utah Development Corporation be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. It can be seen that in 1981 Utah's net profit amounted to $132.6m and that $53m was contributed to federal revenue by way of export levy. The fixed capital investment of the company in its five coal mines in the Bowen Basin of Queensland and in port facilities at Hay Point totals approximately $620m. Fifteen per cent of $620m is $93m. That is the level of after-company tax profitability at which the resource rent tax would operate in this hypothetical exercise. However, as the export levy would have been replaced by the resource rent tax mechanism, of the $53m raised from Utah in 1981 by the levy, $24m would have been paid in company tax and $29m would have been added to profits. So the relevant figures would then have been: $169.9m paid in company tax and company profitability of $161.6m. That figure is $68.6m above the threshhold at which the resource rent tax would have commenced. The total payment to federal revenue, including corporate income tax, branch profits tax, coal resource levy, excise tax and resource rent tax would have amounted in 1981 to $256.7m, compared with the $217m, including the coal export levy, that was actually paid. Thus, if in 1981 a resource rent tax had been applied to Utah at the threshhold levels that I have mentioned, instead of the coal export levy, $ 39.5m extra in federal revenue would have been collected from Utah.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The resource rent tax has the advantage, as I have shown, of not discriminating against smaller companies and underground mines. However, it has the disadvantage of being applied after State royalties and charges, taxes, rail freight and so on, have been imposed. There is also the possibility that transfer pricing will be resorted to and that companies will sell for less than world market prices. We can overcome transfer pricing arrangements and attempts at underpricing on the world market by resorting to the fixing of pricing parameters, as even this Government once attempted to do, although not so successfully as did my late and great predecessor, Rex Connor. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to combat underpricing and transfer pricing, we could refuse to grant export licences unless such pricing parameters were met. But a greater problem is the burgeoning size of State charges. I point out to the House the increasing nature of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the position as it applies to Utah. In 1977 the Queensland Government collected $20.8m from that company in royalties. By 1981 the figure increased to only $30m. But by 1981 the cost of rail freight had risen to $82m. The figure for 1979 was $47.5m. Utah's total payments in 1977 to the State of Queensland amounted to $23m but by 1981 had risen to $116.7m. In contrast, total federal taxes had only grown from $182m in 1977 to $217m in 1981. The return from the coal export levy had actually declined by $1.8m to $53m. In fact, the coal export levy returned to federal revenue from Utah last year was $53m compared with a total of $116.7m paid to the Queensland Government. It was actually less than the $82m that was paid to the Queensland Government in freight charges. </PARA>
<PARA> An ideal arrangement would be for the States to reach agreement with the Commonwealth to waive State charges and royalties, except perhaps for rail freight, to allow the imposition of a Federal resource rent tax, which is, of course, non-discriminatory, on a project by project basis, and with adequate reimbursement from the Commonwealth to the State governments involved. In regard to coal production, in 1981 Australia produced 92 million tonnes of saleable coal and exported 51 million tonnes-23.3 million tonnes from New South Wales and 27.7 million tonnes from Queensland. That is a very high export percentage. The Joint Coal Board predicts that by 1990 New South Wales alone could be exporting 75 million tonnes, at a high level prediction, or around 50 million tonnes at a low level prediction. I do not think that high level will be reached. There will be problems with port construction and transport, particularly between the southern fields of New South Wales and the Port Kembla loader. There possibly will be a world recession and falling oil prices; Japan will import less than expected. Nevertheless, as the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) has said, development will still be considerable, particularly in the steaming coal area, for domestic and export purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> In this situation it really is not good enough to have State governments and the companies themselves making the decisions to develop a new mine. It was because of this truth that in 1979 we decided there was a real need to expand the concept of the New South Wales Joint Coal Board into a Commonwealth coal authority which could be established with the States through a national fuel and energy commission and the States' statutory coal authorities. It could impose a policy of rational exploitation of Australia's coal resources with particular regard to the limited resources of certain types of coal, domestic requirements for coal and the balanced development of our coal exports. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on this note: There is a problem in some areas and in regard to some qualities of coal. The southern fields of New South Wales have an economically recoverable reserve of about 1.8 billion tonnes. At the exploitation rate anticipated for use of stage one of the new Port Kembla coal loader and some mild expansion in the local steel industry, the field would be eliminated within 75 or 80 years. If there were an exponential growth rate of 3 per cent that period would come back to 45 years and if there were an exponential growth rate of 6 per cent we could have less than 30 years supply of coal in the New South Wales southern fields, which of course supply not only the export market but also the great steel industry at Port Kembla which employs over 35,000 people. Certainly I do not want to put an anti-development case against the coal industry but there is a need to rationalise the development, particularly with regard to certain qualities of coking coal, and the possible deficiencies of certain quality coals in areas adjacent to the steel industry, to ensure that there is a long term future not only for the coal exporting industry but also for that other great and even more employment-intensive area, the domestic steel industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The provisions of the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill came into effect close to seven months ago; that is, at 8 p .m. on 18 August 1981-Budget night. In effect we are ritualistically dealing with this matter. The purpose of the Bill is to impose an export duty of $1 per tonne on black coal previously exempt from export duty. Up to now a duty has operated on exports of coking coal at a rate of either $3.50 per tonne or $1 per tonne, and these arrangements continue to exist. The coal concerned was measured in terms of its quality; that was the differentiating factor for this duty. Steaming coal was exempt but now the Government believes the industry is more buoyant and is capable of withstanding this new imposition. Of course steaming coal is in demand more now because of the increase in the price of oil that occurred in 1979. The Government has an entirely different view from the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), who seems to believe that there will be some kind of inevitable decline in the coal industry. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street), in his second reading speech on this Bill, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of changes in the world market for energy resources and the consequential strengthening of export demand for steaming coal the Government decided that there was no longer any reason to differentiate between coking coal and steaming coal in the application of the export duty. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that the honourable member for Macarthur was wrong on a number of fronts. There has been very considerable growth in the coal industry in New South Wales. It is as plain as a pike staff that there is no lack of confidence on the part of the private entrepreneurial people involved. They have never been so enthusiastic about ripping into this great inevitable bonanza. It is totally absurd for the honourable member to put the proposition with which we were confronted tonight. Almost everything he said was totally absurd and without foundation. I would like him to put to the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield) or to any Liberal member precariously holding his seat in Sydney that a coal loader should be built in Botany Bay, so contaminating it, in the face of all the environmental reports made about this matter. Yet he doggedly goes on with that kind of ridiculous contention. </PARA>
<PARA> Far from lacking confidence in New South Wales, the coal mining people are spending money as though it is going out of fashion. In 1979-80 capital expenditure in the industry in New South Wales totalled $198m. In the next year it was $480m-a peculiar lack of confidence, as I see it! In fact, more than double what was spent in the previous year was spent in 1980-81. The biggest rate of growth was in the northern and western areas of the State. The planned expenditure for 1981-82 is $1,140m. It is going up by leaps and bounds. That is more than twice the actual expenditure in 1980-81 and almost six times the expenditure of 1979-80. Honourable members do not have to take my word for this. These figures come from the report of the Joint Coal Board and I do not think anybody would call them into dispute. As at June 1981 employment in the New South Wales coal mining industry stood at 19,867 persons, 12.4 per cent more than the previous year. The post-war peak in 1952 was only 20,802, so we are nudging that figure now. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the honourable member for Macarthur says that this industry is going out of fashion and that the Wran Government has eroded confidence. One could not point to any other industry in all Australia over the whole of its history as having such an incredible, meteoric rise and expansion rate. Production in that year totalled 48.1 million tonnes, up 12.6 per cent over the previous year. Exports from New South Wales were up from 21,870 million tonnes to 23,710 million tonnes , an increase of 8.4 per cent. That is a record for all time, limited only by coal loading facilities-nothing else. That problem is being dealt with as effectively as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that a wrong emphasis is being brought to bear by the honourable member for Macarthur. He has made some disparaging remarks about the idea of a resource tax, which was put forward by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) and the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) as an alternative to the levy arrangement which is the subject of this Bill. But a levy represents a direct addition to costs rather than the sharing up of the profit. The merit of a resource rent tax, if applied on a project by project basis, is that it will operate as a levy on that portion of profit which is above the level necessary to maintain the viability of the project having regard to the risks involved. It is an eminently sensible proposition. In effect, it is a profit that could be had in respect to a very lucrative return. The arrangement that operates at present is a very insecure way for an industry to approach its entrepreneurial efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> I was impressed by a report which has recently come to hand. The report, which is dated January 1982 and comes from the Illawarra and Macarthur Group of Local Government Councils Research Committee into the Coal Mining Industry, was submitted to the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce which is examining the present state and prospects of the Australian export coal industry with particular reference to its contribution to the economy. The report, emanating from the source I have mentioned, naturally concerns itself with the problems affecting the coal mining industry in the areas represented by me-some of the biggest underground mines in Australia are in my electorate at Corrimal, Bulli, Helensburg, Coalcliff and quite a number of others-the honourable member for Cunningham and the honourable member for Macarthur. The general contention in the submission is to the effect that governments ought to be looking at the problems that are created as a result of the coal mining industry and should be making some contribution, through levies of the type we are discussing tonight, so that they can be alleviated. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not one who normally contends that money raised in an area should be spent on that area. I believe that all Australians should share benefits from the exploitation of Australian resources. But when an industry such as the coal mining industry has highly deleterious effects on a community and sets that community behind other communities in terms of environmental factors, road and bridge problems and so on, there seems to me to be a lot of sense in upholding the claim made in this submission that some special return should be made to the areas concerned from the proceeds of the industry. I want to put that kind of case here tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The significance of the mining industry in the South Coast mining areas which were the subject of the report is demonstrated by the fact that raw production in 1978-79-the last year mentioned in the report-was 16.373 million tonnes, close to half of which was exported. So in the first place we are talking about a very great export industry. The region is making a substantial contribution to the wellbeing of the nation. It is very interesting to note a table in the submission entitled 'Distribution of Coal Industry Revenue 1979-80' which sets out the deployment of revenue from this massive industry to workers in the industry, State and Federal government services and so on. State taxes and profits account for 15.6 per cent of the revenue in the region, Federal Government taxes account for 15 per cent and poor old local government gets only 1.5 per cent of the deal. The table indicates that company profits were at the surprisingly low figure of 3.6 per cent of all the revenue raised in the industry. But I really want to contrast the low figure that is returned to local government, which has to bear the brunt of all of the deleterious effects of the industry, with the comparatively high return to both the State and Federal governmental areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor D. Barnett, the Associate Professor of Mineral Economics at the Macquarie University, said that in 1979-80 total profits from New South Wales coal exports averaged $12.32 a tonne, of which the New South Wales Government received $5.38 a tonne, the Federal Government $5.18 a tonne, local government 52c a tonne and the coal companies $1.24 a tonne. Once again this demonstrates the infinitesimal proportion of revenue returned to local government. The report refers to large disparities in the valuation of land compared to adjoining properties. Land values varied from 3.74 per cent to 43 per cent. This relates to colliery land as against land used for other purposes. So local government cannot even pick up revenue from that source. I believe that the objective ought to be to marry the revenue from the coal export levy to the solution of problems created by the coal industry in areas where coal is extracted. My remarks certainly do not apply just to my own area in New South Wales though I have used it as an example. I believe the same kind of treatment is necessary in respect of many deprived areas of Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macarthur, who spoke a short time ago, is well known for being the spokesman for the road hauliers group in New South Wales. He could not give a damn whether the highly capitalised railway system of this State, which is a great instrumentality financed by the taxpayers of this country, pays or not. He does not care because he is generously supported in his election campaigns by the road hauliers. He is there to speak for them and I know he does it very effectively. But the fact of the matter is that we just cannot have a decent community when there are coal trucks running through the streets in a highly damaging and dangerous way, as happens in many of these areas. The city of Wollongong has almost been ruined as a result of this kind of activity. Accidents are the order of the day. Masses of people have been injured, maimed and killed. The honourable member for Macarthur believes that the truck hauliers should be aided and abetted and given unrestricted licence to continue. He gives the impression that it is not a good policy to get coal trucks off the road. Of course it is. The sensible thing is to do in this country what is being done in many countries, that is to carry coal on the people's railway to ensure that we get the best possible return from that kind of activity. </PARA>
<PARA> In my electorate new loading facilities have been erected for the purpose of facilitating the movement of coal by rail. Regrettably coal often has to be stored in unsightly storage bins. We need to use some of the money made by the industry to create a better environment. The same position applies in areas such as Wollongong and Port Kembla which are represented by my colleague the honourable member for Cunningham. An enormous coal loader is being constructed in his electorate. A coal loader is an ugly development no matter how nicely the problem is handled. There is a great need for environmental factors to be considered. As a consequence of this Bill the Government intends to reef another $130m out of the coal mining industry each year. I think it is reasonable that some of this money be given to areas which are suffering so adversely. According to all the well informed people in government and industry this prosperous industry is going to become more buoyant in the future than it ever has been in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The purpose of the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Amendment Bill is to enact the Customs tariff alterations introduced into the Parliament on 18 August 1981 by the Customs Tariff (Coal Export Duty) Proposals (1981) which formally proposed with effect from 8 p.m. on that day an export duty of $1 per tonne on black coal previously exempt from the export duty . As the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) has indicated, the Opposition is moving an amendment which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'whilst not declining to give this Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the existing coal export levies are indiscriminate and calls upon the Government to introduce legislation to abolish the coal export duty and replace it with a resource rent tax which takes into account the real level of costs and profits.'</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition has been consistent in campaigning around the question of a resource rent tax. It pleases me to know that increasing numbers of people are becoming convinced of the appropriateness of that type of approach. What I have been concerned about is the marked difference between the rhetoric and the substance of this Government's attitude towards levies on mineral production and , in particular, the Government's record on this levy. The honourable member for Blaxland indicated that in 1976 the present Government gave an undertaking that it would eliminate the coal export levy over a period of three years. Of course, like most of its undertakings that one was never honoured. In 1976-77 the total revenue derived from the export levy was $121.3m. In 1977-78 it declined to $100 .2m. During that year it was announced in the Budget that the rates would be reduced, and they were. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978-79 the revenue derived was $93.5m, so it had declined again. Again, during that year, an announcement was made at the time of the Budget that the levies would be abolished from 30 June 1979. Again, that undertaking was not honoured. In 1979-80, the revenue derived from the coal export levy again declined to $90.7m. From 1 November 1979 the $3.50 rate was reduced to $1 per tonne for underground mines and new open cuts which came into operation after 30 June 1980. In 1980-81 the total revenue derived from the coal export levy declined again to $84.9m. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to 18 August 1981 the levy applied to coking coal only. It was applied at two rates-$3.50 a tonne for the higher quality coking coal, which was mined from open cut mines that operated at less than 60 metres below the surface, and $1 a tonne for all other coking coal. However, since 18 August-this legislation is designed to give effect to the change on that day-the $1 per tonne levy is to apply as well to steaming coal. It is estimated that in 1981-82-during the current year-as a result of those adjustments the revenue to be derived from the coal export levy will increase to $115m. That includes the $10m which will be derived from the new levy. This assumes an increase in export tonnage of 17 per cent during the current year. It represents an increase of 35.5 per cent in the total revenue being derived from that levy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the contrast between undertakings that have been given by the Government on previous occasions and what in fact it has done. It is not my wish to defend the levy approach or the level at which that levy has been set. But during the debate when the original levy was introduced in 1975-it was fixed at $6 per tonne for high quality coking coal and $2 per tonne for lower quality coking coal-the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Adermann), who was the then Opposition spokesman on customs and excise, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that this tax is the most retrograde tax perhaps in the whole of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) interjected:</PARA>
<PARA> It is stopping development in the industry too. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the coal mining industry. The attitude of the honourable member for Paterson, whose electorate does contain a large number of coal mining projects and employs a large number of coal miners, seems remarkable given that he is not participating in this debate. The words spoken by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) give an indication that his approach, like the approach of the honourable member for Paterson, is of one kind when in Opposition and another when in government. His contribution has been weak and largely platitudinous. In 1975 the honourable member for Fisher also said:</PARA>
<PARA> I appeal that the Government should . . . remove this tax forthwith. </PARA>
<PARA>The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) who was at that time the Leader of the National Country Party in Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA> Above all, I do not believe in the philosophy of export taxes. They are retrograde taxes. They are a depressant against encouraging people to get into the export business. </PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned that levies of this kind are non-discriminatory. They are applied right across the board. It makes no difference whether the steaming coal which has been mined has been mined in a high cost, low profit project or whether it has been mined in one where the profits are higher. Of course, the lower profits are being made in the underground mines, many of which are increasingly becoming marginal. Underground mines are the largest employers of labour. There is no relationship at all between a levy of this kind and either the costs or the profits of any coal mining undertaking. Many of the coal mines producing steaming coal-mines to which this export levy will now apply-are marginal. For instance, at Camden, which is in the electorate of Macarthur, the suggestion that it be a requirement that all the coal be carried by road instead of rail brought an outcry from both the mining operators and the coal miners because the additional cost would place them in an awkward position and could bring about the closure of some of the marginal mines. In the Cessnock area, which is within my electorate, projects are under way at present. It is planned to mine deeper seams of steaming coal. They are essentially marginal projects and are yet to be proven. Millions of dollars have been invested in one project which still is to be proven. Despite that, this Government is imposing a tax which takes no account of the circumstances and the profitability of the mining ventures. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this month an announcement was made which indicated that Austen and Butta Ltd was now having a second look at its proposal to establish another underground steaming coal project in East Lithgow. Construction on that project was scheduled to start in the middle of this year. The total investment cost was to be $158m. It was proposed to export 3.1 million tonnes per year by 1989. The company indicated that recent increases in wages, rail freights and costs generally, which include this export levy on steaming coal, were among the factors which were causing it to have another look at that project. If that project does not go ahead, if those mines in the Cessnock area do not proceed and if those marginal mines in the Camden area close down and throw people out of employment as a result of additional costs being imposed by this Government, then this Government will have to take the responsibility for it. It does not matter very much what the honourable member for Macarthur says in connection with it. He indicated a very weak attitude towards this question. If he is genuine he is a latter day spokesman for the coal miners in the Camden area and in the Macarthur electorate. If he were genuine about the matter he would do the same sort of thing as the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck) does-he would cross the floor and vote against this legislation. But of course when the chips are down he is dictated to by the Government on whose side he sits, despite the fact that the decision that he makes in this place may well be against the interests of the coal miners in his area. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) in his second reading speech for imposing this duty on lower valued coal, principally steaming coal, which had been exempted from this duty, was that because of changes in the world market for energy resources and the consequential strengthening of export demand for steaming coal, the Government has decided that there is no longer any reason to differentiate between coking coal and steaming coal. What in fact the Government said, despite its rhetoric to the contrary, was that if there is some taxation revenue to be obtained by ripping off part of the profits of steaming coal miners, whether they are high cost or low cost producers, this Government will step in and do something about it. What a remarkable contrast this is with the statement that the Leader of the National Country Party made in 1975 when the National Country Party was one of the coalition parties in opposition. Referring to the Labor Government's proposal, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> But no, if there are any prospects that someone will have a boom or success this Government will clamp down as hard as it can. I am just staggered that the Government is doing it to the coal mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Where does he stand now in connection with this proposal and what attitude is he adopting in relation to this levy that is being imposed? The timing of this proposal is absolutely absurd. In the first place there is a world oil glut and this is having an effect on steaming coal prices and the effectiveness with which we can market our steaming coal. Increasing volumes of steaming coal are coming from the west coast of North America, from the Gulf area of North America and from South Africa, and all this steaming coal is going into those markets which we were hoping would be markets in which we would have a greater share. The Japanese are in the process now of providing finance, expertise and advice to China in order to develop the steaming coal deposits in China. The world steaming coal market is flat and there is every reason for us not to believe that the increased market and the higher prices that have been experienced over recent years will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment is in the terms that this type of indiscriminate levy, which will be imposed across the board, should be replaced by a resource rent tax. A resource rent tax would be discretionary, profit related and free of any distortionary impact on the industries and minerals upon which it is imposed. But because of the vacuum being created by this Government and its reluctance to introduce such an appropriately structured tax on excess profits made from resource development, the states are increasingly stepping in to fill the breach . For example, in the Northern Territory the bauxite royalties have been renegotiated. The Northern Territory Government has also considered levying a profit related royalty of 35 per cent on a pre-tax, net profit on various mineral development projects in the Northern Territory. The Queensland Government has increased the rail freights on the movement of minerals, particularly coal. There was also that $220m sweetener that was included in the winning bid for the prospecting rights in the Winchester South coal deposits in central Queensland. In Victoria there was an increase in the pipeline fees. Also the State Electricity Commission imposed increased charges. In New South Wales- reference has been made to this by others-there have been increases in rail freights. The proposed lease fee in New South Wales of 25c a tonne on coal through the new Kooragang Island coal loader will be based on a minimum throughput of 10 million tonnes. In Western Australia a tax arrangement has been established by agreement with the Ashton Joint Venturers under which the government will levy a 22.5 per cent profit related tax once profits reach a trigger level of $20m per annum. So the States are stepping in. The vacuum has been created by this Government. Until this Government takes a more sensible and more responsible attitude towards the whole question of the appropriateness of correctly structured tax on the profits being made on resource development, this situation will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I advise the Government and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) that not only are they missing out on the opportunity to introduce an appropriately structured resource rent tax but also, because the States are stepping in to fill the vacuum, most of the levies, the charges, the extra freights, the additional fees and the extra royalties that are being imposed by the States, are costs which are applied before tax. This means that not only is the Commonwealth missing out on the possibility of a resource rent tax but also, because the States are stepping in to fill the vacuum, it is missing out on the correct share of company tax. How absurd and how indefensible. Increasingly, people are supporting the proposition of a resource rent tax. This proposition is being increasingly supported by resource developers themselves because they do not not know where the additional State charge, special tax, extra freight, levy or royalty will bubble up next. Of course mineral developers want something which is sensible and which is appropriately structured and which gives them reason to believe that they can be sure and secure about the future. They do not want new charges being thrown at them every week. I support the Opposition's amendment to the effect that this levy be abolished and replaced by an appropriate resource rent tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in relation to this proposition was more significant in what it concealed than in what it revealed. The purpose of this amending Bill, to which the Government has already given notice of an amendment which the Minister will move at the Committee stage, is to provide for additional tax-sharing grants and special allocations totalling $69m to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, and to provide for the payment of a fixed tax-sharing grant of $315.1m to the Northern Territory. Both of those provisions relate to the current year, 1981-82 .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said that the Treasurer's second reading speech was more remarkable for what it concealed than for what it revealed. This piece of legislation has an interesting background. The events which have led up to it illustrate probably better than many other developments the arrogant and cynical attitude that this Government has taken towards the States and the contempt which it shows for the States and their governments. Fundamental to the whole mess involving State grants and the formulas which are being applied and the volumes which are involved is the present Government's supposed new federalism. Many of the States were encouraged in the first place to support the concept of new federalism because they believed that the Commonwealth Government would be increasing the total value of assistance available to them. What in fact happened, of course, was that while untied grants and general revenue grants, were increased, specific purpose grants, special grants and capital grants were reduced to a greater extent. So in real terms the States are now worse off than they were in 1975-76 as a result of the last Budget of the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The income tax sharing arrangements which apply currently replaced the previous financial assistance grants in 1976-77. Prior to that, 33.6 per cent of the year 's personal income tax collections were provided for the States in untied grants , and, as a result of them being related to that year's taxation, the States could never be certain about the total amount that they would receive during any year. So the formula was changed in 1978-79 to relate it to the personal income tax collections of the previous year, and in that year the formula resulted in 39.87 per cent of personal income tax being granted to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The States have been deliberately manipulated by the Fraser Government into a seriously disadvantaged position. While that was going on, the Government was also flagging the possibility that there would be a major switch from personal income tax to indirect taxes. It was also flagging the possibility that tax indexation would be applied consistently and continuously. If in fact those impressions had been realised, the States would have been in a position in which the personal income tax to which their grants were being related would have been increasing at a rate slower than that of other Commonwealth revenue. The States then were manipulated into a position in which they felt that other forms of taxation would be increasing more rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that the States, in their submission to the Commonwealth early in 1981, suggested that the base for the determination of those grants be either personal income tax or total tax, because they were concerned that the base for the income tax sharing arrangement would be continually eroded. The Commonwealth proposed, after a transition year in 1981-82, that the arrangements move to a total tax base. The standard percentage would be the State grants of 1981-82, which were based on 39.87 per cent of the personal income tax of the previous year, 1980-81, and that the 1981-82 grant would then be expressed as a percentage of total tax receipts in the previous year and that then would determine the percentage which would be applied for grants of that kind in subsequent years. Apparently the percentage has worked out to be 20.72 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Having got the States to accept and, in fact, to encourage the movement to a total tax base, the Government abandoned tax indexation. The result is, of course, that next year personal income tax collection, which had previously formed the basis for the allocation of State grants, will rise at a rate faster than any other area of taxation and will bring to the Commonwealth an additional $5,000m. The States will not share in that to the extent that they should. </PARA>
<PARA> The States were also conned by the Commonwealth Government as a result of the Premiers Conference which, we well remember, was held on 4 May 1981. This incident provides part of the background for the amending Bill which the House is now considering. We well remember on that occasion the Treasurer admitting that, with the concurrence of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), he had leaked a Cabinet decision which set an upper limit of a further $70m. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister publicly chortled and gloated about the way in which they had conned the States. That accounts for the fact that this legislation provides for the allocation of an additional $69m-very close to that upper limit to which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister failed to go, which would have represented an additional $70m for the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, on that occasion, the States were extremely upset-even to the extent that the Liberal Premier of Western Australia was demanding the immediate resignation of the Treasurer. But the Treasurer was not the only person responsible for that decision. The Treasurer was not prepared to accept on his own shoulders the responsibility for that decision, and it became quite obvious that the Prime Minister was personally involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The specific background to these supplementary grants is related to the fact that total tax sharing grants, once determined, must then be allocated among the States. This is done on a weighted per capita basis. From 1976 to 1981 the weights used were the per capita relativities which applied in 1975-76. These relativities did not reflect any concept of fiscal equalisation but evolved basically through a process of historical accident. In fact, Russell Barton, in the Sydney Morning Herald on 11 June last year, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> According to Government officials, the proposed division of funds would redress the imbalance created by years of political patronage by the Federal Government towards the smaller States. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the fault of not just this Government; governments over a long period have created this imbalance as a result of the political patronage they showed those States. </PARA>
<PARA> Three years ago, as a result of that situation developing, the Commonwealth Grants Commission was charged with responsibility for determining a new and a fairer distribution of total general revenue grants. Its report was presented to the Parliament on 10 June last year and was considered by the Premiers Conference on 20 June. That report recommended the reallocation between the States of almost $300m of the total of the general revenue grants which were being made available to the States. New South Wales was supposed to receive an additional $118m; Victoria was supposed to receive an additional $68.2m; Queensland was supposed to receive an additional $108.3m. In fact, New South Wales will finish up receiving-this legislation gives effect to it-only $24.5m; Victoria will receive only $15m; and Queensland will receive only $20.5m, together with an additional once only grant of $9 million which is being made available to Queensland because of the adjustment that has been made in the estimation of the population base. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1976-77 and 1979-80, the real value of the States' general revenue grants was maintained only by the guarantee arrangement linked to the formula that was applied by the Whitlam Government. The States found themselves in increasingly difficult circumstances because the Commonwealth was retreating from many areas in which it had previously been involved and at the same time leaving those responsibilities to the States without giving the States the financial capacity to see them through. Stage 2 of this supposed new federalism was to provide for the States to have discretion either to increase or to reduce the tax being applied in each of the States, depending upon their own discretion . Fortunately, up to the present, no State has passed the enabling legislation. In connection with the whole question of taxation policy and fiscal management, the States are showing themselves to be much more responsible than this Government. I indicated on a previous occasion that in this year alone total Commonwealth Government revenue will be $7,819 million higher in real terms than it was in the last Labor Budget and that total Commonwealth grants to the States will be down in real terms to the extent of $1,736m. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements contained within this legislation are not opposed by the Opposition. They give to those States which the Commonwealth Grants Commission had indicated were being underfunded in terms of an appropriate grants formula an additional $69m, when the amount of $70m was kept from them during the Premiers Conference in May of last year. There is concern on the part of the Opposition about the amendment, notice of which has been given and which presumably will be moved by the Treasurer at the Committee stage. I will have more to say about that amendment at that stage because I am not clear on a number of the details regarding the meaning and the impact of that amendment. If my concern is justified the Opposition will oppose that amendment, but at this stage the Opposition is in favour of this legislation which will give effect to the granting of the additional funds to those States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment to the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Bill which we are presently debating has considerable significance for the Northern Territory because it is this amendment which appropriates $315.1m for general revenue funds to the Northern Territory Government. Unlike those for the States, the financial arrangements that apply between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory are written down in a memorandum of understanding agreed to by the respective governments. General revenue assistance is one of the basic elements of Commonwealth assistance to the Northern Territory. The amount is analogous to a State's tax sharing entitlement and is determined by the formula laid down in the memorandum of understanding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present arrangements are very satisfactory and are quite clearly contributing to the solid growth the Northern Territory economy is undergoing at the moment. I do want to point out however that since the first meeting in 1977, determining the financial agreement between the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth-a meeting that I attended-it was made perfectly clear that as far as the Commonwealth was concerned, the special circumstances and the particular difficulties of the Northern Territory would be fully recognised and provided for in funding arrangements. I will return to this point later. </PARA>
<PARA> Ensuring a high level of funding for the Northern Territory is important for a number of reasons. The Northern Territory population base is too small to be able to collect enough revenue to provide services that are comparable to those enjoyed by other States. In addition, the Government must face extra costs in providing for residents in outlying and inaccessible areas. The money is essential if the Northern Territory is to promote growth and development and if we are to attract industry to the Territory. The end result of this, of course, will be a lessening of our dependence on Commonwealth funds. The fourth reason is that the Territory Government must provide for a large number of disadvantaged people, notably Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA> Few people would disagree that the pace of development in the Northern Territory since self-government has been remarkable. We have been able to attract many people disillusioned with reduced opportunities in the south. The population of the Northern Territory has grown by as much as 7 per cent per annum, meaning that much of the Territory Budget has had to be devoted to the social infrastructure necessary to cope with such expansion. For the Northern Territory 1981 was a year of real achievement. Whilst we have not escaped the problems being felt throughout Australia, and indeed in most Western economies- problems such as pressures on interest rates, pressures on inflation and a loss of competitiveness in our overseas markets-I believe that we in the Northern Territory have fared better than has the rest of the country. The international slump in commodity prices has squeezed our resource ventures but the exploration and development of our minerals is still surging ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Our economy in the Northern Territory is steadily gaining in strength as it diversifies into new ventures. The tourist industry is looking to beat its recent record growth rate again in the coming year. The heads of agreement for the $100m Yulara tourist village have been signed and work on the complex will begin soon. Last year saw the announcement of a new airport terminal for Darwin- a move which has occurred not before its time. New tourist accommodation was completed in Tennant Creek, Katherine and Alice Springs. New international hotel developments will create a total of 500 rooms in Darwin before 1984, while in Alice Springs a further 600 rooms will be finished by mid-1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, 1981, was a year of mixed blessings for our mining industry. The slump in prices of commodities on the world market forced three or our major mining ventures to cut back on production; namely, those at Gove, Tennant Creek and Groote Eylandt. This, along with industrial trouble, notably at Gove, proved to be a blow to our economy and, as a consequence, decreased the amount of revenue that could be collected by the Northern Territory Government in the form of royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand it is pleasing to report some developments in the mining industry which give cause for hope. This year has great potential for our uranium deposits. The town of Jabiru is established as the centre of the uranium province. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has lifted its ban on loading yellowcake at the Darwin wharf, thus removing a serious impediment to that industry. Recent media reports suggest successful negotiations are being carried out between the Northern Land Council and both Pancontinental Mining Ltd and Denison Mines over their uranium deposits in the Alligator Rivers Region. Investment in oil exploration in the Territory and off our shores over the next six years is expected to be more than $700m. First signs of oil in the Amadeus Basin and the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf have provided the necessary impetus for continuing exploration. The growth in our economy, the surge of capital projects and the new investment and industry in the Northern Territory have, in the main, been due to the aggressive way the Territory has promoted itself in Australia and overseas since self-government. </PARA>
<PARA> To give briefly some perspective to the grants involved in the Bill we are discussing today, and in particular the component of $315m for the Northern Territory, I would like to compare this with other forms of government assistance. The Northern Territory is often branded as a millstone around the nation's neck, as a liability, as an area where Commonwealth money brings no return. There is a contention that the Territory requires a level of support from the rest of Australia that imposes intolerable burdens on the nation. Yet, by comparison with the level of assistance given to manufacturing industry in the southern States the so-called burden of the Northern Territory is very small indeed. The Northern Territory economy has no share at all in the $6,000m tariff protecton subsidy levied on the Australian taxpayer. None of the industries covered by protection are represented in the Northern Territory in any meaningful way. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, continued high levels of protection actually place Northern Territory industry at a disadvantage. The cost to the Northern Territory economy is estimated at $50m. Not only does high protection raise the cost of goods in our market and penalise Territory consumers but also, by exerting upward pressure on the exchange rate, it reduces the competitiveness of Northern Territory beef and minerals in overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the considerable disadvantage in revenue raising at which the Northern Territory was placed under the new health funding arrangements announced last year. When the new health funding levels were announced in June last year I made my reservations very clear in this House. My concern that the Territory would encounter difficulties in raising sufficient revenue to run its own health system was based on two reasons: Firstly, the Northern Territory Government had inherited the Darwin hospital from the Commonwealth with an expensive cost structure and a high cost of maintenance; and secondly, the Northern Territory has an exceptionally high level of disadvantaged patients; in particular, Aborigines who are unable to pay for health care. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I agree with the thrust of the Federal Government's health policies I can say only that the Commonwealth has made a serious miscalculation in the amount of revenue it thought the Territory could raise from its hospitals. In fact there are simply not enough paying patients in Territory hospitals to achieve the Commonwealth's estimate of additional revenue. The trends which were evident after three months of operation have, after five months, shown a further decline in bed days, occasions of service and, consequently, revenue. It would now appear that the Northern Territory will face a revenue shortfall of $4.67m in this financial year and even higher losses in 1982-83. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a number of months honourable members on the Government side of the House have been continually decrying the fact that the Commonwealth Government expends some $450m per annum on the supporting parent's benefit. They have blamed the necessity for this expenditure on everything from family breakdowns to modern advertising. I think many honourable members on the Government side have not taken account of the reasons why many women and men who are supporting their children alone end up going onto the supporting parents benefit. In my view the two reasons are the lack of employment prospects and, more importantly, the lack of secure long day care facilities for the minding of pre-school age children and after school care and before school care for school age children. Unless the Government addresses itself to those two questions, the latter in particular, it will find no way of reducing the number of people who are on the supporting parent's benefit. In 1980 the Government spent only $80m on the provision of child care facilities. It is no wonder there are insufficient long day child care facilities in Australia. Compared with the position in 1976 when there was an allocation of $ 67.3m, the 1980 expenditure represents a net reduction in real terms of over 50 per cent in the Government's commitment to child care. Family day care facilities provide long day care for working parents. It is an area in which I believe the Government has acted despicably by reducing funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my electorate there are three family day care schemes, two operated by local government authorities-the Marrickville and Canterbury councils-and one community based scheme operated by the Ashfield Infants Home. In New South Wales there are nearly 60 family day care schemes. Forty of that number are operated by local government authorities and about 20 are operated by community based groups. The Government has not increased the family day care schemes subsidy of $7 a child a week since 1977. It is five years since the Government increased the grant that is made under this scheme. In that time, by the Government's own reckoning, inflation and costs have risen by 40 per cent. How are these schemes, which provide a very worthwhile role in our community, supposed to exist when the Government freezes their income? They either go to the wall or they can adopt the view that some honourable members on the Government side suggest-that is, charge up to $80 a week for child care. I put it to the House that shop assistants, men and women on low incomes and supporting children on their own, would find those sorts of costs absolutely unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The worst thing about the present Government's policy is that it is forcing the community based family day care schemes to go to the wall. The two local government authorities in my electorate are about $20,000 in debt for their schemes at present but they are willing to shoulder the cost and meet it from general rate revenue. But what happens to the community based organisations when they end up $20,000 in the red? They cannot get an overdraft. They either have to put their fees up or close down. Looking at the approach of the present Government one would think that it is probably looking at closing down some of these schemes. That is bad economics because the scheme that the Canterbury Council runs-it does not cost the Commonwealth Government all that much-caters for 150 children. The scheme that the Marrickville Council runs caters for 175 children. Family day care is the cheapest and the most flexible form of child care for the Commonwealth Government to provide. However, this Government continues to starve these schemes of funds. It is imperative that the Government , when considering the Budget this year, take into account the perilous state of family day care in Australia and that it increase the subsidy. It has not been increased since 1977. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The high incidence of industrial disputes on Australia's waterfront and in our shipping industry is cause for national shame, or it should be. In 1981 these disputes cost Australia almost $1 1/2m a day. When one examines the record for 1981 one discovers that in that year there was not a single day which was completely free of disputes affecting some aspect of Australian shipping-on the waterfront, at sea or in transporting goods to the waterfront. That is a disgraceful record. The year was capped by the decision of the world's largest strike insurer to increase charges for existing associates' shipping through Australian ports to three times the world average, and that insurer refused to cover any new members. This is a humiliation for all Australians. The Republic of Korea, our fourth biggest beef market, is deeply concerned about our inability to deliver our meat on time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Japan has expressed that concern on a number of scores, including coal, iron ore and wool in particular. But it is not merely our exporters who are being damaged. Local processors and manufacturers are also being affected. Many local enterprises are dependent on imported materials and components for their businesses. I have been contacted by a number of manufacturing concerns in my own electorate when these troubles have arisen. They have said to me that if the goods are not cleared from the docks within a matter of days they will have to close down their production lines or part of their plants. Without the supplies being efficiently transported, unloaded and delivered, their production lines grind to a halt and they cannot continue to employ people. Australian employees should be deeply concerned about that sort of activity. In the end Australian consumers must meet the costs of delays, storage costs and the need for importers to obtain further finance to maintain stocks held up in ships or on the wharves. Australian consumers should be outraged at having to pay for these extra costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, 1981 did not have one day completely free of disputes affecting at least some sector of shipping. Many of these disputes probably could have been resolved without the need for a stoppage. Some arose because of petty demarcation disputes between the many unions involved on the waterfront. Money alone certainly cannot be the reason for this disgraceful industrial record because many of the strikes had nothing to do with money. Since container shipping was introduced in 1969 a typical change in the average weekly earnings of waterfront union members is from about 3 per cent above the all industries average to 33 per cent above the all industries average. Unless the unions and employers make a real effort to improve the industrial record, export income and jobs will be lost to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> A summary of significant industrial disputes disrupting sea transport in 1981 was issued by the Department of Transport in January this year. It makes instructive, if rather depressing, reading. I think that all honourable members ought to obtain a copy of that document. It lists a number of the disputes which occurred on our wharves and in our shipping industry and comments on the causes and the impact of the disputes. Let me give a few examples of those that were not concerned with money. A large proportion of them were concerned with such things as employment practices, the selection of apprentices, and so on. One dispute involved Seatainer Terminals Ltd at West Swanston, Melbourne. There were stoppages and pickets after men were dismissed by the company for refusing to work with apprentices selected by the employer. The cause of the dispute related to the selection of apprentices. The union demanded the employment of apprentices approved by them, in some cases relatives. Approximately $60m worth of cargo was held up and ships by-passed the port because of the dispute. The men were reinstated after agreement between Seatainer and the unions. Again in Melbourne, one dispute involved a ban on the handling of rail freight following objections by the Waterside Workers Federation to the Victorian Government's adoption of the Lonie report on rail services. That was a political issue in Victoria, a matter of Government policy on which all electors can have their opinions, and about which they are free to agitate and to engage in political activity. But here was a union on the waterfront bringing about a dispute because of that Government's action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a continent which, prior to the advent of the white man, was covered with huge tracts of virgin forest, the Australian logging industry is depleting our forests in a rapacious and criminal fashion. In Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland the ravages of the saw-millers and wood chippers have left enormous scars on our landscape. In Queensland, with the aid of the Forestry Department, the logging industry has destroyed, in 100 years, half of the tropical rain-forest which stretches from Ingham to Cooktown. The Forestry Department talks about harvesting trees at a sustainable yield, yet no one in the Department has established, by suitable research, exactly what is a sustainable yield. In consequence, it has set high level of quotas which are completely denuding the rain-forests. This treatment of the rain-forests will eventually result in the degradation to such an extent that the Queensland Forestry Department will elect to clear them in order to plant pine trees or allow the land to be taken up for farming, all in the name of progress. Anyone who journeys to Queensland can see the evidence of the indiscriminate planting of pine forests in what were once areas of great natural beauty. The Department talks about conservation in the rain-forests but conservation is not concomitant with logging operations. Conservation in rain-forests means protection from man- induced change and the euphemistic term 'selective logging' really means partial clearing, which is quite contrary to any accepted conservation methods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that once the forest canopy has been opened up by selective logging more species grow than ever before. However, the saw-millers fail to point out that the secondary growth is weedy, widespread, short-lived and contributes nothing to the diverse rain-forest ecosystem. The rain-forest area may not decrease in area because of logging activities but it will decrease in biological value. Our rain-forests are not necessarily being subjected to outright destruction but they are suffering a slow deterioration through species lost as a result of logging activities. A particular problem is that not sufficient research is being undertaken into the long term effects of selective logging in the rich environment of our rain-forests. Rain-forests are so rich in species that only a few individuals of one species occur in one hectare. Logging , even in small numbers, therefore causes a great reduction in the number of individuals as a percentage of the species population. The reductions affect the balance of nature for both trees and the animals which depend on them. The consequence is that, while some species will prosper, others will fall below the threshold number for survival, which could mean the extinction of the species. </PARA>
<PARA> Another example of the despoiling of forests is the attempt by the wood chipping industry to open up the Otway Ranges for wood chipping. The wood chippers promised to be careful in their operations and promised to preserve the forests. But, as I mentioned before, the desecrated areas in Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania make it clear that they cannot keep their promises. The Liberal State Government has a lot to answer for when it agreed to establish a wood chip mill and ship loading facilities to harvest wood chips from the Otways . Under pressure from conservationists and local residents who appreciate the value of this beautiful area of Victoria, the Government has now agreed to an environmental effects statement. However, the Government has also agreed that existing saw-logging contractors can continue their operations. This decision is appalling and is certain to be another reason why the Liberal State Government will be defeated at the polls on 3 April. Forests all over Australia are being destroyed in the name of progress and private enterprise. These forests are a valuable heritage of the Australian people and should not be destroyed. It is time that the Federal Government took a lead and called on State governments to cease their destruction of our great forests. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is not whether wood chipping will have an effect on forest ecosystems but how damaging that effect will be. The problem is that we just do not know the answer because we need the results of long term research studies. What is needed is a national plan to halt and reverse the present decline in the number of trees in Australia. The need is urgent and the Federal Government should act now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last sitting week the honourable member for Wills ( Mr Hawke) fought a battle royal to present a motion to the Parliament on unemployment. Considering the great efforts of that member to be heard, I could only presume that he had proposals of great moment and consequently I hurried to the House to be enlightened. To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. He commenced by telling us about unemployment and on that we concede his expertise. He and his affiliates of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, ably assisted by the Whitlam Government, were the authors of unemployment in Australia. I waited for him to give a solution to today's problems. He eventually got to that point. He commenced by speaking about job creation schemes. By that, he meant government-structured job creation schemes. As Hansard records, I interjected, in amazement: 'Like the RED scheme'. I say that I interjected in amazement because to me the Regional Employment Development scheme became the cross too big for the faltering Whitlam Government to bear. I thought that the Opposition would like to see it buried. But no, the member for Wills went on to defend that very scheme. In fact he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Hoping that my remarks may permeate even some thick minds, I say this: The evaluation of the RED scheme conducted not by the Australian Labor Party but by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations under this Government in 1977 concluded that when viewed in a broad social and economic framework the scheme's benefits outweighed its costs. </PARA>
<PARA>I dispute also the findings of that committee. The Regional Employment Development scheme was commenced on 10 September 1974 as, and I quote from a document relating to it:</PARA>
<PARA>a manpower measure having as its objectives the improvement of employment opportunities in areas of excessively high unemployment by encouraging local initiative in these areas to develop suitable work programmes. . . . At least 50 per cent of all approved grants to projects had to go toward the cost of employing people who were currently registered as unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Wills could not even stay for a whole speech the other day. He had to go at tea time. I was in local government exercising my brain to attract as much RED money to my town as we could get. We started with the same great enthusiasm for the scheme as did the Government. We identified the need for footpaths. Provided we used 1920 technology, it was possible to meet the labour-materials ratio required. We received a grant, collected our unemployed workers from the Commonwealth Employment Service and went to work. That afternoon a group of proud councillors went to inspect the first day's production. Then we learnt our first lesson. Unemployed people could not build footpaths, even with the supervision we provided. The job was a tragedy. The men with the ability to do the work already had jobs. Good local government people do not get deterred by things like that. Arrangements were made and seasonal workers or building tradesmen were encouraged to register as unemployed when gaps appeared in their itineraries. Before long, we had an efficient work force. The original hard core of unemployed people were back on the dole. Of course, the labour requirement still reduced substantially the amount of footpaths we could produce but we saw them as something for nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All that the RED money succeeded in doing was to take men off the regular labour market. In my district, employers of seasonal labour complained bitterly over the lack of their regular labour pool and the dole queue regained its original size. How better to prove this than to look at the registered unemployed during the period of the scheme. During the life of the RED scheme from 1974 to 1976, they grew Australia-wide from 105,800 to 236,800. This was not an isolated situation. My position on the executive of the Country Shire Councils Association of Western Australia gave me contact with all of the State' s local authorities. Everywhere I went the story, with variations, was the same. All work completed was of such poor quality that it had to be redone by skilled labour. We spent $183m of taxpayers' funds on low priority public requirements, often with very shoddy workmanship. We did not create new jobs; in most cases we just transferred workers from the private to the public sector and then threw them back. Jobs will be created only when goods can be bought by willing purchasers whether they be taxpayers or consumers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his statement in the House yesterday said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Their goal, which we all share has been the higher living standards for Australia's families. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to comment on this because evidently some of the Prime Minister's back benchers have not heard of this new-found concern for families. Their calls for cuts in supporting parent's benefits and the means testing of family allowances, as detailed in the Australian on Thursday, 18 February, have caused a great deal of concern, particularly to the Brotherhood of St Laurence which in its social issues news statement of 18 February had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Liberal backbenchers calls for cuts in supporting parent's benefits and for the means testing of family allowances were ill-informed and if heeded, could jeopardise the security of families, and the welfare of children in this country ' the Executive Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, Rev. Canon Peter Hollingworth said today. He went on to say that there is a danger that the suggestions would reinforce the current anti-family direction of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I have spoken before in this House on the evident anti-family direction that this Government's policy has been taking. I point out that over the past five years Government policies have progressively disadvantaged families by failing to increase family allowances in line with inflation and to index the rent and children's allowance components of supporting parents benefits and pensions. There has been a strong transfer of resources away from families, with the result that many are now being pushed into poverty. It makes short work of the Prime Minister's statement today that the Government is looking for higher living standards for all Australians. Evidently it just means some Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Reverend Hollingworth points out that 72 per cent of supporting parent beneficiaries have no other income than the benefit-$69 a week plus $10 for each child and various supplementary benefits. Only 7 per cent of such beneficiaries earn more than $2,548 a year. Only 12 per cent of supporting mothers, and 32 per cent of supporting fathers, own their own homes. The Social Welfare Policy Secretariat report on poverty measurement revealed that 52 per cent of single parent families have incomes below $6,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> If Government back benchers are complaining about the rise in the cost of the supporting parents benefit since it was introduced, they should have a good look at some of the causes, because some are directly attributable to Government's policies. For example, rising unemployment causes stress and breakdown in families and makes it very difficult for supporting parents. </PARA>
<PARA> Other factors in the rise are inflation, the extension of benefits to supporting fathers in 1977- we welcomed that-and the tendency for some divorced and deserted mothers to apply for supporting parent benefits rather than the widows pension to which they were entitled. Canon Hollingworth pointed out that cuts in supporting parent benefits would lead to increased costs in other areas which, in turn, would certainly lower the standards of living of some Australians. He was referring to mental health care, emergency relief, institutional child care and, in the long term, juvenile crime. The cost of keeping a child in an institution in Victoria is now estimated to be up to $350 a week. That does not take into account the cost of the despair and unhappiness which taking such a step creates in a family. The number of children in institutions has declined steadily since the introduction of the supporting parent's benefit. The number of children admitted to State wardship in Victoria declined from 1,055 in 1975-76 to 680 in 1979-80. That really is of great benefit to families. </PARA>
<PARA> Canon Hollingworth concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> The proper and humane government response to these problems should not be further harassment and crackdowns but the raising of supporting parents' benefits and pensions and the relaxing of income tests so that parents can bring up children with a decent standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA>Also, according to an article in the Australian of 19 February, Ms Philippa Smith, the policy analyst for the influential Australian Council of Social Service, said that reducing welfare payments to single supporting parents would make it impossible for many of them to keep their children. She went on to say that most received pensions because they could not find work and were already living in quite desperate poverty. She added:</PARA>
<PARA> A lone parent pensioner with two children gets $104.20 a week at the moment, including the family allowance. This is $19.40 a week below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Miss Smith said federal MPs should consider the children dependent on single parents before they made welfare cutbacks. </PARA>
<PARA> 'It's not only the parents that they're punishing, it's the children', she said . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a time of concern for the problems of small business I believe that the House should be made aware of a remarkable case of official mismanagement which has resulted in the denial of just compensation to a small business and forced it into receivership and considerable loss. It is a story lasting several years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1973 the firm, James Yates Pty Ltd, a producer of kid leather, was badly affected by the 25 per cent tariff cuts of that year. It had been a viable operation for over 80 years, but as a result of the tariff cuts it could no longer continue profitably to produce kid leather. The then government offered assistance under the Structural Adjustment Assistance Scheme to firms adversely affected by its tariff policies, so the company applied for a loan to enable it to diversify its production and so remain in business. It found that such loans were not available, that the only assistance it could apply for was compensation for closure. This compensation was offered on the condition that the firm close and suffer loss on certain assets nominated under the Scheme, such closure and loss being traceable to government tariff policies. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 November 1974 the then Minister for Manufacturing Industry wrote to the chairman of the company and said that probably, in his opinion, the company would be eligible for compensation because it appeared to meet the closure and loss tests. However, nearly three months after closure, in March 1976, the company was advised by the incoming Minister for Industry and Commerce that it was not deemed eligible for closure compensation although it had met the closure and loss tests. The company, having got nowhere by making further representations, appealed to the Ombudsman, who advised:</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of Ministers' consideration in 1976 and later years of the company's application for closure compensation, I concluded that certain factors that would have been important in making a decision were not included in the Departmental submissions. </PARA>
<PARA>The upshot of all this was that in 1980, 4 1/2 years after the company had closed, the Minister agreed that it was indeed, after all, eligible for closure compensation. It might seem that after six years of continual frustration the demands of justice had been met and that, belatedly, the Government had rectified a serious omission. Since the assets involved were worth over $1m the receiver of the company looked forward to the next communication. </PARA>
<PARA> However, on 24 September 1980 the receiver was informed that the company would receive only $210,974 as compensation for affected assets independently valued at $1,200,000, or almost $1m less than the loss incurred. This niggardly offer cannot be squared with the principles of the Structural Adjustment Assistance Scheme under which it is offered. It would leave the company's shareholders as unsecured creditors without a cent. It seems, in fact, that the assessment of stock values by the Department of Industry and Commerce disregards the terms stated in the Government's original announcement, which was the basis for the company's request for assistance, as well as the company's situation at the time of closure. Furthermore, the company's building, which has been independently valued at $500,000, was declared to be virtually worthless, as it was 40 years old. On this basis a considerable proportion of the buildings in Australia are therefore valueless-a self-evidently ridiculous proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is time that this sorry history came to an end. It is surely wrong for a scheme supported by more than one Government and by more than one Parliament to be thwarted by official interference of the kind that I have outlined. It is time to give proper compensation to James Yates Pty Ltd after six years of continual inequity and obstruction. If we are seriously concerned for small business, surely the proper compensation can now be forthcoming, either under the Structural Adjustment Assistance Scheme or by means of a generous ex gratia payment. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) With reference to the Report of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions and the recommendation for the disposal of Commonwealth bookstores to private enterprise, does this disposal mean that bills, papers and documents presently available to Members of Parliament, students and the public will be limited because (a) private enterprise will only handle those papers, etc., which will be most frequently requested and be reluctant to handle papers infrequently sought and (b) only those papers as would have rapid turnover at a price which would make such trade profitable will be handled.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At the 36th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 36), Australia co-sponsored Resolution 36/55 by which the draft Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief was adopted without vote.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No, since the question did not arise in these terms in the course of negotiations in relation to the Declaration. Several delegations were, however, insistent on the inclusion of appropriate wording to protect those with atheist views before agreeing to adopt the draft Declaration at UNGA 36. Article One of the draft Declaration thus extends 'the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion' of every person to 'freedom to have a religion or whatever belief of his choice'. The Government therefore considers that the Declaration provides adequate protection for those who hold beliefs of the kind referred to in the question, as well as those who hold religious beliefs.</PARA>
