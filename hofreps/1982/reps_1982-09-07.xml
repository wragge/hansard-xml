<PARA>STATEMENT BY THE TREASURER, THE HON. JOHN HOWARD, MP</PARA>
<PARA>COMMENTS ON THE McCABE/LAFRANCHI REPORT</PARA>
<PARA>A INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA> I have now had the opportunity of studying in greater detail the report of Messrs McCabe and Lafranchi tabled in the Victorian Parliament on 27 May 1982 ( hereafter referred to as the ''Report''). I have also had the benefit of lengthy comments on aspects of that report from the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA>
<PARA> This detailed statement contains particulars in defence of the Australian Taxation Office, against the unwarranted criticisms that have been levelled in the Report and by the Premier of Victoria when he presented the Report to the Victorian Parliament and in subsequent comments.</PARA>
<PARA> The Report has made a valuable contribution to the debate on tax evasion and tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that it has increased public awareness of the nature of certain tax avoidance practices, and the unsavoury actions so often involved in such practices, it has heightened the sense of public outrage at tax evasion and avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result it has served to emphasise the significance of this Government's legislative and administrative effort directed against such practices in the past four years which had as the highlights the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act and the new Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA> That having been said, however, I believe the Report has been used in an unfair and unwarranted way in three main respects: to create the general impression that this Government and the Australian Taxation Office just stood by and let certain tax avoidance and evasion practices grow unhindered; to create the impression that the so-called ''bottom-of-the-harbour'' schemes continued to a significant extent beyond the passage of the remedial legislation; and finally, to make a number of criticisms of the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA> Before dealing in some detail with the specific allegations there are a number of preliminary comments which I should make and which are in my view essential to a proper understanding of the relevance of this Report and some of the things contained in it.</PARA>
<PARA>B PERSPECTIVE</PARA>
<PARA> It is important in considering the Report to recall the nature of the environment at the time the practices were entered into, especially the prevailing public attitudes and the priorities of the Government, the Australian Taxation Office and others at that time.</PARA>
<PARA>1 Sudden Proliferation of Schemes in 1977-78</PARA>
<PARA> To begin with, it should be noted that the schemes which are focussed on in the Report were largely entered into before the end of 1978. Although there is evidence of some of these schemes in existence earlier in the 1970s, they really did not become widely used until 1977 and 1978, ie, until after the High Court decision in the Slutzkin case.</PARA>
<PARA> Hence, as a consequence of certain High Court decisions there was a sudden proliferation of these and other schemes. Those decisions were seen as providing something of a green light to the development of such schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Australian Taxation Office had been active in documenting and seeking to counteract schemes to strip companies of untaxed profits, it was not until 1979 or 1980 that the full extent of such schemes really became apparent to the Australian Taxation Office and the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> When the Commissioner of Taxation first raised with me in May 1978 the prospect that criminal penalties might need to be introduced in order to deal with these practices, they were still being documented and the full extent of their use was not yet known. Priority was then being given to dealing with other established and damaging schemes, both by the Taxation Office in its administrative responses and advice to me and by the Government in its own legislative processes and response.</PARA>
<PARA>2 Public Attitudes to Tax Avoidance</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, strong public attitudes towards tax avoidance were not yet evident at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the issue of tax avoidance really only started to gain public attention as a result of the publicity surrounding the Government's clamp down on paper schemes of avoidance, such as the so-called ''Curran Scheme''.</PARA>
<PARA> Public awareness grew as the very damaging revenue impacts of such schemes became more generally recognised and as the Government intensified its campaign against tax avoidance by making such schemes the subject of remedial legislation .</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation against the Curran Scheme was followed by a series of further measures against other schemes as their threat to revenue and to the fairness of the tax system became apparent.</PARA>
<PARA> The point is that public attitudes against tax avoidance were only in their formative stages at the time the schemes described in the Report were reaching their peak in 1977 and 1978 and were, therefore, nowhere near as pronounced as they are today.</PARA>
<PARA> These attitudes have, of course, hardened considerably in recent years. Public hostility has grown, as tax avoidance practices have received considerable publicity and as the Government has intensified its campaign against them.</PARA>
<PARA> Hence, without wanting to downplay in any sense the significance of the schemes covered in the Report, it is clearly important to recognise the considerably different state of public opinion towards tax avoidance that existed at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> 3 The Approach of the Australian Taxation Office</PARA>
<PARA> In considering the response of the Australian Taxation Office, it is also important to recognise the administrative procedures and priorities characteristic of their activities at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, the Australian Taxation Office had until the end of 1977 been trying to make Section 260 work as a general anti-avoidance provision. Their strategy until then had been to take test cases on Section 260 to the High Court , to get a ruling, and then to apply that ruling as a basis of assessment.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision in Cridland's case in November 1977 essentially represented the final death knell for this approach. If that decision were to hold, Section 260 could no longer be relied upon as a general anti-avoidance provision and it would be necessary to find some alternative.</PARA>
<PARA> Hence, in early 1978, and with my strong support and encouragement, the Australian Taxation Office began work towards the development of what became Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA> At about the same time, the Australian Taxation Office, having been unsuccessful in efforts to have prosecutions launched, put to me and I readily accepted that there ought to be moves towards measures of the kind which were ultimately embodied in the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> It should also be recognised that in dealing with the sort of allegations made in the Report against the Australian Taxation Office, it is not possible to outline every step that was taken by the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> In what follows, therefore, an attempt has been made to simply highlight the most important steps taken by the Commissioner in relation to these schemes.</PARA>
<PARA>4 What's New in the Report?</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps one of the most unfortunate aspects of the publication of the Report is that it was used to create the false impression that this was 'new' information, on 'new' schemes, with dramatic 'new' revenue losses.</PARA>
<PARA> This clearly was not the case. In fact, the only 'new' feature of the Report was that, for the first time, tax avoidance and evasion of this kind was personalised as individuals and companies were identified by name.</PARA>
<PARA> Although as I said the Australian Taxation Office and the Government developed detailed knowledge of the extent of the arrangements in the last couple of years of the 1970s, the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act meant that the names of those involved in such schemes were totally unknown to me and other members of the Government, prior to publication of the Report.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of note that the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act are such that even now the Commissioner of Taxation is unable to confirm or deny possible correlations between the activities of promoters, unnamed in minutes addressed to me, but named and described in practices set out in the Report.</PARA>
<PARA> Without wanting to labour the fact that neither details of the schemes nor the revenue losses involved came as a surprise to us, it is worth recalling some of the things that I said at the time of introducing our remedial legislation. I gave then some figures just as startling as those in the Report.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have so frequently said in recent weeks, the practices described and the schemes outlined in this Report, were the target of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in December 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> In my Second Reading Speech of 26 November 1980, when introducing the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Bill, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'As the task of artificial avoidance has become more difficult, the less scrupulous have added a new and I think most would agree, unacceptable dimension to endeavours to ensure that payment of tax is escaped . . .</PARA>
<PARA> The seriousness of the position cannot be overstated. For example, one promoter is known to have stripped some 2,086 companies during a recent period. In 733 of these cases, the result has been that the Commissioner of Taxation will be unable to collect tax on taxable incomes aggregating over $128 million.'</PARA>
<PARA> This was in fact quoted directly in the Report (pages 27 and 28).</PARA>
<PARA>5 Evasion or Avoidance</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, to conclude our consideration of perspective, it is important to recognise that although the Report appears to concentrate on evasion, it is in fact referring to a mixture of avoidance and evasion practices.</PARA>
<PARA> The Report focuses on some 923 companies and it notes that they fall into three categories-companies with profits that had not borne company tax (current year profit companies), companies with accumulated profits from previous years ( revenue reserve companies) and non-operating companies with little or no assets (redundant companies). Concern attaches particularly to the first two categories .</PARA>
<PARA> Stripping of current year profit companies had the effect of evading payment of company tax and of avoiding tax payable by shareholders when the profits were ultimately distributed to them as dividends.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, stripping of revenue reserve companies had only the latter effect, i.e., avoidance of tax in shareholders' hands on amounts which, if there had been no strip, presumably would eventually have been distributed as dividends.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Report recognises the existence of these categories, the essential discussion in it is about evasion by current year profit companies. One would tend to think from the discussion that the 923 companies cited in the report were mostly current year profit cases.</PARA>
<PARA> That is not the case. Examination of the cases identified in volumes 2 to 5 of the Report indicates that some 365 of the 923 companies were current year profit cases. Information available to the Australian Taxation Office indicates that, in addition to these 365 companies, some of the remaining companies were stripped of profits before company tax payable by them had been paid.</PARA>
<PARA> Taking those cases into account, the position is that more than half of the 923 strips did not involve any stripping of untaxed company profits. The tax evaded by stripping untaxed company profits amounts to some $34 million.</PARA>
<PARA> It is to that area of evasion that my statement, like the basic discussion in the Report, primarily relates. It is to the question of prosecution of persons connected with this evasion that the strictures in the report against the Australian Taxation Office are directed.</PARA>
<PARA>C THE POSITION IN DETAIL-UP TO 1978</PARA>
<PARA> The initial question concerns what action the Australian Taxation Office took when it heard of cases of stripping of untaxed company profits.</PARA>
<PARA> Before answering this question, however, the point should be made that the activities that are described in this section were essentially those undertaken by the Commissioner in the normal course of his administrative duties and as such were unknown to me until early 1978.</PARA>
<PARA> These are cases in which shareholders of companies were selling their shares in circumstances where there were associated arrangements under which the target companies were stripped of funds and left in a position where the companies could not pay the income tax that would in the normal course of events be assessed to them. The shareholders received the profits of the companies in a tax-free capital form, not diminished in any way by either company tax or tax on dividends but only by the fee charged by the promoter for his services.</PARA>
<PARA> As noted earlier, these ''bottom-of-the-harbour'' cases are to be distinguished from those, now known by the description ''dry Slutzkins'', in which shareholders sell their shares for a capital sum that reflects accumulated company profits that have borne company tax.</PARA>
<PARA> A case of company stripping came to the attention of a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation early in 1973. Following an extensive investigation by Taxation officers the matter was reported to the Commissioner's Head Office in Juy 1974.</PARA>
<PARA> It was decided there that section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act applied and that assessments should be made against the vendor shareholders, to include in their assessable incomes the proceeds of the sale of their shares. (The basis for this assessment action was subsequently ruled to be untenable by the High Court in Slutzkin &amp; Ors v F C of T, 1977 ATC 4076).</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, in August/September 1974, the Commissioner, through his Deputy, sought legal advice from the local Deputy Crown Solicitor as to whether the facts available would support a prosecution against any person under income tax legislation, the Commonwealth Crimes Act or the Companies Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Commissioner received this opinion in January 1975, and it was to the effect that on the material presented by the Commissioner to counsel, grounds existed for prosecution under Section 67 of the Companies Act and under Section 86 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and that proceedings could be instituted under Section 367B of the Companies Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Having checked that secrecy provisions would not operate as a barrier to prosecution, in August 1975, the Commissioner authorised the Deputy Crown Solicitor to take the necessary steps towards action under the indicated sections of the Crimes Act and the Companies Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Following this reference to the Deputy Crown Solicitor, there were further taxation inquiries and a formal investigation by the police. The police having in November 1976 reported in favour of action under the nominated Crimes Act and Companies Act provisions, it was found necessary in the course of ensuing discussions and contacts between taxation and legal officers for further information to be sought, and information obtained was put under examination.</PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the then apparent proliferation of ''straw'' companies and his concern about it, the Commissioner in March 1978 took the matter to the Crown Solicitor himself, using as a particular instance the then unresolved case of the company whose situtation had been before the Deputy Crown Solicitor. Discussions and correspondence ensued and in April 1979 the Commissioner received Crown Law advice to the effect that there was insufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of ''conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth''.</PARA>
<PARA> With the benefit of hindsight, of course, such a period seems inordinately long .</PARA>
<PARA> However, it is important to recognise that the collection of appropriate evidence and the preparation of legal opinion can be a very labour-intensive exercise, particularly in circumstances as existed at that time, where the financial details of these schemes were still being determined and where both the Crown Solicitor and the Australian Taxation Office, of course, had numerous other priorities.</PARA>
<PARA> It is especially relevant to recognise that what was principally involved was endeavouring to establish a charge of conspiracy. Conspriacy cases are notoriously difficult to estabish and sustain.</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the pre-1978 period, the Taxation Office had been seeking to initiate action in relation to other stripped companies. Particular companies were selected as representative of those that had come under notice.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, in one case, reported to the Taxation Head Office in April 1976, it was proposed that the stripped company's past or present officers or directors be prosecuted. Again legal opinions were sought as to whether actions would lie against appropriate persons under section 231 of the Assessment Act, the Crimes Act or the Companies Act.</PARA>
<PARA> However, following an extended series of discussions and taxation enquiries, conferences between taxation and legal officers and counsel, advice was received from counsel, along with comments from the Deputy Crown Solicitor, to the effect that proposed assessment action against the vendor shareholders would be unlikely to be upheld, that prosecution action would not lie against any person, that Section 367B of the Companies Act could not be successfully invoked and that further enquiries would be of no avail.</PARA>
<PARA> In another case, legal advice from counsel, received by the company's liquidator in July 1978, was to the effect that actions might lie against directors of the relevant company for the common law tort of negligence but that actions under Sections 124, 374C and 374D of the Companies Act were unlikely to succeed. The issues were never tested because action instituted against the directors resulted in securing the recovery of a substantial amount of tax.</PARA>
<PARA> To conclude this section, in each of the cases taken to the Commonwealth's legal authorities for advice, it turned out that the advice was to the effect that prosecutions could not, with sufficient prospects of success be launched.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important at this point to recall the essence of the approach of the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA> The cases selected to be put to the legal authorities with a view to formal prosecution action by them were representative cases. These were cases which had been fully investigated and were regarded as the best prospects for sucessful prosecution out of all those that had come to the notice of the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the record shows that the Taxation Office was active in obtaining appropriate legal advice and in doing what it could do to facilitate prosecution action by the appropriate authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>D THE MOVE TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES</PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is important to understand why we finally resorted to criminal penalties and to emphasise the significance of that step.</PARA>
<PARA> It was because the Government believed, on the basis of legal advice provided to it, that the then existing law was an insufficient response to these practices, that it was decided to enact the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> That legislation was presented to the Parliament as a result of advice initially received from the Australian Taxation Office. It was the Australian Taxation Office which in May 1978 first advised the Government that criminal penalties of unprecedented severity for practices of this kind in Australia should be inserted in the law.</PARA>
<PARA> It put proposals to me once it heard that stripping of untaxed company profits was occurring on a wide scale. During the processes leading up to the passage of the legislation it passed on further reports about such practices and was active in seeking completion of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> In deciding to present this legislation to the Parliament the Government also had the benefit of advice from its Taxation Advisory Committee which is comprised of private sector practitioners in the taxation field.</PARA>
<PARA> By any test, that legislation represented a strong and determined response by the Government to the practices against which it was directed.</PARA>
<PARA> It should not be forgotten, however, that criminal penalties were introduced against practices of this kind only after very lengthy and painstaking consideration and notwithstanding considerable misgivings felt by some at that time as to whether such penalties were not perhaps an over-reaction to the practices in question.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the work on preparing what ultimately became the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act commenced in 1978, there was considerable reserve and caution within the Government as to whether criminal penalties were really appropriate and as a consequence further effort was devoted to establishing whether or not some method of coping with the problem could be found without resort to the criminal law.</PARA>
<PARA> In the final analysis, the Government came to the conclusion that there was really no alternative but to bring in criminal penalties.</PARA>
<PARA> However, it is essential to keep this issue in proper perspective and, for example, to recall that even in December 1980, when the legislation was being considered by the Parliament there were many prepared to allege that the Government might be going too far.</PARA>
<PARA> At that time I received many representations stating that the introduction of criminal penalties was an over-reaction on the Government's part.</PARA>
<PARA> These representations included some from the Law Institute of Victoria, the Law Institute of Western Australia and the Law Society of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> To cite one example, the Law Institute of Victoria said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'This Bill makes far reaching changes to the criminal law which will affect all members of the business community including lawyers and accountants. Accordingly it should not be allowed to proceed until all the changes to the existing law have been fully considered and understood, not only by the lawyers and accountants who have to advise members of the business community on the subject of sales tax and income tax, but also by the business community who will have to bear the cost and suffer the inconvenience which will inevitably arise as a result of imposing draconian criminal sanctions on the normal professional relationship between solicitor and client and accountant and client.'</PARA>
<PARA> A common theme of many of these representations was that the Bill I had introduced should be allowed to lie on the table of the House during the subsequent Christmas recess so that its provisions might be critically analysed with a view to eliminating any unintended consequences. The Parliament, at the Government's urging, rejected this advice, the acceptance of which would have provided the tax avoidance industry with a last and wholly undeserved opportunity to rape the Exchequer.</PARA>
<PARA> It can be seen that the period between when the Commissioner proposed to me action of the kind, and the time of introduction of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill 1980, was a lengthy one. I have never sought to hide this fact and I said as much in my address on 6 March 1981 at a seminar conducted under the auspices of the Australian Society of Accountants.</PARA>
<PARA> I quote from my speech on that occasion:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Turning now to the main topic today, the discussion of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980, I would like to assure you that it was only after a long and careful examination that I was convinced of the necessity of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> I was, and remain, convinced that no effective alternative course was open if the quite outrageous activities of those who were engaging in straw company and straw trust tax evasion were to be brought up short.</PARA>
<PARA> I was also concerned to ensure-as was the Attorney-General and other members of the Government-that the terms of the new legislation were scrupulously fair to anyone who was accused of breaching it.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, that no one would have his liberty put at risk except on proof beyond reasonable doubt that he had deliberately engaged in, or aided and abetted someone else to engage in, acts fraudulently intended to evade payment of tax by a company or trustee.</PARA>
<PARA> Both during the preparation of the Bill and when considering amendments while the legislation was before the Parliament, such concerns were very much in my mind.</PARA>
<PARA> After becoming aware that certain evasion methods were being used, and indeed escalating, I had an examination carried out by officers of the Taxation Department, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Attorney- General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA> Their advice to me was that the schemes could not effectively be countered by the application of existing laws which they found to be deficient for the purpose for one reason or another.</PARA>
<PARA> It was put to me that specific legislation carrying penal sanctions was the only viable option to deal with the problem.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government subsequently gave very careful consideration to the form that the new legislation might take before agreeing to the drafting of the Bill. There followed extensive consultations between Parliamentary Counsel and officers of the Taxation Department and the Attorney-General's Department as drafting progressed.</PARA>
<PARA> I also asked the Taxation Advisory Committee to examine and advise on the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response was then reflected in further changes to the draft before the Bill was finally agreed to by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> While not all of the parties who had a hand in the preparation of or review of the Bill through these processes may necessarily have been in complete agreement on all the details of the Bill as introduced, I think it should be clear from what I have said that it had a very thorough preparation which took account of very wide-ranging views and there was certainly very broad agreement on the thrust of the Bill.''</PARA>
<PARA> From my own point of view and that of the Government, I consider that there was no avoidable delay. The period was one when, just in the tax field alone, there was a very large volume of remedial and other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, in the 4 years to 31 December 1980 there were 112 Taxation Bills considered and enacted by the Parliament consisting of 710 pages of substantive legislation. Much of this legislation was complex and was heavily weighted to the anti-avoidance area. The legislation could, of course, only have been framed once Taxation investigation staff had completed the difficult and time consuming task of investigating and analysing the schemes concerned. An attachment to this statement provides more details on the nature of legislation of recent years ( Attachment A).</PARA>
<PARA> Those officers of the Australian Taxation Office who had responsibility for advising the Government on the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill, and instructing Parliamentary Counsel on its drafting, also carried out corresponding tasks on the other tax legislation I have referred to. The heavy burden that they carried throughout the period was recognised later by the Public Service Board when, with my support, it agreed to a strengthening of the staff resources in that and other areas of the Commissioner's Head Office.</PARA>
<PARA> It must also be said that the investigative resources of the Taxation Office were under tremendous strain when the major company stripping activity referred to in the Report occurred, i.e., in the 1977 and 1978 financial years. During those years, the promotion of a wide variety of tax avoidance schemes occurred on a large scale and recognition of the consequent overwhelming workload led, on the Commissioner's recommendation, and with my full support, to the establishment from early 1979 of a new Compliance Division within the Head Office of the Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA> The picture can best be illustrated by some figures that have recently become available. These figures indicate that in 1975-76 there were some 729 participants in avoidance (as distinct from evasion) schemes of the blatant, artificial or contrived kind and which the Commissioner of Taxation has challenged. The next year this figure had grown to 2,787 and in 1977-78 to 10, 295. For 1978-79 it stood at 8,653 but rose to 9,018 for 1979-80.</PARA>
<PARA> Other areas of the Taxation Office also had to cope with substantial and increasing workloads. Appeals staff have had to cope with a large upsurge of litigation at all appellate levels and in other areas of the administrative review processes. In addition to the traditional appeals work there was a substantial growth in the volume of other litigation.</PARA>
<PARA> A greater public awareness of the incidence of taxation brought about largely by increased media attention has led to an increasing propensity to challenge taxation assessments. For example, in the 3 year period 1 July 1977 to 30 June 1980, the Taxation Office received 46,032 requests to refer disputed assessments to Taxation Boards of Review and 1,404 requests to refer appeals to the Supreme, Federal and High Courts. Many of these cases were settled following discussions with the taxpayers concerned or their legal representatives. The substantial increase in litigation-requests for reference to Taxation Boards of Review, for example, increased from 2,446 in 1971 to 18,758 in 1980 (and further again to 19 ,386 in 1981)-was recently recognised by the Public Service Board by way of an increase in appeals staff, an increase I supported.</PARA>
<PARA>E ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES FROM 1978 UNDER THE OLD LAW</PARA>
<PARA> At an administrative level, the Australian Taxation Office continued to follow matters up where avenues for action appeared.</PARA>
<PARA> Thus in the case of Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Corwest Management Pty Ltd and Registrar of Titles 78 ATC 4388 the Commissioner sought recovery of tax by lodging a caveat in respect of land transferred by Kierad Pty Ltd to Corwest Management Pty Ltd in the period after issue of an assessment on Kierad Pty Ltd but before the date the amount owing became due and payable. Judgment for the amount owing had been obtained and registered before lodgment of the caveat. It was argued for the Commissioner that the judgment debt gave the Commonwealth an equitable charge over the land in question which could be the subject of a caveat. The Court rejected the Commissioner's argument.</PARA>
<PARA> In another action involving Kierad Pty Ltd, the Commissioner, through the liquidator of the stripped company, on 13 September 1979 obtained a court order under which a private examination under the Companies Act, followed by a public examination, was held of persons having knowledge of the company's affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this exercise was to establish the facts necessary for proper and full consideration to be given to prosecution action which might be taken against those responsible for the stripping of the company, in order to recover the amount of tax owing.</PARA>
<PARA> This case has remained uncompleted because of the Commissioner's inability, despite the assistance of the Australian Federal Police, to ascertain the whereabouts of relevant persons. Information was sought from the McCabe/ Lafranchi Inquiry but this was refused at the time on the grounds that the information could not be disclosed except in the Inquiry's Report.</PARA>
<PARA> In yet another case, first reported to the Taxation Head Office in June 1979 after the Deputy Commissioner concerned had detected it in April 1979, advice was sought from a Deputy Crown Solicitor in August 1979 regarding the possibility of instituting proceedings under the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Companies Act or the Commonwealth Crimes Act against one or more of the individuals responsible for the misappropriation of funds specifically set aside for payment of tax owed by the company.</PARA>
<PARA> Discussions ensued in August and November of that year between the Taxation Office and the Deputy Crown Solicitor regarding this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> Advice was received on 12 December 1979 from the Deputy Crown Solicitor that no offences could be established under the Crimes Act or the Assessment Act. The possibility that offences may have been committed by the directors or former directors of the stripped company under a provision of the State Crimes Act or section 374A (1) (c) of the Companies Act was mooted. However, the Deputy Crown Solicitor observed that prosecution of any officer or former officer of a company pursuant to either of the two sections would not result in any money being recovered for payment of the outstanding tax debt, and concluded that in any event it was unlikely that the essential ingredients of these offences could be established.</PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Crown Solicitor did suggest that winding up proceedings could be instituted against the company but doubted whether such proceedings would have any beneficial effect in relation to the recovery of tax. Moreover, he considered action under section 367B of the Companies Act not to be advisable, in view of the costs involved, unless there appeared to be some real prospect of recovering money. He also commented that income tax secrecy provisions might well preclude the divulging to the liquidator or the Corporate Affairs authorities of some of the information obtained by the Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Commissioner decided to join in an action to have the stripped company wound up. To the Commissioner's knowledge, the Corporate Affairs Office temporarily ceased enquiries in relation to this company, inorder to give priority to another case. It is understood that the enquiries have now resumed and following interviews with the parties responsible consideration will be given by the Corporate Affairs authorities to the possibility of instituting prosecution actions.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of his continuing concern about the general matter, the Commissioner of Taxation again wrote to the Crown Solicitor in May 1980 about the first of the cases that I have outlined in this statement. The Commissioner indicated in his memorandum that the particular method of avoiding or evading the payment of tax by companies was continuing to be used quite extensively and was creating serious problems for the Taxation Office. The Crown Solicitor was asked if he would further examine arrangements of this kind for the purpose of advising whether, in his opinion, there was any reasonable basis for the possible application of section 367B of the Companies Act, section 231 of the Income Tax Assessment Act or section 5 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. It was indicated to the Crown Solicitor that the particular case could be taken as typical of the case with which the Taxation Office was currently concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> The Crown Solicitor replied to this memorandum in September 1980. In his memorandum of advice he observed that what had been seen to be the particular deficiency when the matter was last looked at was that of evidence, namely, that there was insufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of conspiracy to defraud, and this problem still remained.</PARA>
<PARA> As to possible action under section 231 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Crown Solicitor pointed out that the time limit for prosecution under the section had then expired in that particular case. But he indicated that, even had it not, it would be 'difficult to imagine a court construing the section so as to impose, in criminal proceedings, more onerous restrictions on a taxpayer's activities than are to be found in the primary provisions relating to liability to tax'.</PARA>
<PARA> For similar reasons he was of the view that associated action under section 5 of the Crimes Act would not be productive.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to action under section 367B of the Companies Act, the Crown Solicitor thought that the only transaction that could be likely to attract the operation of that section would involve proceeding against a 'man of straw'. For that reason the Crown Solicitor observed that action by the Commissioner to persuade the liquidator of the company to make an application under section 367B of the Companies Act would be likely to result in no substantial benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> In short, the Crown Solicitor's final advice in this representative case was not encouraging to the Commissioner of Taxation and his officers in their efforts to pursue the persons responsible for the stripping of the companies.</PARA>
<PARA> Generally, the Australian Taxation Office has proceeded as fast as resources and priorities have allowed with investigation and assessment of stripped companies in order to quantify the tax debt and take whatever recovery action is left open to it.</PARA>
<PARA> Where the companies have attempted to wind up before assessment or payment of taxes the Taxation Office has, wherever possible, intervened to keep the companies on the books and their records intact to enable the examination of possible actions available through the liquidator.</PARA>
<PARA> In extreme cases, court actions have been taken to remove liquidators who had been appointed and to replace them with persons nominated by the Taxation Office . Thus, in December 1980 the Crown Solicitor was asked to engage senior counsel to represent the Commissioner in some particular actions. He was also asked at the time for advice as to any additional remedies under the Income Tax Assessment Act, Crimes Act, Bankruptcy Act and the Companies Act which might assist recovery of tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Following receipt of the sought-for advice the following action was taken in respect of a number of the schemes, an intrinsic part of which involved the voluntary winding up of companies, following the stripping of current year profits:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the Commissioner has intervened in the voluntary winding up of proceedings and secured undertakings or court orders deferring the final creditors' meetings ;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the previously-appointed liquidators have been removed, by the vote of creditors or court order, and new liquidators apointed;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the tax liability of each company has been admitted in the winding up-see for example Commonwealth of Australia v Duncan 81 ATC 4228;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) a liquidator has been examined under Section 278 of the Companies Act (Vic .) before Crockett J in the Supreme Court of Victoria. In the judgment, handed down on 7 May 1982, the actions of the liquidator were severely criticised. Crockett J directed that they be brought to the attention of-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Attorney-General for the State of Victoria</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Corporate Affairs Commission</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Law Society</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the Companies Auditors Board</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the Attorney-General for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> In yet another case the Taxation Office decided in November 1980, on the basis of senior counsel's opinion, given in a similar case, to petition the Supreme Court of Western Australia for an order to wind up the company. Section 293 of the Companies Act, in conjunction with Section 122 of the Bankruptcy Act, could then, perhaps, be relied on to set aside the transaction stripping the company of funds on the grounds that it was a preferential distribution by the company.</PARA>
<PARA> The Court ordered that the company be wound up and appointed a liquidator in April 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> Soon after the winding up of that company the Commissioner decided to ask the Deputy Crown Solicitor to obtain an Opinion from senior counsel on the avenues open to him, including the options available under the income tax law, the Companies Act, the Crimes Act and the Property Law Act 1969-1973 (WA). Counsel's Opinion on whether the secrecy provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act would inhibit such action was also sought.</PARA>
<PARA> After interviewing a number of 'elusive' persons, who had participated in the stripping arrangements, in an attempt to elicit all the facts about the diminution in the company's assets, the matter was referred by the Taxation Office to the Deputy Crown Solicitor early in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The accounts in immediately preceding paragraphs concern liquidation and associated action in cases where a company strip has associated with it a tax avoidance scheme of some kind. Cases that are bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, i.e ., simple evasion of payment of company tax have not themselves yet reached the stage where action has been taken to institute liquidation proceedings. A large amount of work on representative cases having been carried out the relevant Deputy Crown Solicitor was on 2 June 1982 asked to seek legal advice from senior counsel before wide-scale action is launched. Further information was subsequently supplied to counsel. Legal and other issues relevant to the conduct of that action have, of course, been clarified by the already instituted liquidation proceedings that have been referred to.</PARA>
<PARA> All of these actions have been designed to make the best of a situation given legal advice that offered no encouragement that effective prosecution could be mounted.</PARA>
<PARA> There are, as appears from the Report, views to the effect that there are grounds for prosecution action, although the published Report does not instance under what Commonwealth provisions prosecutions should be launched.</PARA>
<PARA> Such views were put in relation to the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill at the time of its introduction and were the subject of a response from the Government' s advisers, tabled by me in the House of Representatives. That response is attached to this statement (Attachment B), and I draw attention to the fact that its conclusions, that there were not then available effective and adequate legal sanctions, were unanimously subscribed to by the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, the Acting First Parliamentary Counsel and his officers, senior officers of the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Taxation Office.</PARA>
<PARA> Whichever of the two groups of views be the correct one, the key point in relation to the gravamen of the charge being levelled against the Australian Taxation Office is that it acted, as it was entitled to act, on the basis of Crown Law advice and even then, as I have shown, the Taxation Office did not simply ask for advice and receive it-having received unfavourable advice it pressed the matter with its legal advisers, only to have that advice confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA> On a related point, but in similar vein, the Crown Law advice in the particular case taken as a representative one had much to do with what was seen to be an insufficiency of evidence. The Report (page 28) observes 'No doubt, one can rightfully assume if that Office (The Taxation Office) had ascertained all facts published in this report, a prosecution would have been instituted.' But it also goes on to observe that there may be some explanation in the fact that the power of a special investigator under the Companies Act is wider than the power of a taxation officer.</PARA>
<PARA> As to that, it is a fact of life that in recent years taxation investigators have found their efforts to obtain information come under increasing challenge.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation observed in his Annual Report to Parliament on 29 October 1981 that promoters of schemes, having increasingly surrounded them with secrecy, were strengthening their endeavours to frustrate investigative action.</PARA>
<PARA> The difficulties faced by taxation officers are evidenced by the facts that have been placed before the High Court during its hearing of the case, O'Reilly and Others v The Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria and Others. In this case, investigation officers, who on previous days had been given access to documents relating to a taxpayer's affairs at a branch of the State Bank of Victoria, were on a subsequent day denied access which would have enabled them to complete their inquiries at that branch. On the latter occasion, officers of the bank refused a request to unlock a door of a storeroom in which relevant documents were thought to be and also refused to specifically state where the documents could be found.</PARA>
<PARA> The Report refers (page 23) to views attributed early in 1980 to the Acting Commissioner of Taxation, to the effect that the real cure of the 'company dumping' problem lay with tighter Corporate Affairs Commission regulation. The views attributed to the Acting Commissioner were apparently taken from a press report, and were not the subject of any inquiry by Messrs McCabe or Lafranchi of the persons concerned. I regard it as a very serious matter to attribute to the Taxation Office a particular administrative attitude on the basis of a press report, unsupported by any investigation as to its accuracy or the context in which it was made.</PARA>
<PARA> In any event, I am quite satisfied that the Australian Taxation Office at no stage refrained from action against company stripping because it thought the matter was one for company law.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation said in his Annual Report to Parliament, tabled on 18 September 1980, referring to the then state of company stripping activity:</PARA>
<PARA> 'An alarming tactic much in evidence during 1979-80 is stripping companies or trusts of their available assets without making provision for payment of tax assessed or to be assessed. This makes use of legal forms and procedures but would be regarded by most as pure tax evasion not really capable of passing under the euphemism of ''avoidance''.</PARA>
<PARA> Companies or trusts with current year profits are denuded of assets in a way which completely disregards the rights of creditors or potential creditors. This action is the more egregious when members of the company resolve to place it in voluntary liquidation before an income tax assessment can be issued so that early destruction of records may be achieved. This tactic is used either as a primary or sole means of avoiding the payment of taxation that is due or as a back-up method of escaping from any possible liability in cases in which the company has participated in a tax avoidance scheme the efficacy of which has not been finally tested.'</PARA>
<PARA>F THE POSITION AFTER THE CRIMES (TAXATION OFFENCES) ACT</PARA>
<PARA> A matter of considerable concern to me has been the claim in the report that company stripping activity still continues after the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act and the inference that, again, the Australian Taxation Office has failed or omitted to respond and to follow-up the apparent breaches of the new Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The Report (page 28) refers in this regard to 'continuing notification' at the Victorian Corporate Affairs Office of particulars for directors and registered office addresses believed to be false or misleading.</PARA>
<PARA> From advice that I have from the Australian Taxation Office, and from my own contacts with legal and accounting practitioners, I believe the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act not to have been a failure, but a conspicuous success.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Commissioner has told me that a particular person, not mentioned in the Report, who had been very active prior to the Act in stripping companies (his activities were the subject of figures given by me when the legislation was introduced) was on all the evidence available immediately put out of business.</PARA>
<PARA> It is to be noted that the 923 companies that were the subject of the Report were stripped well before the Act commenced. An analysis of the Report shows that the shares in the stripped companies were sold by the vendor/shareholders in the following financial years:</PARA>
<PARA>Number of</PARA>
<PARA>companies Financial year</PARA>
<PARA>stripped</PARA>
<PARA>1972-73  6 1973-74  2 1974-75  71 1975-76  64 1976-77  526 1977-78  246 Year not disclosed  8</PARA>
<PARA> 923</PARA>
<PARA> Following the enactment of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act the Commissioner of Taxation issued instructions to his Deputy Commissioners in which taxation officers were asked to be alert to anything that might suggest that there may have been a breach of the Act. The Head Office instruction, sent on 19 December 1980, contains this paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Legislation of this kind has, and is intended to have, a deterrent function. It is to be hoped that the mere existence of the criminal penalties that it contains will deter people from being involved in the kind of activities against which it is directed. If it does not, then early detection and vigorous and successful prosecution of offenders should have the desired effect. More than that, if people concerned remain aware of the legislation and are conscious that authorities concerned are alert to any possible breaches of it, the deterrent effect of the legislation will be maintained.''</PARA>
<PARA> To this date, and subject to the exceptions that follow, the Australian Taxation Office has not, despite being alert for such indications, become aware of evidence of or pointers to continued company stripping activity of the '' bottom-of-the-harbour'' type.</PARA>
<PARA> Plainly, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act immediately had a telling effect in curbing the kind of evasion activity against which the Act is directed. In that situation, the Australian Taxation Office effected its alert by maintaining a number of monitoring avenues that would help to bring to light any continuing stripping of untaxed company profits.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, Taxation Office forms notifying changes in the identity of the '' public officer'' of companies that had been paying income tax were checked. A range of documents lodged at the Office of Corporate Affairs was routinely monitored by taxation officers.</PARA>
<PARA> Some information, drawn to the attention of the Taxation Office only in the last few weeks and since then the subject of investigation by it, has revealed some cases of post-3 December 1980 stripping of untaxed company profits. The information comes from the Royal Commission into the activities of the Federated Ship Painters' and Dockers Union. With the aid of that information, taxation investigations have, since the Report, revealed that three New South Wales and two Queensland companies were stripped of untaxed profits after the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> Two of the companies were stripped after the commencement of Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA> There were, from the same source, another nine cases that warranted further investigation. Enquiries into them have indicated that all but one of the nine companies were not stripped of untaxed profits after the enactment of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. The exception relates to a small amount of rental income which would be taxable if the particular company were denied a deduction claimed by it for prior year losses.</PARA>
<PARA> The identified cases are being investigated and followed up on a top priority basis by the Australian Taxation Office which will, as soon as its initial taxation work is completed, refer the cases to the Australian Federal Police for investigation with a view to the initiation of prosecutions under the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, the matters mentioned in the Report. It refers, on page 28, to continuing notifications at the Victorian Corporate Affairs Office of apparently false or misleading particulars indicative, in the view of the authors, of continuing company stripping activities. I observe that the Report was presented to the Victorian Government in November 1981, and the situation of which it speaks is thus a situation at least some 7 months old.</PARA>
<PARA> On the Monday following the publication of the Report (i.e., on 31 May 1982) the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Melbourne sought from the Corporate Affairs Office particulars of the matters referred to in the Report. In response , he received on 9 June 1982 a computer-prepared listing as at 31 May 1982 of the names of a number of companies, the list of addresses representing in the words of the Commissioner for Corporate Affairs in Victoria 'a list of addresses which were considered to warrant further investigation'.</PARA>
<PARA> Since then the Taxation Office has been engaged in the very considerable work of following up the leads provided by this list. Its enquiries, completed on 18 June, reveal that none of the 1,376 cases involves stripping of untaxed company profits after the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from this source, the only cases identified to the Commissioner of Taxation that may have formed the basis of the observations in the Report are those of three companies in relation to which there was, in the middle of 1981, notification at Corporate Affairs of changes in the identity of company office- holders. On the best information now available none of these companies was stripped of untaxed profits after the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> One was stripped well before, and the August 1981 notification of changes in office-holders represents simply a 'cleaning up of paper-work' operation. The change in office-holders for the other two companies, notified in May 1980, is of a change occurring on 1 December 1980, i.e., a few days before the Act was passed.</PARA>
<PARA> I add that some further possible leads are currently being followed up by the Taxation Office, and appropriate action will be taken as and when necessary. However, on all the experience of the many time and resource-consuming trails that the Taxation Office has had to follow in recent weeks in investigating suggestions that there have, after the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, been strips of untaxed company profits the Commissioner is most confident that very few, if any, such strips will be found as a consequence.</PARA>
<PARA> To summarise then, there are only five identified cases of post-3 December 1980 company strips (none of them in Victoria), with no more than a possibility that others may exist. It is of course a matter of concern that there should be any such activity after the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, but it represents no sense of complacency to observe that if there are a handful of cases, such numbers are hardly indicative of a failure of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> To reduce company strips from their heyday levels, which plainly has happened, is a remarkable achievement. As I have said already, the legislation has been a conspicuous success.</PARA>
<PARA> Nor can the existence of the handful of cases, only recently revealed, constitute any reflection on the Australian Taxation Office and its compliance activities.</PARA>
<PARA> I have referred already to monitoring activities that the Taxation Office employed after the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, and noted that these extend to inspections at the Office of Corporate Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> For quite some time, there have been very co-operative working arrangements between the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Melbourne and the Office of the Commissioner of Corporate Affairs. Taxation officers regularly visit the Corporate Affairs Office to scrutinize a range of documents passing through it. The range and volume of the documents does of course impose practical limitations on the extent to which taxation officers can make examinations of corporate affairs documents. But, as I have indicated, taxation officers have not in the course of that scrutiny come across anything of the kind to which Messrs McCabe and Lafranchi refer.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not put it at the forefront but I do observe that there were, in the context of the liaison arrangements, opportunities for corporate affairs officers to bring any matters of present relevance to the attention of the taxation liaison officers. This was not done.</PARA>
<PARA> In any event, there has still been nothing revealed from the Corporate Affairs Office in Melbourne that would make good the contentions on page 28 of the Report.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that it was known unofficially to some taxation officers in October 1980 that the Victorian Corporate Affairs Office had a facility to produce a computer-prepared listing of cases that, on the basis of names and addresses, might warrant follow-up action. The officers came into possession of such a list at that time-a list, I stress, that covered periods prior to the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act-but, regrettably, did not see that if the Taxation Office were to obtain such lists on a continuing basis they might help to monitor the situation after the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporate Affairs Office itself did not, before 9 June 1982, supply any further listings to the Taxation Office. However, even if it had, either of its own initiative or on Taxation Office request, it appears in the event that the listings would not have contained actual evidence of continued stripping of untaxed company profits after the Act although, as the Commissioner of Taxation has pointed out, they would have been a source of evidence of such cases if any existed.</PARA>
<PARA> The preceding discussion, in responding to comments in the McCabe/Lafranchi Report, focuses on possible avenues of enquiry or information at the Office of Corporate Affairs. That focus does, however, tend to distort the overall picture , which is that corporate affairs records are not the only means, nor are they arguably the best means, of detecting any post- 3 December 1980 bottom-of-the- harbour schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, a major promoter of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes based in another State but with operations extending throughout Australia, made it a practice not to lodge at the Office of Corporate Affairs the requisite documents indicating changes in shareholdings of companies and their officers.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the question of indicators, available in the past, of continuing bottom-of-the-harbour strips I think that the Premier of Victoria has done everyone, himself included, a disservice by referring to the advertisements for the acquisition of companies that appeared after the advent of the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act. I think that the Premier himself now realises that these advertisements did not relate to bottom-of-the-harbour strips. They concerned stripping of company profits that had already borne company tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Whatever views people choose to take of past events, the Australian Taxation Office is, as I have said, following up the various matters and, should its taxation enquiries reveal possible breaches of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, it will, under the guidance of Crown Law authorities, have the matter referred immediately to the Australian Federal Police for appropriate action.</PARA>
<PARA> It is relevant to the present situation that not only is company stripping a Commonwealth offence, under the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, but any person who sells his or her shares as part of such a scheme is liable to tax under Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The Part IVA legislation, introduced by me into the Parliament on 27 May 1981 and made effective in relation to schemes entered into after that day would make a vendor shareholder liable not only to tax on his or her share of stripped company profits, but also subject to statutory penalty tax of 200 per cent of that amount of tax.</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this further legislation is that the persons who stand to profit most by company stripping activities-the vendor shareholders-also stand to pay heavily for any involvement in such activities. That proposition applies both to bottom-of-the-harbour strips and strips of taxed company profits.</PARA>
<PARA> I add that I had earlier been informed by the Commissioner of Taxation of action by his Office to raise assessments against companies that had been stripped of pre-tax profits before the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 commenced to operate. That action is continuing but, in the case of those stripped companies whose records have been destroyed, it obviously involves some very great difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner is not optimistic that this action will result in significant collections of the tax sought to be evaded and he expects that it will ultimately be necessary to formally write off as irrecoverable the great bulk of the tax assessed to these companies.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the Commissioner's intention that, in pursuance of his statutory obligation to report annually to the Parliament on the working of the income tax law, he will name in his report the companies concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner expects that that action will bring to the Parliament's attention the identity of a significantly wider group of company stripping participants than has been revealed in the Report.</PARA>
<PARA>G CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA> I say in conclusion that there are some unfortunate things about the Report, its release and subsequent treatment. Of particular concern is the fact that as appears on page 25 of the Report, the authors sought no facts or comments from the Taxation Office and admit that for that reason the opinions they expressed were necessarily based on limited factual data.</PARA>
<PARA> Their reference to the secrecy provisions of the income tax law does not justify that omission. While the secrecy provisions do forbid unauthorised disclosure of taxation information the Commissioner of Taxation would readily have explained to Messrs McCabe and Lafranchi had they approached him, his general administrative approach in cases of this nature. In particular, he would have explained how he had been seeking the institution of legal action with a view to persons concerned being brought to book.</PARA>
<PARA> I do feel that the Report has been unfair in its treatment of the Australian Taxation Office and of the dedicated people in it. No one should overlook the difficulties and frustrations that attach to the work they do on behalf of the community. They are to be thanked for their work.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, for its part, has a record of challenge and response to tax avoidance and evasion that is not open to reasonable criticism.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that it would be a very brave man or women who, in the light of this Government's Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act and Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, would now venture into any company strip.</PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, some lessons to be learned from this episode. I believe that all authorities concerned will renew their vigilance. I have said already, and now repeat, that the Government does not seek to close the book on pre- December 1980 events. If on a further review of the relevant facts and law the appropriate legal authorities conclude that prosecution ought to be launched, then that will be done.</PARA>

<PARA>CRIMES (TAXATION OFFENCES) BILL 1980</PARA>
<PARA>(Advice to the Treasurer, Tabled by him in the House of Representatives on 4 December 1980)</PARA>
<PARA>Retrospectivity</PARA>
<PARA> Messrs Russell and Davies suggest that the Bill could, in conjunction with legislation that is enacted to overcome particular tax avoidance arrangements but is made to apply from an earlier date (e.g., the date of the Treasurer's statement foreshadowing the anti-avoidance legislation), operate to make it a crime to undertake activity that was not a crime under the law in force when the activity was carried out.</PARA>
<PARA> That cannot happen under the Bill. It could only happen when such anti- avoidance legislation is enacted in the future, and only then if the other elements of the proposed offences exist and the anti-avoidance legislation is so drafted that its effect in back-dating tax liability is applicable in relation to the requirement in the Bill that the actions of the accused must relate to tax that is or becomes legally payable.</PARA>
<PARA> The time to consider this matter is when such anti-avoidance legislation is brought forward. At that time the choice will lie between, on the one hand, respecting the convention that statutes ought not to have retrospective penal effect and, on the other, giving weight to the fact that adherence to the convention would soon signal that, between the dates when anti-avoidance legislation is foreshadowed and when it enters into force, activity to strip a company of its capacity to pay could be freely undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> The Law Institute proposes that Parliamentary consideration of the Bill be deferred until the autumn. Doing that would, as the Bill stands (i.e., entry into force on date of Assent), represent an open invitation to strip companies and trusts for the next two or three months. Any action to make the legislation, when enacted in the autumn, effective from the present time would however contravene the convention that penal statutes should not be retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA>Liability of professional advisers</PARA>
<PARA> The Law Institute and Messrs Russell and Davies represent that professional advisers will be exposed to criminal prosecution and penalty for carrying out their ordinary work as tax advisers. That is certainly not the position.</PARA>
<PARA> A professional adviser will be no more exposed than any other citizen who has the same involvement in an arrangement as does the professional adviser. In other words, any criticism of the Bill's likely effect on professional advisers must be a criticism of the basic elements of the proposed offences. Such criticisms are dealt with under the heading 'elements of the offences'.</PARA>
<PARA> Clause 6 is the relevant provision. Sub-section (1) is in the terms:</PARA>
<PARA> '(1) Where a person-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) directly or indirectly, aids, abets, counsels or procures another person ( including a company) to enter into an arrangement or transaction; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) is, in any way, by act or omission, directly or indirectly concerned in, or party to, the entry by another person (including a company) into an arrangement or transaction,</PARA>
<PARA>knowing or believing . . .'.</PARA>
<PARA> This provision bears very fair comparison with section 5 of the Crimes Act 1914 -</PARA>
<PARA> '5. Any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures, or by act or omission is in any way directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to, the commission of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth, whether passed before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be deemed to have committed that offence and shall be punishable accordingly.'.</PARA>
<PARA>Certificate of Commissioner as evidence</PARA>
<PARA> Comments under this head relate to clause 10, which Garrick Gray &amp; Co describe as 'the most undesirable feature of the Bill'. The comments are misconceived.</PARA>
<PARA> The essence of the point of criticism is that, against the background that it is an element of each offence that tax be or becomes payable, a certificate by the Commissioner (or a Second Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner) may be tendered and made conclusive evidence that tax is payable, when it has not been finally determined that tax is payable. The Law Institute of Victoria says that 'the Commissioner' can, by such a certificate, secure a conviction even though it is subsequently held by the courts that no tax was in fact payable.</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of clause 10 is set out on page 16 of the explanatory memorandum and is, in brief, to ensure that questions of tax liability are to be determined only in the conventional processes of objection, review by a Taxation Board of Review and/or appeal to a court. Tax liability alleged by the Commssioner to exist may be challenged by the taxpayer concerned, but only in that conventional way.</PARA>
<PARA> The key answer to the criticism is clause 11. If a prosecution is brought while relevant tax liability has not been finally determined then the magistrate in committal proceedings, or the court at the trial, must stay the proceedings. The courts are thus given a clear direction by the legislation not to allow a prosecution to go ahead if tax liability has not been finally determined.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Forsyth Q.C. suggests (in effect) that 'it is probable' that the mandatory stay of proceedings provided for by clause 11 would be overridden by section 177 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which makes production of a copy of a notice of assessment conclusive evidence of the assessment.</PARA>
<PARA> This is just not so. Clause 11 clearly makes a stay of proceedings mandatory if it appears to the court that tax liability has not been finally determined. Section 177 has no application in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner as prosecutor</PARA>
<PARA> Against the background of allegations about reactions by the Commissioner of Taxation and his officers to recent tax avoidance practices it is suggested that the Commissioner may be overbearing in use or purported use of the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> The offences proposed by the Bill are indictable offences. Section 69 (1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 provides:</PARA>
<PARA> '(1) Indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth shall be prosecuted by indictment in the name of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth or of such other person as the Governor-General appoints in that behalf.'.</PARA>
<PARA> No taxation officer holds an appointment under section 69. The officers who do hold such appointments by the Governor-General are the Crown Solicitor, Deputy Crown Solicitors and certain other senior legal officers of the Attorney-General 's Department.</PARA>
<PARA> The institution of committal proceedings before a magistrate is not similarly restricted. However, it has never been contemplated that a magistrate would be asked to commit a person for trial under the legislation except by an information laid by those legal officers of the Attorney-General's Department who have the responsibility of instituting proceedings for alleged breaches of Commonwealth laws and who had come to the conclusion that, on the evidence available, a prima facie case existed.</PARA>
<PARA>Adequacy of existing laws</PARA>
<PARA> Both sets of legal opinions seek to dispute that there is a need for further legislation to deal with straw company tax evasion and suggest that adequate remedies are already available under existing criminal law, taxation law and laws applying generally to companies in both the State and Commonwealth jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA> This advice is very firmly contradicted by the views of the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor, the acting First Parliamentary Counsel and his officers, senior officers of the Attorney-General's Department, and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Taxation Office. Those officers, who have carefully examined what might be the scope of existing law to overcome these practices, are unanimous that no effective and adequate legal sanction is currently available. Persons known to be operating the schemes do so quite openly and must be taken to share this view. It can be safely assumed that their apparent confidence is founded on the basis of legal opinions.</PARA>
<PARA>Offences under company law</PARA>
<PARA> The opinions supplied by the Law Institute cite sections 67, 114, 124, 367B, 374C and 374G of the uniform companies Acts as being relevant. As a general observation, it may be noted that State company law is not in any event the appropriate vehicle for countering frauds against the Commonwealth. State authorities responsible for following up apparent breaches of company law have their own policies and priorities and the plain fact is that they have not launched prosecutions against people known by the Commissioner of Taxation to be involved. Secrecy provisions of the taxation law are an obstacle to the Commissioner providing relevant information to State authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also the very important drawback that company law is limited to actions in relation to companies, whereas 'straw' arrangements also operate in relation to trusts.</PARA>
<PARA> That difficulty aside, each of the sections referred to by counsel can be seen to have shortcomings such as to render it, at best, of only marginal assistance-</PARA>
<PARA> Section 67-This is a comparatively minor offence and forbids a company to finance the purchase of its own shares. It would not apply to the major straw company operator who does not need to rely on the funds of victim companies when acquiring their shareholdings. Courts rarely register convictions under the section and when they do the penalties imposed are nominal (maximum penalty is 3 months gaol or $1,000 fine-invariably a small fine results).</PARA>
<PARA> Section 114-Although referred to by Messrs Russell and Davies this section appears to be irrelevant to the subject. It merely imposes a maximum $200 fine on a company that does not have the requisite number of directors.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 124-This imposes a duty on directors to act honestly and with reasonable diligence. Being applicable only to directors the section is of little use; in particular it is of no avail against promoters who keep themselves detached from formal participation in the company's affairs. It is also useless where the installed directors are men of straw. In any event, it carries a maximum penalty of a $2,000 fine which is of no deterrent effect when compared with the large sums at stake in straw company operations.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 367B-This section deals with misfeasance by officers of a company and allows a court to assess damages against delinquent officers. Again, this provision cannot be used against entrepreneurs who do not take a direct hand in the management of a company nor, effectively, against ''straw'' directors. There is the further limitation that the section is generally restricted to situations where a company is in liquidation or under an official manager or receiver. Applications to a court for an order against a delinquent officer are ordinarily made by liquidators who can be expected to be unwilling to make application unless a substantial benefit to creditors is likely to result.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 374C (1) provides for it to be an offence for an officer of a company to be knowingly a party to the contracting of a debt where there are no reasonable grounds of expectation that the debt will be paid. This suffers the obvious flaw of being restricted to the 'contracting of a debt', which is not apt to include incurring of a tax liability (3 months imprisonment or $500 fine) .</PARA>
<PARA> Section 374C (2) covers the offence of carrying on the business of a company with intent to defraud creditors or for any fraudulent purpose. It is not clear whether the offence would be committed in circumstances where the business of a company has been brought to an end. Again it is unavailable against scheme operators who formally stand aside from active participation in the company's affairs. The maximum penalties are 1 year's imprisonment or a $2,500 fine.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 374G-This is the nearest comparable company law provision which makes it an offence for an officer of a company, with intent to defraud creditors, to be a party to a reduction (by gift, transfer or charge) in the property of a company. It is also an offence to sell or remove company property, with intent to defraud creditors after or within 2 months before an unsatisfied judgment for payment of money owed by the company.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 374G does not in practice, however, meet the situations that the tax measures necessarily deal with:</PARA>
<PARA> Like section 374G the tax offence will apply to officers of a company (broadly directors, secretaries and employees) but the tax offence will apply also to other parties to the arrangement who have the proscribed purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 374G is limited to officers of companies while the tax provision applies also to trustees and their employees and agents.</PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (b) of section 374G is limited to diminution of assets by gift, transfer or charge. However, in straw company tax evasion the most common arrangements are those under which the assets of a company are stripped by way of loan to an associate or are 'invested' in things such as over-priced redeemable shares.</PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (c) of section 374G, being limited to concealment or removal of assets, could not deal with the 'lending' and 'investing' arrangements mentioned above. The fact that the section is limited to acts after, or within two months before, a court judgment would also rule out its effective use in relation to income tax debts where the stripping arrangements are likely to occur well before the tax is even assessed.</PARA>
<PARA> The penalty on conviction for an offence under section 374G is two years or $5, 000.</PARA>
<PARA>Offences under the Crimes Act</PARA>
<PARA> The only provision of the Commonwealth Crimes Act mentioned specifically in either of the opinions is section 86 which declares that it is an offence to conspire with another person (or persons) to defraud the Commonwealth. (There is also a common law offence of conspiracy, which generally encompasses the agreement of 2 or more persons to do an unlawful act.)</PARA>
<PARA> Section 86 is obviously very much in the mind of scheme operators who have organised their arrangements to minimise any risk of prosecution. They do this by ensuring that parties to straw company schemes know as little as possible of the overall arrangements. Vendor shareholders who take part in the overall arrangements take pains to not even know what happens to their company after it is sold. This renders difficult, to the point of impossibility, the prosecution' s task of showing that any alleged conspirators had the necessary 'common design '.</PARA>
<PARA> Conspiracy is an offence notoriously difficult to prove, even in blatant cases. In the area of 'white collar' crime it is difficult enough to show a guilty intention or knowledge in one person, but this difficulty is compounded when conspiracy must be proved.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 5 of the Crimes Act provides that aiding and abetting a person to commit an offence against the Commonwealth renders a person guilty of the same offence as the person aided and abetted commits, and subject to the same penalty .</PARA>
<PARA> The offence provisions of the Bill contain aiding and abetting offences in language that closely parallels section 5. The technical reason for having separate provisions in the Bill is because the principal straw company offences apply to behaviour of individuals and not companies.</PARA>
<PARA> Where a company is aided and abetted in a 'straw' arrangement section 5 could not operate in conjunction with the basic offence provisions of the Bill, because the company does not itself commit the basic offence.</PARA>
<PARA> There is also advantage in having the aiding and abetting offences contained in the same Act as the principal offences to which they relate. There is implied acceptance in the opinions now under discussion of the concept that legal and accounting advisers should be subject to criminal law aiding and abetting provisions. The Bill does not go beyond that concept.</PARA>
<PARA>Offences under State criminal law</PARA>
<PARA> Counsel have also mentioned State criminal law as an avenue for redress, but have not referred specifically to any particular provisions as being the ones they had in mind. Officers are unaware of any State criminal law measures that provide any real assistance. (So, it can be certain, are the promoters and others involved.) Certainly, the State laws contain aiding and abetting provisions in relation to offences against State law. But again it is first necessary to show that the person aided, etc., commits an offence against the State law. The difficulties in meeting that prerequisite have already been demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA>Income Tax Assessment Act provisions</PARA>
<PARA> The only provision in point is section 231 which makes it an offence to avoid or attempt to avoid assessment or taxation.</PARA>
<PARA> This provisions has the fatal defect that it is framed so as to render the company itself subject to a pecuniary penalty-quite pointless when the company is devoid of assets. In any event, it is very doubtful whether the section applies to schemes to prevent collection of tax, being expressed in terms that strongly suggest it is limited to evasion of tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA>General</PARA>
<PARA> The opinions also refer to existing support for prosecution being available under other general laws, e.g., bankruptcy and common law. No particular offences were mentioned apart from conspiracy which has been discussed earlier. It is difficult to see how the Bankruptcy Act which deals only with cases of individual insolvency can assist in relation to straw company matters.</PARA>
<PARA> The foregoing brief analysis makes it plain that the existing remedies are inadequate to deal with the situation. That is hardly surprising since the provisions discussed were drafted before the emergence of the sophisticated straw company and straw trust arrangements now being encountered.</PARA>
<PARA> Even with the enactment of the present Bill, which is addressed directly to countering these activities, it can be expected that the evidentiary burdens on the prosecution in proving its case beyond reasonable doubt will prove to be very substantial indeed.</PARA>
<PARA>Elements of the offences</PARA>
<PARA> At the heart of each proposed offence are two related elements. For a person to be guilty of an offence he must run foul of at least one of these plus, of course, the other ingredients of each offence.</PARA>
<PARA> The two related elements are-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) reducing a company's or trustee's capacity to pay tax and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) securing a company's or trustee's inability to pay.</PARA>
<PARA> The element of securing inability to pay does not seem to need explanation, but the criticisms now under response have attached the concept of 'reducing capacity to pay'. That concept is a necessary complement to the 'securing inability to pay' concept because if securing inability to pay were the only element there is at least a risk that the provisions would only reach cases where from the outset there was a lack of capacity (as happens in some of the sales tax schemes). To cover the cases-and these are in the majority-where a company could have paid its tax but for what followed, the second element of reducing capacity is required. Its presence in the legislation also facilitates coverage of situations where the stripping leaves some residual amount of funds sufficient to pay a part of the tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Parliamentary Counsel are satisfied that the expression 'reducing capacity to pay' must be interpreted as meaning a real reduction in capacity-it will not be the case, as has been implied, that every payment out of the assets of a company will fall into this description. There is not thought to be any doubt that the courts will read and apply the provisions that way.</PARA>
<PARA> In the company law area, in relation to the company law offence of contracting a debt where there is no reasonable or probable expectation that the company will be able to satisfy the debt (section 374C), the courts have had to come to grips with what is meant by ability to pay. It appears from relevant decisions that the courts approach that task in a flexible and realistic way and will take into account not merely the company's asset position but such factors as its ability to borrow or obtain other financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, reducing capacity to pay is not, as the Law Institute seems to put it, a mere matter of reducing assets. Far from it. A company officer who writes a company cheque for $10,000 thereby may reduce company assets but he does nothing to the company's capacity to pay its tax if the company overall remains in funds to pay the tax. And even if the company were in financial stress the payment of $10,000 would not reduce capacity to pay if it related to acquisition of assets of equivalent value. Payment of an ordinary creditor's debt would not reduce capacity to pay-capacity to pay would have been affected ( if at all) by the incurring of the debt in the first place. As the company law authorities suggest, the question of whether an arrangement or transaction does involve reduction in capacity to pay must be judged on the basis of an overall view of the company's ability to discharge its debts.</PARA>
<PARA> In all of what counsel have written the impression is conveyed that the new provisions carry a real risk of injustices being done, with people being convicted and gaoled in circumstances where no criminal activity had been carried out. The truth lies in quite the opposite direction.</PARA>
<PARA> The Crown Solicitor and other legal officers emphasise that before a prosecution can succeed the Crown will have to discharge very substantial evidentiary burdens in proving every element of an offence beyond reasonable doubt. This task includes the proving of the necessary subjective elements related to the mental state of a person charged.</PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 5, for example, it will be necessary to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a person had a purpose of reducing a company's capacity to pay tax or of securing its inability to pay tax. Alternatively, under clause 7, it will be necessary to prove the proscribed knowledge or belief of a person in entering into an arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> From the outset of this exercise senior legal officers of the Commonwealth have been pointing to the very real evidentiary difficulties that prosecutors face in proving the mental element in 'white collar' crimes. Given the complexity and sophistication of the latest arrangements to strip companies and trusts those difficulties will be no less troublesome for prosecutors in relation to these new provisions. To the extent that arrangements are aimed at defeating collection of 'future' tax, i.e., tax that might reasonably be expected to become payable, the problems of proving the subjective elements of the offence are compounded-in favour of the accused-by the complex nature of the taxation law itself.</PARA>
<PARA> Far from working against accused persons as the opinions imply, the complexity of the general tax law gives opportunities for straw company promoters to colour their real intentions. A number of schemes have come under notice where a tax avoidance scheme is superimposed on stripping arrangements that ensure that tax cannot be paid if the avoidance scheme is ineffective. In such situations the task of showing beyond reasonable doubt that the parties did not expect the avoidance scheme to work would be added to the prosecutor's difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> These considerations are also relevant in relation to the position of professional advisers under the aiding and abetting provisions. Contrary to the opinion of Messrs Russell &amp; Davies, the Crown Solicitor is firmly of the view that courts would not register a conviction on anything less than proof beyond reasonable doubt of the requisite subjective knowledge or belief of what was being sought to be achieved by the client.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the suggestion that a person might be convicted because of a tax liability stemming from a subsequent change in the taxation law made by a court decision is untenable. The fact that the requisite purpose, knowledge or belief must be demonstrated as at the time of entry into an arrangement becomes more difficult rather than less difficult. It would be only in an exceptional case that it could be expected to be shown that the outcome of the court decision on the tax liability question had been anticipated by the parties to a company stripping operation if, but for the decision, no tax liabiity would have arisen.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is being said that the legislation could, if interpreted widely, impinge on quite ordinary business transactions. This is an allegation frequently made about tax legislation but history is not on its side. Look at section 260, for instance.</PARA>

<PARA> There is a real danger to the community, however, by the loss of proper ministerial supervision. It is essential that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia should be able to gain full access to taxation information so that he can see the extent to which the Revenue of the Commonwealth may be being affected by fiscal policy, or by the depredations of thieves and rogues. Should any Treasurer in the future seek to misuse the access to information that this would give him, the matter may be redressed by Parliament, and if not by Parliament, by the people at an election. Likewise, the Attorney-General should have free access to all information that comes to the Crown Solicitor's Office, and not be inhibited by the operation of section 16.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on with the recommendation which is being examined by the Attorney- General and by the Treasurer in relation to that matter. I think it would be a reasonable test in relation to any documents to see whether there are any documents that have not been made available to the Royal Commissioner which might be made available and which would meet the normal test of freedom of information legislation once that legislation has actually been proclaimed and is in force. I think it would be reasonable to regard any requests from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this matter against that general background. They will be so examined.</PARA>

<PARA>I move this motion because the Standing Orders of the House limit the initiatives which the Opposition can take in any effort designed to bring properly to account a government seeking to evade responsibility. This Government, the most scandal-ridden government in the history of this nation, is now beset by a scandal that far exceeds anything in either its term of office or in the history of Australian national government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) today sought to reduce Question Time to a low farce. Three questions were directed to the Prime Minister. They concerned matters central to an issue of great concern leaving the community alarmed at the level of administration by the Fraser Government. In all respects the Prime Minister sought to evade any responsibility in these matters, responding that in some time in the hereafter-God alone knows when that might be-there may be access to relevant documents under the Freedom of Information Act when and if-I stress if-it is proclaimed. That is no resolution to the problems that beset this Government and disturb the Australian community. Ordinary Australians cherish standards of decency in the conduct of their daily affairs. They are appalled at the standards this Fraser Government is seeking to establish because of the way in which it has behaved in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Look at the questions which were asked. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) had made a declaration in a Press statement in late June-a quite compendious Press statement-which was at diametrical odds with what the Prime Minister was seeking to assert today. The Prime Minister and more recently the Treasurer in this Parliament sought to evade real responsibility and accountability for matters relating to tax evasion-which I repeat is a criminal offence and, I add, rampant within the higher echelons of the Liberal Party-by invoking section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Later, in late June, the Treasurer, as I indicated today in my question to the Prime Minister, made it abundantly clear that those secrecy provisions-or privacy provisions as they should be more accurately defined-were nowhere near as strict as he is now interpreting them. In fact, he sought to claim then, when seeking to pour scorn and contumely on the McCabe- Lafranchi report, that if McCabe and Lafranchi had approached him or the Taxation Office they would have had access in general terms to matters related to tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Now as a matter of convenience, when their hides are on fire, they are declaring that section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act will now allow no such thing. That is sheer nonsense. It is a deceit. It is designed quite dishonestly to mislead this Parliament. The same applies to the joint management review report. That ought to be tabled. I have here before me, on the centre table, extracts from that report. It does not glibly brush aside the deficiencies of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office as the Prime Minister sought to do. More pertinently, the Prime Minister sought to slide around what is a crucial issue of conflict between, on the one hand, what the Treasurer claimed in late June in his Press statement in relation to the attitude of the Government and various departments, including the Australian Taxation Office, and, on the other hand, the view put by Royal Commissioner Costigan in relation to the attitude of the legal section of the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner declared in his published report that the legal section of the Taxation Office for a long time, measured not in days, weeks or months but in years, had been confused and could not understand why existing provisions of company law, the Crimes Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act and other related Acts were not applied in connection with tax evasion practices. He declared that he believed, as did a wide range of independent opinions of senior counsel which were made available to government departments, that those provisions could adequately be invoked for prosecution purposes against tax evaders. He said quite explicitly in his report that the legal section of the Taxation Office believed that this could be done. In late June the Treasurer-there can be only one construction of what he did-sought to mislead the Australian public and serving members of parliament by declaring to the contrary, by declaring that the legal section of the Taxation Office accepted the view of the Crown Solicitor's Office that existing provisions could not apply. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about the grimmest scandal that has confronted this Government in the period in which it has been in office since 1975. It is quite a scandal. No government has been confronted and wracked by more scandals that has this Government. Let me give honourable members its dimensions. Let us not brush away what we are talking about. We are not just talking about errant behaviour; we are talking about a dereliction of duty on the part of Ministers-the Attorney- General (Senator Durack) as the first law officer of the land and the culpability of the Treasurer, who is responsible for tax collections, for amounts which are estimated conservatively at between $10,000m and $15,000m. Let us look at what that money could have done for Australia. The total amount of payments and loan approvals to the States for this year is $15,000m. The whole of Australia at the State level could have had its affairs paid for by the accumulated losses through tax evasion which this Government and its two culpable Ministers presided over. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just a matter of errant behaviour or shuffling of ministerial responsibility, a central principle to our system of government; it is a matter of the indolence of these Ministers giving accommodation to criminal activity. The criminal activity is organised crime. We are talking about organised crime by white collar masterminds, many of whom are members of the Liberal Party and many of whom have been identified as senior officials of the Liberal Party. Sure , the mercenary hoodlums and thugs provided by the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union were put out front to do the dirty work. But as Commissioner Costigan points out in his report-not the published one-they were regularly brought to account for their criminal behaviour. The white collar masterminds consistently evade their responsibilities. The white collar masterminds include, I repeat, some of the brightest and best that the Liberal Party has been able to produce. </PARA>
<PARA> The report talks about only one promoter. What happens when we come to Sydney and Melbourne which are the main focuses of the organisation of this sort of tax evasion? What happens when we discover the identity of the three eminent ' gentlemen'-I use the word 'gentlemen' rather loosely-who, as their reward for services to society, have been elevated to the peerage of the realm, who are well known as being involved in organised crime and who are making huge fortunes in this country? I do not have to identify them. They are well known to the Press Gallery. They are well known to the police, who have conveyed their identities to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That point of contention between us can easily be cleared up. All the Prime Minister has to do is to give me authority to quote the names and I will give the House the background of those people. Let me continue. This Government sinks deeper and deeper in the mud of scandal and dissension which it heaps upon itself. Look at the past week. The Federal Executive of the Liberal Party, sullen in its resentment, merely noted what the Government intended to do in relation to retrospectivity in legislation affecting tax avoidance. Look at this quotation from the Australian:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One source close to delegates from West Australia said: 'There's a long way between noting and approving what this Government is trying to do'. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course they do not approve it. The Liberal Party administration, at least extra-parliamentary, is absolutely corrupted by this sort of behaviour which the Prime Minister, by his description of it, has defined as criminal behaviour. Look at the events of last week. There was the extraordinary situation of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) declaring that an unnamed Minister had been cleared of unspecified charges; and he asked us to take the Government on trust in this matter. This Government is the least trustworthy government in the history of the Parliament. Scarcely a day went by last week when there was not a demand from the ranks of the Government that the Attorney- General resign. Senator Withers said: 'You should not start at the bottom with a few sacrifices aimed at taking the pressure off. You sack senior Ministers and senior public servants'. He said: 'Do you want poor Australian standards?' Read for 'poor Australian standards' 'Malcolm Fraser's standards'. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey), who is enjoying his last days in this Parliament as it draws to a close, said that the Attorney-General had failed in his commission to administer his office and made it clear that the Attorney-General ought to resign. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr), also in the closing period of his parliamentary service, said quite bluntly that Senator Durack ought to resign. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) said with a sort of vanity wave gush that there is only one conclusion under the Westminster system. We all know what that is-sack him, get rid of him. Where is the Treasurer while all this is going on? He has been shipped overseas like an unwanted remittance man. These are the standards of the Government at present. To top it off, the Age newspaper this morning on its front page had the latest episode of this shoddy behaviour. It outlined how even more companies involved in tax evasion had been organised by Mr Horgan. Who is Mr Horgan? He has been chief fund raiser for the Liberal Party in Western Australia, amongst his other duties. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that we are not talking about just some minor aberration of people who are perhaps misdirected but are not criminally intending to devise schemes to avoid their tax liability; we are talking about exercises which have been embarked upon quite consciously by people who have contrived them for the purpose of evading their clearly identifiable tax liability at law. That is a criminal offence. But honourable members need not take my word for it. On 30 August in South Australia, the Prime Minister had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In a real sense, the recipients of those funds have in their hands stolen funds whether you want to say stolen from the Commonwealth or stolen from other taxpayers it doesn't matter very much. </PARA>
<PARA>Why did it take so many years for the Government to get active on this matter? What these people, these senior officials of standing in the Liberal Party, did was to make Ronald Biggs's audacious efforts pale into the modesty of gathering pocket money. In its own way this is a serious criminal offence. If a person blew a safe with the aim of picking up $10,000 or $20,000, the full and unrelenting force of the law would pursue him through the courts. He would go to gaol, and very properly. If someone broke into a house and stole the contents of the house, the full and unremitting force of the law would fall there too. That person would end up in gaol, again, very properly. But the proceeds from the offences that we are discussing today make those offences look like the gathering of spending money for a paper boy. These offences must be measured in thousands of millions of accumulated dollars which have made individual members of the Liberal Party multi-millionaires. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the sorts of people who are involved. We have had them addressed to us before but let us look at them again. They include Bill Mitchell, special adviser to the Western Australian Liberal Party Premier-I wonder on what he advises-Ian Warner, Western Australian State President of the Liberal Party; Denis Byrne Horgan, chairman of the finance committee, who was drawn in for his special qualifications, I presume; Sid Corser, immediate past President of the Western Australian Liberal Party; and His Honour, the Australian High Commissioner in London, Sir Victor Garland-his activities were described in some detail by my colleague the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) in the last parliamentary sitting week so I shall not go through them. Andrew Tilt, Tasmanian Premier Gray's head of office, is involved in a little tickling of the petty cash can in this area. We discover in the newspapers today that the Government members in South Australia and a senior former member of the Liberal Party in New South Wales have also been involved. I am starting to wonder whether there is anybody in the Liberal Party who has not been drawn in. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the principles that guide these people? I think they were startlingly divulged a few weeks ago at Question Time in the Parliament when the Treasurer declared, I thought rather unwisely given all the information around to the contrary, that tax evasion was dead. He invoked for his authority Coopers and Lybrand. It so happened that I recalled that Coopers and Lybrand were cited in the McCabe-Lafranchi report as being the fiscal advisers to some group that was involved very heavily in tax evasion. When I pointed this out to the Treasurer, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I was perfectly aware, when I gave the answer that I did, that Coopers and Lybrand were referred to in the McCabe report. I would have thought that the authority of people to speak on this subject had something to do with their practical knowledge and understanding of what has gone on in the tax avoidance industry. If one wants to understand what has happened in this area one should not confine one's examination to a reliance on the views of people who have absolutely no practical understanding of what goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> So now we understand the principle behind any announcement from the Government, should we hear it in the near future, that the new chairman of the national crimes commission will be Harry M. Miller. The facts are that this situation is out of the Prime Minister's control. Sure, the Prime Minister can declare that a special prosecutor's office will be set up, but that is trying to shut the door after the horse has bolted. He can talk about a crimes commission if he wishes and seek to infer that that is the preferred view of the Costigan Royal Commission. If that is so, he must have a different edition from both the published and non-published volumes of that report. My reading of the unpublished volume referring to this matter leads me to the understanding that Commissioner Costigan sees very serious defects and very real threats to people' s fundamental liberties in the American approach, as practised, to the crimes commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the problems the Prime Minister has, and honourable members will understand why this matter is out of his control. One fundamental fact is that he cannot sack these Ministers as he ought to, and as he did when a miserable 200 bucks was involved in a television set. They were small beer; they were the minnows. He cannot sack these Ministers, much as he may want to if he has a grain of moral decency in him, for the basic reason that there are two National Country Party Ministers who presided over the greatest food scandal in the history of this country-the substitution of rotten donkey meat for first grade export beef. It may call for special skills to do that, skills over which only the National Country Party has a monopoly. The rest of Australia is not diverted and, even more certainly, it is not impressed. Those Ministers do not intend to stand down when their incompetence, glaring as it is, is finally established by an inquiry into this matter, a royal commission. How many royal commissions will this country be burdened with in the course of this parliamentary term investigating the grave deficiencies and gross incompetences of Ministers of the Fraser Government?</PARA>
<PARA> Another reason why this matter is out of the control of the Prime Minister is that his national Executive has declared solemnly that, while it notes his intentions, it will not support them in relation to retrospectivity of legislation in this area. What it is really saying by implication is: 'All the speculation in the newspapers may be right. Maybe you do want an early election. We can understand why, given the mess you have made of the Australian economy, given the dissatisfaction. Okay, get the election out of the way, and we will remind you that we just noted your intentions, we did not support them, and you will not be doing much about it'. Let us see the Horgans and the Corsers and the rest of them from the Liberal Party in the courts on criminal charges and going to gaol as they ought to. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question is this: What have Durack and Howard got on the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party that has made them frightened to act? Everyone knows why this sham fight has gone on for so many years in relation to tax avoidance and tax evasion. Everyone knows, but it has been made dramatically clear now, with the evidence publicly produced. They have been sham fighting because Liberals have been making money out of it. We have the curious situation where the Prime Minister will not sack the Attorney-General, but he will not defend him either. He does not want to talk about the Treasurer. That is why he has got him overseas. This is how committed he is to his Ministers in this mess of incompetence and bumbling which has been exposed. I quote from a report in last Saturday's Australian of a Press conference in which the Prime Minister was involved. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you agree with Mr Peacock and Senator Withers that Senator Durack should resign?</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA> I'm not going to comment on that. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he added rather sourly:</PARA>
<PARA> I thought we weren't going to talk about this. </PARA>
<PARA>For good measure, he went on and clearly nailed his colours to the mast by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> If we are, this ends now. </PARA>
<PARA>What sort of Prime Minister is this who says his Ministers should not resign when ordinary Australians have been ripped off on this massive scale while the Government has been sitting on its hands like a dummy-a zombie government for the first time in the history of the nation. The Prime Minister refuses to give any explanation or defence. Who will be convinced by that sort of thing?</PARA>
<PARA> The issue is one of ministerial responsibility. If nothing else invoked moves our case-hardened colleagues opposite on the Government benches-we can understand why they would be case-hardened after being involved in so many scandals in this country which would have humiliated any person of decent morality-let me quote what the late Sir Robert Menzies had to say about this:</PARA>
<PARA> To put this matter in another way, in our system a political minister must face the music in Parliament; that is his duty and his privilege. He must take responsibility for his department and its administration. When I was Attorney- General-</PARA>
<PARA>Attorney-General, mind you:</PARA>
<PARA>I had a fixed rule that advice given to me by the Solicitor-General (who, in Australia, is an official and not a politician) was given to me for my consideration and if adopted by me became my advice for which I must accept responsibility. If his views were rejected by me, I would, of course, substitute my own opinion and the Solicitor-General's advice would find a resting-place in the files. This practice indeed represents the whole principle in action of ministerial responsibility; ministerial responsibility is of the essence of responsible government. </PARA>
<PARA>We therefore have irresponsible government, on this Government's record. Let us be clear about it. The Attorney-General is, on paper at least, highly qualified in the practice of law. He would know from both his studies and his practical involvement as a lawyer, as a politician and as a Minister the responsibilities that fall upon his shoulders. He does not mutely and thoughtlessly accept propositions put to him by his Department as interpretations of the law; he has to be satisfied, drawing on his experience and knowledge, that the interpretations are correct. What he is trying to put to us though, by implication, is that Ministers such as he sit behind padlocked office doors like big dummies shuffling papers which have been pushed under the door. They are time servers; they are mute ciphers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General is given a commission by the Governor-General to administer his Department and to accept certain responsibilities. It is clear that the Attorney-General is not accepting those responsibilities. He is not just seeking not to accept them. I invite the House to look at the transcript-I regret I do not have time to go through it-of the television program Sunday of 5 September 1982 when with some rather clumsy footwork he sought to put all the responsibility onto the shoulders of the Treasurer. What we need to do in this House is to see the documents we referred to today: The long list of independent senior counsel opinions, the reports of the Australian Federal Police, the very detailed, exacting and highly skilled report of tax investigator Todman and the opinions of the legal section of the Taxation Office-all of which are quite contrary to the practices of the Government, its declarations and its decisions. It is pretty clear from the long list of comments made by the Treasurer in his statement on 27 June 1982 that he had considerable detail available to him about these matters dealt with by Costigan in relation to these subjects which were discussed in this Parliament last week and are being aired again today and will continue to be aired because the smell of this incompetence-indeed this corruption-will not go away by stalling and holding actions on the part of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard certain sections of observations I have made in relation to the statement of the Treasurer on 27 June. Those statements clearly evidence that the Treasurer had information available to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me continue while the honourable gentleman looks at it. The Treasurer has sought to conceal his responsibility in these matters by aiming at invoking the cover of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Honourable members will recall that section 16 is the so-called secrecy or privacy provision of that Act. By statements the Treasurer has made, he had available to him quite extensive general information on these matters; that is, section 16 does not apply. By the statement he made in late June, it is abundantly clear that opinions must have been made available to him. He is, or was until he became a member of parliament, a practising lawyer. It is also equally clear that similar information must have been available to the Attorney-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The case is prima facie that both Ministers knew of their ministerial responsibilities in this matter-that is, they should have more carefully and critically addressed themselves to the matters before them-and certainly no one sensibly or fairly could argue that they ought not to have known. To argue that would be to argue the case of dereliction of duty in public office and that is what the Attorney-General seeks to establish. The Government, through these matters, has become the focus of public scorn and contempt. In their fashion the Liberals are faithful to public morality but they act like a cut rate street corner strumpet who is opposed to pornographic publications in her off-duty hours. No one believes them. This is a government which is deeply steeped in incompetence in administration and corruption-if not in its parliamentary administration, in its extra-parliamentary administration. Therein rests the explanation why no effective action, until quite recently, has been contemplated by the Government against organised, criminal tax evasion. The reason is that so many Liberals stood to gain profit from it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The statement continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) First, the Treasurer outlines in considerable detail, but without the trenchant criticism of Costigan, the same bottom of the harbour scheme as is covered by Costigan in his fourth report. If the secrecy provisions are so draconian, how was the Treasurer able to get such a detailed breakdown, presumably minus names, from the Tax Office in June 1982?</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Treasurer specifically states that he first became aware of the bottom of the harbour schemes in May 1978. In other words he has known now for over four years. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Treasurer was continually kept informed since May 1978. In his statement he refers on page 7 to the fact that he received minutes from the Commissioner of Taxation relating to bottom of the harbour schemes; on page 16 he says legal advice was provided by the Government about the law applying to bottom of the harbour schemes; on page 17 of his statement he says that the Tax Office passed further reports about company stripping to him after May 1978; on page 21 of the statement he again refers to legal advice he received on bottom of the harbour schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) The most compelling argument that there was no bar to him knowing was in his own words in the conclusion of his Press statement on page 51. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Of particular concern is that fact that as appears on page 24 of the report--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the McCabe-Lafranchi report. </PARA>
<PARA>the authors sought no facts or comments from the Taxation Office and admit: that for that reason the opinions they expressed were necessarily based on limited factual data.'</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Their reference to the secrecy provisions of the income tax law does not justify that omission. While the secrecy provisions do forbid unauthorised disclosure of taxation information the Commissioner of Taxation would readily have explained to Messrs McCabe and Lafranchi had they approached him, his general administrative approach in cases of this nature. In particular, he would have explained how he had been seeking the institution of legal action with a view to persons concerned being brought to book.'</PARA>
<PARA>This clearly establishes beyond any doubt-from his own statement-that there was full access without any serious impediment from section 16 of the taxation Act to the sort of information that this House should now have available to it. I quote from Senator Durack's statement made on Nationwide on 24 August. He stated :</PARA>
<PARA> Now, the Treasurer's indicated already, and it's clear the Government was given information in broad terms about the problem that was arising with straw companies, what have now become known as bottom of the harbour companies. And that was advised to the Treasurer in 1978 and it led to the special legislation, the Crimes Taxation Offences Act, which was passed in the end of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>On the Government's own declaration, on the record of the quite lengthy Press statement of the Treasurer in June and on the statement of the Attorney-General, made on a perhaps not terribly popular current affairs television program quite recently, quite extensive information was made available to the Government on these matters. The conclusion is clear. When it suits the Government the confidentiality or privacy provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act are no impediment to adequate information being provided; they merely become a disability for the Parliament when the Government finds it not just inconvenient but downright embarrassing should that information be made available. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us understand what this is all about. It is about the provision of information in this Parliament so that members of the Parliament can make a properly tempered and carefully considered judgment not just about whether the principle of ministerial responsibility was seriously infringed-it clearly was- but about the nature and the extent of that infringement, and go beyond that to establish to what extent the Prime Minister himself is involved in these matters . It is incomprehensible that, in that period from 1978 to 1980, and of course subsequently, when debate on these issues-tax avoidance and tax evasion-reached a fever pitch to the disadvantage of the Government, there was not, first of all , detailed analysis by the responsible Ministers, both lawyers-the Attorney- General and the Treasurer -of legal opinion available. It is incomprehensible that these Ministers did not note that the legal section of the Taxation Office disputed the indolent conclusions of the Crown law office that existing provisions were defective-it believed that they were effective-and the information provided by the Commonwealth Police Force and by the taxation investigator Todman. In considering these matters the Cabinet must be directly involved. At regular intervals the Prime Minister must be party to discussions at this high level. Finally, in bringing about changes to the law in response to alleged defects disputed by every other source-except apparently the indolent, lethargic Crown law office-the Prime Minister and Cabinet must be directly involved. The fact is that we are calling for the resignation of the Attorney- General and the Treasurer. If they do not have the common decency, which would prevail for any ordinary citizen outside, to resign they ought to be sacked forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) in making his presentation on many occasions slid around the facts to make a point. That might be all right in this chamber but it does not get to the substance of the issue and it does not get to the concerns of this Parliament. Let me take a point right at the outset. In answer to questions I indicated that a request for a document on this issue would be dealt with in accordance with freedom of information legislation as though that legislation were in force. That would be the test that would be put against any request for a document. The Leader of the Opposition, in response, tried to suggest that requests would be dealt with when the legislation is given the royal assent, when it comes into material force in the generality of application. That, of course, is not what I said in that particular answer. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition also keeps avoiding the fact that it is the Royal Commissioner, Mr Costigan, who said that neither the Treasurer (Mr Howard), nor the Attorney-General (Senator Durack ) nor any of their predecessors, including the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer, could have been told of the particularities of the case which is the main subject of chapter 3 of the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The Leader of the Opposition continually ignores that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, in talking about section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, the Leader of the Opposition continually avoids and ignores relevant paragraphs in the Royal Commissioner's report. In any accurate description of the events he ought not to do so. One of the things that come out very plainly is that the Leader of the Opposition finds it very difficult to read any document in a straight fashion. I would like to read in full the Federal Executive resolution of the Liberal Party of Australia. In addition, I would like to read a letter that was signed by the Federal President as a result of one particular newspaper chain getting the interpretation of that resolution quite wrong. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Executive of the Liberal Party today came out strongly behind the Government's continuing battle against tax evasion and tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Executive gave full support to the Government's determination to recover tax illegally evaded through devices such as the bottom-of-the-harbour and other schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Executive noted that the Government, in its legislation, did not intend to establish a new tax liability but was determined to collect the tax that had been evaded from those who had wrongfully benefited from such evasion. The Government had indicated that it would be taking particular care in drawing up the legislation and it would be given the closest possible scrutiny before it was introduced into the House. </PARA>
<PARA> The Executive, while recording its objection in principle to retrospectivity,--</PARA>
<PARA>What honourable member does not dislike that principle in basic fact? But there are some circumstances which lead us to put aside that objection--</PARA>
<PARA>noted that the Government's intention was to collect the tax which would have been paid in the absence of such devices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Executive expressed strong support for the Government's determination to bring criminal proceedings against promoters of these schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Because there were some misinterpretations of that very plain statement by one newspaper chain, the Federal President of the Party wrote a letter clarifying the issue and making it quite beyond doubt. In that letter, amongst other things , he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Executive statement issued last Friday does represent unaminous support from the Executive for the Government's determined moves against tax evasion and tax avoidance and in particular for the Government's moves against bottom-of-the -harbour schemes. </PARA>

He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Executive statement issued last Friday does represent unanimous support from the Executive for the Government's determined moves against tax evasion and tax avoidance and in particular for the Government's moves against bottom-of-the -harbour schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Executive does not like the element of retrospectivity involved in proposed new legislation, but accepts the inevitability of this in the circumstances. It believes it is an occasion when the pursuit of tax evaders-and a fair go for the community as a whole-is the most important of the competing principles. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister made no concessions and gave no ground at the Federal Executive meeting. The Executive respected and supported the Prime Minister's uncompromising stand. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words are perfectly plain in regard to the attitude of my organisation. The Leader of the Opposition imputed to the central organisation of the Liberal Party views which were totally false. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is important to understand that once the Costigan report was within the hands of the Government we moved to take action swiftly on a number of fronts.

Obviously that investigation, dependent upon the examiners's inclinations and upon what his examinations reveal, could become quite a wide inquiry. It is my understanding that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) will be announcing today the name of the person who will be undertaking that inquiry. A joint management review of the Crown Solicitor's Office has been undertaken. It is in the process of implementation. As I said before, that report did not get to the heart of the matters revealed by the Costigan report, and maybe it could not have been expected to because it was not that kind of inquiry.

An urgent examination is being conducted into those recommendations. Many honourable members, certainly those on this side of the House, will be interested about the future of the Costigan Royal Commission. Both the Attorney and I have said on more than one occasion that the Commission will have its term of office extended beyond its present period which expires on 31 December this year. There will be continuing activity by the Commission. We are, of course, examining the establishment of a national crimes commission. Some elements of the crimes commission may well take over work that is being undertaken by Mr Costigan. In the meantime, the Attorney will have discussions with Mr Costigan on Friday about how the task force we will establish with the special prosecutor and a further task force we are prepared to establish in co-operation with Victoria in relation to other general matters referred to in the Royal Commissioner's report can be best assisted by the Royal Commissioner, by the evidence available to the Royal Commissioner and by the information and the vast stack of documentation within the files of the Royal Commission. We hope that the activities of the Royal Commissioner and the task forces of the special prosecutor can be co-ordinated in a way which will most effectively lead to prosecution in these matters. I hope that the extensive measures which the Government has taken will have the full support of the Opposition.

The genesis of the tax avoidance industry goes back to 1973. It goes back to the Curran scheme. It is worth noting that the then Treasurer, Mr Crean, stated that the government of the day was considering amending the income tax law and expressing a new capital gains tax law so as to counteract the effect of the High Court decision in the Curran case. But through the terms of office of three Treasurers-Mr Crean , Dr Cairns and the present Leader of the Opposition-nothing at all was done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was making the point that this Government has acted on many occasions in relation to tax avoidance and tax evasion, in marked distinction from three Labor Treasurers who, even though they were well aware that there were problems in relation to the Curran scheme, did precisely nothing. The new anti-avoidance section of the Income Tax Assessment Act-Part IVA-and the changes to the Acts Interpretation Act are most significant amendments and changes. As a result, it is our advice that new tax avoidance schemes have been stopped and that up to this point the section of the Act has been thoroughly effective. Loopholes have been plugged. If there is a need for further measures in the future, obviously the Government stands ready to legislate. Again, it is obvious that the proposed new legislation against bottom-of-the-harbour schemes is an example of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fairness of this legislation will be given careful consideration. The Government is determined to collect revenue. It should be noted that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) made his statement about this piece of legislation before the Costigan report was tabled. It is worth noting also that the Australian Labor Party has admitted the effectiveness of the legislation as Senator Evans is on record as having said that it will enable the Government actually to recover the amounts lost. I think that is an important admission by the Opposition because of all the members of the Opposition, Senator Evans may know something about the matter. It indicates that the Government's approach is effective and is working. I would like to have incorporated in Hansard a list of the various measures the present Government has legislated against over the last three or four years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition has made that point. I call the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a great deal of misunderstanding-in many cases deliberate misunderstanding-in relation to the question of ministerial responsibility. I think it is well worth noting that there are many misunderstandings of what is alleged to be the practice and the principle in the United Kingdom. I put certain views on record for the benefit of the House. It is worth quoting the view expressed by Sir David Maxwell Fyfe on 20 July 1954. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . where action has been taken by a civil servant of which the Minister disapproves and has no prior knowledge, and the conduct of the official is reprehensible, then there is no obligation on the Minister to endorse what he believes to be wrong or to defend what are clearly shown to be errors of his officers . . . But, of course, he remains constitutionally responsible to Parliament for the fact that something has gone wrong and he alone can tell Parliament what has occurred and render an account of his stewardship. </PARA>
<PARA>(Extension of time granted). </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to quote another view which was expressed by Herbert Morrison, a former member of the Labour Government in Britain who said:</PARA>
<PARA> If a mistake is made in a Government Department the Minister is responsible even if he knew nothing about it . . . even if he has no real responsibility whatsoever, the Minister is still held responsible . . . It is, however, legitimate for him to explain that something went wrong in the department, that he accepts responsibility and apologises for it, and that he has taken steps to see that such a thing will not happen again. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that those two statements disappoint the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party but they go very much to the point. If a matter has gone wrong in a department it is the duty and responsibility of a Minister to put that matter right. There is no anology at all with the kinds of circumstances that unfolded with Lord Carrington in relation to the Falklands dispute. He has been personally responsible for offering advice to the British Government on the conduct of foreign policy, and that advice had proved to be in error. As I understand it, he advised that the Argentinians would not use force and that the garrison on the Falklands was large enough and did not need reinforcing. He indicated after the event-after hostilities began-that he had been personally responsible for the conduct of foreign policy and for the advice that had been tendered to the Government and, therefore, in those circumstances believed that he ought to resign. Those circumstances bear no analogy with the circumstances of the Attorney-General or the Treasurer. Indeed, the comments of Sir David Maxwell Fyfe and Herbert Morrison bear reasonably accurately on the current circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the section the Leader of the Opposition read concerning Sir Robert Menzies imputed to that section a meaning which is not in the original text. The point Sir Robert was making was that Ministers are responsible to the Parliament and answerable to the Parliament; they need to explain policies and to respond to questions. This is where Ministers must take responsibility for what they do and for what their departments have done. He also pointed out that it was their duty and their privilege to face the music in Parliament. Quite plainly, that is the kind of circumstance this Parliament is for, and that is the circumstance that is being applied at present. The Leader of the Opposition in making those points seemed to have forgotten that there was a censure motion on this broad subject in the last week of the parliamentary session. The Treasurer was here to answer it; he spoke and an extended debate went on for several hours of parliamentary time. In the light of that and in the light of the Treasurer's response at that time, and knowing that the Treasurer had planned to be at the International Monetary Fund meeting and other discussions, I think it is despicable to attack him for being away during this one week of the parliamentary session. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other matters that I think need to be commented upon. I should like to read a letter from Mr Costigan. This letter, which is to be tabled in the Parliament, is a highly relevant letter as to two points. The letter, dated 6 September, states:</PARA>
<PARA>My dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> Both the Commonwealth and the Victorian Governments have enquired whether I would modify the recommendation contained in the Interim Report No. 4 that Volumes 2 and 3 of that Report should remain confidential. In making that enquiry it has been suggested that I also consider whether, in the event that I remain of the same opinion that the Report should not be tabled, it would be possible for a summary of these two volumes to be published. </PARA>
<PARA> To meet this enquiry I have re-read with care both volumes. </PARA>
<PARA> With one modification, which I shall refer to shortly, it is still my firm view -</PARA>
<PARA>His view-not the Government's view but the Royal Commissioner's view-</PARA>
<PARA>that these volumes should not be published. The events of the last fortnight have strengthened this view. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important sentence. The Royal Commissioner stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The events of the last fortnight have strengthened this view. Moreover any summary of the volumes would be rendered meaningless by the need for massive editing and deletion. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the reasons for this view can be stated (others cannot because the reasons would themselves reveal confidential information):</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The reports deal with matters which are the subject of current investigation by the Commission. To reveal the nature and the direction of those investigations would be counter-productive to the work of the Commission;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) A number of the matters referred to in the two volumes are the subject of proposed or current investigation by law enforcement agencies, some of which have commenced as a direct result of matters ascertained by this Commission. Those investigations, as much as the Commission's investigations, would be prejudiced by the publication of what is presently known;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) It is in the interests of the community that the persons mentioned in the two volumes be dealt with according to law and by the implementation of the normal criminal processes. A fair and proper trial would be impossible should the reports be published. In expressing this view, which I have always held, I find considerable support in the observations of several Judges of the High Court in the recent decision in Hammond v. Woodward. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> I can see why there is some concern about not publishing these volumes. This springs from the fact that it is public knowledge that the two volumes are in existence and a good deal of speculation has arisen as to their contents, much of it quite unfair to some persons and organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA>Much of it quite unfair to some persons and organisations. </PARA>

<PARA> It would be quite inaccurate to draw any specific inference as to what names might appear in those volumes, or whether they come from any particular state or territory or country or have associations with any political organisation or group. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite obviously, Mr Costigan felt it necessary to place that section in this letter because of the statements of the Leader of the Opposition, statements which he knows to be false and which he has repeated on more than one occasion, and again in relation to people in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should have thought that even the Leader of the Opposition could understand Mr Costigan's letter. He does not want these things published because it would prejudice inquiries. It is worth noting that Mr Costigan made it perfectly plain that it would be quite wrong to draw any inferences about the nature of those names. I shall read that section again:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would be quite inaccurate to draw any specific inference as to what names might appear in those volumes, or whether they come from any particular state or territory or country or have associations with any political organisation or group. </PARA>
<PARA>It was necessary for that to be said because the Leader of the Opposition, on a radio program, had said:</PARA>
<PARA> And it is indisputable that the political contacts that some of those white collar criminals have would be very embarrassing for political parties; but the Labor party is not included amongst those parties which could be embarrassed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition was quite plainly seeking to use privileged knowledge, having been given copies of those reports which the Royal Commissioner wants to be kept secret, in a way which he knows to be utterly contemptible and beneath any person in this House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Costigan's letter further states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I should say something about the nature and role of interim reports. Particularly in a Commission such as this, which extends over a considerable period of time and covers a vast range of subjects, it is important that from time to time Government should be informed as to the directions in which the Commission is moving and the conclusions it is reaching on specific matters. Indeed it was contemplated that I should do so when I received a major extension of time in early 1981. By being appraised as to these matters in detail Governments may better determine such legislative and administrative initiatives as may be required. For example, there is currently discussion in the highest places concerning the need or otherwise for a Crime Commission. I believe the confidential volumes can be of assistance in these discussions by revealing the type and character of organised crime in our community and identifying means of suppressing it. For such reports to be useful generalities are not adequate: without detailed analysis their value is limited. But, for the reasons given above, unless such analysis remains confidential it cannot be included in a report. </PARA>
<PARA> The modification I referred to in paragraph 3 above relates to Chapter 10 of the Report contained in Volume 2. Following a request transmitted to me by the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department I have prepared an edited version of this Chapter which I have forwarded to both Governments. It may assist State Attorneys-General and Police Ministers in their current consideration of a Crime Commission. It is for both Governments to determine whether it should be so distributed or whether the publication should be wider. </PARA>
<PARA> I have written in similar terms to the Premier of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>That edited chapter will be published as soon as copies are available. I regret that at present I do not have a copy available for the House. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one other point I would like to make. I did not make it at Question Time in the Parliament last week when the Leader of the Opposition originally became sensitive about certain matters. However, I have made the point very plainly that if an organisation of the character and kind of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union happened to be affiliated with the Liberal Party of Australia-I am sure the same would apply to the National Country Party of Australia-then either of us would move to have that body disaffiliated from our ranks forthwith. Painters and dockers, the people whom Mr Costigan has described as murderers and thugs, the organisation which is in charge of hardened criminals, the organisation that has put it beyond the reach of normal law enforcement agencies is affiliated with and through its affiliation takes part in the policy-making provisions of the Australian Labor Party. Why does the Australian Labor Party not move for disaffiliation of this organisation from the State of Victoria? The Painters and Dockers Union is affiliated with the Australian Labor Party in several States. Senator Georges has confessed to this in the Senate. And the honourable gentleman who does not know what his senators reveal should find out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been an abysmal defence by the Government. We did not hear one real reason given by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) as to why the Ministers-the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard)-should remain in the Cabinet. Both Ministers should be sacked. Let me make the situation very clear. What is the criterion on which the right honourable gentleman purports to defend his two Ministers? That is what the debate is about-in fact, not only the two Ministers but also the whole of the Government. The Prime Minister relies on a statement which was made by Maxwell Fyfe about ministerial responsibility. I advert to this aspect of what Maxwell Fyfe had to say when talking about ministerial responsibility:</PARA></TALK.START>

Again Maxwell Fyfe says that if a Minister is busy he has an obligation, indeed a duty, to lay down instructions and rules whereby he can be informed as to all matters which are of concern to the nation. Where do we see the Treasurer laying down any set of instructions or rules which were brought to his notice to deal with the massive tax avoidance that has been going on for years? The Prime Minister made no reference to it at all. Is ignorance the excuse of this Government? It is no excuse in law. Let me advert to what the Prime Minister himself said in 1978. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Without integrity-without the appearance and reality of integrity-no Government can hope to have the confidence of the people. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This Government does not have the confidence of the people. Let us make that very clear. We have heard a litany of explanations as though we are going to appoint a clerk to collate all the missing files. Of what relevance is it to talk about getting a further investigation or new laws? Is it not relevant to remind the people of Australia that billions of dollars have been lost, have been appropriated by crooks over a period of years when this Government has been in office and the Ministers responsible can only plead ignorance. Ignorance is no excuse. I make the point again by referring again to what the Prime Minister said in 1972. He said that Ministers 'ought to be aware of all major matters and , therefore can be clearly and directly responsible for them'. </PARA>
<PARA> What other evidence do we have to give to this Parliament and to the nation to prove that these Ministers should not be in office, that this Government is incompetent? It is not just a minor matter. The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) was sacked from his ministerial responsibility because of some indiscretion on his part. The Treasurer is not here today but he might have guessed that he should have been on duty today because this matter certainly will not go away. The people of Australia want to know why there had to be a report by some inspectors who were appointed by the Victorian Parliament and also a report into a trade union before we could ascertain, in an indirect, incidental way, that there has been massive fraud and corruption in this nation. Why is it that we had to rely on those incidental reports to find out this information? Surely it was obvious; it has been obvious all the time. What about the actions of these Ministers? I notice that the Right Honourable Reg Withers, commenting on these matters, said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think all that it shows is an absolute incompetence in the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that in Australian terms if one finds the Crown Solicitor's Office running an escort service surely one must be alerted to the fact that there is serious incompetence in the Attorney-General's Department. That is Withers's approach to the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard an explanation that everything was well because the Federal Executive of the Liberal Party said that it would certainly press ahead with the question of criminal prosecution. This was the defence. The Sydney Daily Telegraph of 3 September stated that the Western Australian Liberal Party President, Mr Ian Warner, said there should be no new tax liability-in other words, no retrospective tax. So where are we going when we rely on the fact that the Federal Executive of the Liberal Party is deemed to be pursuing this matter with the utmost vigour? In fact the Prime Minister slid around the issue-Liberals might be unanimous on criminal responsibility but they certainly do not want any new tax. We are well aware of the attitude of back benchers and others in the Government-particularly from Tasmania-who have said that they will not vote for retrospective legislation. The decision was not unanimous at that time. If we look at all the evidence, why is it that these Ministers were not aware of what was happening? Let us look at another aspect-the Joint Management Review of the Crown Solicitor's Division which was referred to by the Prime Minister. The review was commenced about three years ago and the report was handed to the Attorney-General in July 1980-over two years ago. What were the results of those recommendations? Amongst a number of other things, the report stated that ineffective officers are left in supervisory positions. This was known to the Attorney-General over two years ago. The Joint Management Review under the heading of 'Taxation Appeals' at page 236 of this report-which, of course, has not been tabled in Parliament-stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax avoidance schemes have proliferated . . . Central office has been unable to make any great contribution to these cases . . . the officers conducting these cases are relatively inexperienced in taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA>It was recommended that the central office should develop tax expertise. That report was given to the Attorney-General over two years ago. What have we got to get by way of evidence to convict the Attorney-General and the Treasurer for their failure to understand ministerial responsibility? Can we just gloss over the issue, that incompetence does not matter providing one is not aware of it? Where do we face up to the responsibility as outlined by what was said by Maxwell Fyfe, that Ministers should be laying down instructions and should know the particular positions?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me go to the facts of the matter as far as they concern the Australian people. If the evasion of tax is as big as it is and can be shown to be, every pay-as-you-earn taxpayer in this nation has been subsidising these crooks to the extent of about $2,000 a head. Can honourable members imagine that? They are not able to be identified by the Department of the Treasury or by the Treasurer? I make this point. When we then get these Ministers in the recess talking about the situation what do we find? We find the Attorney-General saying on a radio program on 3 September: 'Look, I know there have been a number of opinions. I understand that the Queen's Counsel are saying that the existing law can be utilised'. I emphasise that to the Prime Minister: The Queen's Counsel's opinion says that existing laws can be utilised. The Attorney-General says: 'I am not challenging that view'. That is rather remarkable because he challenged it when he made a statement to the House, through the Minister who represents him in this chamber, only the previous week. He is not challenging the view. Of course he cannot because over 20 opinions have been given that the law should be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> It is counter-productive from the point of view of giving effective leadership to this nation for the Prime Minister to walk in here today and say: 'Well, we are relying on some new laws'. Let me make this very clear. Mr Costigan said that the real failure of this Government was its failure to apply the existing law. That is the position. The real failure of this Government was that crooks have got away with billions of dollars. The Prime Minister was anxious to talk about what happened under the Labor Government in 1973. At least the Australian Labor Party recommended a prosecution. When the Labor Party was sacked from office in 1975 that prosecution was pending. It was made on the legal advice of Mr Brinsden, Q.C. What happened to it? The honourable gentleman might want the words thrown back in his teeth. In 1979, four years after we were sacked, it was decided that there was no evidence to warrant the prosecution. Mr Costigan has identified that in the report as a lie, a falsehood. Mr Gleedman, the man responsible, certainly had no right to put that forward as an excuse. When Mr Costigan questioned Mr Gleedman about that matter he said that he had no knowledge about how he could possibly give that advice in law. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at this from the point of view of the Treasurer. In the second last Costigan report, of December last year, Mr Costigan talked about a case involving the examination of certain people in Victoria. He gave notice of the proposed examination to the Commissioner of Taxation and also to the Treasurer. He was hoping that the Commissioner of Taxation would be present in court when the examination took place. I make the point that Mr Costigan told the Treasurer about the matter. Mr Costigan made the point that when the examination took place in the court no representative of the Taxation Office was there. He made a further point that because of that examination some $200,000 in cash was removed, so obviously the Taxation Office could not get at it. He adverts later on to the fact that he discussed this matter with the Taxation Office and it said it was concerned about its officers' physical safety. That we can understand. But what about the fact that Mr Costigan, in an earlier report in 1981, alerted the Treasurer? He asked why through his Department, he did not come along and listen to some of the evidence as to what was wrong and where the crimes were. Mr Costigan says in this earlier report last year:</PARA>
<PARA> I have had discussions with the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation for New South Wales in Sydney and with the Commissioner of Taxation and two First Assistant Commissioners of Taxation in Canberra. I was informed by the Commissioner in Canberra that his office had been aware for a considerable time that promoters of the schemes of the kind I have outlined have been using criminals in the way suggested. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commissioner has been aware for a considerable time that criminals have been used. The Treasurer knows nothing about it. The Attorney-General knows nothing about it. The unfortunate taxpayers of this nation are having to foot the bill. We get a mealy-mouthed explanation here today that something will be all right because the Government is fixing up a few procedures or extending the commission . </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get this very clear. Anybody running a business like this would be made bankrupt or sent to gaol. That is the position. But we have Ministers here saying: 'Well it will be all right'. 'I really can't afford,' says the Prime Minister, 'to sack any more of my Ministers because I would be about the only one left'. We should look at the way this matter developed. It did not come out in the open through the Prime Minister. There was no mention of the Costigan report in the first week of this parliamentary sitting. It was not until the Prime Minister was asked a question in Question Time on the Thursday of the first week as to what happened to the Costigan report, which he had had since 27 July, that he volunteered to table it the next week. Why has he worried about it ? Why did he not at least table it? It was a matter of the utmost importance to this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had some suggestion here that the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia is to blame. What utter nonsense. Most of the people referred to in the report are used car salesmen and many of them are in the Liberal Party . Let me make it very clear: We can identify in Perth particularly the presidents of the Liberal Party taking an active interest in running the party while being the recipients of benefits of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. We named them. Mr Horgan is the current chairman of the Liberal Party finance committee. Mr Corser was his predecessor. Both of them were clearly identified in the McCabe-Lafranchi report as getting millions of dollars. They are still in one way running the Liberal Party. But we get some oblique reference to the painters and dockers. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the Government not face up to the fact that this motion says that the Government is an incompetent government. It deserves to be censured by this Parliament. It certainly will be censured by the electorate whenever it goes before it. What are the facts on which the electorate will be judging the Government? The Treasurer's statement in June last was again in error. I have referred to page 24 of his statement when he said that in about 1979-80 about 9, 000 companies were involved in tax avoidance. Does he know that the statistics of his own Department-he should have know this when he made his statement in June this year-clearly show that the number of individuals and companies in 1979 engaged in tax avoidance was 11,253, over 2,000 more than his statement says? Does he know that this has escalated now, according to the Taxation Commissioner 's report, to 22,366? What other direct evidence does the Government want to establish the fact that there has been a massive escalation in tax avoidance and that it is still going on? I make this point: The number of companies and individuals engaged in tax avoidance has doubled since 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the number of companies incorporated in Victoria as against the number of companies lodging returns, what better evidence could one find of tax evasion and avoidance than this? In 1979 there were 116,000 companies and only 52,000 lodged taxation returns in Victoria. There were 64,000 which did not account for anything. In 1978 there were 109,000 companies in Victoria and only 53,000 lodged taxation returns. In 1978, 56,000 companies in Victoria did not lodge any returns. When one looks at it from the point of view of the total figures one will see that there has been a massive reduction in the number of taxable companies compared with a massive increase in the number of non-taxable companies. As honourable members know from other statistics, the PAYE taxpayer is now being obliged to pay another 6 per cent or 7 per cent of total taxation. If one looks at New South Wales one will see that in 1979 122,000 companies were incorporated and only 100,000 lodged taxation returns. In other words, another 22,000 returns were missing. When one looks at the facts one sees that there was a proliferation of incorporated companies which were not lodging any taxation returns. Would that not give one notice that something was wrong? Figures will be produced in New South Wales which will clearly show that if Perth thought it was in any way leading in the tax avoidance field New South Wales will go right past it. It will leave Perth standing because of the massive tax avoidance that has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer lives in Sydney. He is a lawyer. He is able to discuss these matters with his counterparts in that profession or in the accountancy field. Was he going around blinkered and unable to see what was happening? How to avoid tax was on everybody's lips in Sydney. So, do not give us any more of this nonsense that the Government has nothing to worry about now because, according to the Durack formula, if one does not have any personal failing one need not worry about the matter. We want to make the point to the nation that the Cabinet has failed miserably. It is afraid of finding out how much money is owing. It is really afraid of that. It is afraid because it is going to affect its own party supporters. It affects our nation as well. There is another report which, with the McCabe-Lafranchi examination and the Costigan examination, clearly shows that the rottenness and corruption in this country has seeped into the highest level. It has gone into every aspect of government. Criminals are really active. This lot are not painters and dockers either. </PARA>
<PARA> The Asian Wall Street Journal talks about Nugan Hand and about the massive amount of money that has gone. It talks about the possibility of money being laundered through the Reserve Bank of Australia. Would the Reserve Bank not have known of the amount of money that might have been laundered through Australia when it ran into billions of dollars? Would it not have known if it was related to arms dealing? On what basis can one say that simply because some former members of an intelligence agency were involved there is no need to ask questions? The Asian Wall Street Journal named the people concerned and they said it was just a normal bank. Nugan-Hand is well known now to have been associated with crime. We now find from Victoria that merchant banks such as Ward, Knight and Dunn have been associated with this area. They have been associated with phoney companies being formed. If honourable members want further explanation of the matter they will find the directors of those people come right back to Maher in Queensland and are also associated with John Wynyard and others in Sydney. In other words, there is a massive interlocking of crime not only domestically but also internationally. This is on record. This Government did not know anything about it and could not understand what was happening. There have been murders in this country. Commissioners have been trying to find out how it happened. If honourable members look through the reports they will see the rottenness and corruption that has occurred. What we want to see is not just more inquiries; we want to see prosecutions. That is the only way to bring the people involved to book. The sooner it is done, the better . If this Government is to survive on the question of integrity and honesty, what better example can it set than to sack the Ministers responsible? That is the only thing to do. This is what the censure motion is about. No Opposition worthy of its name is going to take any notice of these Ministers or a government which is so rife with corruption and so oblivious to crime that we even get objections to the fact that we raised the matter. There could not be a more serious matter. Let us get serious about it. People have died. People have lost their fortunes because of these crooks. Now we find the taxpayer having to make up the deficit because of what has happened. The excuse of the Prime Minister was abysmal. He made no reference in this debate to what had happened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Opposition has, in fact, said nothing of substance today which it did not say in this House on 25 August. If the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was here, he would be entitled to seek the incorporation in Hansard of the speech he gave on that occasion. There was nothing new for him to answer which was not put on that occasion. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) have used, perhaps abused, the forms of this House by a series of collective smears and innuendoes about people allegedly based on material in those volumes of the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union which the Royal Commissioner has said he wishes to remain confidential for the time being so that prosecutions may be launched. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition concluded his remarks by referring to the need for the prosecutions. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said that the Government is determined that that should be so. We are determined to allow the people who are identified in those confidential volumes of the report to have an opportunity of a fair trial and the investigators to have an opportunity to gather the evidence to launch the prosecutions, and to do so quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the allegations about the Ministers concerned, let me refer to the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act because the Leader of the Opposition himself did so several times without quoting them. I want to quote the relevant section. Section 16 (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to this section, an officer shall not either directly or indirectly, except in the performance of any duty as an officer, and either while he is, or after he ceases to be an officer, make a record of, or divulge or communicate to any person such information so acquired by him. </PARA>
<PARA>Sub-section (5A) of the same section states:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of sub-sections (2) and (5), an officer or person shall be deemed to have communicated such information to another person in contravention of those sub-sections if he communicates that information to any Minister or any Minister of the Crown of a State. </PARA>
<PARA>The secrecy provisions of the Act are very relevant to the performance of the Ministers concerned. The Royal Commissioner reflected this in paragraphs 3.10 and 3.11 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph 3.10 states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary, before I proceed further, to draw the attention of those who may read this Report to the circumstance that the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act apply with equal force to the Ministers who have charge of the enforcement of the law in this area. I refer in particular to persons holding the office of Treasurer, and of Attorney-General. The events to which I am referring took place over a period of 10 years. It will be recalled that during that time there had been a number of incumbents of both those high offices of the State. All of them have been denied access to the detailed information which has now been provided to me, and which has identified the situation described in this Report. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 3.11 states:</PARA>
<PARA> I will have more to say about the desirability of a secrecy provision that has this effect at a later stage in my Report. It is sufficient to say, at this stage, that the secrecy provision has been an effective bar to proper ministerial supervision of the discharge of duty by both the Australian Taxation Office and the Crown Solicitor's Office. </PARA>
<PARA>It is against that background that this motion is launched. The fact is, as I said, that nothing has been added by the Opposition today which was not said on 25 August. Indeed, one of the attachments to the statement of the Treasurer of 27 June, which was incorporated today in Hansard sets out an impressive and unrivalled record of achievement by this Government and this Treasurer in particular in respect of the elimination of tax avoidance and tax evasion. Any fair debate-too much to expect in this Parliament from the Opposition-would certainly identify that to be so. It would take account of all of the tax avoidance schemes which have been identified in recent years and the action which has been taken in respect of them. The Prime Minister when he was speaking sought to table a short chronology of a very detailed and lengthy series of those measures. It cannot be overlooked that the so-called bottom-of-the-harbour schemes were up and running as schemes at the same time as a series of other schemes were. Many of those were probably more damaging from a revenue point of view than those of which the Opposition is now complaining. In any event it ought not to be thought that that tax revenue is irrevocably lost. The Treasurer will no doubt say something on that matter when he introduces his Bill next week . </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should remember the Curran scheme about which much was said. It was this Government which acted in respect of the Curran scheme. One might ask, and it has been asked by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister before: What action was taken by Treasurers Crean, Cairns and Hayden in respect of that serious loss of revenue to the Commonwealth? The picture has to be taken as a whole. When that is done it would be generally agreed by any fair minded person that no one, in respect of legislative action in the area of taxation reform, has done more than the present Treasurer has to try to crack down upon, and he has been successful in his diligence in cracking down upon, the-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me refer the honourable member to another matter in the Royal Commission report. I refer to paragraph 3.120 on page 89 of the report. The Royal Commissioner lists the record of the number of companies which were identified as taking advantage of one of the schemes against which this Government legislated in 1980. As honourable members will see, the figure was at its height in 1980 when there were 1,412 companies throughout Australia benefiting from that method of tax avoidance. In 1981 there were 121 companies. I have a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation addressed to the parliamentary secretary of the Treasurer. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to your discussions early today-</PARA>
<PARA>That is of 26 August-</PARA>
<PARA>with Mr McDermott concerning the statistical information relating to pre-tax profit stripping operations set out in paragraph 3.120 of Volume 1 of Interim Report No. 4 of the Costigan Commission. This information was provided to the Royal Commission by the Australian Taxation Office and relates to companies that had been identified as at 30 June 1982. As pointed out in paragraph 3.125 of the Report there have been a further 1,678 stripped company cases which had not at that time been identified as to the year or type of strip. </PARA>
<PARA> I confirm that the table relates to pre-tax profit stripping cases identified as having been stripped of assets in the financial years ended 30 June 1973 to 1981. With the exception of some 5 cases, the companies identified as having been stripped during the year ended 30 June 1981 relate to the period between 1 July 1980 and 3 December 1980, i.e., they pre-date the Crimes (Taxation Offences ) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Altogether we have now identified 7 cases in which companies appear to have been stripped of assets after the enactment of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. No prosecution proceedings have been instituted as yet. Assessments have only recently been raised following an investigation of the facts of each case. We have judged it to be appropriate to await the expiry of the due date for payment before referring the cases to the appropriate law enforcement authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>A postscript to the letter adds:</PARA>
<PARA> We have prepared a brief for the police which will go forward immediately the due date expires if payment is not made by then. </PARA>
<PARA> That illustrates the great success of the legislation of 1980-the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act. It has virtually eliminated that form of tax avoidance and evasion which was a very great cost to the Australian revenue. In the course of preparing that legislation the Treasurer, recognising that it was a criminal offence and that this was a major and radical piece of taxation law reform, took great pains to seek advice from his Taxation Advisory Committee-from specialist persons who were not themselves involved in tax avoidance and evasion programs. As well there were matters concerning the onus of proof and the gravity of the legislation. It was a new and quite radical set of reforms affecting individual rights and the practices of the law under which people arranged their affairs. The legislation needed to be prepared with care and was prepared with care. Indeed, when it came to this Parliament, despite all that care, there were still amendments that had to be made. Undue haste would have been ground for condemnation of the Treasurer, but not the ground of great care. The legislation has been highly successful. It has eliminated the practice. The Treasurer should be commended, not condemned, for his approach to the question of taxation law reform. I repeat that no one individual and no one government have done more in that area than the present Treasurer and the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom-of-the-harbour schemes referred to in this debate are only one aspect of a very large problem. After receiving the report of Messrs McCabe and Lafranchi, the Treasurer in a statement of 27 June, which appears in Hansard, described in some detail the actions which he, the Government and the Australian Taxation Office had taken on that matter. Despite the efforts that are now being made by the Opposition to misrepresent the contents of that document, it remains a good explanation. Each of the actions when considered in their own context would be seen-by any fair-minded person-to add up to a remarkable degree of diligence and effective action by the Treasurer and certainly do not represent any dereliction of duty as is alleged. </PARA>
<PARA> Much is being made of the fact that the Treasurer accepted advice which came from internal advisers on legal matters. It is said that he was wrong or unwise to do that and that he disregarded some external advice. I make it perfectly clear that the Treasurer was not entitled to know that the Commissioner of Taxation had sought external legal advice. He was not told. He need not have been told that that advice had been sought. If the Commissioner had chosen to tell him in general terms he could have but he would have had to do so being well aware of section 16 of the Act, to which I have referred. The responsibility for the administration of the income tax law rests with the Commissioner. The Commissioner himself is responsible for the administrative arrangements. Therefore even with hindsight the assertion that the Treasurer ignored external advice has not been substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been made of the fact that the Treasurer did not know that certain external opinions had been obtained by the Crown law authorities at the behest of the Commissioner of Taxation. Again, he could not have known and should not have known that that was so. Whether those external opinions prove to be sound opinions remains to be seen. Certainly the Treasurer did not know about them. He need not and should not have known of their specific terms. In all the circumstances and even with the benefit of hindsight, but in particular taking account of the context in which the opinions were given, it is not surprising that they were never placed in the Treasurer's hands, especially having regard to those secrecy provisions. When the Commissioner put to the Treasurer in May 1978 that the time had come when specific criminal offences ought to be assigned to bottom-of-the-harbour operations the Commissioner of Taxation perceived then no reason why he should detail an external opinion when in the Commissioner's experiences and in accordance with the established administrative arrangements it was the view of the Government lawyers which would have to prevail. In fact, it was the assessment of the Taxation Commissioner that the Government lawyers would be almost certainly averse to any sort of proceedings under the current law. Hence it was thought that the law had to be changed with reference to the legislation I have cited. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated by the letter from the Commissioner. Certainly, it was not absolutely confirmed until some months later that the ultimate decision of the Crown law officers was as the Comissioner expected it to be. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been complaints that other external legal opinions did not support the advice given to the Commissioner by Crown law officers and that the existence of these was, because of some alleged ulterior motive, concealed. It should not be overlooked that at least two of these external opinions were given on the particular facts of cases which did not possess any familiar characteristics of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Those characteristics have been described in this House. Of course, they refer to the sale, for an unrealistically high price, of the shares of a company with an impending tax liability to a promoter of the scheme, the ultimate transfer of the control of that company to sham directors along with the adoption of false addresses and in some cases the consignment of relevant records to the bottom-of-the-harbour or some other place of oblivion. These two cases in question where external advice was obtained, had none of these characteristics. They did, however, bring into question one arguably common feature: The possible negligence of directors in carrying out an operation. It seems that it is on this basis that they have become bracketed with bottom-of-the-harbour cases. The fact remains that they were obtained in the ordinary course of tax administration by the Commissioner in accordance with his responsibilities; they were in relation to different kinds of cases altogether and there is no reason why the Treasurer need have had knowledge of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention that in passing because it has been suggested that one of the opinions was acted upon, and indeed it was. It was acted upon very effectively and resulted in company tax being paid in accordance with the law. The point I am making is that counsel in each of these cases was dealing with a particular factual situation and it cannot possibly be asserted with certainty that they would have reached the same view if the facts had instead been those views typical of bottom-of-the-harbour cases. The Treasurer has said in a number of places that a conspicuously successful piece of legislation, the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act, which I referred to earlier, dealt a mortal blow to this activity. However, it took rather a long time to germinate because of its radical nature and the care which had to be taken in effecting the rights of people who had acted under the law as it was. The Treasurer gave a perfectly satisfactory explanation of that in his statement on 27 June. The Royal Commission itself acknowledges that the Treasurer's statement, which is, as I said, now in Hansard, assisted it. Far from being incompatible with the findings of the Royal Commission, it assisted it to come to the findings to which the Treasurer referred. </PARA>
<PARA> When it is taken into account that the Royal Commission had access to the records of the Australian Taxation Office, the statement by the Treasurer in relation to the performance of the Australian Taxation Office is vindicated by the Royal Commission in its report. When it is also taken into account that the Royal Commission in its recent report made no finding against either the Treasurer or the Australian Taxation Office in relation to their respective performances in the main matter of inquiry, it can be deduced only that the Royal Commission found the Treasurer's statement to be factually acceptable and to tally with what was ascertainable from the official records to which it had access but the Treasurer did not. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, there is no basis whatever for a censure against the Treasurer on this or any other matter involving tax avoidance. In fact, he ought to be receiving the praise of the Parliament for the tremendous amount of work he has done in this area in the period from late 1977 when he first became Treasurer. He has a very distinguished record. If honourable members opposite were really concerned with tax avoidance and evasion they would have made sure that their three Treasurers took action in this area because the schemes of which they are complaining were then apparent. </PARA>

Worse than that, the Leader of the Opposition has shown that he is incapable of dealing with confidential material in respect of which, in the interests of those who are to be prosecuted, secrecy must be maintained for a greater period. Action will be taken, and collective smears and innuendoes by the Opposition are no substitute for substantive debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter needs to be seen in clear perspective. One Minister mentioned Mr Khemlani. The reprehensible circumstances which led to a decision by the coalition parties to refuse the passage of the Budget in 1975 and thus to the dismissal of an elected government were the attempt to borrow $4 billion. This Government has seen the revenue defrauded by more than $4 billion. It wants to sit it out and attack the Opposition for daring to raise the matter. What has been unveiled is the most monstrous tax scandal in the history of Federation. It is the most monstrous scandal ever to touch the Parliament. We have had scandals in the past. Nothing reaches this in magnitude or importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government talks about a fair debate, and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) attacked us for requiring the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to come home. Mr Connor was in bed with pneumonia when he was interviewed over an attack by the then Opposition rabble about loan raisings. There was never any suggestion of impropriety on his part, not a bit, but he resigned his position because he gave conflicting advice to the Parliament. He was a man of honour. What honour is there here? These people will sit it out. Look at the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). A prostitution service is being run from the Western Australian office. As well as that, the recommendations for prosecution have not been taken up. Yet the Attorney-General is still in the job. He is still sitting there. The Treasurer is away. Imagine what the coalition would do if a Labor Government were in power and the Treasurer was at an International Monetary Fund gabfest. It would be dragging him back to Australia and demanding his resignation. We demand the Treasurer's resignation. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee), who has just finished speaking, said that we are saying today the same thing we said the other day and that there is no substance to it. It is the view of the Opposition that the Treasurer should resign his ministry. We believe that he knew about these tax matters and that he misled the Parliament. I will indicate where I believe he has misled the Parliament. He put out a statement in June in response to the McCabe-Lafranchi report which, by the way, he called a political stunt. Let that be put on the record. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was not until 1979 or 1980 that the full extent of the schemes really became apparent to the Australian Taxation Office and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us get that clear. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was not until 1979 or 1980 that the full extent of the schemes really became apparent to the Australian Taxation Office and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I say that is a lie. Let me give the House another quote. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office and the Government developed detailed knowledge of the extent of the arrangements in the last couple of years of the 1970's. </PARA>
<PARA>I say that is another lie. I sustain that claim by saying that there was an investigation by an officer, Mr Todman, of 50 companies in 1973. In September 1974 he sought a legal opinion from the Deputy Crown Solicitor, stressing the urgency of the matter. Mr Todman was an Australian Taxation Office investigator. He had already examined 50 companies in relation to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes in 1973, six years before the Treasurer said he even knew of the matter. Mr Brinsden, Q.C., gave his opinions in 1974 and 1975. At paragraph 335 of Mr Costigan's report he said that the Taxation Office had warned that the case raised 'far-reaching implications for the collection of company tax generally'. The case referred to was the first bottom-of-the-harbour case. That occurred in 1973. At page 26 of the McCabe-Lafranchi report Mr McCabe said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was apparent that in the investigation sections, in particular those in Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, officers were aware throughout the relevant time period-</PARA>
<PARA>That is from 1973 onwards-</PARA>
<PARA>that companies were being dumped. </PARA>
<PARA>A prosecution was launched in August 1975 which Mr Gleedman, an officer in the Crown Solicitor's Office, sat on. It is clear that what the Treasurer said in his statement in response to McCabe and Lafranchi does not accord with the facts . In fact he has misled the public. It is clear that he is attempting to mislead the public by saying that the Australian Taxation Office did not know about the matters. It carried out the investigation years earlier. Mr Gleedman was sitting on the matter. What was wrong with the Commissioner of Taxation putting up this matter to the Treasurer? On 25 August-the last sitting week-when talking about the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> He is saying that we knew all the time what was going on, yet one of the major findings in the Costigan report is that the Income Tax Assessment Act is so structured that we cannot find out what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA>He relied again on section 16 of the Act. He said that the Government did not know what was going on. It is true that under section 16 information about individual taxpayers cannot be given to the Treasurer, but it is to some extent immaterial whether Joe Bloggs or Billy Bunter is involved in the case. What matters is the nature of the case, the cost to revenue, the type of scheme and how a defence can be made to it. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that information was given to the Treasurer. He said as early as 1978 that he knew about it. He became Treasurer at the end of 1977. In early 1978 at the latest he must have known of these schemes and their import even if he did not know the names of the individuals involved. It is a sham argument to suggest to the Parliament that he needed to know the names of individual companies and taxpayers to be able to take action against the nature of the scheme, bearing in mind that he would have been apprised of the nature of the scheme and a likely defence against it. But he said that he did not know. The McCabe-Lafranchi report says that the contrary is so. He said that the report was:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . used to create the false impression that this was new information, on new schemes, with dramatic new revenue losses. This was clearly not the case. Neither details of the schemes nor the revenue losses involved came as a surprise to us. </PARA>
<PARA>Either he knew or he did not know. He cannot say here that he did not know and a month before that he did know and that McCabe-Lafranchi was a stunt, because the whole tone of the Treasurer's statement in respect of McCabe-Lafranchi was that McCabe-Lafranchi was a political stunt and that there was no new information about the cost to revenue of the operation of the schemes. Yet he told us the contrary in the Parliament two weeks ago when he said: 'We knew what was going on, yet one of the major findings of the Costigan report was that the Income Tax Assessment Act is structured so that we cannot find out'. In other words, he denied knowing. Two or three months earlier he said he knew the lot and that there was no new information in this stunt report. This is the man we are supposed to hold up as a paragon of fiscal virtue who is out there catching the tax cheats. I do not suggest for a moment that the Treasurer is corrupt in any personal sense, but he has been corrupted by the ambience of Liberal Party attitudes. His ministerial responsibilities have been corrupted by attitudes prevailing in the Liberal Party-that John Howard had a good future in the Liberal Party as a prospective leader and to go soft on tax avoidance. The Government turned its back away from it in the way that the Taxation Office has. The Taxation Office got the signal that the Government did not want to go on with it so it did not. It knew from 1973. What must someone like Todman think after he went through 50 companies and put together a report of such quality? Then there is the high quality of the police report of 1976. Costigan applauded the quality of the work put together by those police officers in 1976. We have Todman in 1973; the Brinsden decision in 1974; the police report of 1976; and then the Treasurer says that it was not until 1979 or 1980 that the full extent of the schemes really became apparent. What a bloody lie that is! What a lie that is! What a disgraceful, despicable parliamentary lie that is!</PARA>

We all know that. He was hunted to his grave, and for what? He was trying to borrow $4 billion. For what? To put in a few more coal harbours and ports and railways lines, for which we have seen a great and pressing urgency in the years since. Yet the Government has seen the revenue defrauded by $4 billion and says that this is a stunt by us and that we are a bunch of whingers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government is corrupt. If it is not corrupt in a personal sense, if the Ministry is not corrupt, then the attitudes are corrupt. They go right through the Liberal Party. It is a disgrace that we have to stand here and call for Durack's resignation. The Prime Minister should have insisted on it. He insisted on it with Moore and with others. Yet the Treasurer is abroad trying to do this number. Wait until I get on to this little part in the statement of the Treasurer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to recall the nature of the environment at the time the practices were entered into, especially the prevailing public attitudes and the priorities of the Government, the Australian Taxation Office and others at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same statement he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Strong public attitudes towards tax avoidance were not yet evident at that time . . . Without wanting to downplay the significance of the schemes, it was clearly important to recognise the considerably different state of public opinion towards avoidance at that time. </PARA>
<PARA>As if the barometer of public opinion should be in any way relevant to the obligations that the Treasurer took upon himself when he took the oath of Executive office to uphold his responsibilities and to administer the Department of the Treasury and the Taxation Office! That is his responsibility-not to be some bell-wether about what the public thinks of tax avoidance but to stamp it out. That is his responsibility. What did he do with his responsibilty? He reminded us that members of the public were soft on it. Of course, they were soft on it. They did not realise that it was anything so audacious or outrageous , that approaching 10 per cent of budgetary revenue was being defrauded. Why would they not be soft on it? Yet we read those three disgraceful and disgusting quotations in a chapter in that statement which is the perspective and the environment of these things. Who wants to know about the environment? What he is saying is: 'I should be excused for not taking this matter on'. The environment was created by the corruption within the ranks of the Liberal Party machine. It was created by the shonky business people around the Liberal Party structure, and they have permeated now right to the very core of the Fraser Ministry. That is what we are facing here. </PARA>
<PARA> We are facing the most outrageous scandal in Australian federal history. We are not going to let up. We are going to hound this Treasurer out of office and we are going to hound the Attorney-General out of office, because they are unfit to hold office. The Prime Minister has protected and presided over them while making fish of one Minister and flesh of another. He has dismissed Ministers. He has protected National Country Party Ministers. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) saw the Australian meat trade with the United States of America at risk when the dogs were barking the fact that crook meat was leaving Australia. The Prime Minister let him stay in his job. He cannot afford to lose the Treasurer because he is the linchpin of his economic policy and the one person who has been defending the Government's indefensible policies. If he loses him, the Government is gone. Now the Government is gone. The public are not going to take this sort of fraud. They are not going to accept that the Government can do these things and get away with them. We on this side of the House are not going to sit back and see this happen with the Treasurer getting away with glib statements by relying on the facts that we will not compare one month's statement with the next. </PARA>
<PARA> I just go over the ground: If the Treasurer did not know, he should have known. My contention is that he knew about it all the time. It is clear from the early investigations in 1973 and 1974 that the Taxation Office knew of the bottom-of- the-harbour schemes.That is clear from the police report in 1976. It is clear from the opinions. Let us consider the opinions that we have seen: The Brinsden opinion of 1974-75; the opinion from the unamed Sydney barrister in early 1976; the police report of 1976; the Ormiston and Spry opinion to the Commissioner of Taxation in 1978; and the Traill opinion of 1978-a litany of opinions and investigations over five years. Yet he has the hide to tell this outrageous, audacious lie--</PARA>

He is responsible for that office. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) today have quoted the Prime Minister extensively on ministerial responsibility. There is no case whatsoever for the Attorney-General remaining in office. Members of the Liberal Party have said so.

That is precisely the difficulty that looms in this extremely grave matter. I have not denied the gravity of this matter and I do not know of any person on this side who has denied it. But the fact remains that it is not up to the Leader of the Opposition to say: 'The people named here are all corrupt. They should all go to gaol'. A person will go to gaol when a jury convicts him or her. I hope that this country will not allow itself to be stampeded into the position of ignoring the service that a jury does for the individual in this country. A jury stands between the caprice of the political practitioner and the liberty of the subject. This afternoon the Leader of the Opposition said: 'Let them go to gaol' . In my discipline of years gone by, if I were briefed to appear for these people I would appear. If at any time in the future I am required by my discipline to appear I will appear. This is first thing that I would always say to a jury: 'No matter what you may hear or have heard outside, you should assess the matter on the evidence presented before the court, not on the basis of prejudice or bias, not because you do not like the man's politics or because you admire his politics'. This is precisely the great weakness in the Opposition's case. If the Opposition had said: 'We believe that every assistance should be provided to ensure that evidence is gathered for prosecutions', that would have been not merely a mature response but also a very responsible response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said that a task force will be established. We have said that additional powers will be granted in order to ensure that the evidence is mustered and presented against those who have been named. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Charges have been made against the Treasurer that he was aware of the schemes in operation. I inform the House that section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act stands there not merely against the Treasurer but also completely against the Treasurer. It stands there as a fetter over the Commissioner of Taxation and over every Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. It is there as a fetter over every officer of the Australian Taxation Office. If the Commissioner of Taxation had secured legal opinions regarding tax evasion or fiddle-call it what you will-the Commissioner of Taxation was not under the slightest obligation to show those opinions to the Treasurer. Again Mr Costigan turns to the limitations placed on him by section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. He goes on to argue, as a consequence of that, that the limitations placed on those outside are infinitely greater. That is quite clear from his report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the charges made against the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). I want to repudiate them in the most explicit of terms. To the rather vulgar accusations which have been made against the Attorney-General I say this: They have been made with a conspicuous sense of unfairness. I will say why. Three people in the Deputy Crown law offices in Perth, Western Australia, have been charged pursuant to section 55 of the Public Service Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition rests the case against the Attorney-General on the basis that three people have been charged in Western Australia. In 1972-73, under a Labor administration, 1,682 people were charged under section 55 of the Public Service Act and a number of those were dismissed. Is it being said that, as they were charged, the Minister should have resigned? In the following year 1 ,309 people were charged under the Public Service Act. The point that I wish to make about ministerial responsibility is this: It is the clearest obligation on a Minister that he hold himself responsible to Parliament to explain and to defend. If he cannot explain and if he cannot defend to the satisfaction of his party, of his Prime Minister and of the Parliament then he has the obligation-</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Port Adelaide would do better if, instead of interjecting, he went and shore the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West). I administered a large department of state for six and a half years. There were nearly 130,000 people within that department. I submit to the House that it is a nonsense to say that a Minister today or in those days should be held responsible in that sense for every error that was made. The test of responsibility is: Did the Minister know about the mistake? Did he know about the fraud? Did he know about what appears to be the misdemeanour? That is the crucial test. That test has been put and accepted by many fine parliamentarians through the years. I quote from what was said by Douglas Jay, former member of the Labour Party in England, and Labour President of the Board of Trade. He saw the light as far as the Labour Party was concerned like a lot of people in this country. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . if Ministers are going to resign when anyone makes a mistake in a department, there will very soon be no Ministers left. If, on the other hand, everything is referred to Ministers departments will rapidly grind to a stop. </PARA>
<PARA>One could take illustration after illustration of massive bungling in this country. What about the turtle farm scheme on Thursday Island? It does not matter! Let us take also the case of the fuel crisis in the United Kingdom. In 1947 the Minister of the day said that there was no fuel crisis. Within six weeks the nation was plunged into the worst fuel crisis in its history. </PARA>

Mr Costigan cannot convict. No royal commissioner can convict.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The report by the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory dealing with energy use, distribution and conservation in the Australian Capital Territory was tabled on both Houses on 24 September 1981. The former Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Ellicott, referred the matter to the Committee in November 1979. I congratulate the Committee on its report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government recognises the need to pursue actively policies designed to encourage the efficient use and conservation of energy on a national basis. The Government supports the thrust of the Committee's report, which gives special emphasis towards energy conservation and to the better handling of emergency situations where supplies of energy are threatened. I am pleased to advise in this regard that several of the Committee's recommendations have been implemented by the Government. Of the Committee's 11 recommendations only three are not accepted by the Governemnt, while another two need to be considered further. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a summary of the recommendations and the Government's proposals in relation to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 1: The Committee notes that drafting instructions have been prepared to amend the Fuels Control Ordinance as proposed by the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee and recommends that urgent action be undertaken to put these into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Comment: This recommendation has been accepted and the necessary amendments to the Fuels Control Ordinance 1979 implementing the changes requested by the Senate Committee were made on 4 March 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 2: The Committee is concerned about the delay in the formal establishment of the Fuels Use Advisory Committee and recommends that it be established without further delay. The membership of the Committee should comprise four representatives of the oil companies operating in the A.C.T., plus four service station representatives, the Fuels Controller and perhaps a representative from the House of Assembly or the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Comment: It is not considered feasible to establish the Committee as a statutory body. There are considerable legal and practical problems in specifying, in legislation, which areas of the fuel industry should be represented and in maintaining membership given the ever changing nature of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> A Fuels Use Advisory Committee has been operating on an informal basis for some time. The current membership comprises a representative of each of the nine major oil companies operating in the A.C.T. and of the A.C.T. Automotive Services Association. The Controller of Fuels (appointed by the Minister under the Fuels Control Ordinance 1979) acts as Chairman of this voluntary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed to administer any future fuel shortages with the assistance and advice of the Committee. Meetings of the Committee can be initiated by any member to ensure that any problems which may arise can be considered at the earliest possible time. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that in any emergency declared under the Fuels Control Ordinance priority be given to providing fuel for the public transport system and emergency services. Private vehicles should be rationed on an 'odds and evens' system and a maximum limit able to be purchased at any one time should be set. </PARA>
<PARA> Comment: These recommendations are accepted. A two month storage capacity has been developed for Canberra's public transport system to enable its operations to withstand fuel shortages. </PARA>
<PARA> Priority for the maintenance of essential and emergency services is accepted. Detailed arrangements need to be determined having regard to the nature and extent of specific emergencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fuels Control (Amendment) Ordinance 1932 which has recently been made enables the Controller of Fuels to ration fuel sales during a declared emergency on an ''odds'' and ''evens'' basis. The amending Ordinance also allows controls over trading hours during a declared emergency. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal Ordinance provides that the Controller, during a declared emergency, may by an instrument in writing, require that a person not sell, to any person, at one time, a quantity of fuel exceeding the quantity specified in the notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends that the A.C.T.E.A. conduct a survey of the generating equipment within the A.C.T. with a view to establishing whether or not there are adequate emergency facilities within the A.C.T. </PARA>
<PARA> Comment: The A.C.T.E.A. has information about the capacity of generating equipment within the A.C.T. However, the adequacy of these facilities in an emergency situation is largely a matter for the management of individual organisations to determine. The Electricity Supply Amendment Act 1982 which provides for rationing of electricity supplies has now come into operation. This law enables the A.C.T.E.A. to restrict usage to provide for continuity of supplies during emergencies. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends that the Department of the Capital Territory investigate the possibility of providing funds to allow for the further development of electric vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> Comment: The Department's operational role in transportation matters makes it inappropriate for it to engage in, or sponsor, vehicle research projects. The Department of National Development and Energy provides funds for electric vehicle research through the National Energy Research Development and Demonstration Programme. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of Australian firms with an interest in the conversion and marketing of electrical vehicles and it is considered that funding through the Department of the Capital Territory would not be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 6: The Committee recommends that the Minister for the Capital Territory take immediate measures to eliminate the petrol pricing differential between the A.C.T. and N.S.W. </PARA>
<PARA> Comment: The price differential between N.S.W. and the A.C.T. has been the result of the price control system operated by the N.S.W. Government which (i) prior to 7 May 1982, determines a lower maximum wholesale price than that recommended (and operating in the A.C.T.) by the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority (P.P.P.A.) and (ii) also determines maximum retail prices. Since the Committee's report was made the N.S.W. Government reinstated on 7 May 1982 the two cents per litre margin deducted from the P.P.P.A. price for N.S.W. in June 1980. The N.S.W. Government also introduced a 3cpl petrol tax effective from 1 August 1982. It is expected that these actions will reduce the differential between N.S.W. and A.C.T. wholesale prices. In addition, the wholesale price in the A.C.T. is affected by a freight component not reflected in Sydney prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Independent determination of wholesale prices by an A.C.T. prices body would mean duplication of activity undertaken by the P.P.P.A. and, on this basis, cannot be supported. Furthermore price control would be inconsistent with the Government's policies. As a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions the A .C.T. Prices Regulation Ordinance was repealed on 18 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 7: The Committee recommends that the D.C.T. in association with the N.C.D.C. and the major energy suppliers establish an A.C.T. Energy Information Centre to provide information to energy consumers. The centre should become the focal point in the event of a fuel emergency being declared. The work of the centre should be incorporated under the responsibilities of the Controller of Fuels. </PARA>
<PARA> Comment: An integrated energy information centre could have a desirable influence on consumer attitudes and behaviour by providing information and advice on how to conserve energy in homes, commercial buildings, and industry. Proposals to combine the existing sources of customer information into an integrated centre providing a range of information and advisory services are currently being considered. The Government considers it appropriate to encourage private enterprise groups and semigovernment authorities to develop such a centre before considering direct Government sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of the Capital Territory has received several applications for leases for energy conservation demonstration projects. These will receive the fullest support possible consistent with land release and planning policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 8: The Committee recommends that the Government give priority to the feasibility study being undertaken on a possible railway link from Canberra to Gunning and further recommends that the Government expedite the provision of an XPT rail service between Canberra and Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> Comment: The whole question of rail access to Canberra will be covered in the context of general proposals for upgrading transport links to the A.C.T. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 9: To make the public more aware of energy conservation in housing the Committee suggests that the Housing Industry Association and the A.C .T. Chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects consider awarding annual prizes for energy conservation conscious design in housing. The Committee further recommends that the DCT and NCDC jointly prepare and promote a pamphlet on energy efficiency in housing and ways householders can achieve greater energy economies in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Comment: Whilst action on the Committee's suggestion is for both bodies to pursue independently of Government I am advised that the Housing Industry Association is committed to energy conservation for housing and presents awards for energy conscious design in housing. I also understand that the Royal Australian Institute of Architects has proposed to introduce, in 1983 a conservation award to be presented on a biennial basis. A number of authorities (NCDC, CSIRO, ACTEA and the Department of Transport and Construction) presently provide publications which canvass different aspects of energy conservation in buildings. The Department of the Capital Territory is updating its Building Note No. 24 'Energy Conservation in Buildings'. In its updated form it will be of assistance to the public by providing comparative information on the thermal insulation characteristics between the commonly used forms of construction. The Building Note is available without charge from the Building Section, Department of the Capital Territory, and reaches a wide cross-section of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 10: The Committee recommends that the terms of reference for the IDC on conversion of government buildings from oil to natural gas be extended to that of energy conservation in government buildings and that it be made a standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Comment: The Government has established an IDC on Energy Conservation in Commonwealth Buildings as a standing committee to co-ordinate the implementation of the Government's programme of energy conservation in all Commonwealth-owned and occupied buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 11: The Committee is concerned at the lack of attention given to energy conservation and efficiency in school design and recommends that higher priority be given to maximising energy conservation in new designs for school buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> Comment: The A.C.T. Schools Authority advises that energy conservation has been a design criterion for schools constructed since 1976. Energy audits of six schools, conducted by the NCDC, indicated that irrespective of the school's design, by far the largest potential for energy savings related to the operation and management of the school, for example, through the more efficient use of lighting, heating and air conditioning, and school equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> In the second school term of 1982, a 'Saving Energy in School' competition is being conducted for all primary and high schools and secondary colleges in the A .C.T. This competition is being sponsored by the Department of National Development and Energy, the Curriculum Development Section of the A.C.T. Schools Authority and the Science Teachers' Association as part of the National Energy Conservation Programme. ACT schools have also been issued with wall posters which present twelve ideas for saving energy in schools. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs KELLY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Canberra)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory I should like to make a short statement in relation to some of the recommendations outlined a few moments ago by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman). My main concern about the Government's response to the recommendations is that in many of those recommendations it has not been specific enough and taken action where there was an identified need for direct action by the Government. Let me give some examples. There is a recommendation for a fuels use advisory committee which, on the recommendation of the Committee, was to be set up with the appropriate statutory responsibilities and with proper legal procedures. The Government has responded by saying that that is not necessary any more and that there is a tribunal which operates quite well on a voluntary basis. I have had some discussions with people in the industry in the Australian Capital Territory who are concerned about a number of issues relating to the oil industry in the Australian Capital Territory, especially marketing problems, depot trading problems and pricing differentials. These are the sorts of issues which members of the Committee felt could be dealt with by a fuels use advisory committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report also brings up the issue of price control over petrol. The Government dismisses this matter by saying that it is ideologically opposed to imposing price control on petrol, and that that is currently being undertaken by the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority. However, what is happening is that the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority has no effect at all on retail petrol prices in the Australian Capital Territory. That body is under considerable question as a controlling body for the whole of Australia for considering even the wholesale price of petrol. I understand the Australian Automobile Chamber of Commerce recently withdrew from hearings when price rises were granted without sufficient evidence, simply on the request of the oil companies. </PARA>
<PARA> In Canberra we have a situation where the New South Wales Government, because it has imposed certain taxes on prices, has now identified the areas around Canberra as needing to be given special consideration, with the price of petrol in areas surrounding Canberra being kept at the same level as the price of petrol in the Australian Capital Territory. Yet for years we had the reverse of that situation. Petrol was at least 2 cents a litre cheaper in New South Wales than in the Australian Capital Territory, and no consideration at all was given to the disadvantage that that caused consumers, business people and retailers in Canberra. So at least the New South Wales Government has given recognition to the fact that there was a price differential between New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. I think it is appalling that for years we had a situation in Canberra in which consumers were considerably disadvantaged vis-a- vis the price of petrol in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> As usual, the Minister has said: 'Leave the energy information centre to the private sector'. I do not think that is good enough. The Government needs to show leadership. If it believes that such a centre is important it cannot just leave it to the private sector and say: 'Go ahead and set up a centre'. Such a centre needs not only encouragement but also some cash from the Government. The Committee also recommended that the train service between Canberra and Sydney should be upgraded. In the Government's response it dismissed that recommendation in a few lines. It simply said that the whole question of rail access to Canberra will be covered in the context of general proposals for upgrading transport links to the Australian Capital Territory. I do not think that that is good enough. What it means is that the whole issue will be glossed over; it will be forgotten. Upgrading the rail link between Canberra and Sydney would change Canberra overnight. It would open it up for tourists from all over-</PARA>

The positive aspects of the Committee's report with which the Minister has dealt are welcome. However, I do think that the Government has glossed over several issues, has not come up with specifics and, I am afraid, too frequently it has left it to other people to try to do what is basically the Government's job.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TITLE>Proposed Student Loans Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the introduction of a comprehensive student loans scheme will:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Restrict access to education People from poorer backgrounds will be deterred from studying by the prospect of incurring large debts. These people, if they enrol, will be forced to amass loan debts. Richer students do not face this handicap.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Undermine the tertiary education assistance scheme TEAS should cover the basic living costs of students. Currently the scheme only assists 38 per cent of full-time students and the maximum level of TEAS is a mere $49.67. Government statements indicate TEAS will be further downgraded if loans are introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Disadvantage Women Women students would be disadvantaged by a loans scheme as they have a lesser ability to repay loan debts, because on average women earn less and have a higher unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Disadvantage mature-age students Usually mature age students forego income to study and already have large financial commitments. They could not return to study if it meant incurring substantial debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Distort educational choices Mounting loan debts would force students into studying shorter courses or not continuing with post-graduate study.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Result in massive attrition rates Students will attempt to undertake extensive part-time work or overload courses to minimise their loans. Increased failure rates will result forcing students to 'drop-out' rather than continuing study and increase their debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Cause administrative and financial difficulties Overseas experience shows high default rates will occur on student loans. Government money will be channelled away from TEAS to paying off banks. The Government will also bear the administrative burden of pursuing defaulters.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the proposed student loans scheme will have disastrous effects on tertiary education, which we believe benefits the whole community, not just the individual student.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that: The House of Representatives will reject the introduction of a student loans scheme.</PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals No. 21 (1982). </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The proposals introduce changes outlined by my colleague the Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce and Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) in the House on 26 August when he announced the Government's decision on the recommendations made by the Temporary Assistance Authority in his report on certain flat steel products, pipes and tubes of iron or steel. As a result of this decision tariff quotas will apply allowing individual importers to import at their 1981-82 levels at the current rates of duty. Imports above the quota level will be subject to an additional temporary duty of 150 per cent. The proposals also contains changes resulting from the Government's decision on arrangements to apply to articles of knitted or crocheted fabric, elasticised or rubberised, which were covered in the Industries Assistance Commission's report on miscellaneous textile products. When I introduced the Customs tariff proposals containing the changes resulting from that report I stated that the assistance to apply to these goods was receiving further consideration by the Government. The IAC recommended that a rate of 20 per cent apply to these goods but also concluded that there was potential for damaging substitution to local production from imports of garments in this category. The IAC therefore suggested that imported garments be kept under review by the administering department. The Government has carefully considered all the information available and recognising that scope existed for circumvention of the protection accorded--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the Government has now decided that the Defence (Visiting Warships) Bill is not now the great election winner that it was supposed to be when the Bill was first mooted. Therefore the debate on the Bill is to be restricted. The Bill legislates on matters which already exist and which are understood to exist within the powers of the Commonwealth relating to defence. It arises from a little political grandstanding and election preparation by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) during the parliamentary recess-probably the longest in the history of this Parliament-when he sought to exploit the clear concern of the Victorian Government in respect of nuclear activities in that State and a letter which he received from the Premier of that State asking whether the Prime Minister would pass on to the United States of America the Victorian Government's opposition to visits of nuclear warships to that State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it should be made clear that the Prime Minister decided to go public on that and make statements at the time alleging that the Victorian Government's position could jeopardise our international relations and the defence of Australia. That is plain rubbish. Nevertheless it is in line with what the Prime Minister says on many occasions when he is seeking issues which he can utilise for election purposes. The Prime Minister has also decided that the ANZUS alliance is not as important to him as a foreign policy or defence alliance as it is for exploitation for domestic policial purposes even if that creates conflict and division in Australia-this has been part of his policy over his whole period of tenure of office and was prior to his coming to office-about our American alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister would see it as a plus if he could create a situation that would allow us to fight an election on a pro-American or anti-American basis. That is not likely to happen, because the alliance is important to all parties in this parliament. This is despite the attempts at divisiveness and to use foreign policy as a screen for lack of commitment, lack of success and failure of successive administrative and policy initiatives by this Government. As a result this matter falls into much the same category as the debate we had in this Parliament a fortnight ago about North West Cape. The Bill is a device which makes the law clear and quite unambiguous. It does not in any way change the existing law. It brings into law what the defence powers have always made available to Ministers for Defence and to Prime Ministers since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is about something quite different. It is part of the grand strategy which has permeated Australian politics for the last 40 years, the strategy of talking up defence, talking up foreign affairs and seeking to bring about a situation of divisiveness. What price has Australia paid for this type of policy ? The Victorian Government is entitled to have a concern about the safety of its citizens. It is entitled to express its opinion. There is no reason why it should not request the Prime Minister to pass on that information to the United States. Clearly, the Victorian Government cannot, and would not-the Premier acknowledges this in his letter to the Prime Minister-interfere in any way with the defence powers or any matters related to the defence of Australia. It is a Commonwealth function; it always has been. Because this Bill makes that absolutely clear in respect of not only the matter at issue but also a number of other matters, the Opposition does not oppose it. Some powers in this Bill could be misused by a Minister but one hopes that the good sense of Ministers for defence over a long period will be repeated in the future and those powers will not be misused for political purposes in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Another concern is that in the Bill there seems to be a lack of any requirement in peacetime that safety provisions and other provisions which are related to the normal running of a port and the management of the flow of port traffic should be necessarily taken into consideration by a visiting warship. That is a concern which I think should be cleared up. In peacetime a warship coming into a port should be required to meet the normal safety and traffic requirements. No Commonwealth law should be able to override the basic safety requirements of ports. This Bill would probably allow that overriding on a direction from a Minister of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government brought this Bill forward as a political stunt-no more and no less. It did the same thing with the debate on the North West Cape Communications Station about two weeks ago. During the period it has been in office it has regularly tried to build up some form of phony issue in order to cover up its lack of administration. As I said in an earlier debate a few moments ago, its economic management of this country leaves a lot to be desired. If we read the statements of Prime Ministers, Treasurers and other Government spokesmen we will find that every year we have different predictions, different sets of circumstances and statements that the recovery will come from a different line. On one occasion the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) told us that the uranium industry, which is the heart of this Bill, would provide 500, 000 jobs in Australia. It probably provided $500,000 in contributions to a particular political party but it never provided 500,000 jobs. The other day an honourable member produced a letter in this Parliament which had been written on parliamentary stationery by Senator Walsh. It was not said that in the same year every company in Australia was written to on parliamentary paper by a leader of a political party in this House asking for funds. In one instance it was a matter of 27c; in the other it was a matter of $1,000. In one case it was an alleged misuse of a member's facilities; the other was a normal activity accepted by conservative parties in the Parliament. Mr Speaker-</PARA>

The Government over a period has tried to create hysteria about the American alliance, defence and foreign policy. The other night in this House we heard a statement by the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) relating to the defence of this country. This Bill, which has been portrayed by the Government as critical to Australia's defence, allows warships to sail into and out of harbours in peacetime. The law is to be restated merely to meet a political requirement of the government of the day. Where are the big statements that have been made in the past? Why does this Government feel that it cannot stand on its record, that it has to have hysteria, distortion and overstatement?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I will mention a few things that have happended in this Parliament while we have been members. I clearly remember at the time of the Czechoslovakian crisis the then Prime Minister, Mr Gorton, a person who placed Australia's interest above his political interests and was thrown out of the Liberal Party leadership for doing so, going to the Opposition to discuss the devising of a resolution that could be unanimously agreed to by members of this Parliament. All honourable members voted for the resolution. No one opposed it. A resolution was unanimously passed expressing, I think, the opinion of the great majority of Australians. Afghanistan, of course, was quite different. A new Prime Minister had come into office, whose politics were the politics of division and derision, opportunism and the use of our allies and international situations, no matter how tragic. He was a Prime Minister who saw an opportunity to score a political point and use it to the maximum. We have had no consultation about a joint resolution, no discussion about an expression of view by this Parliament which expresses the views of all Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been no expression by the Prime Minister of the need for a unified Parliament on what he described as the most serious threat to this nation since the Second World War. One sentance was asked to be taken out of the resolution and the Opposition said it would support it. The sentence had nothing to do with the substance of the resolution. It had to do with the stage management of political issues by a Prime Minister who saw an opportunity to exploit the tragedy of others for his own domestic purposes and to divide the Australian nation while he was doing so. It was all about one sentence. So there was no bipartisan attitude, no discussion and no resolution of this Parliament was passed unanimously, not because all members of parliament did not agree that a resolution should be passed but because the Prime Minister saw it as more important to serve his narrow political ends of division in this country than to have an expression on behalf of Australia. What has happened to the war in two years? It is the same as the Menzies war of three years in the 1950s. The defence vote has been cut in every year since that statement was made. None of the statements on defence has been honoured. This year we have less money to spend on the non-wages part of defence in real terms than in any year since this Governemnt came to office. There has been a real cut in the money available for facilities and equipment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am being accurate. There is an actual increase from last year's Estimates from 49 per cent to 55 per cent in the proportion of the Budget allocated for defence which will be absorbed by wages, leaving 45 per cent for non-wages expenditure. That is a cut of 6.5 per cent in real terms on the non- wages content of the defence vote and the Minister knows it. That is why he is running around the country making stupid statements about 35,000 tonne aircraft carriers and giving the F18s to the Royal Australian Navy to fly. If he put a tender behind the carrier, he could put the Army on it and we would have a great defence policy in line with what the Government has actually achieved over the years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us return to what this Government does and says about war in two years. I said in my speech the other night that the Minister had not mentioned Afghanistan. He said he had mentioned it. I read his speech and the greatest crisis in 40 years rated one word. It rated one word two and a half years later and the word was 'Afghanistan'. There was not one word about what had happened in the meantime, about the miscalculation or about what had been done about the intelligence services which led the Prime Minister to make in this Parliament statements that were patently inaccurate and misleading and which caused the Prime Minister to bring about a division on a matter on which the Parliament should have been unanimous. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Bill is not opposed by the Opposition, it is in the Parliament because the Prime Minister thought he had the opportunity to create division on foreign and defence policy in this country. He could not do so. He has always believed that the most important element of any matter which comes before the Australian Parliament is the degree to which it can be exploited for his narrow, short term political benefits. The unfortunate thing is that at a time when Australia is in crisis, a time when we need leadership which can unite the nation, we have small, petty-minded leaders who see themselves as political survivors at the cost of the nation. We do not oppose the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome with great enthusiasm the opportunity to speak on the Defence (Visiting Warships) Bill. Before I get to the statistics, which are dry but fairly effective, I would like to say this to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes): I cannot believe, having had a good deal of experience with him, that he really believes what he has just said-that this matter in respect of visiting warships is purely a political stunt by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Let us assume that it is a political stunt by the Prime Minister, which is as far as possible from the truth. That assumption accepts the judgment, the evaluation, that the people of Australia are convinced that this is an extremely important issue. If it is to be presented as an election issue, obviously it is of great concern to the people of Australia. Why should it be of great concern to the people of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I never cease to wonder how honourable members on that side of the House can possibly take the slightest risk of upsetting our understanding and agreements with the United States of America. How on earth could we possibly face up to an emergency of any consequence if we did not have one ally of that sort of strength? Recently I had the advantage of talking with the most powerful soldier on earth, Admiral Long. I am sure that both the past Minister for Defence and the present Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) would agree that he is one of the most powerful people on this earth in relation to his responsibilities and the power over his forces, which extend from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean and across to the Arabian Sea. That is a fair responsibility. What did he say? He said: 'Our regard for Australia is based on one obvious fact; you do not just stand by and hold our coat'. That is how he put it. So apparently the United States appreciates the fact that we have an effective alliance and an effective understanding. How can we say to such people: 'Right, when we want you we will scream. We expect you to come and be with us in an emergency but, hang it all, do not come into our ports'?</PARA>
<PARA> How many warships have come into our ports? The statistics are rather interesting. Since 1974 there have been 331 visits from United States warships alone. Opposition members say that if they are carrying nuclear arms, we do not want them hanging around and so we expect them to put on a big number plate saying: 'We carry nuclear arms'. What did Mr Whitlam say about that? Let me quote the great man. </PARA>

<PARA> Nuclear armed ships-presumably only nuclear armed naval ships-have come to Australia for very many years. They have come from several powers. Successive governments have accepted that naval ships these days are quite likely to be nuclear armed. It is impossible to expect the navies of other countries to specify for public consumption which of their ships are nuclear armed and which are not so that any country which is host to those ships may require that only those which are non/nuclear armed can come to the ports. If that information and that requirement are imposed it becomes a matter of public knowledge which of the ships in any particular navy are nuclear armed . . . </PARA>

<PARA> The proposed visit of the US nuclear armed ship the USS Goldsborough to Melbourne is an extreme provocation. The United States Government is fully aware of Victoria's nuclear free policy. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words-United States, keep out. What did Mr Cain say? In a telex sent to the Prime Minister on 3 June 1982, when talking about the visit of a ship, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In this particular case I do not intend to raise objections about the visit of the USS Hector which from published sources is manifestly an elderly non- combatant auxiliary ship which would not carry nuclear weapons. I understand that its armament is restricted to four machine guns and that its function is to provide a capability to repair other vessels. </PARA>
<PARA>How benign! How generous of Mr Cain! He had no objection to the Hector coming into port, just creeping into port. The message was loud and clear. Blind Freddy , whom we quote in this House from time to time-I have never met the gentleman but he is frequently quoted here-would understand from that comment that had this ship in any way been a suspected nuclear ship, it would keep out. But Mr Pain-well, he has caused enough pain in Victoria so I would be forgiven for making that sort of mistake-Mr Cain has seen the way the wind is blowing and had pressures brought to bear on him by more responsible members of the Labor Party. Now he has altered his tune a great deal and is thinking of this things beside the Hector. If we have any sense of responsibility at all for the security of this country, would we deliberately set up a barrier which would impose an inhibition of the worst possible kind between ourselves and the United States?</PARA>
<PARA> People who live in Tasmania and Melbourne can make their own arrangements, but I live in Queensland and am concerned with the northern frontiers of this nation . We are probably the most vulnerable. We have often thought that, come the next war, we will have a Brisbane line and will give away everything south of it if those who live there do not behave themselves. We are much more conscious of the vulnerability of northern parts of this nation. Hence we are deeply concerned with retaining and maintaining the sort of friendship, the sort of understanding and the sorts of agreements with the United States which would not be impeded by a policy which says: 'If you have a nuclear ship we do not want you in port'. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the proposed legislation obviously is to formulate existing Commonwealth powers and responsibilities in respect of visiting foreign warships -fancy having to formalise this!-and specifically to clarify that that sole authority for granting approval for such visits resides with the Commonwealth. In other words, we have to substantiate our powers. We are to come out and say to these irresponsible States, and thank God there are only one or two of them: 'Okay; if you are going to make it difficult, without one ally on whom we can depend, we will have to step in and superimpose our Commonwealth powers on you'. I congratulate the Minister on bringing this measure forward. I think the circumstances which made it necessary are regrettable. I totally support the Bill. </PARA>

This Government remains determined, for political purposes, to turn the American alliance into a weapon against a proportion of its citizens rather than see it evolve and develop in the context of a mature relationship in national security policy. The route by which this legislation has been brought before us is perhaps one of the worst examples of this process. Rather than address the concern that some of our citizens have that visits by nuclear powered and armed warships pose environmental dangers, strategic dangers and problems for the independence of our foreign policy, the Government produces crude and exaggerated argument that any inhibition on where and when the ships visit will negate the American alliance. The argument is utterly fatuous. If it were a genuine consideration, why did the United States of America alliance not collapse when the McMahon Liberal Government in 1971 banned visits by United States nuclear-powered warships?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. What the Government hoped to achieve was a situation in which, were any stabilisation agreed to at prevailing levels of activity, those prevailing levels would include substantial usage of Western Australian ports. Likewise it has been the Australian Government which has urged the United States to homeport warships in Western Australia, as it was the Australian Government which urged the United States to intervene in Australian domestic politics on this matter early in the year. After all, one can hardly expect the United States Government, which benefits greatly from the presence of intelligence gathering and communications facilities in Australia which are important to its strategic deterrent and arms control agreements, which benefits from the Australian Orion P3C surveillance of the eastern Indian Ocean, which has permission to transit Darwin with reconnaissance B52 aircraft, and which has the co-operation of the Australian intelligence community with the utterly vital naval ocean surveillance and information system of the United States, to take quite the same frenetic view of the value of occasional rest and recreation visits by warships as those on the other side of the House who in defence matters live in a state of suspended adolescence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that port visits by United States warships are useful but not vital to the American relationship. As such the question of the frequency of the visits, their location and the numbers involved can be viewed in a calm environment and with care to ensure that no environmental or strategic dangers emerge for the Australian community from their presence. The Government has a number of questions to answer on both these points, to which I wish now to turn. I have before me the report produced in 1976 by the Department of Defence and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission on Environmental Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia. This report justified the Fraser Government's rescinding of the McMahon Liberal Government's ban on visits by nuclear powered warships. For example, point 13 in chapter one reads:</PARA>
<PARA> However, the acceptance of nuclear warships under the proposed conditions is limited to those with reactor power levels less than 100MW (thermal) i.e., the current designs of nuclear powered submarines and the early surface vessels. Much larger reactor units are used in the latest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz and are planned for use in future United States nuclear surface warships. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was quoting from the report entitled 'Environmental Considerations on Visits by Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia', produced in 1976, which compared reactor units in nuclear powered submarines with those in larger units. The report continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The acceptance of these vessels would need to be assessed separately in the light of available technical information of guarantees on their safety. </PARA>
<PARA>This means that of the 29 nuclear powered warships that visited in the period from 1976 to 1981 and the 11 or so since, the 30-odd submarines have been cleared by this report but not necessarily the cruisers and the carriers. Has the Government new information which has not been released to the public which clears them? If so, where is it? The Governments of Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales are entitled to have that information as those ships must berth near population centres and the public is entitled to assurance and not abuse on this matter. In the report consideration is given to the unlikely event of a reactor melt down. This is identified as 'the principal risk from a nuclear warship visiting an Australian port'. It must be said that the prognosis on that possibility is encouraging. The risk is not seen by the authors of the report as being very high. Given however the fact that the Government's advisers see the risks as finite the public is now entitled to know in what ways, if any, these assessments have been altered by the experience with the Harrisburg disaster. We do not know if the British and American bodies which monitor naval reactors-on whose advice we rely-have assessed that accident. </PARA>
<PARA> Other risks were identified and defined in the report in the following way: Firstly, a catastrophic failure of the reactor pressure vessel causing a coincidental breach of the reactor containment direct to the atmosphere; secondly, from a high speed collision breaching both the containment and the primary circuit; and, thirdly, from sabotage. All three possibilities require the co-operation of those State authorities which control ship movements in port , berthing, evacuation procedures for population and police. Their co-operation is recognised by those who compiled the report on the safety of nuclear vessel visits to the Government and is not dismissed by them with the same slighting reference as that which has been made by Government spokesmen in public and by the Minister for Defence in his second reading speech. They recommend detailed plans, for implementation in each State, relying on co-operation with the State authorities, not the abuse of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to know how effectively all those plans have been developed in the last five years and in what ports appropriate procedures have been achieved. One would have thought that in any second reading speech on this matter produced in this House that would have been a minimal requirement upon which a Minister would make statements. It is understandable that when confronted with the fact that in 1980-81, under the Liberal Government, only 10 port visits were made, none involving nuclear powered vessels, and that of the 331 port visits which occurred between 1974 and 1981 only 43 were made by nuclear powered vessels-35 of them to Western Australian ports-the Government of Victoria should not perceive quite the same extreme urgency to the alliance subsequently discovered by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for port visits by nuclear powered ships, or any type of ship for that matter. It is not surprising also that Premier Neville Wran should feel somewhat chargrined at now being berated by a Prime Minister who, for six years, aquiesced without complaint on his maintenance of the McMahon Government's ban insofar as it affected Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some of the strategic questions involved and put aside the environmental matters as I understand some other Opposition speakers wish to deal with them. There is no doubt that the capacity to exercise with Australian ships and air and ground forces is a valuable feature for some port visits. It is much more preferable in terms of defence of Australia to have substantial experience in this regard off our coast than in distant points of the Indian and Pacific oceans. That is certainly a gain from port visits by American warships. However, it is fallacious to go beyond this to argue that the visiting warships serve a direct Australian defence purpose. They serve United States purposes and will be committed to action at the initiative of the United States Government and nobody else. </PARA>
<PARA> The ships which visit Western Australia do not patrol its shores to pick up smugglers, spies, terrorists or whatever. They do not police our off-shore installations and are of very marginal value to coastal surveillance. Were we to be embroiled with Indonesia over Timor or become embroiled with Indonesia in New Guinea those ships would not be committed to pulling us out of trouble. As a member of parliament representing an electorate in Western Australia I resent the way attempts have been made to con the general public in Western Australia into believing that United States port visits defend Western Australia. The Government slides into this argument whenever attention is drawn to its erratic record on the defence of Western Australia. On the southern and eastern coasts of this country there are 12 destroyers, 14 patrol boats and 6 submarines. After seven years of Liberal Government there is only one patrol boat on the west coast. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Government began its term with the promise of a full utilisation of the capacity of HMAS Stirling-four destroyers and three submarines. In 1976 the Liberal Government promised that a patrol boat base would be built in the north- west of Western Australia by 1981. In the 1977 election the then Minister for Defence promised two destroyers and two submarines at Stirling by 1980. Of course none of these have appeared. They are a part of the continuing but non- implemented promises of this Government. I have great confidence that they will be trotted out in the very near future as we approach an election. The implications of all this is that Western Australia has forward defence and the rest of the country has defence self-reliance. This Government will go on using the smokescreen of visits by the United States Navy to conceal the utter charade it has made of its defence promises in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to one further matter on the strategic question which needs to be addressed and that is an aspect of the quality of our alliance relationship. The Australian people have an entitlement to a clear understanding of the significance of every aspect of our relationship, not just because this is essential in every democratic society, but because it is essential for sound political judgment in alliance relationships. Whenever this House debates an alliance-related subject it does so as though there were no other leg to the alliance and that to modify or trim the policy under discussion will bring down the whole house of the alliance. This is mindless. I concede that occasional efforts have been made by Government members to break out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The influence of bad habits built up in the 1960s on the detail of our involvement in Vietnam and discussion of the role of the joint installations, however, remains. On this matter I draw attention to certain features of the port visits to Western Australia which have not been raised for proper discussion in the House. I find the notion of providing allies with rest and recreation facilities, where the allies require it, unimpeachable. Less impressive is the manipulation of an ally to achieve certain objectives which are then sold as an allied initiative. Even less impressive is the construction of a pattern of visits which suggests that an operation other than simply occasional R and R is being conducted. It may be that both activities ought to be approved. Neither should be approved without full and frank public discussion . </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the connection between the increasing visits to Western Australia and the efforts to subvert or modify President Carter's initiative to demilitarise the Indian Ocean. This was never discussed at the time. At that time the official position of the Australian Government was to support an Indian Ocean peace zone. In the interim it supported a balance of naval forces in the Indian Ocean at the lowest possible level. Its policy on port visits in practice subverted its objective at that time, but that was never explained. In addition, Western Australia now experiences visits by submarines with a frequency which suggests that R and R visits are associated with an operation. They appear for a week once a month at HMAS Stirling. We are not entitled to know the details of those operations. In the same way, we are not entitled to know the technical detail of how Pine Gap or one of the other installations monitors communications or performs technical functions. We are entitled to know if an operation exists and its purposes. In my view, from an assessment of the public record and from answers to ministerial questions, the regular submarine visits represent the tail and softer end of a substantial Australian contribution to an American anti-submarine warfare effort in the eastern Indian Ocean. We contribute communications through North West Cape and contribute surveillance through P3 operations from Australia, Indian Ocean islands and Malaysia. In the past we have contributed to hydrographic surveys and in other ways assisted the development of underwater sensor systems, and we participate in monitoring maritime communications. </PARA>
<PARA> The submarines are the business end of an anti-submarine warfare infrastructure in substantial measure provided by Australia. If this is the case it ought to be discussed in this place as it is a major contribution to our ally's security. It provides secure transit for the United States Navy between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Nowhere in the Minister's speech on this matter is there an appreciation of this point. It is simply discussed in terms of rest and recreation visits of the warships involved. We are entitled to know the full extent of our co-operation with the United States in every area-not, as I said, the secret technical aspects of it but the purposes of it. We on this side of the House support this Bill. We deprecate, however, the divisive course that has brought it here. That course is destructive of rational foreign policy debate and it is corrosive of our national interest, and the Government should be condemned for that aspect of its activity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nuclear energy is a very contentious issue throughout the world. Genuine fears are held by many people about the effect of the uranium nuclear power industry on this country. I respect those views and I understand them. We should face the fact that nuclear arms have been here for many years and they are here to stay; it is a fact of life. Many countries have achieved a nuclear capability. According to previous speakers, some 370 nuclear powered and/or nuclear armed ships have visited this country in recent years. To understand the extent of the debate we have only to look at some of the advertisements that have appeared in our national Press and are still appearing. One published in 1976 is Headed 'No Nuclear Warships'. I hope I do not unfairly accuse the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren). This article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Premier of NSW, Mr Neville Wran, has declared that NSW ports will be closed to nuclear warships. We wholeheartedly endorse and support his stand, believing it to be in the interests of the safety and well being of the people of NSW and the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The advertisement contains a list of names. I am sure that most of the names that appear in that advertisement are genuine. On balance, whilst we respect the views opposing nuclear power, we eventually have to make a decision as to what stand we shall take. It is very heartening tonight to see that the Australian Labor Party-the Opposition-has defused the issue; it supports the Defence ( Visiting Warships) Bill. I believe this is a truly bipartisan approach despite the fact that a very strong element within the ALP will-as the Victorian ALP is trying to do-bring it forward as another contentious issue. </PARA>
<PARA> We support the fact that our American allies have chosen to arm and to power their ships by nuclear means. That is not our decision; that is their decision. We, as signatories to the ANZUS Treaty, cannot say: 'The Treaty is at an end. Go home, we are not interested in playing with those sorts of armaments'. Of course we are not. It is necessary, despite what armaments they might carry, for us to offer them our porting facilities. I think it is important to quote a joint communique issued by the representatives of the governments of the United States , New Zealand and Australia at the conclusion of the thirty-first meeting of the ANZUS Council held on 21 and 22 June 1982. That communique, quoted in the second reading speech of the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair), states:</PARA>
<PARA> In particular (the Deputy Secretary and the Ministers) confirmed the high priority each partner placed upon a regular and comprehensive programme of naval visits to each other's ports, as well as to friendly ports in the Asia/Pacific region generally. They recognise the importance of access by United States naval ships to the ports of its Treaty partners as a critical factor in its efforts to maintain strategic deterrence and in order to carry out its responsibilities under the terms of the Treaty. In this regard the Australian and New Zealand members declared their continued willingness to accept visits to their ports by United States naval vessels whether conventional or nuclear powered. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask: What sort of ally would we be if we accepted our allies only on our terms ? We would very shortly run out of allies. I remind the House that the United States of America and some of our other allies decided to arm and power their ships with nuclear energy. It was not our decision. I remind the House that nuclear armaments had their beginnings in World War II. There is no need to remind people here that the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the last 40 years has been due to the necessity of keeping the balance of power-or terror, as some people might choose to call it-and it takes two to achieve balance on any see-saw. Too often the Western bloc countries are blamed for the proliferation of nuclear power when two are playing this deadly game. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of this debate is this: Do we approve of allowing Eastern bloc countries to develop nuclear weapons without attempting to counter them? If we do not approve we are obliged to support our American allies. Part of that support is to offer what help we can. If we assist in this way the time will come when they will assist us if we call them. The assistance we can offer includes porting facilities. One of the points which I believe has been missed in the debate is that this Bill came forward mainly because the issue was raised , not by the Government, but by the the Victorian premier and before him, by the New South Wales Premier. Recently Mr Cain challenged the Federal government as to its authority in this matter. That authority has been acknowledged, I am glad to say, by the other side of the House. Since that time Mr Cain has backed down, and rightly so. Before that, in a more low key way, the Premier of New South Wales also challenged the authority of the Federal Government in this matter. I believe it is unfortunate that this Bill is necessary. Again the Opposition has acknowledged that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that any government's first responsibility is to protect Australia and its territories. If anybody thinks that we can do this alone he is sadly mistaken. All governments, whatever their political complexion, have sought allies since this country became a nation. Generally speaking there has been a fairly bipartisan approach to defence. The ANZUS Treaty has been part of our defence policy for many years. It has stood the test of time and I suspect it will remain for many years to come. The Government, under the Treaty, is obliged to offer assistance, including porting facilities, to our allies. If that assistance is not forthcoming America is quite entitled to question our commitment to the Treaty. Apart from some notable exceptions, members of the Australian Labor Party have supported the ANZUS Treaty. If they support that Treaty, I fail to understand how there can be any serious division about suporting the porting of American ships. Both the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) have talked tonight about the political purposes of introducing this Bill. However the fact is that the Bill was introduced simply because the Premier of Victoria sought to challenge the authority of the Federal Government which-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can only agree with the honourable member for McPherson (Mr White) who said that this House should be devoting its attention to more important issues. The House is debating the Defence (Visiting Warships) Bill because it was brought in by the Government for two reasons, both of which are reprehensible. Firstly, the Government has spoken a great deal about the United States alliance, but by its very actions not only on this Bill but also on the United States Naval Communications Station Agreement which was debated recently what it is effectively doing is demeaning that alliance. I can well understand the embarrassment of the United States Government which is being dragged into the continued and contrived devices of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who is trying to set up some gimmick for an election before the Budget he brought in breaks down completely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This afternoon the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) mentioned that this legislation could be seen as a political stunt. This is one of the very few occasions on which I wholeheartedly agree with the honourable member for Kennedy . Let us be very clear about this legislation. The Bill contains no provisions that are not already available to the Government. The type of regulation and control in the Bill is already available to the Government. There is certainly no argument with the Australian Labor Party that defence is a federal power. Sometimes the Labor Party is criticised for being too centralist a party. There is no question-we have made it very clear-that the defence power, under the Constitution, is a power that is reserved for the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> References have been made this evening to the report on Environmental Considerations of Visits of Nuclear Powered Warships to Australia. That report was presented to this Parliament in May 1976. It was produced to this Parliament in May 1976 because the Labor Party, in opposition, established a working party because we were concerned about the safety of the population and particularly the introduction of nuclear powered vessels in circumstances of heavy maritime traffic. At that stage real concern was displayed by the Labor Party which set up a working party of officers between the Department of Defence and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. The Liberal Party will probably take credit for that report. The credit for that report lies distinctly with the Labor Party administration of defence from 1972 to 1974. During the period of Liberal Party government through to 1972 not only did the Prime Minister at that time, Mr McMahon, do nothing about the matter; one of the Ministers for Defence who did absolutely nothing about the matter also was the present Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason that has been advanced for the introduction of the Bill, again it is a reprehensible one, is that the Government-I am glad that the new Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) is in the House-is seeking to lay down a smokescreen to hide its monumental mismanagement of defence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be delighted if the honourable member who has his back to me would turn around. I would like to say a few words to him. This legislation has been brought down as a smokescreen to cover up the Government's incompetence and inadequacies. In 1976 this Government brought in the first of its great five year rolling programs. That program promised an increase in real terms in defence expenditure of 5 per cent. After the first five years the result was not the 5 per cent increase which the Government promised-another broken promise-but an increase of 3.9 per cent in defence expenditure. We are already three years through the second five-year plan and the Government promised a real increase in defence expenditure of 7 per cent. The Minister came into this House, very quietly I must confess, and made it very clear that the real increase in this year's Budget will not be anywhere near 7 per cent; it will be a mere one per cent. These are promises which the Government has made for the last six or seven years. Obviously it must try to hide the facts. What does the Government do? It comes running into this House with contrived debates and legislation on the North West Cape and Omega facilities and on the Bill we are currently considering. It is all an act to cover up its incompetence and mismanagement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will take a couple of examples of what the Government has promised and what it has delivered. The program envisaged that equipment would take up 22 per cent of defence expenditure. We are getting some rubbery figures. No longer is the Government satisfied to talk about equipment in terms of new equipment. It throws in all sorts of other equipment, including repairs and maintenance, to make up its equipment vote. Instead of the 22 per cent increase in defence expenditure which the Government promised, the real figure will be down to 15.1 per cent. The Government bravely said that it will cut manpower costs to 45 per cent of expenditure. What does the current Budget show? It shows that 51.5 per cent of expenditure will be on manpower. Defence facilities were to take up to 7 per cent of defence expenditure. In the 1975 Budget it was aleady at 6.9 per cent. What is the result of six years of Liberal Government? Defence expenditure is down to 4.6 per cent. We have heard tremendous rhetoric about defence purveyed and conveyed by the Government; on each and every occasion it has failed to deliver the goods. The promises have all been there but the Government has broken every promise it has made on defence. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Minister for Defence Support (Mr Viner) who is at the table will sum up for the Government in the debate. I want him to tell the House , if he can, what promises the Liberal Party Government has been able to achieve in defence. There is one particular matter which the Government will emphasise. I refer to the percentage of defence expenditure compared with gross domestic product. The Government is now claiming that defence expenditure will be 2.9 per cent of gross domestic product. This is pyrrhic victory because the way the Government has been able to achieve something of what it promised is by the very simple device of completely disorienting this country where the GDP is decreasing. What a great victory it is to say: 'Okay, we are achieving one of our aims by the very simple process of distorting-as the Government has done through its economic policies-the growth potential of this country'! This is the first time since Federation that any government has come into this Parliament to tell it and the Australian people that there will be no growth in our economy this year. This is what the Government stands for.</PARA>

The real impact of this Budget is that there will be no growth. It is for that reason that the Government will be able to achieve 2.9 per cent of a very much smaller GDP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party has come into the House to accept this Bill. There is nothing in it that was not conducted effectively by the Labor Party in the defence administration of this country. There is no reason why we should oppose it. It does not contain anything which the Federal Government has not got and which cannot be used to carry out its purposes. The Government has made a farce of this Parliament. It has made a farce and a charade of the alliance with the United States. It has demeaned the United States alliance for narrow political partisan purposes. That is all that this Government has ever stood for in defence matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the member for Melbourne Ports I enter this debate because I represent an electorate which contains the basic port facilities for the Port of Melbourne. Any visit by a United States warship, nuclear or otherwise, is a matter of some concern to me and my constituents. What is in dispute here is not really at any stage the defence power of the Commonwealth. The defence power of the Commonwealth has been conceded by all members of this Parliament, and indeed by all those State Premiers who have been concerned to express a view on the matter of visits by nuclear warships. The Defence (Visiting Warships) Bill was not and is not necessary to strengthen the power of the Commonwealth in the exercise of its prerogatives under the defence powers in the Constitution. This legislation initially was an exercise in political grandstanding by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), who was seeking to use Australia's relationship with the United States and the general view of his Government to create hysteria within the electorate, to create a situation where, faced with the declining economy, with a record of Government failure in respect of the economy, he could contrive an artificial issue to take to the Australian electorate. In so doing, of course, a number of arguments have been completely obfuscated, and the history of Australia's relationship with the United States and our perception of the problems that are occasioned by the visit of nuclear powered or nuclear armed warships has been overlooked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) pointed out, the first Prime Minister in Australia to indicate to both Great Britain and the United States of America that we did not want visiting nuclear warships to visit Australia was McMahon. In a statement to this House the then Prime Minister, Mr McMahon, pointed out that, acting on the advice of the Department of Defence and on the basis that there were no adequate undertakings or guarantees from either Great Britain or the United States at that stage, his Government felt constrained to say to both the United States of America and Great Britain that our port facilities would not be made available. Of course, if what the Prime Minister has said is true-that the refusal by any Australian Government of those port facilities would destroy the basis of ANZUS-that leaves us with the interesting question: How is it that, despite the refusal of the McMahon Government, ANZUS seems to have survived? The answer to that is that over a period a quite formidable set of agreements and undertakings were given by the United States and other nations whose warships are nuclear powered or nuclear armed and which carry the flag of their country. They indicated that they would give certain guarantees, and some of those details have been given by the honourable member for Swan. </PARA>
<PARA> I say without any hesitation at all that whilst one might not be greatly concerned about a visit by a nuclear powered vessel, there are some nuclear vessels which I would be very unhappy to see visit the port of Melbourne. I refer to vessels such as the recently build United States nuclear submarines, the Tridents. Anyone who knows anything about defence knows the awesome lethal capacity of those vessels. They are a major strike component in the United States nuclear weaponry system. If those vessels were detected they would immediately become the target of any Soviet marshall responsible for targeting what he would perceive as a threat to the Soviet Union. It is one thing to act as host to a nuclear powered vessel whose sailors are going on rest and recreation leave. It is quite another thing if, as a result of the view that is being put by this Government in respect of Australia's responsibility to ANZUS, we say that we will extend that doctrine to allow the United States to say to us : 'Prime Minister, we are going to send you a Trident submarine. We know you will happily accept that whatever port in Australia it goes into automatically becomes the target of a Soviet missile'. We have no defence capacity in Australia at all and none could be provided by the United States in that situation. I do not think the United States seeks to do that but I point out that none of the existing arrangements between the Government of the United States and this Government cover that contingency. </PARA>
<PARA> It is glib nonsense for the Government, having decided that this matter is no longer one of major moment to this Parliament, to say: 'We will restrict Opposition speakers to 10 minutes. We will get the Bill through the Parliament because we are not really concerned to argue about it'. I am concerned to say, because I think it needs to be said, that any sensible Australian parliamentarian, whether he supports ANZUS or not, has to be concerned about the growth of the nuclear weapons systems in the major super powers. The emphasis that is now being given to a strategy of limited nuclear war and strategic nuclear weapons is a major destabilising factor between the super powers. Any person who is concerned to protest about the growth of nuclear weapons and the sophistication of those weapons held either by the Soviet Union or the United States in my view is acting rationally and sensibly. </PARA>
<PARA> We have just had a report from the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which has analysed, amongst other things, the nature of the threats that Australia faces. It pointed out that, in the event of superpower conflict, in all probability Australia would be a target for nuclear weapons. In that situation, as a member whose constituents could be grossly affected, I will not allow this debate to pass and simply say: 'Well, I am going to accept this Government's view that the only relationship we are allowed to have with the United States is automatic compliance with every aspect of United States policy' . What this Government does, I believe, in expressing the kinds of views that have been expressed by the Prime Minister, is to undermine continually any coherent development of a doctrine of regional defence responsibility within Australia. It says: 'In any situation we look to our great American friend'. </PARA>
<PARA> We also seriously and falsely raise the expectations of the Australian people in terms of the responsibilities that the United States of America has as a superpower when we say that because a piece of paper was signed in 1951, that means that whatever conflict situation we find ourselves in, be it a regional conflict or whatever, the United States will automatically come to our assistance. I point out to the House that as at 1980 the United States was involved in no less than 140 separate treaties. One only has to look at the recent conflict between Great Britain and Argentina where both Great Britain and Argentina had different expectations from the United States in terms of their existing treaty relationship with the United States. It is a glib over- simplification, and my view a dangerous over-simplification, to say that because of a piece of paper signed in 1951 we can always presume that the Americans will come to our aid in any situation, even if it is just a situation involving regional conflict. The reality is as was put by McGeorge Bundy, a former American presidential adviser, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The American commitment anywhere is only as deep as the continued conviction of Americans that their interests require. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote the words of a distinguished member of the Liberal Party in Australia, Senator Hamer, who, on 25 March last year, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The United States will come to our assistance in an emergency if it thinks it is in its interests to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what happened in 1942 and there was no alliance then. It is time this Government ceased its practice of dragging out the United States alliance as some political ploy in which it hopes to obtain some immediate electoral favour. There are serious defence issues facing this nation. This legislation is unnecessary. It came about as a result of what seemed to me to be a complete exercise in political expediency by the Prime Minister. The very attitude that the Government takes in limiting the debate in this House and the very interest shown by Government members shows this Bill up for what it is-a fairly sordid political exercise which does the Government no credit in its so often voiced pronouncements about its very special relationship with the United States. Any visiting United States parliamentarian would be sickened by the cynicism that has been displayed by the Government on this issue. I believe the Australian electorate should be sickened by the way in which this Government has demeaned what ought to be a very important debate, not merely about Australia's defence prospects but about the very real threat that every Australian faces when we look at where the nuclear arms race is heading and where doctrines of limited nuclear strategy are leading the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a number of remarks in concluding this debate on the second reading of the Defence (Visiting Warships) Bill. It is as well to remind the House why this legislation was necessary, particularly having regard to the remarks just made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) who sought to suggest that this legislation and the reasons put forward by the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) in his second reading speech were glib over-simplifications of the situation. This legislation is necessary and it was necessary because the Labor Premier of Victoria announced that his Government was going to legislate to prevent nuclear armed or nuclear powered ships entering the port of Melbourne. That was a direct challenge to the constitutional authority of the Commonwealth to act in the defence interests of the Australian people, an authority which I do not believe had ever been challenged in the history of the Australian Federation. So it is perfectly natural and absolutely necessary for the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia to respond immediately to a challenge of that kind by the Labor Premier of Victoria to the constitutional authority of the Commonwealth. I venture to suggest that if there were a Labor Prime Minister faced with the same challenge by a Liberal Premier, that Labor Prime Minister would respond in exactly the same way, because the defence power and the foreign affairs powers in a very real sense are of paramount importance to not only the purpose for which the Federation was formed back at the turn of the century but also the reason why it continues to exist and thereby unite our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That direct challenge by Mr Cain was taken up by the Labor Premier of the State of New South Wales, Mr Wran. Indeed, it was also backed up by the Western Australian Leader of the Labor Party Opposition in my own State, a Mr Bourke, who came out publicly in support of the Victorian action. He said that a Western Australian Labor Government would oppose visits by nuclear powered or nuclear armed ships. That is a statement from the leader of a political party in Western Australia which had been the host within Fremantle harbour and HMAS Stirling to numerous nuclear powered ships and numerous normally powered surface ships of the United States fleet. Is it any wonder that the Commonwealth, faced with statements of that kind by Labor Party leaders, should desire to introduce and have passed by this Parliament the Defence (Visiting Warships) Bill? In introducing the Bill the Minister for Defence said:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to discharge the responsibilities of the Commonwealth in relation to visits by foreign warships. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a succinct and direct statement on the purpose of the Bill. Honourable members might wonder why the atmospherics and the heat level in the debate on this Bill displayed by honourable members of the Opposition is so remarkably different from the public debate which erupted immediately after the Cain statement and the confusion in the Labor Party ranks caused by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) . The answer is quite obvious. When the Labor Party Opposition had to face up to the fact of the constitutional authority of the Commonwealth it of course had no arguments to sustain the stand which had first been taken by Mr Cain. It must be a great deal of embarrassment to the Opposition to have to come into this House and support the Bill against the background of those earlier statements of Mr Cain, Mr Wran, Mr Burke, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and other prominent members of the Labor Party. Indeed, some would say, having listened to the debate this afternoon and tonight and having heard member after member of the Opposition say that the Opposition supports the Bill, while at the same time trying to mount some clever but unconvincing arguments, that we saw the hallmarks of hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to direct my concluding comments to some statements made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). I really do wonder where the honourable member for Melbourne Ports stands when he says that he supports the Bill but that he would not like a Trident nuclear powered United States submarine entering the port of Melbourne because it could lead to a Soviet missile attack on Melbourne. I suppose it is a fairly glib observation to say that if the world unfortunately was faced with another world war there is a likelihood that nuclear weapons would be used. Heaven forbid that any of us ever live to see the day when there is either another world war or nuclear arms are used. The public is entitled to ask very deliberately where the honourable member for Melbourne Ports stands when he says he supports the Bill and then says he would not like to have a Trident nuclear powered submarine entering the port of Melbourne. That is the very reason why it is necessary for this Bill to have the authority of Parliament and for the authority of the Commonwealth to be reaffirmed. </PARA>
<PARA> I will turn now to the remarks of the honourable member for Swan, who happens to come from my own State of Western Australia. (Quorum formed). I think it is fair enough to observe that the speech by the honourable member for Swan was clever but unconvincing. He, like the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, supported the Bill so from that we are entitled to assume that he is in favour of United States nuclear powered or nuclear armed warships entering the Port of Fremantle or Cockburn Sound. He went on to pontificate by saying that we the public are entitled to know certain things. I really wonder whether the honourable member for Swan is so naive as to think that United States warships in the Indian Ocean are there for a holiday. </PARA>
<PARA> It so happens that 11 United States warships will be visiting Fremantle and Cockburn Sound this month. Those 11 United States warships make up the United States carrier task group operating in the Indian Ocean. Obviously they are not there for a holiday. They are there for a strategic purpose relevant to the world-wide defensive operations of the United States, which are directly related to sustaining the overall defence of Australia. The importance of visits of ships of that kind to Australian ports was verified in the Communique issued by the ANZUS council meeting held in Australia in June. The communique stressed ' the importance of access by United States naval ships to the ports of its treaty partners as a critical factor in its efforts to maintain strategic deterence'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason why the United States carrier task force is operating in the Indian Ocean. It is an ocean of great importance to Australia and to the Western world, particularly in view of the instability in the Middle East, the Gulf states and in Africa-indeed, right around the rim of the Indian Ocean. It is because of the sentiments expressed in that communique of the ANZUS council meeting in Australia in June that it is not only important but also vital that Australian ports, such as Fremantle, and defence facilities, such as those at HMAS Stirling, are freely open and available to United States nuclear powered or non-nuclear powered or nuclear armed or non-nuclear armed warships. Those ships are the ships of an ally of this country. I wonder whether the Australian Labor Party will ever be prepared to state its true sentiments. We hear honourable members time after time come into this House and condemn our alliance with the United States of America but how often do we ever hear them condemn the aggressive military capability and operations of the Soviet Union?</PARA>
<PARA> When, as a Western Australian, I sit here and listen to a fellow Western Australian, the honourable member for Swan, speak as he did today-knowing of the statements that were made in Western Australia by his political colleague Mr Burke, the Leader of the Labor Opposition in State parliament, opposing visits by nuclear powered or nuclear armed ships-I really wonder where the honourable member for Swan stands on this issue. I think it is time that he and his fellow Western Australian federal members and senators, as well as his fellow State Labor Party members, really told the public of Western Australia where they stand. Are they in fact going to oppose, for example, the visit by these 11 United States warships which are about to enter Fremantle harbour and Cockburn Sound? None of the arguments put forward by the Labor Party have been convincing , notwithstanding the fact that Opposition members get up here and rather tritely say they are going to support the Bill. </PARA>

The Minister for Defence Support and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence (Mr Viner) has established that the Government is on a fishing exercise for political purposes and it does not matter how much damage it does. I make quite clear that the Government's justification for this Bill is, to say the least, phoney and certainly has no substance. The Minister said that the Victorian Government made the Bill necessary by its refusal to allow nuclear ships to visit the Port of Melbourne.

<PARA>To the Rt Honourable J. M. Fraser, CH., M.P., Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>My Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I have seen media reports that a visit by the USS Goldsborough is planned for Melbourne in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also seen reports in which you are reported to have said that the visit of such vessels is not the concern of State Governments. The Victorian Government is concerned to protect Victorians from the danger of nuclear contamination and in that context visits by nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed warships to Victoria from any country are not welcome. If it is to be your position that you will not seek to inquire if any vessel might carry nuclear weapons and there is any degree of probability that it would, it should be necessary to assume that it would carry nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government recognises however, that the Commonwealth has ultimate authority in these matters and so would not prevent such visits. Should the Commonwealth Government agree to a request from a foreign power for a visit in this category, the Commonwealth Government must assume full responsibility for the safety, environmental and financial aspects of such visits. </PARA>
<PARA> I would appreciate details of any visits by warships which have been planned as I believe Victorians are entitled to be fully informed of the details of these visits and the arrangements the Commonwealth will make to ensure the safety of all Victorians. </PARA>

<PARA>916/10/1</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Fraser,</PARA>
<PARA>Visits to Victoria by Nuclear Powered and Nuclear Armed Warships</PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised that until early in 1980 it had been the practice in the case of proposed visits to Victoria by nuclear powered warships for the Prime Minister to write to my predecessors as Premier seeking their concurrence. Since February, 1980, arrangements for routine visits to Victoria by nuclear powered warships have been handled at departmental level. </PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to give you early notice of my Government's policy that it will not permit visits of nuclear powered or nuclear armed vessels to Victorian ports . </PARA>
<PARA> This policy, which was part of the platform on which my Government was elected, will apply without qualification. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to your co-operation in assisting us in the maintenance of compliance with this policy. It would be appreciated if your Government could advise relevant foreign Governments, as appropriate, of my Government's policy in order to avoid misunderstanding.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the Budget of a desperate government, led by a desperate, divisive Prime Minister. At a time when consensus is needed in Australia we are led by a man whose most outstanding characteristic is his divisiveness, who has no moral authority and who, after this Budget, has no economic credibility. The Government is desperate because it is running out of scapegoats to blame for its own mismanagement, maladministration and failure to live up to even the basic standards of ministerial responsibility. It is a government that still thinks it is born to rule. I must say that I am amazed when even front bench members from the other side say that something is the fault of the Whitlam years. The Government parties have governed for 30 of the past 33 years. This Government is led by a Prime Minister who is now complaining because three Bills are blocked in the Senate. Where is all the guff now about the House of review? When the Australian Labor Party was in government for three years 93 Bills were blocked in the Senate by the then Opposition, so let us have no nonsense about blocks in the Senate. The big scapegoat now for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is the world. He says that Australia's problems are caused by the world recession and that we cannot do anything about what is happening in the world economic situation. It must flow through to Australia. What did this Prime Minister say in 1975? He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped, it is part of a world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership when if they were men of real stature, they would be saying we can overcome. </PARA>
<PARA>This Budget perfectly expresses the futility of this desperate Prime Minister and his Government. It expresses the futility of his leadership. Budgets are both economic and political documents. As a political document this Budget is a cynical response to some of the needs of groups and individuals most bludgeoned by the Government's wicked economic policies. Even where needs have been recognised, it is clear that the findings of Liberal Party opinion polls have been taken into account. This is the reason why the needs of the unemployed and the single parents have been all but ignored. The Liberals have calculated that unemployment will not be an issue. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget has been framed with an early election in mind on the basis that those affected by high interest rates, record taxes, record unemployment, low social security benefits and high inflation will forgive their masters if a few lollies are handed around a few months before an election is envisaged. Of course, the benefits come after 1 November, or 1 January in some instances. The extra revenue collections and the taxes started from 17 August. This is the Government that has now broken the dollar barrier for a schooner of beer. This is the Government that has levied and loaded fuel and petrol with so many taxes that it is now the biggest taxing government in Australia's history. As an economic document the Budget is a surrender. It is a cynical reaction to the Fraser recession. It is not an appropriate economic response to the Fraser recession. It is obvious, of course, that the Prime Minister is casting around for an excuse to have another early election. He is desperate and the biggest scapegoat he was banking on has blown up in his face. That was the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union set up by the Liberals to show guilt by association. What it has shown has been guilt by direct connection with the Liberal Party on the issue of tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget reminds me of the 1977 situation. Recently, when the Prime Minister suddenly realised there was a drought on, not only did his reaction keep the November election option open but also it was a direct parallel in rural policy to the panic that produced the beef incentive payments scheme in September 1977. The Government, when in opposition, made so much of the plight of the beef industry in 1975 and did nothing about it for two years and then acted in panic. The Government has responded similarly to the drought. The Prime Minister has totally undercut the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). The basis for this Budget and the reasoning and thinking of the Government for the Budget in relation to the rural sector is that it believes that that sector can be taken for granted. The votes are locked up. It can treat the farmers and graziers, the rural sector and people in country and provincial areas with disdain if not contempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Budget and the rural sector. The Budget has done nothing to alleviate the impact of the adverse economic and seasonal conditions currently faced by the majority of Australia's producers. It totally ignored the request submitted by the National Farmers Federation. As we all know, before Budgets are framed there is a series of discussions with various interest groups, the peak organisations of this country representing the unions, the bureaucracy, the farmers and the business people. They have discussions. The peak farming organisation is the National Farmers Federation. It put to the Government a series of requests. Let us go through them. It wanted an additional 20 per cent bounty on fertilisers. This was not done. It wanted an additional $30m for rural research. This was not done. It wanted an additional $5m for wool promotion. This was not done. It wanted an increase of $32m over the 1981-82 allocation for rural adjustment. There was an additional allocation of $2m, which in real terms was less. This was in a year when the Government was getting $10m back from the States. It could simply have cancelled that out and given $10m without its even appearing as a Budget item.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Farmers Federation wanted the Government to waive the threshold State contributions during a continuing drought. This was not done, and has not been done in two meetings since the Budget. It wanted the Government to write off the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign debt. This was actually done, but the slaughter levy was increased from $3 to $5. The $23.5m to wipe out the debt of the BTEC simply restored the Federal Government's commitment to pay 15 per cent of the cost of the campaign. The Cattle Council of Australia quite rightly says that this is all it is. It took many representations from the Cattlemen's Union, the Cattle Council and the National Farmers Federation to get the Government to do even that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us return to some of the things that the National Farmers Federation was asking for. It wanted the return of Commonwealth funding of the BTEC to the originally agreed 15 per cent level. This was not done. It wanted to increase the real level of funding for rural roads. This was not done, though we make some allowances for the additional levy on petrol for roads. It wanted some initiatives in the telecommunications area to provide better communications for people in rural areas. What the Government did there was to increase telephone charges for medium distances by 4c and 7c a call, depending on distance. It wanted an increase in the interest rates on income equalisation deposits. This was not done. It wanted the maintenance of the fuel freight subsidy. This was not done. The subsidy was reduced and now it is paid only when the differential exceeds 1c a litre. The National Farmers Federation wanted the immediate write- off of fixed capital investment in farm-based power generation. This was not done. It wanted the Government to accept ongoing responsibility for additional costs associated with increased inspection resulting from the meat substitution scandal. This was not done, but the Government did agree to hold meat inspection charges at the 1981-82 level. Finally, it wanted the Government to assume some responsibility for soil conservation. This was not done. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) as well as not fighting in Cabinet for anything in the Budget for the rural sector, bar the one or two matters I have mentioned, even sought at the meeting of the South Australian Rural Media Association on 30 August to misrepresent the Budget for Australia's agricultural and pastoral industries. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . total outlays . . . are estimated at $310m . . . which is a very significant increase of 40 per cent on the 1981-82 level of $200m. Given our policy of continuing economic restraint, I cannot see how anyone can reasonably argue that primary industry is ever forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA>What he did not point out, of course, was that the additional sums arise almost entirely for anticipated payments to the wheat and sugar industries. They are existing marketing arrangements as money going into a fund and out of a fund. The sugar figure is simply an accounting function of some millions of dollars and, of course, the wheat figure is quite rubbery because of the drought situation; we do not know how much wheat we are going to get. The Minister says that he believes in ongoing policies and that it does not all need to be done in the Budget. We all agree with that. But there has been no response prior to the Budget and on the most pressing issue of the time it took the Prime Minister's intervention to get any action at all. I suppose he refers to ongoing things such as the razor gang, which is one of the greatest jokes ever perpetrated on the primary industries. Perhaps he likes to think of ongoing things such as the resolution passed by the Federal Council of the Liberal Party recently. The resolution reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That this Federal Council believes that Marketing Boards, with powers of compulsory acquisition, levy and monopoly marketing, are contrary to Liberal philosophy and supports the existence of Marketing Boards, private sector or Government-owned, established by statute or otherwise, provided that-</PARA>
<PARA> no Board has the power of compulsory purchase;</PARA>
<PARA> no Board has a statutory monopoly on sale;</PARA>
<PARA> no Board has the power to exact a compulsory levy from purchasers;</PARA>
<PARA> no Board has the power to determine the variety of goods produced;</PARA>
<PARA> the administrative and marketing expenses, in the case of statutory Boards are met from the commission on sales;</PARA>
<PARA> no Board should have an inspectorate with powers of entry, search or seizure of commodities without warrant. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the ongoing things that the Liberal Party and this Government adhere to. It similarly means that they are out to wreck the Australian Wheat Board, the Australian Wool Corporation, the Australian Dairy Corporation, existing sugar arrangements in this country and all the 11 statutory marketing boards that this Government is responsible for. If that is one of the ongoing things, it is one of the things the Labor Party will oppose. </PARA>
<PARA> The first signal that the interests of Australian primary producers were to be ignored by the Government was provided just weeks before the Budget when the Government announced that no action would be taken to reduce protection to manufacturing industry. The cost of this decision to primary producers would be of the order of $450m during 1982-83 or about $50 per producer per week. We on this side of the House all understand the decision relating to the protection of Australia's manufacturing industry but this is a decision that hurts our rural exporters and the rural export industries still account for 45 per cent to 50 per cent of our export earnings. This is a decision that hurts by default, and no offsets are given in the Budget. In return, the Government provided nothing for primary producers in the Budget, not even the prospect of economic recovery. Interest rates remain at record levels but still some producers find the necessary credit difficult to obtain. </PARA>
<PARA> In July the Bureau of Agricultural Economics estimated that the real net value of rural production was likely to fall by a massive 30 per cent during 1982-83. The major contributing factor was an estimated increase in farm costs of 10 per cent in real terms. The worsening drought situation is likely to cause the estimate of the value of production to fall even further, possibly to a level around 35 per cent or even 40 per cent below the 1981-82 level. At the same time , as a direct result of this Budget, farm costs will rise even further. The excise on petrol and diesel fuel has increased to 6.155c per litre. Primary producers are big fuel users, both on-farm and off-farm. In 1979-80 fuel accounted for 8.8 per cent of the total cash costs of all farming industries and that figure is likely to have increased since then. In the fishing industry fuel accounts for 30 per cent to 40 per cent of total cash costs. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the new rebate system being proposed by the Government to replace the certificate system, we find that tuna boat and prawn boat owners will have to find an extra $30,000 a year. They will have to extend their overdrafts by that amount to meet this new arrangement. The exemption from excise duty on diesel fuel for all off-road use will be abolished and replaced by a rebate system. The change is expected to yield $176m in a full year. Presumably the bulk of the $176m will come from the railways, which have lost their excise exemption and will not be eligible for the rebate. Rail charges will increase and primary producers will be among those most severely affected. One estimate, that given by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde), is that freight costs for grain growers will increase by $20m to $30m a year. Other producers of bulk commodities such as sugar and wool will also experience massive hikes in freight charges. The inevitable delays in the rebate system will impose yet further costs on primary producers. Under the new system they will be forced to carry the added cost of fuel until the rebate is paid. For many producers it will necessitate extending overdrafts at a time of record high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already said, among primary producers the largest fuel users are fishermen. Increased costs of fuel will add to the considerable economic difficulties already faced by parts of Australia's fishing industry. The honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) has already pointed out the difficulties being faced by fishermen. My colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) has pointed out the problems for the tourist industry, particularly the off-shore islands in north Queensland. The honourable member for Henty points out that a simple arrangement of colouring the diesel fuel would be a far better way of getting around this problem. Of course, the scheme being proposed by the Government will not prevent abuses-they will occur with the rebate as well-and the number of Customs officers who will have to be employed in the States will be quite enormous. It is quite ill thought through. The administrative costs to the States will be quite large because the States already operate fuel exemptions. The petroleum products freight subsidy has been reduced. Previously freight costs were subsidised where the differential exceeded 0.44c a litre. Now the differential will have to exceed one cent a litre. The slaughter levy on cattle for disease eradication will be increased from $3 to $5 a head. A new series of taxes will be imposed on banking transactions. Telephone charges, as I have already said, will rise. Allowing for the effect of the drought and increased costs, the reduction in the real net value of production for 1982-83 could be as high as 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Government's economic strategy in raising outlined in this Budget does nothing to reverse the declining competitiveness of Australia's export industries. Increasingly, primary producers are confronted with a situation in which their competitiveness is declining as Australia's rate of inflation exceeds that of our major trading partners and competitiors and as the managed exchange rate is unable to be adjusted to offset changes in relative rates of inflation. Inflation is unlikely to be reduced by this Budget, particularly if the drought worsens, given the contribution of food to the consumer price index. The Government has given no signs of a change in its approach to exchange rate management from one based on wishful thinking to one based on economic reality. I will not go through the Budget forecasts of 10.75 per cent inflation, no real growth in the economy, no change in the employment situation, and a rise in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the drought situation. All Australian States and the Northern Territory are now drought affected. New South Wales is in the worst situation, with some areas of that State experiencing their fourth year of drought. It is followed by Queensland and Victoria. Prospects for relief are rapidly diminishing in all areas. In the Budget the government made no allowance for the disastrous situation now confronting many primary producers as a result of the drought. This is a situation from which the Government has tried to extricate itself. As I have said, the Prime Minister saw a droughty sunset, suddenly realised the drought was on, on one of his recent visits to Australia, and undercut the Minister for Primary Industry. Let us look at what the Minister for Primary Industry is saying about the drought. At the Australian Agricultural Council meeting held in Rotorua in New Zealand, where the New South Wales and Victorian Governments requested a review of the drought aid packages and Commonwealth involvement, the Minister for Primary Industry rejected what they were saying. In words of single syllables, he said that they were dills for even raising the matter. The Minister for Primary Industry, in his media release of 18 August, said: that the attitude of the Victorian Premier to drought aid for farmers was utterly unbelievable. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth does not need to make a commitment to help drought affected farmers, because its commitment is already through the natural disaster relief arrangments. </PARA>
<PARA>In an interview on AM on 24 August he said that there was no need to do anything more beyond the existing drought arrangments. In the same interview he said Mr O 'Brien of the drought committee of the Livestock and Grain Producers Association of New South Wales, should be better informed as a farm leader in raising the problems of the drought. This is why the South Australian Liberal Minister for Agriculture said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is amazing that two people, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, and the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, being two Country Party members of the coalition, should have lost touch with the rural community to the extent to which they appear to have done, or that they should be such lightweights in the outfit at the level that they have not been able to convince the Prime Minister and his treasurer to give the rural community a fairer deal. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are some of the things that have been said about the drought before the Budget and after it. As I said, it was only when the Prime Minister realised that a real drought existed that any steps were taken to ameliorate the effects of the drought. The Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) highlighted a $ 10m advance to New South Wales, but this was part of established procedures under the natural disaster relief scheme and did not represent any special treatment for New South Wales. The most pertinent question to be asked here was why no advance was made to Victoria or Queensland. Are the established procedures invoked only when enough noise is made by a State? Funds for the rural adjustment scheme were increased by $2m to $18.4m. At a rough estimate, about 100,000 primary producers are severely affected by drought, spreading the total allocation by this Government-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three ways of approaching an Appropriation Bill such as the one before us. One is to concentrate on those areas where the Budget does not do everything that everybody wants, and obviously no Budget is capable of satisfying every demand that a community makes . Another is to select those parts of the Budget which deliver to elements in the community something close to everything that they want and to concentrate on them, and of course every Budget does that at least to a certain degree. It seems to me that the more sensible way is to place a Budget against the major problems facing the Australian economy at the time. The major problems facing the Australian economy now are, firstly, the stagnant world economy, which harms our export earnings; secondly, the high interest rates, which weaken investment; and thirdly, the rapid growth in wage costs, which hurts both output and employment. All of these factors together affect the standard of living and zest for living of all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is in reality nothing an Australian Budget can really do about the world recession. There is something, although not a great deal, it can do about interest rates, which are largely internationally determined, and there is definitely something it can do about wage costs and therefore the consequence of wage costs. It goes without saying that of these great problems facing the Australian economy the most fundamental one is the world recession-the zero growth in the level of demand in industrialised countries, the falling commodity prices, and the low growth of world trade. As I have said, these factors are outside the influence of a small, open trading economy such as Australia's and therefore outside the influence of his Budget. What we can ask of a Budget and of a Government in this sort of international climate is that they avoid making the situation worse, as the Labor Government made it worse between 1973 and 1975 -of course, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) ignored all of this-by recklessly expanding Government expenditure, recklessly expanding the money supply, recklessly increasing the deficit, and recklessly encouraging a wages explosion. This Budget does avoid those errors.</PARA>
<PARA> We can also expect a government to take steps to maintain confidence and encourage investment so that the economy is prepared to take advantage of a resumption in world economic growth. This the Budget does, especially in its measures against the effect of high interest rates and the dangers of a further wages explosion. We can also expect a Budget to provide help to people who need it in difficult times. This the Budget certainly does for pensioners, single income parents, home buyers, students, veterans, the disabled and the handicapped, families, the unemployed, the sick, and the Aborigines in all those various measures summarised by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his Budget Speech. </PARA>
<PARA> From the international recession I turn to the second major problem to which I referred earlier in my speech, that of high interest rates. These slow down business fixed investment, investment in plant, equipment and buildings, they stop people buying homes, and they make the burden worse for those already paying them off. Yet while interest rates are high overseas they will be high in Australia. They have to be high enough to cover the deficit on current account. At the same time, capital inflow is weakened while the Australian dollar is being devalued, and borrowers run an exchange risk, although this situation may change later in the financial year if devaluation is completed. The Government's ability to manipulate interest rates in these circumstances is obviously limited . It is true that it can have some influence by limiting the deficit, limiting the amount of government borrowing, but as far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned this can easily be overstated since most government borrowing is done by State governments and semi-government authorities. As Table 10 of Budget Paper No. 1 shows, State and local government borrowings for 1981-82 are almost three times larger than Commonwealth public sector borrowing-almost $3 billion as against $1 billion. A reduction of Commonwealth borrowing in these circumstances will have only a small effect. Therefore, in this context of high interest rates, the Commonwealth Government has opted for more direct methods of stimulating investment, in particular its home loan interest rates package and its new depreciation package. The home loan interest rebate will provide significant savings to the taxpayer and will be a real boost to new dwelling construction. The home buyer can claim a rebate at the standard rate on the amount of interest he pays on his housing loan from any source, over 10 per cent on a mortgage up to $60,000. For example, a taxpayer with a $30,000 building society mortgage at 15 per cent will save $450 a year. The Treasurer has also asked the Reserve Bank of Australia to release one per cent of its statutory reserve deposits for housing. This SRD release is in addition to the $400m by which the major banks agreed last week to increase their home lending. </PARA>
<PARA> The housing package makes a valuable attack on the problem of high interest rates as they affect both taxpayers and builders. The depreciation package announced in July will reduce the impact of high interest rates on business and will also stimulate investment. The new concessions allow manufacturing industry to write off plant over three years; the rural sector to write off plant over three years and the mining sector to write off mining equipment over 10 years or the life of the mine. The 2.5 per cent depreciation for commercial buildings is also important especially in the longer term. I said that a Budget, in an internationally integrated economy, can do only a little about high interest rates pending their fall internationally. But what can be done has been done by the housing and depreciation packages. </PARA>
<PARA> A Federal Budget can make a significant impact on the third of the great problems facing our economy-the rapid rise in wage costs. The gravity of this problem is plain for all to see. Average weekly earnings grew by 17 per cent in 1981-82 and real unit labour costs are now, as is shown in Table 8 on page 28 of Budget Paper No. 1, the highest since the disastrous year of 1974-75 and double the costs of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Table 15 in Budget Paper No. 1 shows that our inflation rate was 10.1 per cent at the end of 1981, far higher than the rates of our major trading partners. Japan had an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent, West Germany 5.6 per cent and United States of America 8.9 per cent. This has resulted in a sharp squeeze on profits so that company income fell by 9 per cent in 1981-82 compared with a 21 per cent rise in 1980-81. This squeeze has, in turn, caused a faltering in production, a stagnant employment situation, falling investment in plant and equipment and the erosion of international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet the Budget has taken a major step towards helping to contain wage costs in its package of tax cuts. In the recent wage offensive some unions called for a return to wage indexation. The Budget has not only indexed tax rates but also given tax cuts on top of indexation. As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) pointed out in his speech on the Budget, a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two dependent children, earning $180 a week receives a tax cut of $30 a week which would require a wage increase of $44 a week to equal it and has an effective indexation of about 180 per cent. The taxpayer on $200 a week gets a $ 22.40 tax cut which equals a wage rise of $33 and indexation of 180 per cent. The taxpayer earning $300 a week-average weekly earnings-gets a $17 to $18 tax cut or a 26 per cent wage rise equivalent, which represents over 200 per cent tax indexation. A taxpayer on $400 a week gets a cut of $22.86 or a $42 wage rise equivalent and an effective indexation of 140 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. This table shows that a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two dependent children who, in the year beginning July 1981 was earning as assessable income of $6,000, would, allowing for inflation in the year beginning July 1982, be earning $6,645 with an effective indexation under this Budget of 476.5 per cent. A taxpayer earning $14,000 in the year beginning July 1981 would in the year beginning July 1982 be earning $15,505 with an effective indexation of 210 per cent. A taxpayer earning $16,000 in the year beginning July 1981 would be earning $17,720 in the year beginning July 1982 with an effective indexation of 221 per cent. A taxpayer earning $33,000 in the year beginning July 1981 would be earning $36,547.50 in the year beginning July 1982 with an effective indexation of 121 per cent. So the call for a return to wage indexation has been more than met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said the Budget not only has indexed tax rates effectively but also has given tax cuts on top of that. All individual taxpayers receive cuts but low income earners, families and pensioners receive the biggest cuts. The amount of the tax free income threshold is raised by $400 a year to $4,595. The standard rate of tax is to be reduced from 32c in the dollar to 30c in the dollar. This new 30c rate is to extend to a higher income with an increase of $1,606 to $19, 500 which is the point at which the 46 per cent rate applies. Almost three out of every four taxpayers will be on the new lower standard rate of 30c in the dollar as from 1 November. Pensioners get a special $250 rebate. The spouse and sole parent rebates have been increased by $200 where there are dependent children. Shareholders get a 30.67c in the dollar tax rebate on dividends up to $1,000. Employees will be able to buy shares in their employer's company without being taxed on any benefits arising from the issue price gained under an approved scheme. I have already mentioned the home loan interest rebate. All these concessions will cost the Government over $1.6 billion. As I said it is indexation and more than indexation. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, this can be contrasted with the situation under the 1972-75 Labor Government where there was no indexation and in the three Labor Budgets pay-as- you-earn taxpayers found their tax rates increased by 120 per cent, fuelling the wage explosion of those years-an explosion which is still remembered as one of the great tragedies of our time as far as the Australian economy and its management are concerned. The tax cuts in this Budget remove the need for rapid wage increases. Obviously it is the Government side of a general wages policy. The tax cuts are better than any likely wage increase and will surely be taken into account in wage claims. Despite the rhetoric from the Opposition and from some leaders of the trade union movement I think in the light of this Budget, when it is fully understood and absorbed, the reality as distinct from the rhetoric will be that the trade union movement will recognise the significance of the offer by the Government of the Government side of a general wages policy and we will see one in place. Meanwhile we will get the rhetoric but I believe that the reality will replace that rhetoric in the foreseeable future. I think we are seeing signs of that already. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer also told us in his Budget Speech that the Government will seek to restrain the growth of financial aggregates to a degree consistent with growth in M3 within a range of 9 per cent to 11 per cent for 1982-83. In other words, the growth in money supply will be restrained so as to restrain price growth and, therefore, wage growth. Our competitive edge in world markets will also consequently be improved. Only the most demagogic rhetoricians in public life would claim that Australia can influence the world economy. However, we can take steps to minimise the harmful effects of the world recession on the Australian economy. This Budget, as I said, does that in contrast to what the Labor Government did in the 1973-75 period. But while we can take steps to minimise the harmful effects on the Australian economy, we would be most recklessly demagogic to imply that Australia can take steps to turn the international economy around. Whilst we have a Budget that recognises our inability to influence the world economy in that way, it nevertheless takes real action against the problem of high interest rates-although there is a limit to what can be done it does it-and it takes major action against the wages explosion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a good, useful Budget to bridge the gap until world economic growth is resumed and to prepare Australia to take advantage of that resumed economic growth when it happens. It helps people who need help in these tough times. It is a responsible Budget, increasing expenditure by 13.9 per cent, compared, say, with the famous 1974-75 increase of 46 per cent. The deficit is confined to 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with the famous 1974-75 deficit of 4.2 per cent of GDP. The Budget stimulates investment, restrains wage growth, maintains confidence in the Australian economy and gives help to those in need in these tough times. It may well be that world economic growth will resume sooner than the Budget Papers suggest. There are signs that the international slump has bottomed out and that we are observing the beginnings of recovery in the United States, and the international recovery must begin there. I refer to the fall in the levels of inflation and interest rates, the Wall Street rallies, and the improvement in housing commencements, signs of which are also visible in Australia. It is too early to say with confidence, but if world economic recovery comes next year this Budget will have contributed significantly to positioning the Australian economy to take advantage of it. It may well turn out to be the ideal Budget for an election in Australia next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This year's Budget was introduced in an atmosphere of speculation regarding an early election and its contents did nothing to dampen that speculation. However, its public and media reception has been much less than enthusiastic and must be causing the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser ) to have second thoughts about the course he so obviously intended, even if the recent events and debates regarding corruption in Australia arising from the Costigan report had not caused him a substantial rethink. The Budget attempts to buy votes from the middle group, the group the Government believes it has to win back to retain government. But after seven years in government, with a substantial majority in the House, the Government shows no indication of overcoming the twin malaise of the Australian economy-inflation and unemployment . Indeed, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) indicated an inflation rate, measured by the consumer price index, of 10.7 per cent at June 1982, 4 per cent above the average for all major Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development trading partners. His own figures on unemployment may seem less reliable than those on inflation, but by any measure the figure for unemployment will be in excess of 400,000 for the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government talks of all sorts of financial restraint. Is it not amazing that such a government can use $12,000 of public money, through the Information Services Division of the Department of Administrative Services, to have a commercial polling organisation sample more than 1,000 people in a telephone survey to determine their attitudes to the Budget? Surely this is a straight party political survey. If not, it should, upon its receipt, be reported to the Parliament. It should be on the table already. If honesty does not exist with respect to small amounts how can we expect honesty with respect to larger amounts?</PARA>
<PARA> The media have been quick to point out snags in the Budget. The Treasurer has already indicated that there is a risk of the housing interest policy being abused, allowing advantage to higher income people. He claims that the Government is drafting legislation to correct this. How much confidence does that give us in this Government's Budget? Obviously the scheme is so tottery that as soon as it is introduced we hear talk about it being amended or altered. How well has the Budget been thought through? Will these snags overshadow the desired perception of an election handout Budget? While the housing policy will deal with the interest rates in the housing area, what will the predicted higher interest rates in other areas do to the cash available to the average elector?</PARA>
<PARA> I usually consider most legislative measures from the point of view of the constituents who elect me. Let us consider what the Treasurer sees as the principal features of the Budget and how they operate in these circumstances. The first of his principal features was some personal tax relief and other assistance specifically designed to give maximum help to Australian families, especially those on lower and middle incomes. At first view there seems to be an advantage to my electors. The change in the tax threshold and lowered rates give them some dollars. The increased family allowance for first and second children will assist a number of families. But is this advantage not illusory? The altered tax structure to some extent only rectifies the broken promises over the last seven years. If one repeatedly hits one's head against a brick wall it hurts like hell but it is such a relief when one stops. This Government has treated the electorate so badly in regard to taxation it hopes it can pull a three card trick and make these tax concessions appear to be great ones. They seem good only because such action has been missing for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders how long it is intended that they should continue. We have previously seen this Government give tax concessions and remove them within a six-month period. How much of the tax advantage is eroded by the Treasurer's gentle statement that there are some increases in indirect taxation and a modest broadening of the indirect tax base? Thank God he did not say there were substantial increases and a more than modest broadening because people know how these charges hit them. There are items not in the Budget but which erode-for example, the substantial increase in Telecom Australia charges. That increase is not part of the Budget but it affects the ordinary person in the community. Another item is the one cent per litre increase in the price of petrol. The increase will be two cents per litre from 1 July 1983. In an area such as mine public transport is poor and cars have to be used. </PARA>
<PARA> Prescriptions have increased to $4 an item. What happens to the person who needs a frequent supply of medicines and who may have to get two or three items at a time? For those depraved electors of mine who drink beer and smoke cigarettes, there has been a 15 per cent and 20 per cent increase respectively in the take out of the ordinary bloke's pocket money. Also much more erosion is caused by the new federalism. More and more responsibilities are forced on to State governments and then down to local government to carry out services. Payments to those levels of government from the Commonwealth Government are lagging far behind their responsibilities. Local government, with its wide range of welfare and other services, has to increase its rate charges. After all rates are not a particularly equitable way of taxation. Many State semi-government authorities, such as the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, are having to increase charges because of a lack of finance from specific programs for the deficiencies that exist in the community. Voluntary health insurance funds are forced to ever increasing premiums because hospital fees must be raised by State governments to maintain services in the face of increasing deficits. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional costs for public transport further erode the tax advantage. As I have mentioned, my electorate is poorly served by public transport. Many of my constituents have to use their cars to get to work and they are hit by massive fuel cost increases not because they are using their cars by choice but because they have to do it by necessity. At least there is one bright note in the electorate of Scullin. When I was a member of the State Parliament in the 1960s, the then Liberal Government talked of extending the East Preston tram line. That is all it did for years-talk! The numbers of people who needed this service soared with development in the outer suburbs. The Cain Government has announced the commencement of the first stage of this project and its continuation through the other stages during the 1980s. At least it has done something about it. But for my people, because of all these factors and others, the tax advantage is gone. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the feature of the Treasurer of an increase in job training opportunities and other help for the unemployed? I do not knock this feature per se. Indeed, my support for all such schemes in my area has been unstinting, and local organisations and people will acknowledge this. However one despairs at the end result of job training schemes. There are only a few jobs available for their skills amongst the young unemployed. There is another group of middle-aged unemployed with skills for engineering, furnishing trades, metal trades and so on but there are no jobs. In this House I have previously referred to a survey conducted in the municipality of Whittlesea which showed that for structural and economic reasons there would be no further jobs available for the young in that municipality. No matter how much job training there is it is useless without job creation. That survey indicated that there are many small businesses which might prove to be sources of some extra jobs, but this would mean improving conditions for small business. But nowhere has this Government showed any real initiatives in support of small business. Indeed, it has presided over the demise of more small businesses than any other government in Australian history. It has the cheek to put up small business award schemes. It is no good. What it needs to do to help is to make conditions so that these people can continue in business. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the new bank charges. While they place a burden on many individuals and large businesses, to small businesses they are a deadly expense. Cheques already attract bank service charges, State stamp duty and now a killing Federal tax. Much of the increase in education expenditure does little to improve quality or opportunity in education or even to restore previous levels. Much of the expenditure is directed to job training, which is useless without job creation. It simply keeps young people at school longer, an aimless procedure which is destined for only a brief period to dampen down unemployment figures. The fact that unemployment benefits for persons under 18 years have been increased by a niggardly $4 from $36 to $40 a week-the first increase for 10 years-is another crude attempt to force families to keep youngsters at school . On that sort of unemployment benefit they are neither one thing nor the other.</PARA>
<PARA> What of the aid for the family? There are some welcome changes in the allowances, no matter how belated. What will the result be in children's services? Is innovation undertaken when, say, present pre-school programs feel at risk? They feel at risk, firstly, because of funding and, secondly, because of the breakdown of Federal, State and local government components. I have received many representations from local government authorities and groups on this matter. I think the view of the ordinary person is found in three paragraphs of a letter from the South Morang Pre-School Association, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> We value the service provided by the Kindergarten in our area, particularly the opportunity to be involved in our children's education in the early formative years. We feel that it is the right of every child, both now and in the future to have the opportunity to learn and develop in an environment designed for growth, such as Kindergarten provides. </PARA>
<PARA> Without proper funding, our fees would need to be so high that many families in our area could not afford to send their children to Kindergarten. The service would then only be available to the rich, certainly not a democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA> Victoria has always been in the forefront of pre-school education both in Australia and in the world. We feel that this achievement should not be downgraded, but that our system should be promoted as a successful example of co -operation between community and governments at all levels-local, State and Federal. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter illustrates the breakdown that has occurred and the greater pressures that have been put on local and State government in so many areas. What guarantees do they have from the Government? The Minister of Health in Victoria was forced to write to all bodies which are concerned with pre-school services, pointing out that in the last financial year the Commonwealth's contribution to the running costs of such pre-school services dropped from 60 per cent to an estimated 20 per cent. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been an almost total ending of capital funds from nearly $3m in 1976- 7 to a meagre $5,000 last year. </PARA>
<PARA>He pointed to the failure of the Commonwealth Government to index such grants and give the local and State governments a chance to continue these services. One of my local councils points to this in a letter. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> This Council, like many others in this State, has entered into a partnership with the State Government for the funding and provision of pre-school educational services. The partnership is based on the Council actually providing the service from funds originating from Commonwealth and State sources. The withdrawal or lessening of funds due to policy change or the effects of inflation would have a dramatic effect on this partnership arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the Council makes a telling point about some of the failures in this Budget to appreciate what is going on in the community. Having dealt with those issues, I would like to deal with one that is of particular concern to me. It may seem a little out of place in a general Budget debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) for his courtesy. We hear so much about the drug problem in Australia, about illicit trade in drugs and the effect that it has in the community. We see the action directed essentially to detection. We see the punitive measures to try to prevent drug use. I am appalled at the lack of imagination that is shown in devising measures to stop this problem at its roots. We have royal commissions inquiring into where the drugs come from and who is involved. How much information do we have about what is happening on the ground? I indicate to the House that, for example , in the United States of America a survey has been conducted over the last five years on the incidence of drug use. One of the things that concerns me about that is that the greatest problem-alcohol-has got down to youngsters at primary school. The incidence of smoking is dropping. The use of marijuana, PCP or angeldust, amyl and butyl nitrites and tranquillisers has gone down. There has been a sustained level of use of heroin, barbiturates and LSD amongst young people. The use of opiates other than heroin occurs at a steady level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the increase in the use of amphetamines and speed that concerns me the most. The feedback I get from my own area is that there is an increased use of the amphetamines. There is an increased use of amphetamines by injection. It is obvious that there are inadequate built in mechanisms in the community to warn the young people about what is going on. I raise this matter at the end of my speech on the Budget because I see so much being done-punishment of offenders, about detection, about the criminal element-but nowhere do I see any sort of imaginative program out in the community to teach people what the problem is, what it brings about. If we have a preventive sort of education we reduce the number of drug abusers. We reduce the profits that can be obtained from the increased numbers of users. We help them to solve the problem without all the business of royal commissions inquiring about who we have to punish and where the drugs come from. We have to get out and convince people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the Age of 19 August this year in an article headed 'Canberra Moves on Lone Parents' I read that single parents would have to prove that they could get maintenance before they were granted a pension. As well, maintenance payments of over $6 a week will be counted in the income test. The decision was announced in a one sentence line in the background papers attached to the Budget. The decision says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Existing provisions in the Social Security Act concerning the requirement to take reasonable steps to pursue maintenance action will be reactivated. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not suggesting that the Department of Social Security should not check on who is or is not eligible for benefits or who should or should not be chasing maintenance claims. However, we should not lose sight of some of the difficulties that are attendant upon both applying for and collecting maintenance already granted on a continuing basis. The insecurity of payment of maintenance is a cause of great distress to single parents supporting children. A person may prove an entitlement to the money but collecting it is another matter. If the Government intends to reactivate existing provisions of the Social Services Act to make sure people make every effort to get maintenance I warn that this will create a lot of extra work for departmental officers who are already overloaded and understaffed. It will create also a lot of worry for the recipients of benefits. This Government approach concerning maintenance assumes that the men are not only willing but also able to subsidise the children whom they have fathered. Most people who work in welfare of any kind would agree that this is in direct contrast to their experience and to the experience of the mothers of the children. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Government that it do something more constructive than harassing single parents. It should set up a national maintenance collection agency. This would be a great help to the people trying to collect the maintenance and, incidentally, would save the taxpayers some money. In Western Australia maintenance is collected through the Family Court thus giving direct help to the people relying on that money for survival. In South Australia I understand the maintenance collection is done through the Department for Community Welfare. The point is that it is one thing to apply for maintenance but it is very difficult for the individual not acquainted with court procedure to pursue his or her maintenance claims month after month. We should set up a national maintenance agency through the family courts which are available in every State and Territory and which would have the authority that the individual lacks. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the Budget Papers there seems to be a deliberate attempt to blame the single parent for the increases in the welfare budget. This relates to the fact that there is an ever-increasing number of people whose only access to any income for survival is through the Department of Social Security. I am well aware that the number of people who are now in receipt of supporting parents benefits has increased since the benefit was first introduced in 1974. There are a number of basic reasons for this. One of the reasons, of course, includes rising unemployment which causes tremendous stress and breakdown in families. The Budget has dealt most unfairly with those receiving the supporting parents benefit. Those people, together with the base rate pensioner and the young unemployed, have been almost totally ignored in the Budget. A proper and humane government response to those problems would not be further harassment, crackdown and interference in those people's private lives; it would be the raising of the supporting parent's benefit and pensions and the relaxation of income tests so that parents could bring up their children on a decent standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has, despite its general air of affluence, a growing number of families in poverty and non-functioning array. If this Government is serious about preserving the family unit-that includes the supporting parents as a family unit-it must face the fact that its current policies are failing to guarantee even minimal living standards for every citizen. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has said in his ministerial statement on social security programs that he has sought a solution which as far as possible avoids creating further financial incentives for separation and reduces the incentives for forming new relationships. Is the Minister trying to tell us that people are breaking relationships, marriages and homes so that they can go chasing after these fairly minimal benefits that are provided through the Social Security Department? I think not. I think the Government must give a second thought to the predicament in which these supporting parents find themselves. It is a very difficult thing for a supporting parent to get out and get a job when he or she has young children. What we give them to live on is really not enough to preserve that family unit which is equally as important as the family unit that we are accustomed to that, with two parents in the family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Farmers are up in arms over the method of applying the diesel fuel tax which has recently been announced and the way in which rebates can be claimed. Surely, the Customs and excise people could have come up with a more simplified method. The new system will not, of course, eliminate problems where tax free distillate is made available to transport operators. Honourable members in country electorates are being bombarded with complaints as to the administration of the rebate. It is unwieldly. We all know how farmers do not like administrative work. They work on their farms during the day. They do not want to come home at night to find a lot of paperwork. The onus is on the farmer to keep records. Under the previous method a farm tractor operator made known to the Bureau of Customs the horsepower and the make of the tractor that he was operating. He was issued with a diesel licence from the Bureau of Customs . In most cases these licenses were left with the local oil distributor. When he made deliveries to the farm he left an invoice with the diesel licence noted on it. When he had diesel lorries he purchased a certain amount of fuel which was duty paid. Customs officers visited country areas and called on the distributors to check their books. In many instances legal action was taken where it was found that transport operators were using a farmer's diesel licence. This went on for some 18 months or two years and then, for some unknown reason, the inspectors ceased coming. This is one of the reasons why the system was open to fraud and no doubt is one of the reasons why the Government lost $40m revenue. Operators were found to be purchasing distillate on farm diesel licences. The new system will require policing as unscrupulous people may still claim the rebate on fuel, which could still be sold to transport operators. It will in no way stop this practice. It will cost huge sums of money to administer and police the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another very serious aspect of this legislation is that fuel distributors will have to find another 20 per cent more capital to handle this sytem. That is, they will have to find 6.155c per litre. We know what distillate fuel big farming operators purchase, and the local oil distributor has to find this capital. The farmer then makes application for a rebate from the Bureau of Customs. The rebate will be claimed by the farmer and paid to his account. The distributor will not get it. Accounts that are now financed by the oil distributors, not the distributor himself, will get the rebate. Where an oil distributor is financing a farmer because of the farmer's lack of finance, the rebate will be paid into the farmer's bank account and the distributor will miss out. This is a very serious aspect of the legislation, and feel it has not been given full consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, the new system will require a huge sum of money to administer. Surely it is not too late to review the rebate situation and the whole operation of diesel fuel tax. This is a serious situation. It is causing great problems to all concerned, not only to farmers but also to the fisheries industry and oil distributors. I believe that the Bureau of Customs has let us down in this instance, and the matter should be looked at as soon as possible. The Bureau of Customs has advised the Government on this matter. The Government ought to have another look into the matter. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Did South African surfers compete in a surf carnival held in Sydney on Saturday, 25 April 1981; if so, (a) how many took part, (b) what were their names, (c) what official Australian travel documents were they using and (d) when were those documents issued?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr Street</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Three members of the team were South African citizens. One other member of the team was an Irish citizen.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Bruce Jackson, Shaun Tomson, David Hansen, Mark Price.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Jackson, Tomson and Hansen were travelling on South African passports and Price on an Irish passport.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Mr Bruce Jackson was issued a visitor's visa for entry to Australia on 29 October 1980. Mr David Hansen was issued a visitor's visa on 16 January 1981. Mr Shaun Tomson was issued a temporary resident visa on which he entered Australia on 26 February 1981. Mr Mark Price was issued a visitor's visa on 20 January 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I have been advised that the South African flag was flown at the event. This is a matter for regret as such action conveyed the false impression that the South Africans competed as national representatives. I emphasise that they were not here as representatives. I emphasise that they were not here as representatives of their country, but as individual competitors.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am not aware of the substance of conversations between journalists and the competition organisers.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Government's policy on sporting contracts with South Africa and its commitment to the Gleneagles Agreement is well known.</PARA>
<PARA> Since 1975 the Government, in common with its predecessor, has actively discouraged sporting contracts with South Africa. Such a policy has been in accordance with both United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/6 of November 1976 and the Gleneagles Declaration agreed to at the November 1977 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.</PARA>
<PARA> The main practical restriction has been on the entry of South African sportsmen into Australia. Thus, while sports in South Africa are organised on the basis of race, colour or ethnic origin</PARA>
<PARA> (a) sporting teams or groups of sportsmen domiciled in South Africa will not be granted entry to compete in Australia, irrespective of whether or not they intend to represent South Africa or any South African organisation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) individual sportsmen domiciled in South Africa will not be granted entry to compete in Australia as representatives of South Africa or any South African organisation;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) individual sportsmen intending to compete in Australia as private individuals and not as representatives of South Africa or of any South African organisation will be considered for entry on a case-by-case basis;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) applications by officials of South African sporting organisations seeking to enter Australia as visitors will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</PARA>
<PARA>While the Government does not place restrictions on travel abroad by Australian citizens or seek to impose its views on sporting bodies and sportsmen, it looks to them to take into account, in making their decisions, the policies it has enunciated and its reason for them.</PARA>
<PARA> Following the 1977 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to all national sporting organisations in Australia forwarding to each a copy of the Gleneagles Declaration and reiterating to them Australia's undertaking to discourage sporting contacts with South Africa or with any other country practising racial discrimination in sport.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also circulated to national sporting bodies in Australia a statement of the practical application of this policy, drawing their attention to the United Nations Resolution 31/6 of November 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1978, national sporting associations were informed that it would not be in accordance with Government policy for Government grants to be used to facilitate sporting contacts with South Africa, whether such contacts took place in Australia, South Africa or elsewhere.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to the findings of a study by the economic research department of the Commercial Banking Company which states that the average debt for a member of the Australian workforce was $5174 at the end of the 1979-80 financial year.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6I4">Mr Macphee</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I thank the honourable member for drawing my attention to the study on household debt by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. The study, in addition to putting forward a measure of gross household sector debt per member of the labour force, makes mention of the fact that the household sector overall is a net lender to other sectors of the economy. In other words, household sector gross indebtedness is more than offset by household sector savings-though of course some people in the household sector are net debtors.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government is well aware of the fact that there are a number of net debtors in the household sector. At the same time, as mentioned above, the household sector overall is a net lender to other sectors which means that there are also a large number of individuals in the household sector who are net savers. In framing its policies therefore the Government has to achieve a balance between the sometimes competing interests of existing and potential borrowers and those of household savers. It is in the interests of both groups that inflation be reduced and a more stable financial environment be established and this is the primary aim of the Government's economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. The study on household debt estimates that approximately two-thirds of the outstanding debt of the household sector as at June 1980 was in respect of housing loans. It therefore appears that the main reason why individuals in the household sector are incurring debt is to purchase a home.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) No universally accepted definition or set of criteria for determining pain in animals exists. In practice, the judgment of levels of pain and stress in animals has to be based on the clinical experience and commonsense of the research worker. Indicators such as struggling, excessive vocalisation, convulsions or severe palpitations assist in the recognition of pain. Other measureable parameters would include dilated pupils, increased blood pressure, increased heart and respiration rates and sweating.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) No. In some case, pain and discomfort for the animal are unavoidable but are minimised wherever possible. In some situations, the animals are painlessly killed as soon as practicable to avoid suffering. When it is known from past experience that a particular experiment or activity will cause a state of pain or it is judged that a new procedure is likely to cause pain, the animal is anaethetised to the maximum extent possible. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and all Government organisations involved in experiments on animals in the A.C.T . abide by the joint National Health and Medical Research Council/Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation 'Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals in Research in Australia').</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr Carlton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some health insurance organisations can experience adverse financial circumstances from time to time. This can be due to a number of factors such as: higher utilisation of services (and payment of benefits) at certain times in the year; increases in levels of charges (and payment of benefits) before time is available to adjust contribution rates correspondingly; lags in contribution payments, Christmas/New Year holiday break. However with good management practices and planning, efficient organisations can provide for these circumstances and take corrective action. It is not unusual for different types of undertakings to experience adverse financial circumstances from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore it is inappropriate to establish that at any point in time such-and- such organisations are experiencing 'financial problems'.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department is particularly concerned with the preservation of the interests of contributors. It regularly monitors the financial situation of registered health insurance organisations to ensure that possible financial difficulties are detected at an early stage. Corrective action can be taken to ensure their financial viability or, in particular cases where the contributor profile and drawing rates show longer term problems, to discuss amalgamation with a kindred registered organisation.</PARA>
