<PARA>That this house expresses its deep regret at the death on 20 July 1982 of the Honourable Norman John Oswald Makin, A.O., a member of this House for the Division of Hindmarsh from 1919 to 1946, Speaker from 1929 to 1931, member for the Division of Sturt from 1954 to 1955, member for the Division of Bonython from 1955 to 1963, a Minister of the Crown during the Second World War, Ambassador to the United States of America from 1946 to 1951, President of the Security Council of the United Nations in 1946 and 1947, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>All of us were saddened to learn of the death of Norman Makin on 20 July. Norman Makin served Australia in a large number of capacities with great distinction. In his maiden speech in this House on 20 March 1920 Mr Makin spoke of his intention to further the interests of this country and to further its general prosperity and progress. He worked to this end in and out of the Commonwealth Parliament with distinction for the next 62 years. It is a proud record. </PARA>
<PARA> In his last speech in this place in October 1963 he returned to that same theme of the need to build Australia up, saying that the Australian people had the capacity and the courage to continue to build up their country. Norman Makin was born on 31 March 1889 at Petersham in New South Wales. He was educated at the Central Public School in Broken Hill and in 1918 was elected President of the South Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party. He was first elected a member of the House of Representatives, representing Hindmarsh, in 1919. When Mr Scullin became Prime Minister in 1929 Norman Makin was elected Speaker of this House. As Speaker he was committed to this institution and was well respected by all who came in contact with him. </PARA>
<PARA> Norman Makin also served with distinction on a number of committees of the House. From 1922 to 1925 he was a member of the Commonwealth delegation to the Empire Parliamentary Association in the United Kingdom. In 1937 he was a member of the delegation which visited that country for the coronation of King George VI. He was also a member of the Standing Orders Committee from 1932 to 1946 and from 1956 until his retirement from this Parliament in 1963. During the Second World War, Norman Makin was a member of the Australian Advisory War Council from October 1940 to 1945. He served as Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions from 1941 to 1946, during which time he presided over the rapid expansion of the Royal Australian Navy. He was Minister for Aircraft Production from 1945 to 1946. In 1946 he resigned from the House of Representatives to become Australia's first Ambassador to the United States, remaining in that post until 1951. In 1946 and 1947 he was also the first president of the Security Council of the United Nations. In both posts, he was able to serve this nation and the cause of international peace and security with great distinction. </PARA>
<PARA> In the general election of 1954 Norman Makin was re-elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Sturt. Following a redistribution of seats in the year following, he was elected as the member for Bonython and retained that seat until his retirement from Parliament in 1963. He gave many years of devoted service to this House and to Australia. He was a Minister, Speaker, a member of the House for many years and our ambassador in a post which was and still is of vital importance to our interests. Above all, he was a man who was intensely proud of Australia and of the movement he so ably represented. He was awarded the Order of Australia in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Norman Makin is survived by two sons. His wife, Ruby, predeceased him. On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, I extend my sympathies to his family. The life of Norman Makin is one of the great examples of an Australian who has served this country throughout more than a century. He did it in a way which was dedicated and which earned the respect of all those who came in touch with him. I was in this House when he was still here and I was privileged to know him. I valued his friendship as I am sure did all members of the House of which he was a part. He was one of those people from whom, I think, we could all profit and learn in certain times. I doubt that I ever heard words spoken in anger or bitterness by Norman Makin in making speeches in this Parliament. He put forward his views with strength but, at the same time, with a sense of moderation and a sense of understanding that this institution and the country it represents are much more important than any one of us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in expressing condolences to the surviving members of the family of the late Norman Makin. It is a matter of melancholy circumstance that has us today expressing condolences to those surviving members of the late Norman Makin's family. Norman Makin I recall vividly on my entry to this Parliament 21 years ago. He was a man of considerable distinction physically. The measured diction with which he delivered his addresses to this Parliament, a steady commitment to principle, in spite of a long life of service in public affairs and in spite of the many frustrations and disappointments which must have confronted him over that period, and a practical idealism were the ingredients which, it seemed to me, went to make up the late Norman Makin in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Norman Makin served this country well. He served it for long periods and on two occasions in the national Parliament. He served it elsewhere at international forums. At all times a steadiness of purpose guided him in the discharge of his duty and public service. He was a man of great principle and, in the period during which I knew him in the national Parliament, he gave great encouragement, indeed fatherly encouragement, to the younger members who came into this institution. He was a man who by his physical courage-a courage by the way in which he projected his views by the moderation with which he expressed himself- was an inspiration to all who worked with him. His vivacity of interest in the political affairs of this country-a vivacity of interest which went well above party commitments on many occasions-stayed with him until the end of his life. I still vividly recall meeting him in Adelaide during the 1980 election campaign at the major rally which the Labor Party conducted in that capital city. His involvement then was as passionate in its commitment as it was when he was a youth. I suppose the thing which struck me most of all as I listened to him on many occasions speaking in this House and as I frequently and clearly recall those occasions was the way in which the man expressed himself. He clearly conveyed that his feelings were steeped in a sincerity which was unassailable. </PARA>
<PARA> His record of service to this country, like the achievements of the governments in which he held prominent positions, speaks proudly for itself. He entered Parliament in 1919 when its meeting place was in Melbourne. He served as Speaker during the period of the Scullin Government. He was the first Speaker to shun the gown and wig, preferring a distinguished black suit and bow tie, I am informed, and proudly boasting that he 'did not need a mace to control the Parliament'; a proud boast which would be resorted to with greater caution these days, I expect, Mr Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> Prime Minister Curtin appointed him to the crucial wartime post of Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions. He was a War Cabinet member and a member of the Production Executive of Cabinet. He also served as a member of the Australian Advisory War Council from 1940 to 1945. In 1946 Norman Makin became the first President of the United Nations Security Council. Following service as Minister for Aircraft Production under both Forde and Chifley, Prime Minister Chifley appointed him the first Australian Ambassador to the United States of America. His contribution within our Party, the Australian Labor Party, was equally commendable and just as enduring. He served as President of the South Australian Branch of the Party from 1918 to 1919, and was Secretary of the Parliamentary Labor Party from 1928 to 1929 and from 1934 to 1941. He served for a time also as Federal President of the Party. </PARA>
<PARA> His character was suited to the many overseas roles entrusted to him-from ambassador to his membership of the Far Eastern Commission, and his governorship of the International Bank in Washington. He established easy and often quite personal relationships with such eminent figures as the late President Truman, Nelson Rockefeller, General Marshall, Governor Dewey, Eleanor Roosevelt and a range of other people who in their own way had been instrumental in changing or influencing the course of history. </PARA>
<PARA> The late Norman Makin was a noted lay preacher but he well respected the frailty of human nature. I was attracted to the obvious quality of the man of never being a moraliser, even though he was devoted, quite obviously, to the belief in the perfectability of man and society if ideals were established and pursued with generosity and sincerity. His services to the United States, to the Australian Parliament and to the Australian people exemplify that commitment in practice. The Australian Labor Party remembers Norman Makin with warm admiration and it extends deepest sympathy to his sons, Lloyd and Harold.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -On behalf of the members of the National Country Party I would like to join in the very fine tributes that have been paid to our late colleague Mr Norman Makin , A.O. I knew Norman Makin in this House. I also knew him long before I became a member of this House. My association goes back to the time when as a very young schoolboy my parents brought me to Canberra. We lived in the Kurrajong Hotel. Norman Makin then had a young family and everbody lived as a very happy group in either the Hotel Canberra or the Kurrajong. We lived in the Kurrajong. There was no going home at the weekends. It was just one great community with everybody relying on and getting to know each other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember Norman Makin as a real gentleman. He was a very dedicated, very sincere person. He certainly was the elder of this House at the time of his retirement. I think that to reach the fine age of 93 dispels all the theories that politicians die early. The fact that he was a very good Methodist and did not drink or smoke probably added considerably to his life span. His lay background was exhibited in the way he behaved in this Parliament, in his approach to carrying out his responsibilities as a member of parliament and in his sincerity towards the Australian Labor Party, to which he had devoted his life. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall Norman Makin having onerous responsibilities during the war years as Minister for the Navy and then as Minister for Aircraft Production. As a boy I recall going to Garden Island for the opening of the new dock. It was Norman Makin's efforts that led to the building of that dock and he opened it on that occasion. He was a man with a most distinguished record. Very few Australians will ever achieve the record that he achieved of 36 years in Parliament, two of them as Speaker, having held a number of portfolios. He was appointed the first Australian Ambassador to Washington. During that period he was made the first President of the Security Council of the United Nations. For anybody to have that sort of record is noteworthy and something for all of us to be proud of. Certainly this is an occasion on which to pay a tribute to him and to express sympathy to his family at the loss of a great Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join earlier speakers-the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), and the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony)-in expressing condolences to Lloyd and Harold and to their wives Pauline and Colleen and their children. I say at the outset that, had he been here, certainly the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), who was a life-long and close personal friend of Norman Makin, would have wished to join in these condolences, as would every Australian Labor Party member who has retired from this Parliament, including Clyde Cameron, Jim Toohey , Clem Ridley, Fred Birrell, Martin Nicholls, Reg Bishop, Jim Cavanagh-all people who worked with Norman over a long period of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Norman Makin was one of the greatest sons of the Australian working class. He was born at Petersham in New South Wales in 1889. He attended the Central Public School in Broken Hill. He was a pattern maker by trade and a member of the Australasian Society of Engineers. He entered the Parliament in 1919 at the age of 30 and he was the member for Hindmarsh until 1946. During that time he saw the transfer of the Parliament from Melbourne to Canberra. He often said that his first view of this place was from the earthworks under the floor before even one brick had been laid upon another. As has already been said, he was also Speaker of the House. He was a member of the War Cabinet from 1941 to 1946. As Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions from October 1941 to August 1946 he helped expand the Royal Australian Navy from a total strength of 16 ships at the beginning of the war to 350 ships at the completion of the war. He was also Minister for Aircraft Production from February 1945 to August 1946 and Acting Minister for External Affairs in 1945. </PARA>
<PARA> He resigned from the Parliament in August 1946 upon being appointed the first Australian Ambassador to the United States when Australia upgraded its diplomatic representation from a legation. Not only was he Australia's chief delegate to the United Nations, but also he became the first President of the United Nations Security Council. He was also a member of the Far Eastern Commission and Governor of the International Bank in Washington. Following the termination in 1951 of his appointment as Ambassador to the United States, he returned to South Australia and in 1954 ran for the seat of Sturt and was successful. After a redistribution, he transferred to the newly-created seat of Bonython, which he won and held at two subsequent elections. </PARA>
<PARA> Norman Makin eventually retired from politics in 1963. He accepted very few honours-a Doctorate of Laws, membership of the Order of Australia, a United Nations Peace Medal and a certificate from the Methodist Church commending him for 70 years of lay preaching. He served his party as South Australian President , as Secretary to the Australian Labor Party in the House of Representatives, and was the first South Australian to become Federal President of the Party he loved. He served the people of three electorates for a total of 36 years in Parliament, the country for five of those years in the war Cabinet, and the international community for a further five years as diplomat and statesman. </PARA>
<PARA> Right up until the time of his death Norman Makin took an interest in the activities of the party. He always insisted on paying at every function to which he was invited. At every election and by-election until the time of his death Norman Makin forwarded a cheque to the Labor Party office to help its campaign funds. He was an outstanding person. He was dearly loved by everybody within the Labor Party, which is not an easy achievement, and he leaves behind him great warmth in the party. People will have great memories of Norman Makin. Very few of us will be able to emulate the great achivements of this wonderful person. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Politics generates its own distinctive misconceptions, and in the vanguard of those misconceptions is the view held by many people outside Parliament that personal friendships cannot be formed where there are political differences. I trust that it is the common experience of all of us in this Parliament to identify that as a misconception. Probably it is just as well that that is so because unrelieved conflict is not an emancipating element in the democratic process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Norman Makin left this Parliament he came to me-he always addressed me as 'James'-and said: 'I want to give you something.' I said: 'What is that?'. He gave me the bound volumes of the Convention Debates. It was a very generous gift , a very valuable gift. In one of the volumes, in what I can describe only as copperplate writing, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> To The Hon. D. J. Killen, LL.B, Minister for Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> In acknowledgment of a warm personal friendship and with my highest regard. </PARA>
<PARA>NORMAN MAKIN  (Former Austalian Ambassador to the USA, and Minister of the Crown .)</PARA>
<PARA>He could have presented those volumes to scores of libraries and they would have been very welcome. Indeed, he could have given them to many of his colleagues who shared his political views, but he gave them to a person who did not share his political views. It was, I regard, a very generous expression of friendship.</PARA>
<PARA> He held strong political views and he held strong social views, and this is no paradox. His early life was not easy. He had a strong personal commitment to the Christian faith and he held a strong commitment to the Christian ethic. Integrity and honour, to Norman Makin, were not some curious estates to be treated in a very casual fashion. They were very precious estates. To illustrate just that I will tell a story which, I suspect, has never been told before. When Norman Makin was Ambassador to the United States the then Prime Minister Menzies visited the United States and Makin accompanied him to the White House to visit President Truman. After discussion of a quarter of an hour or so, he turned to Prime Minister Menzies and said: 'I have no doubt you will be wanting to discuss matters of great confidence', and he rose to leave. Menzies put his hand on Makin's arm and said to him: 'I have no secrets from you.'. </PARA>
<PARA> Norman Makin had a distinctive record of parliamentary service. It is incredible to think that a few of us sat in this House with a man who sat in the Parliament when it met in Melbourne. His political experience was immense. When in Adelaide I would visit him, and his interest was maintained to the end. He would recall with vigour past events and past political figures. He had an inquiring mind as to what was going on in politics today. On the occasion of his ninety-third birthday I sent a message to him and I received a letter in reply. I shall read it to the House. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> My dear James,</PARA>
<PARA> If my thoughts could be 'minted sovereigns', you and your dear wife Joy would be millionaires. I am enriched in my feelings by the most gracious and generous telegram of congratulation and good wishes on the occasion of my ninety-third birthday anniversary. </PARA>
<PARA> You are both regal in the gifts of friendship that so crowns these my senior years with golden thoughts of the years that have been and for the years still to be for me. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours ever to be with respect and goodwill, Norman Makin. </PARA>
<PARA>The words of Robert Browning come back. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Grow old along with me!</PARA>
<PARA> The best is yet to be,</PARA>
<PARA> The last of life, for which the first was made:</PARA>
<PARA> Our times are in His hand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to join briefly in this motion of condolence. Norman Makin was older than the party which he served for most of his life-a life that is now inextricably entwined in the history of that party. He could recall the election of the first ever Labor Government with an absolute parliamentary majority-that of the Verran Government in South Australia in 1910. He was a member of this House for 37 years and four months, the third longest serving member in its history, representing in turn the seats of Hindmarsh, Sturt and Bonython. He served under every Federal Labor leader to date except the first three and the last two. He remained until his death at the age of 93 actively and passionately concerned with the party to which, with his Methodism, he had dedicated his life. I regret that I had only a minor acquaintance with his vast fund of reminiscence, anecdote and legend about the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Others have already enumerated the high offices in which Norman Makin served this nation. I will only note, Mr Speaker, that out of that range of offices he most preferred your office. He once wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> My favourite position was the Speakership of the Parliament. It seemed to lift the occupant right above the contentions of politics. </PARA>
<PARA>This concern about the contentions of politics was a life-long theme for Norman Makin. Although he never flinched from the hurly-burly of politics, as is evidenced by his 37 years in this place, and although he always remained staunch in his convictions, he deprecated the animosity of political life. In 1931 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The reason why politicians do not get on better with each other is because they will not try to understand one another. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps there are lessons for all of us here. Despite his achievements he remained always a very humble and very approachable man, seeking neither rewards nor honours for his service. Although he became the grand old man of South Australian Labor, his retention to the very end of an extraordinary youthful and zestful outlook on life enabled him easily to span the half century or more that frequently separated him from his conversational companions. I hope the day will come when this Parliament will honour him by renaming the seat of Bonython after its first and greatest member. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a small contribution to the tributes to the late Norm Makin. I wish to pay a tribute for a number of reasons. I pay tribute to Norm Makin the member for Hindmarsh; to Norm Makin, the unionist; to Norm Makin, the statesman; and to Norm Makin, the local preacher. I was privileged to know Norm Makin initially through the trade union movement. He was a member of the South Australian branch of which I was the State Secretary. Just recently I attended a function in the company of Clyde Cameron and Norm Makin. I consider it a great privilege to have known the man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Norm Makin was elected to the House of Representatives for the Federal seat of Hindmarsh in 1919. He was re-elected on a number of occasions-in 1922, 1925, 1928, 1929, 1931, 1934, 1937, 1940 and 1943. He resigned in 1946. However, he re -entered Parliament in 1954, representing the seats of Sturt and, later, Bonython, in 1955, 1958 and 1961. I know that the electors of Hindmarsh, of all political persuasions, would wish to record their thanks to Norm Makin for the care and attention he gave to their representations. </PARA>
<PARA> Hindmarsh was well served by Norm Makin. On behalf of the people of Hindmarsh I say: 'Well done and thank you'. Norm Makin was a proud and loyal unionist, a member of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union. He joined what was then the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, known as the ASE, in July 1911 and was a pattern maker by trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Norm Makin was born at Petersham, New South Wales, in 1889. His early life was spent in Broken Hill, where he became proficient as a metalworker. Trade union values and traditions were clearly a part of Norm Makin's life. He never lost those values and traditions. Speaking on the Supply Bill, in the House of Representatives on 4 March 1920, Norm Makin referred to an increase of 50 per cent over a period of eight months in the price of boots. In response to an interjection suggesting that people would end up with bare feet, Norm Makin said :</PARA>
<PARA> I have seen bare feet already, and I know that children from some families are sent to school without the necessary food because the bread-winners are not receiving an adequate wage to meet the exorbitant cost of living. I can cite a case of one man, a Government employee in South Australia, with a wife and nine children. He is in receipt of the minimum wage. He desires to conserve their interests and to be a faithful husband and father. I said to him, 'I suppose you will be attending the Eight Hours celebrations tomorrow?' but he replied, 'No, I will not be able to do so.' I said, 'Surely you are a good unionist, a good labourite?' 'Yes', he responded. 'I am that, without doubt', but where I am unable to take my wife and children I am not prepared to go myself'. I pointed out that there was nothing in connection with the Eight Hours celebrations that should hinder him from taking his family to witness them, to which he answered, 'Of course not, but the fact is that I am unable to provide my children with shoes and stockings in order to make them presentable enough to go into the city .'</PARA>
<PARA>Norm Makin went on to point out that at that time that was not an isolated case.</PARA>
<PARA> Norm Makin retained his union membership right to the end. He never faltered in his passionate defence of the working class, the trade unions and the Australian Labor Party. He was proud of the Labor movement and the Labor movement is proud of Norm Makin. Norm Makin was a statesman. The Australian Parliament has seen, and will see, many politicians but few statesman. I doubt that we shall see statesmen of the calibre of Norm Makin. His many roles included Speaker of the House, member of the Advisory War Council, and Cabinet Minister with many important portfolios such as those of Navy and Munitions. </PARA>
<PARA> On the international post-war scene he was the first President of the United Nations Security Council and the Australian Ambassador to the United States from 1946 to 1951. Norm Makin was recently awarded the Order of Australia-a somewhat belated but appropriate recognition of the quality of his service to the nation. Norm Makin, statesman, earned his place in Australian history. Norm Makin, local preacher, served for 75 years. In the early 1920s, when the Federal Parliament was still meeting in Melbourne, Norm Makin was much sought after by suburban churches as a preacher on special occasions. Recently he was awarded a certificate for completing 70 of those years as a local preacher in his church. Norm Makin has earned his place in Australian history. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 14 July of the Right Honourable Sir Philip McBride, P.C., K.C.M.G., a member of this House for the Division of Grey from 1931 to 1937, a senator for South Australia from 1937 to 1944 and a member of this House for the Division of Wakefield from 1946 to 1958, a Minister of the Crown for 11 years; places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>All honourable members were saddened to learn of the death on 14 July of Sir Philip McBride. Sir Philip was born on 18 June 1892 and was educated at Burra Public School and later at Prince Alfred College in Adelaide. He was first elected to this House for the Division of Grey at the general election of 1931. Sir Philip was re-elected to this House in 1934 and, subsequently, in October 1937 was chosen by the South Australian Parliament to fill a casual vacancy in the Senate. He was re-elected to a full term in the Senate commencing in 1938 but was defeated at the general election of 1943. In 1946 Sir Philip was re- elected to this House as the member for Wakefield and retained his seat at the general elections of 1949, 1951, 1954 and 1955. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Philip began his ministerial career in the first Menzies Ministry as Assistant Minister for Commerce from April 1939 to October 1941. He was later Minister for Supply and Development and Minister for Munitions from 1940 to 1941 . He was also a member of the War Cabinet during this time. Sir Philip was, in fact, the last surviving member of that first Menzies Ministry which led Australia through the early years of the Second World War. Following the return of the Menzies Government in 1949, Sir Philip resumed his ministerial career as Minister for the Interior from 1949 to 1950. In 1950 he was appointed Minister for Defence and retained that post until his retirement from Parliament in 1958. Sir Philip was also actively involved in politics outside the Parliament. He was a member of the United Australia Party when he was first elected to this Parliament and played an important role at the time of the establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia, and after his retirement from this House he maintained his involvement with politics and was Federal President of the Liberal Party from 1960 to 1965. Sir Philip also made a valuable contribution as a pastoralist and served as president of the Stockowners Association of South Australia. He was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1953 and a Privy Councillor in 1959. </PARA>
<PARA> Norman Makin and Sir Philip McBride were both born before the formation of the Commonwealth of Australia. They lived through two world wars and saw vast changes throughout the time they were in public life, and indeed before. I think it does not hurt us to recall at times the changes of which they were a part and which they helped to guide. They both had a wealth of history which is beyond the living memory of the current members of this House and an experience that few of us will ever attain. Again, it is a demonstration of the very great service that has been given to this Parliament and to the people of Australia by people who have served the major part of their lives in this institution. On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, I express sympathy to Sir Philip's widow and two surviving sons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and on behalf of the Opposition express condolences to the surviving members of the late Sir Philip McBride's family; that is, to Lady McBride and their two sons. The late Sir Philip McBride gave long and distinguished service to this Parliament. He served in it for 27 years and represented the seats of Grey and Wakefield. In the period during which he served in this Parliament he gave public service as Minister of the Crown in the portfolios of Commerce, Army, Supply and Development, Munitions, and again later in the Menzies Government in Army, Navy and Defence. Up to his retirement from politics he served his party as Federal President of the Liberal Party of Australia-for five years to 1965. He was of course a close associate of the late Sir Robert Menzies for some 30 years-indeed from the time of the formation of the Liberal Party. In that formation he played an instrumental and valuable role . According to all accounts he was known for his down to earth approach to politics, and at the same time for his patient behind the scenes work in influencing Liberal Party organistion and policy-making methods. He gave, through these instruments, a quiet strength to his party, especially at times of strain, and functioned as an effective resolver of tensions, especially in situations where fissures were threatening. He is survived by Lady McBride and two sons. He was aged 90 years at his death. He gave long service to this Parliament and enjoyed a long and fruitful life. We express our condolences to the surviving members of his family.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I would like to pay tribute to Sir Philip McBride and to express sympathy to Lady McBride and her two sons on his death. Sir Philip was very greatly respected in this Parliament. He was of immense importance to the Liberal Party organisation and he was greatly respected as a man. At the time of my entering this Parliament he was Minister for Defence. He held that position with great distinction. I think he was aptly described as man Friday in the Menzies Cabinet -a man who always adopted a low profile approach to questions but who seemed to wield very considerable influence. He was a practical, down to earth man who held great status. His point of view was always regarded as being sound. I found him a modest man-perhaps he was a shy man-but he was always totally responsible and totally conscious of his responsibilities as a member of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir Philip served in many roles in both Houses of this Parliament, the House of Representatives and the Senate, and was a member of Sir Robert Menzies' first post-war Ministry. I am told that until his death in July he was the last surviving member of the Menzies' first post-war Cabinet. He was a man one looked up to and admired. He kept active after his retirement. He was very prominent in business and within the pastoral interests of South Australia. On many occasions I had the opportunity to have discussions and exchange points of view with him. He was a man to be remembered, to be missed; a man one could easily love and respect. Therefore, I express sympathy to his family and to his friends. </PARA>

I did not sit in this House with Sir Philip McBride; at that time I was in the State Parliament. My early memory of the greatness of the man as it affected me at that time was the tremendous trust and faith that the Premier of South Australia, Sir Thomas Playford, and the Honourable Mr McBride had in each other. I believe it was a very important facet of the trust that existed in those days between the State Government and the Federal Government, a trust which, to paraphrase the words of an earlier speaker, it is not always easy for one party to place in another. I believe he made a significant input into my State of South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 22 June of Sir John McLeay, K.C.M.G, M.M., a member of this House for the division of Boothby from 1949 to 1966, and Speaker from 1956 to 1967, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, we were saddened to learn of the death of one our our former colleagues, Sir John McLeay, on 22 June. Sir John McLeay was one of a number of notable members who entered the House of Representatives as part of the first Liberal Government under Sir Robert Menzies in 1949. He served in this place until 1966 and held office as Speaker for a record term of ten and a half years. Throughout his lifetime Sir John and his family served this country with distinction. His brother George was a senator and Minister in the early Menzies governments and his son John succeeded him in the seat of Boothby on his retirement and also served as a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John McLeay was born on 19 November 1893 at Port Clinton, South Australia. He was educated in that town and at Unley Central School. Later he took a commercial course at Muirden College. In 1915, after the outbreak of the First World War, Sir John enlisted in the first Australian Imperial Force and served in France with distinction as a stretcher bearer in the 13th Field Ambulance. He was awarded the Military Medal at Villiers-Bretonneux. Throughout his life Sir John maintained an active interest in veterans' affairs, being a past president of the South Australian Legacy Club and a past member of the board of the Returned Services League. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir John McLeay was well versed in government before he was elected to this chamber as member for Boothby in 1949, having served in both local government and in the South Australian Parliament. He was a councillor of the Unley City Council for a long period from 1925, was Mayor of that city and served as a member for Unley in the South Australian Parliament. He was also a councillor of the Adelaide City Council and the Lord Mayor of Adelaide from 1946 to 1950. As a member of the House of Representatives Sir John served on the Privileges Committee from 1950 to 1956 and was Chairman of that Committee from 31 August 1954. He was Temporary Chairman of Committees from 27 August 1952 until he succeeded the late Archie Cameron as Speaker on 29 August 1956. </PARA>
<PARA> It is as Speaker that Sir John McLeay is best remembered. Indeed in the decade in which he served as Speaker he became almost an institution in the chair, carrying out that role, as Harold Holt said at the time of Sir John's retirement , in a way which preserved the dignity of the House and its stature. The late Arthur Calwell, when congratulating Sir John on achieving a record term as Speaker on 12 November 1964, said that had the Opposition won the 1961 elections it would have kept Sir John as Speaker and even allowed him to wear his wig. Sir John McLeay gave great and meritorious service to Australia through a very long lifetime in many offices. He served in all levels of government with great distinction and with great honour. On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia I extend my sympathy to Sir John's family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in extending condolences to the surviving members of the late Sir John McLeay's family-his son John, now Consul- General in Los Angeles, his son Peter and his daughter Barbara. Sir John, as the Prime Minister correctly pointed out, had a long and distinguished career of public service. He served in local government. He served as Lord Mayor of Adelaide. He served three years in the State Parliament of South Australia. He served 17 years in the national Parliament and, as if that strain was not sufficient in itself, he served in the most trying position of all-a decade as Speaker of the House of Representatives. My recollections of him are clear. He was Speaker when I arrived in 1961 and still Speaker in 1966 at the time of his retirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should clearly acknowledge that there was a distinct quality to the style of control of the chamber that he adopted as Speaker. One would say that he gave it great stature and great strength but he discharged the administration of his responsibilities not always with an elegance. One suspects that the robust good humour which he almost inevitably displayed spilled over into a general robustness at times of particular tension in the Parliament and he adapted the Standing Orders according to the circumstances prevailing. I say that with a clear recollection of some bruising which still lingers on my political psyche. I had been here but a short time and sat near where the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Free) is now seated. Not far from me was a then irrepressible member of the Parliament, Freddy Daly. It is hard to believe these days that Freddy Daly would have been responsible for what might be described as at least moderately unseemly behaviour in the Parliament from time to time. But it was a fact, as some of us recall, and indeed witnessed. On one occasion Freddy Daly was making some pungent points in the Parliament and injecting great disorder in the ranks of the conservative Government opposite. Sir John McLeay made the quiet but firm observation that the next person to misbehave or behave in a disorderly way would be ejected from the Parliament. At that point I got up to walk out and leave the Parliament. He misinterpreted my physical movement and had me ejected immediately. Having a very conservative electorate and an extraordinarily slender majority in those days, I went back to my electorate with some timidity, but survived. </PARA>
<PARA> I learned to respect Sir John McLeay as Speaker in the discharge of his duties at trying times, but I learned to respect greatly and unstintingly the way in which he controlled this place. He did it mostly with a display, I repeat, of robust good humour and an understanding of the way in which the people who come to this Parliament at times conduct themselves when the going gets a little rough and provocative, and always in a way that suggested that he was prepared to make some adaptation of the Standing Orders to get around a tight spot. I observe in passing and in fairness to you, Mr Speaker, that I have noted that you too have been capable of doing that on the odd occasion, and we wish that you would extend it more often to this side of the House. But let me make it clear, and in conclusion, that my recollections of the late Sir John McLeay are affectionate ones, deeply respectful ones and ones appreciative of the service which he gave to this Parliament and service which obviously he gave to the community, while in the State Parliament of South Australia and in local government in that State. The Opposition expresses its deepest condolences to the surviving members of Sir John McLeay's family. </PARA>

The death of John McLeay in June came as a very sad blow, an especially sad blow to many of us who remember Sir John with a great deal of affection. He was a jovial character who had a great capacity for remembering details about people and their lives. He was always inquiring after family circumstances. He was a very lovable character. I found out that only last year when I happened to meet him in Los Angeles, where he was visiting his son. He still recalled all the personalities and inquired fondly after them. He was a man who gave very distinguished service. He holds the record for length of service as Speaker of this House, having served a 10-year term. He followed the illustrious Archie Cameron in that position. He carried on the high standards that had been established under Archie Cameron, and I am pleased to say that they have been carried on by his successors too.</PARA></TALK.START>

Sir John was followed as member for Boothby by his son John, who is now Consul-General in Los Angeles. Sir John McLeay will be remembered for his very outstanding service and his dedication. He was a greatly respected man, loved and admired by all. I extend very great sympathy to his son John, to John's brother Peter, his sister, Barbara, and to Lady McLeay. </PARA>

<PARA>Honourable members will be saddened to learn of the death of one of our former colleagues, Charles Griffiths. Charlie Griffiths was born on 26 June 1903 at Jesmond, in New South Wales. He was educated at the Bribbaree Public School. Upon leaving school, Charles Griffiths joined the New South Wales Railways. He became actively involved in union affairs and was, in turn, an organiser and State councillor of the Australian Railways Union. From 1940 to 1952 he was State Secretary of that union. He was first elected to this House at the general election of 1949 for the newly created seat of Shortland. In his maiden speech to this House on 28 February 1950 he spoke of the great sacrifices made by the working people of Australia to aid the war effort and the evil influence of communism which he believed could be defeated if people could look to a secure economic future, free from poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> Charles Griffiths served as a member of the Printing Committee from 1951 to 1954 and was a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works from 1959 to 1966. He was a member of the Australian delegation to the ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1964 and, in 1966, was a member of a parliamentary delegation to South Asia. In 1969 he was a member of the parliamentary mission which visited Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan. At the general election of 1972 he retired from this Parliament. On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, I extend my sympathy to his widow, Jess, and to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition, I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in extending sympathies to the surviving members of the late Charlie Griffiths's family. He served in this Parliament for 23 years. I served with him for 11 of those years. He was well known to me and recognised and respected as a hard working representative of his electorate. He was, in truth, an authentic voice of a very large and important section of the Australian community. He sought to present the problems which confronted ordinary people in the day to day challenge of living in society in the context of the speeches which he made in this Parliament. It was clear from the way in which he projected those experiences of ordinary people and the feeling with which he presented those experiences that he was dedicated in his service to his electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important in this institution that not only the technical and complex matters that present themselves to this Parliament be responded to technically and in a complex way, as befits the particular issues of the time, but that also the problems that confront ordinary people, as prosaic as they may be, are also addressed. If that responsibility is failed, a very serious failure is evident in the way in which this parliamentary institution functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Charlie Griffiths's speeches, as I say, were always down to earth. There was a homespun quality about them. But they were always relevant to the experiences of people who were struggling, often with the greatest disadvantages, in ordinary society. They are innumerable; and they go to make up the Australian community. But his speeches were not always prosaic. Some of them were quite significant in the way in which they addressed themselves to particular issues, and some were memorable. I seem to recall that his farewell speech had a rather rivetting quality, and the Leader of the Opposition at that stage probably gave more attention to it than he gave to any other speech which the late Charlie Griffiths delivered in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The service of the late Charlie Griffiths in this Parliament has been referred to in some detail by the Prime Minister. It scarcely, therefore, requires me to go over that service again. I repeat that the Opposition feels greatly diminished at the loss of a former colleague who served the Labor Party well and who gave it lengthy service. Our condolences are conveyed to the surviving members of his family. </PARA>

Those honourable members who were in Parliament during this period will remember him. He was one of those people who had very strong beliefs. He was a very earnest character, but he had a great sense of humour and could always laugh at himself if need be. He was ready and willing always to get into the debates of this House. He was a very hard worker and, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden ) has said, he had a great social conscience. Hardly an adjournment debate or a grievance debate would go by without him revealing some particular hard case. He was very concerned about social welfare and about pensions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in paying tribute to my predecessor and friend, Charles Edward Griffiths, or Charles as he was known to his family and close personal friends. His career was that of a local boy who devoted his life to the service of the community in which he grew up and of his fellow unionists of the Australian Railways Union. In the latter half of his life he went on to represent them in this House as the member for the new electorate of Shortland from its creation in 1949 until his retirement in 1972.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He started work in 1917 at 14 years of age as a shop boy in a railway depot in Newcastle. He progressed to become a top tradesman as a machine moulder at Honeysuckle workshop. From an early age he was active in industrial and political affairs, having joined the ARU in 1919. He became secretary of the Newcastle branch of the ARU in 1941 and then in 1945 its northern organiser for the area from Gosford in the south to the Queensland border in the north. In those days union organisers did not have access to provided cars or other forms of transport. Many former colleagues of Charles still remember the familiar sight of him pushing his way to the various workshops and job locations along the track on his pushbike. </PARA>
<PARA> His political career began when he joined the Adamstown branch of the Australian Labor Party in 1924. He later became president of the branch for 13 consecutive years. He was also elected to the presidency of the Hamilton State Electorate Council and served as a member of the State Executive of our party for the 11 years prior to his election to this House. As the first member for Shortland, Charles quickly earned a reputation as a fighter for the rights of the battler, the ordinary man, the disadvantaged, the pensioners and the ex- servicemen. Literally thousands of his constituents would not have received their rightful entitlements had he not been here to fight their case for them either with the bureaucracy or with the Ministry. In the Parliament, in addition to normal parliamentary duties, Charles served as a member of the Joint Committee on Publications for two years and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for eight years, when he stood down to provide opportunity for younger colleagues to participate. </PARA>
<PARA> Charles Edward Griffiths was a humble man and a good family man. He was a man who did not seek the limelight. He chose instead to serve the people he represented. I was very moved when I visited him a few weeks prior to his death on 17 May 1982 when, although fully aware of the seriousness of his illness, he stressed to me his love of Australia and his love of the Labor movement. He stressed to me also the vital need to carry on the struggle for the rights of the less privileged and the disadvantaged members of our community. His regret was that he had spent all his parliamentary life in opposition. If there was one tinge of bitterness in those last remarks and those last words to me it was in respect of a matter, the motive for which he was never able to understand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, you and I served with Charles Griffiths for 17 years prior to 1972 when he left the Parliament. I suppose the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) would also recall, as he was also involved in debate in the Parliament at that time, that Charles had a great devotion to social welfare cases and to repatriation cases especially. He was not a man who had a hilarious sense of humour by any means, but I do recall a number of anecdotes about him. One is the connection with an occasion when he was telling the Parliament in great detail about the adversity of an ex-serviceman who, he said, had lost a limb, had had two heart attacks, and also had had a steel plate inserted in the back of his head. The man was totally disabled. Charles Griffiths said accusingly to the Government: 'What work do you expect a man such as that to do? ' Eddie Ward retorted: 'Put him in the Senate.' That was one of the few occasions on which Charles took a joke very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Charles Griffiths was a very earthy man and a great family man. He served on the New South Wales Executive of the Australian Labor Party for nine years. He was devoted to his son and daughter and to his wife Jess. We would call Charles Griffiths a fair dinkum Labor bloke of the old school. He used to say that the rot set in in this country when people stopped using the lay-by system and resorted to using credit and hire purchase systems. That will give honourable members an idea of the type of fellow he was. I have very fond recollections of the service he gave to this Parliament and of the great devotion and sense of duty he had to under-privileged people in the community.</PARA>

The people of the areas involved noted recently with jubilation and with appreciation the announcement on the introduction of supplementary licences for non-metropolitan radio and television services. This, of course, will bring an improvement in the choice of broadcasting outlets available to people in these areas. However, is it not true that there are some people in other parts of Australia, such as Muttaburra, Jundah, Dajarra and other small centres, who do not have access to any radio or television services at all?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true, as the honourable member observed, that only a few days ago the Government announced that it would introduce a system of supplementary licences for radio and television. This, as I think the honourable member indicated, will bring frequency modulation radio to many country and regional towns and also a second television channel to those areas. However, the honourable member quite rightly drew attention to the fact that there are also some particularly remote areas of this country which still do not have any radio at all and which do not have any television at all. The Government has been concerned for a number of years about the lack of services in those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's response to this problem has taken several aspects, one of which is the Remote Areas Television Service, which takes television signals from the international satellite. Without having to pre-empt anything the Treasurer may say tonight, I am confident that our program in this regard will be continuing. There are many places which are scheduled to receive that satellite television service. I am in the process of examining a number at the moment. By a remarkable coincidence Muttaburra, which is one of the places that the honourable member just mentioned, is one such place to which I have very recently approved the extension of the Remote Areas Television Service. That town has a population of some 400 people. In view of the fact that the acquisition of land, which is necessary for the system, and the acquisition of equipment, which is also necessary for the system, are both well advanced, I am confident that television will be brought to that town and that area at least by the time of the Brisbane Commonwealth Games.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To start off with I should explain that there has been no change in the Government's announced position. At no stage have I or my predecessor suggested that a decision with respect to the second RAAF fighter squadron would be made before the discussions which are to take place in 1984. Those discussions are expected to embrace the degree to which the FA18 has been progressed in its introduction to service in the RAAF and, of course, the manpower requirements that will be involved in the change from the existing Mirage squadrons to FA18 squadrons. Any involvement of the RAAF in Butterworth has, of course, been in total agreement with the Government of Malaysia. There is no doubt that the presence of RAAF aircraft there has not only been appreciated by that Government but also has contributed significantly towards the enhanced security that is apparent in the region. In the future matters will need to be considered by both governments. It is for that reason that the whole question is up for review in 1984.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0N7">Mr NIXON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is correct that a request has come from the Premier of Victoria to the Prime Minister for financial assistance in drought aid in that State. I noticed with some interest a report in the Press that the Premier had asked for in the order of $10m. The telex that has come in does not mention any figure, but is simply a request. Indeed, the telex shows a lack of appreciation and of real knowledge of how the system of drought aid really works. I would like the Premier of Victoria to know that the present drought funding arrangements go back to the early 1960s when a formula approach was devised by the then Treasurer, the late Harold Holt, which formula with some changes, is still in existence. All that is required for the Premier to ensure that he obtains funding is for him to make sure that the first $7m of drought assistance is paid by the State. The Commonwealth will contribute $3 for $1 after that amount has been paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that, over the last two or three years, the Commonwealth has contributed $100m towards State drought assistance under that formula. The Premier ought also to know that there is no limit to the amount of funding available on the $3 for $1 basis once a State is eligible for it. Once the Premier has spent his first $7m, the Commonwealth will provide funding in a big way. The sooner the Premier gets on with the business of assisting the farmers with their problems, the better it will be for all.</PARA>
<PARA> The Premier has said that we have been kind enough to assist New South Wales in a different fashion. He is again obviously unaware that New South Wales unlike Victoria, has suffered significant droughts and is now running into its fourth season of drought. For that reason, last year we made $20m available as an interest-free loan-not as a grant, as I suspect the Premier of Victoria believes -and this year we made available $10m as an interest-free loan. New South Wales has run into genuine financial difficulties because of the continuing drought over a number of years. Victoria is not in that situation. Therefore, I do not think that the Commonwealth would see it as proper to depart from the normal drought arrangements at this point. The Prime Minister will be responding to the Premier in due course.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the Government's policy to encourage the development of uranium resources in the Northern Territory and it is very pleasing that we have reached the stage where the Jabiluka project has now been given approval to proceed. As far as the Koongarra project is concerned, it is necessary for three requirements to be met before development approval can be given; that is, it must have the agreement of the Aboriginal people, it must conform with the environmental requirements and there must be compliance with our foreign investment policy. In relation to the environmental area, this Parliament passed legislation last year changing the original excised area for the Koongarra project. This was as a result of a request from the company and an evaluation of the possible environmental consequences for the Kakadu National Park. It was pointed out in the second reading speech that this change would actually improve the value of the park as well as help the mining company to meet the environmental regulations. That legislation was passed. Up to this point, although there have been discussions with the Aboriginals, they have some reservations about the altered boundary.</PARA></TALK.START>

At the moment, further discussions are scheduled between the relevant land council and the traditional owners. I believe they will take place shortly. I hope that agreement will be reached. There is no objection to the actual mining of uranium; it is more a concern about the new boundaries around the prescribed area. As far as compliance with the foreign investment rules is concerned, Denison, which is a wholly-owned Canadian company, will be required to divest down to 25 per cent of its current interest. At this point-to the best of my knowledge at any rate-no proposal has been put to the Foreign Investment Review Board. I hope that all these requirements will be satisfied in the fairly near future so that the Koongarra project can proceed, as is the Jabiluka project, because uranium development is very important to the commerce of the Northern Territory, and to employment and, of course, is of benefit to Australia in relation to a further export earning and making our contribution to the energy requirements of a needy world.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that there is a great deal that can be done. I think that a good deal has been done over the recent period. The conference that was held between the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Government had a number of common elements. Whilst the parties to that conference would have given different emphasis to different events and circumstances, I think there was a common thread running through our concerns for the Australian economy, caused significantly but not exclusively by two factors, one being the downturn in the world economy, which is having a dramatic effect on export income and commodity prices. Nowhere is that more evident than in my electorate, where the Alcoa smelter has come to a halt. It will be a ghost works for a considerable period. Honourable members may not be aware that that plant was being established not to supply the Australian market but to supply world markets in total, using Australian bauxite and Australian power. Those markets, of course, do not exist and the company ran out of funds and could not get partners. In those circumstances, it unfortunately had no choice. That is one of the starkest reminders of what can happen as a result of world recession and world difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On top of that many countries, because they were in a period of recession and of high and rising levels of unemployment-up to nearly 14 per cent in the United Kingdom and about 10 per cent in the United States-had been achieving through last year and the period before that levels of wage settlement of around 5 per cent or 6 per cent. The mood in the Australian economy and, I think, amongst the overwhelming number of Australians at this time last year was quite different from that which exists today. Unfortunately, there were wage pressures and wage agreements which tended to make Australian industry and exporters much less competitive at a time when other countries were becoming more and more competitive, even though they were under the threat of the difficulties imposed by the very real economic downturn in those countries. Be that as it may, the kind of figure that the honourable gentleman gave, which has recently been published, obviously makes us less competitive at a time when other people have been becoming more competitive. There is much that we need to do about it. I think the conference organised between the ACTU, the CAI and the Government provides a foundation upon which it is possible to build. I think also that the acceptance of the parties concerned-the maritime unions, the industries or companies concerned and the Government-of the Crawford report provides an example of working together, of a very real recognition that Australians have to sit down and solve problems together rather than try to argue about them or cast blame for what might have happened in the past.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the coal industry, there are things that have needed doing. It would have been very easy to take certain attitudes about the reasons for delays out of certain coal ports. Instead of taking that as a purely political point it is much more important to sit down with the New South Wales and Queensland governments and the unions and companies concerned to take measures and decisions which will get coal moving and which will remove the bottle-necks, whether they are physical or industrial relations, so that we can deliver coal on time to our customers overseas. A great deal has been achieved in the last three or four months. There is much yet remaining to be done in that particular area.</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the Government can take other decisions. We believe that we needed to make a special effort to set an example from the highest paid people within the Commonwealth environment. As a result of that, special submissions were made by me and by the Treasurer, obviously with the Government's full support, to the Remuneration Tribunal. Honourable members all know the result of that. If there had been a recommendation for a 12 per cent, 13 per cent or a 14 per cent wage increase, coming on top of what had happened before, it would have been very easy for that to be regarded as a bench-mark for other decisions. It could be said: 'You have had your 12 per cent, why shouldn't we?' A very different recommendation came forward in the event. The Academic Salaries Tribunal has followed that lead. A number of private enterprise companies around Australia have followed that lead and some have indeed gone a good deal further than that. Other submissions are being made before wage fixing tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA> I have written to Premiers in relation to these matters. The Premier of New South Wales has already taken action of a quite dramatic kind in relation to certain salary increases for public servants of the Government of New South Wales. So long as there is a recognition that this kind of restraint is important throughout all sections of the Australian community to return this country to the kinds of economic health and growth that we would all want, then I believe we have a capacity to work together and to achieve just that.</PARA>
<PARA> Statements by significant union leaders in recent times have contributed to the mood for restraint. I will be very disappointed, and I believe the Government and the Treasurer will be very disappointed if, as a result of the Budget that is announced tonight, there will not be a capacity to build more on the mood for restraint. I think that the Budget will establish substantial arguments in support of that in future wage determinations. Therefore, a number of avenues are open to the Government, and a number of avenues are open to other sections or groups within the Australian community, but overridingly we have to recognise that there are significant problems, some of which are home grown and some of which are caused by the wider world outside. We are not going to overcome those problems unless we have a capacity to work together to achieve results. I believe a significant advance in that direction has already been made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That matter has been brought to my attention. I made a statement a couple of weeks ago making it perfectly clear that there is no provision in the tax law of this country which would enable donations, as such, to a political party to be tax deductable. I discussed the matter with the then Acting Commissioner of Taxation who told me that contributions to bodies of the type described by the honourable member would not be tax deductible. He also said that contributions to foundations established by financial supporters of another political party would likewise not be tax deductible. Under those circumstances I give the maximum assurance that can be given by a Treasurer, having regard to the responsibilities of the Commissioner of Taxation for administration of the Act. I think the honourable member is really concerned, as I believe his question indicates, that moneys which are not tax deductible do not wind up in the hands of a political party. I gather by his nodding that that is what he is concerned about. I hope that he will talk to the treasurer of every branch of the Australian Labor Party around Australia as a result of his concern in the matter and make sure that the next time the treasurer of that Labor Party branch receives a donation from a trade union movement, that treasurer gets a written undertaking from the secretary of the trade union movement that none of the contribution has come out of the fees of the members of that trade union, because those fees themselves are tax deductible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I held a meeting in Melbourne yesterday with the producers, processors and the Australian Council of Trade Unions on this question. At yesterday's meeting the producers confirmed that they were prepared to accept a levy of 2c per head on sheep slaughtered, raising therefore some $600,000 for promotion of sheep meats, mostly in the Middle East. This would of course be matched dollar for dollar by the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the processors were to join the producers in making a donation-they talked about a 1c offer-this would add another $300,000. That has not yet come to pass. The House will know that the Commonwealth has made $1m available for dollar-for- dollar matching. The significant thing is that the qualification the Commonwealth and the industry have relates to there being a resolution of industrial difficulties on the live sheep issue around Australia, but particularly in Portland. The Vice-President of the ACTU, Mr Crean, has agreed to take this very question back to the ACTU Executive this week and provide me with some response by the end of the week. I look forward to that. As I understand, he has fairly detailed consultations to undertake not only with the ACTU Executive but also with the Trades and Labour Council in Melbourne or the Trades and Labour Council down in the Portland district. The market development fund will be handled under the auspices of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. There is to be an advisory committee on the expenditure of funds which will consist of three producers, one processor, one representative of the ACTU and a couple of Commonwealth Government representatives.

Having concluded its consideration of the Dix Committee's report, the Government took the view that the public interest would be best served if I announced those decisions as soon as possible. We also considered that there was a responsibility to inform the Australian Broadcasting Commission and Commission staff as soon as practicable of the Government's intentions regarding amendments to the structure, charter and responsibilities of the Commission even though this meant announcing these decisions during a period when the Parliament was in recess. I hope to be able to give notice, within the next few days, of my intention to introduce Bills to implement those decisions which require legislation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The subject of the Tribunal's inquiry, the report of which I have just tabled, is of prime importance to the Australian community. The matters investigated have obvious social, economic and technological implications. For these reasons the Government has decided to make this summary of the report and its recommendations available now rather than wait for the complete report to be printed. The full report of five or six volumes will be tabled in Parliament at the earliest opportunity after I receive copies of it for tabling, and this will probably take place early in September. There will be a parliamentary debate on the report as soon as possible after that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tribunal's major recommendations are that: Australia should introduce both cable television and radiated subscription television as soon as practicable. There should be limitations on the ownership and control of cable and radiated subscription television licences, based on factors such as prescribed interest levels, total media interests and the viability of existing broadcasting services. The restrictions on foreign ownership of commercial radio and television should generally apply, with some qualifications in respect of cable television, particularly in respect of companies that are naturalised for the purposes of the Government's foreign investment policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of cable television, a further recommendation is that separation of ownership of the cable reticulation system and the operation of cable television should be permissible. The private sector and public authorities-including Telecom Australia-should have equal opportunities to own and maintain the cable reticulation system. Public authorities should not hold cable television licences but may lease channels on the system. Cable television licensees should provide separate channels for community, education and children's programming. Cable television systems should be permitted to carry enhanced services such as security services or two way tele-shopping services. Each conventional television broadcaster whose service is substantially within the licensed area of a cable television system should have the right to require his signal to be carried on that system. </PARA>
<PARA> Cable television licensees should be prohibited from importing signals from conventional stations in other localities, except in special circumstances. Advertising should be permitted on basic cable television services such as local broadcast television channels but not on additional pay channels such as those which televise recently released movie programs. In respect of radiated subscription television services, advertising should not be permitted within services that are encoded. The Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Special Broadcasting Service should not own or operate radiated subscription television services. Cable television and radiated subscription television licensing processes should generally be similar to procedures under the current Broadcasting and Television Act. The licensing process for cable television should be administered by a single federal regulatory authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to process the report promptly. It also wants to receive the widest possible range of views from the community on the inquiry's findings. I wish to thank the Tribunal and inquiry Chairman, Mr David Jones, the other members of the Committee, Mr Moremon, Mr Archer, Professor Gibson and Mr Wilkinson, and the Tribunal staff for their work in producing the report. The inquiry was established in July 1980 by one of my predecessors, the Honourable A . A. Staley, to report on a wide range of issues associated with the possible introduction of cable television in Australia. Later the terms of reference were extended to include a full examination of radiated subscription television. It is evident that the inquiry has had to confront many complex social, economic and technological questions. It has done so in a most professional and competent manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I reiterate the point that the intention with respect to tabling this report, which honourable members will see is described as an interim report but which is really a summary, is to enable people to have it as quickly as possible and to have access to it earlier than they would if they had had to wait for the entire six volumes or so to be printed by the Printer and then tabled. The Government feels that it is in the public interest and in the interest of all those concerned and interested in this issue that people should have access to this document at the very earliest opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of all the social, political and economic problems facing Australia today the lack of cable and subscription television services does not rank very high. The ministerial statement made today is extraordinary in its timing and frustrating in its lack of content. The Minister for Communications (Mr N.A. Brown) has given us the menu but nothing to sink our teeth into. We are provided with a two-page statement by the Minister for Communications and a short interim report by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. We are told that the full report of five of six volumes will be tabled at a later date-in September unless an election intervenes-and then debated. The timing of the statement on cable and subscription television is significant. It is clear that the Government intends to adopt the report if it holds office long enought to do so. The announcement today is intended to guarantee financial support for the Government in what will probably be an early election campaign, depending on the public's reaction to tonight's Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister's statement shows exactly what the priorities of the Fraser Government are. With half a million unemployed, the best that the Fraser Government can offer is to provide them with 60 television channels to watch. Perhaps we are to witness the spectacle of a cable television-led recovery. How extraordinary that the Government should be paving the way to adopt the Tribunal report on cable and subscription television before the report of the Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunications Services is received and debated. It is clear that, if the Tribunal report on cable and subscription television is adopted, it will be another nail in the coffin for Telecom Australia. We have always argued that Telecom should provide the technical infrastructure for any cable system to be introduced in the future. Estimates of costs put before the Tribunal for cabling major cities were about $3,000m. Telecom's estimate was $1, 200m. Telecom has the ducts underground and would presumably replace existing cable with optical fibre when the technology becomes generally available in about five year's time. It would be absurdly wasteful to introduce cable now with conventional technology and not to take advantage of fibre optic technology when it becomes available. This would be a classic example of built-in obsolescence. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case the development of satellite systems may make cable and subscription television systems much less attractive economically, especially if RCA's new second generation satellite is adopted. This may mean that a television set owner, by the use of a black box which he or she hires and which unscrambles signals from a satellite, will have access to more than 100 channels -assuming that this is regarded as an advantage in our media saturated society- without having to pay for the cost of constructing a cable network and hiring out his or her own line. If cable is to be introduced Telecom should provide this using Telecom ducting and the operators should be licensed through Telecom. If subscription television is to be introduced, the Australian Broadcasting Commission should have it because of its already existing national network capacity and because it would provide an additional and independent source of revenue for the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> We condemn cable television in principle, at this moment, as an extravagance in times of economic recession-a modern form of bread and circuses. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) cannot give jobs but will offer the top 20 per cent of Australians a vast choice of television programs. Cable television will have nothing in particular for specific identified needs in broadcasting, such as the needs of regional areas for example. Any employment generated would be short term and wasteful in the sense that it would be involved in duplicating Telecom resources. It would be better to develop the Australian television system in an orderly way offering additional over-the-air services and consider the possibility of introduction of cable television in specific areas when the new technology is available. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very real politico-cultural problem in the programming of cable television. There is no doubt that the bulk of program material-witnesses to the Tribunal inquiry said up to 60 channels-would be imported from the United States of America. In our broadcasting system, we have always seen the development of the system as one which sought social cohesion and cultural identity in this country. This Government adopted the report on self-regulation of the Broadcasting Tribunal which said that television should have 'an Australian look '. There is no way that cable television can operate in the foreseeable future on that basis. With four networks in Australia at the moment, we already have more than 450 hours of television programming in the major cities each week. Honourable members could imagine how exponentially that would increase if there were 60 networks operating right around the clock, seven days a week. That will effect a very serious diminution in the degree of Australian content. </PARA>
<PARA> The interim report is a very unsatisfactory document. The Opposition is unable to examine vital issues properly because the reasoning for those decisions is not supplied; it is in the other five or six volumes which, as the Minister said , have not yet been tabled. Yet we are asked to accept on trust statements such as this one on page 64 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal reached the conclusion that the social, technical and economic arguments against the adoption of Cable television were outweighed by the favourable arguments. </PARA>
<PARA>But we are told for instance about the economic argument that there is doubt about the economies of program provision for all those new channels but that it is merely a commercial matter and not one for the Government. If that is the case, why has every Australian government since broadcasting began always been concerned with questions of viability? Why has this Government paid great attention-quite rightly-to the question of the viability of country television stations, as recently as the announcement on supplementary licences? Surely they are commercial decisions? The report is absurd. It so severely breaks practically every established policy which has given us a reasonably good broadcasting system that it must be rejected and sent back to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal with the request that it should try again. </PARA>
<PARA> Amongst the other objections to the report is the fact that, first, there is no separation between the control of hardware-that is, the transmission systems themselves-and the software, the programming. Secondly, licences are to be for a whole system, not just for a channel. Is the system operator to say who gets the channel? That throws out of the window the present system of licensing a channel only after proper inquiry. Of course, this comes from the licensing body itself. Thirdly, we are told that the initial grant of licensing is to be for 15 years with 10 year renewals compared to five years and three year renewal periods at present. If we had neutral, public authority ownership of cable systems, renewals could be maintained at a five year or three year interval. But on this basis there is such a dramatic break with precedent that we need to know far more why the licence needs to be granted over a 15 year period. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is very lax on foreign ownership and on Australian content-all things patiently built up over the years. On top of this, we are told that public authorities are not permitted to hold cable television licenses. Why is there this discrimination? The report is hasty and ill-thought out. It is no basis on which to prepare the plan for cable television. </PARA>

A consultant to the companies interested in cable television-Myer, Amatil, Elders-IXL and other generous contributors to Liberal Party funds is Mr Henry von Bibra, a former legal partner of the Chairman of the Tribunal, Mr David Jones. The Chairman showed a surprising and a quite uncharacteristic lack of discretion in not disqualifying himself from sitting on this important matter given that such a critical role was taken by his former legal partner and where it is fair to say that the report completely accepts the argument put by his former legal partner.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no more important matter in the Australian political climate at present than the matter of tax avoidance. During the recess-namely, in May-a report called the McCabe-Lafranchi report was tabled in the Victorian Parliament. It was a report of an investigation of certain companies in Victoria. In the process, that investigation revealed the most massive fraud of Commonwealth revenue. It says that the fraud amounted to at least $200m. In a subsequent statement-what would be called a mea culpa statement-the Treasurer (Mr Howard), in endeavouring to explain the Government's inaction and apathy, admitted that he knew of at least 31,000 companies being involved in tax avoidance over a five year period. That is in his Press statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one were given an extrapolation of that in relation to the number of companies investigated by McCabe-Lafranchi, one would see that it is no exaggeration to say that tax avoidance at present could be costing $6 billion. What would happen if, this evening, the Treasurer were able to allocate $6 billion to the needy in Australia? That would amount to at least four times what he might give by way of tax cuts. And there are all the questions that apply to the needy schools and hospitals and the fact that the States are entitled to at least a third of that money. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the facts. In the statement made by the Treasurer, who apparently does not have time to come into this House to debate the matter, this situation is made very clear. This is a very important matter. We are dealing with a matter of fraud and the failure of a government to do anything about fraud-a criminal action. The McCabe-Lafranchi report refers to transactions in which companies are bought by dealers and sold-on to directors who are sham directors and nobody can ever trace them or the company after that happens. In the process of the sale of this company-in the sold-on provisions-all the tax liabilities that should have been paid to the Commonwealth are avoided. As the investigators said, the transactions were a sham, the companies were dumped and the loss of revenue to the Federal Government was massive. The generated losses of many millions of dollars come about because of the trading in shares of companies sold-on to sham directors in sham transactions. There is fraud all the way through. </PARA>
<PARA> The report clearly states that the Melbourne operation was established in 1976 as Commercial Securities Ltd. It names the directors. It says that a network of commissions was established and that the process was the largest tax avoidance operation in this country. The factor which assisted the growth was the failure of the Australian Taxation Office to take any action. One cannot blame just the people in the Taxation Office. The Treasurer and the Government have the laws that apply-they are the laws of income tax and the laws of crime-so they have plenty of laws to catch in the net those who want to avoid tax and those who are guilty of fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> We have only to look at Part IV of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which relates to penal provisions. There is a penalty for failure to furnish returns, a penalty if a person refuses to give evidence, a penalty for lodging a false return and a penalty for lodging a false declaration. There is certainly a double penalty for what is called fraudulent avoidance. There is certainly clear evidence of what the Commissioner can do by way of making prosecutions. He needs only a mere averment of the offence to make a prima facie case. Nothing has happened in a period of years. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back to this report. It talks about the arrangements that were made. Discounts were given to those who were handling the matter. There were those willing vendors who obviously participated in this fraud. That is a significant point. We have all the details. Here is some of the evidence: The sham directors were procured by a Mr Faint, an associate of Mr Maher. Faint alleges that Maher required him to procure purchasers who would be able to disappear, who were of little or no substance and who had little or no assets. We now have this classic result of the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. The Treasurer is now known in the cartoonist's situation as the Calamari Kid because nothing has happened about the whole matter of dredging up what should have been obvious in any reasonable legal approach to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we have to accept the view that the Taxation Office is so devoid of legal intelligence that it does not know fraud when it sees it? Are the Attorney- General's Department and the Crown-Solicitor so unable to see the situation that they cannot lodge one prosecution for fraud when this evidence is within the knowledge of the Department of the Treasury? Is it a cover-up by a Government which is not able to admit that it could not cope with the situation or, worse still, is unwilling to cope with the situation? The dreadful explanation given by the Treasurer in a massive tome of 27 June can be summarised by saying that the Treasurer is not expected to know everything that is going on in the Taxation Office and that perhaps there was some legal advice to the contrary. I doubt that very much indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the vendors, that is, those people who have got away with the money -perhaps they are not the ones one would call the shams, but they are the beneficiaries-received a generous consideration which had no regard to tax liability. The dealers went on to withdraw the balance and give themselves secret commissions, but the Taxation Commissioner was left lamenting. If this is the evidence, how is it that the Government is now talking about doing something about it and introducing some legislation that needs to be brought in? I submit to honourable members that the legislation already exists. It is contained in the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. There can be prosecutions for either stealing or, certainly, conspiracy. The Crimes Act provides for it. It is about time this Government did something about it instead of trying to mislead the public of Australia that nothing could have been done. </PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence from a Mr Hurley who admits that the persons involved were shams and stooges. He would be an excellent witness in the box if one is talking about conspiracy. Pages 18 and 19 of the McCabe-Lafranchi report list the names and addresses of all the sham directors. These people knew that the directors and secretaries had no knowledge of the companies into which they were capitulated. They were sham transactions. It was obvious that they would never be found and could never be established in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act. </PARA>
<PARA> So let us get it very clear. The real issue is that there have been transactions covering thousands of companies over a period of years extending perhaps as far back as 1973. In fact, we cannot find any prosecutions at all. In one case only a liquidator was appointed. Why were liquidators not appointed in all the other cases? That is the normal process when a company cannot pay its debts. What is wrong with this Government that it cannot find out where crime, particularly conspiracy, takes place? It wasted $20m in a conspiracy case against unfortunate Greeks. All they received was the invalid pension and they are still getting it. But the Government wasted $20m trying to persecute them. It is very clear from the investigations that they asked this rhetorical question: 'Why was no action taken?' Whatever the position those responsible for the decision not to prosecute ought to be regarded as being answerable for the losses that have flowed from the abuse. That matter comes right back to this Government. It cannot avoid this in any shape or form. </PARA>
<PARA> In the report of June which the Treasurer gave at length he said that he did not really understand the position himself. He came back with a further statement a month later saying that he had more advice and that the Solicitor- General would indicate that in one case there was some cause for action. I know that the Solicitor-General is a man of the utmost integrity. I submit that if he had had a look at the report, if he had seen the evidence that was available to the Taxation Office, to the Treasurer and to the Government, prosecutions would have been lodged years ago. This is the significant point of this report. Because no prosecutions were lodged, as the investigators said, this increased the nerve of Mr Maher. The lack of decision promoted the nerve of Maher. The schemes are now, of course, jokingly referred to as bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Maher's nerve was so increased that he just stepped around the tax avoidance legislation of 1978 and apparently he was not too worried about the legislation of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with the fact that I now know that an opinion was given to the Taxation Office, one which would have been available to the Treasurer if he had asked for it-if he has not already done so-and certainly to the Attorney-General 's Department, by a leading silk in Melbourne to the effect that something should have been done. That option dates back to 1978, and it notes that if a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth can be established, there is a strong possibility that the agreement being the subject of that conspiracy is itself a nullity. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the transfer of shares has never taken place. We see the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer here today saying: 'Oh, we are going to bring in some Act to try to avoid the transfer'. There was a learned Queen's Counsel opinion which any reasonable lawyer would support that if a transaction is done by fraud it is no transaction at all; it is a nullity. Those shares have never been transferred. What about having an explanation from the Government as to why this opinion has never been disclosed in any report by the Treasurer? The reason is that the Government does not want to attack some of its own kith and kin. Let us make this very clear. The Queen's Counsel makes the point himself:</PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible of course to hypothesise as to degrees of informality which might be produced in any particular set of circumstances but assuming that the purchaser is for example, non-existent and that the transactions upon which the vendor embarks are nullities, the real risk is that the vendor remains the shareholder and director as previously and the company has to discharge the tax liability despite the fact that the assets have found their way into the hands of the entrepreneur. </PARA>
<PARA> In that situation and from a practical view-point the Commissioner would probably look to the vendor to recover the lost income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has been done. The Queen's Counsel said:</PARA>
<PARA> The above considerations lead me to conclude that a prudent vendor of current profits in today's climate should satisfy himself (to the extent of obtaining competent advice) that the sale in contemplation: (a) will not involve him in any offence under the Companies Act, (b) will not involve him in a conspiracy to defraud and, (c) will be made to a bona fide purchaser of substance (not straw) conscious of his prospective liabilities and with acceptable means of discharging them. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the position. That is the law. So why did we have this nonsense brought in today that we will have some legislation that will amend and cure the situation? I make it very clear again-this is a very significant point in this opinion-that where people such as this have been engaging in the practice of what we can only say is fraud the vendors themselves could well be indicted. </PARA>
<PARA> So, from a practical point of view in the short few minutes available to me I say that the Opposition is able to establish to honourable members the names of the people through the McCabe-Lafranchi report; it is able to establish that there was a learned Queen's Counsel opinion back in 1978 that there should have been prosecutions. There has not been one prosecution. Billions of dollars are being lost in the hands of these crooks who should be brought to book. The only way, as this report says, that we will ever stop tax avoidance is by bringing in criminal penalties. If we prosecute these people one knows very well that juries will convict them. Is the Government fearful that some of its own friends will be involved? Is that the real reason it has not acted, when one looks at some of the people who are involved in the vendor position? That is the real reason. It is no good just arguing that the Government cannot do it because it does not have the law on its side. I emphasise the point that there is that opinion. I think any reasonable lawyer must say that the law is surely not such an ass that we can have all the provisions for preventing conspiracy to defraud, stealing and for dealing with the question generally of failure to lodge returns under the taxation Act which can all go for nought because these people did nothing at all about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The investigators make the point about how the banks got involved in this issue . They picked a little place called Stones Corner up in Brisbane where there were three banks. They make the point that on just one afternoon 60 companies were transferred through one branch of a bank. This involved $30m to $60m in the one afternoon. They make the point also with regard to a used car salesman being able to buy a company for $1.3m. He was an employee of Maher and others. What other evidence does the Government want? People who are working hard and paying their taxes are paying more taxes now because this Government has failed. The real issue is: We should be asking for the Treasurer's resignation. If he cannot administer an Act better than this he ought to get out. Admittedly, he only got this information in 1978 and a lot of defalcation and defrauding took place before that. But it is no excuse to say to the people of Australia, 'I can't do anything about it' when there is this report, when there is the law and when the Treasurer failed to admit that he had an opinion from a learned silk in Owen Dixon Chambers in Victoria which clearly says that as far back as 1978 action should have been taken. The Opposition wants to know why it was not taken. It looks forward to an immediate explanation from the Treasurer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tax avoidance is now dead. They are not my words; they are the words of the national chairman of one of Australia's largest accounting firms. In a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald this morning Mr Roderick C. Cameron stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tax avoidance is now dead. I refer to avoidance (use of artificial schemes) as distinct from evasion (the cash economy). </PARA>
<PARA> When are the media going to give due recognition to the achievements of the Treasurer, Mr Howard, in relation to tax avoidance?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cameron went on:</PARA>
<PARA> There continues to be widespread coverage of the avoidance of huge sums of taxation in past years in such a way that the public must believe that a major problem still exists. </PARA>
<PARA>From listening to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) today one would get the false impression that it would still exist. Mr Cameron continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Extensive coverage given recently to the rather emotive remarks of Mr John Miller, president of the Australian Society of Accountants, would have added further to that impression. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that tax avoidance is finished. Mr Howard has had to overcome enormous problems, particularly those arising from certain High Court decisions in years past. The war has been won by the Treasurer and the public should be left in no doubt of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Howard deserves the highest praise. </PARA>
<PARA> Tax evasion, however, by those engaged in 'cash' business continues to be a major problem-</PARA>
<PARA>Particularly for many supporters of the Australian Labor Party-</PARA>
<PARA> And involves a vast amount of lost revenue. The Treasurer will not make much headway in overcoming it without the active co-operation of all members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> We should all resist making payments in cash (even if offered a lower price) and should not co-operate with those who obviously evade their responsibilities to the community in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>I read that letter, particularly the last bit about the cash economy, to drive home to the Australian Labor Party that some officials in unions which are very close to the Australian Labor Party protested violently when there was an attempt some years ago to examine methods by which the cash economy, which is now the biggest area of tax evasion in Australia, operates. It involves the payment by cash for work done by people who do not want to have any record kept of that work. Various unions close to the Labor Party violently protested when attempts were made to examine methods by which this money could be recouped for the benefit of those Australians who are obliged to pay tax as pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. It seems to me that we have simply to examine whether the points made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition can, in fact, be even vaguely sustained. He said that the Government has failed to pursue the collection of income tax. Now that is an incredible statement. The announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) of 25 July to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred in such a disparaging way clearly rebuts the statement but no doubt he did not want to read that bit. The Treasurer said that the amount of revenue which can be collected from vendor shareholders in bottom-of-the-harbour strips of untaxed company profits is estimated to be $450m and we are proceeding to get that money . The matter of public importance also states that the Government has failed to prosecute persons responsible for defrauding the Commonwealth of revenue. This is clearly wrong. The report of the Commissioner for Taxation for 1980-81 clearly shows that in the preceding financial year legal proceedings were taken in 68,394 cases to recover income tax and additional tax. The amounts sued for in such cases totalled $151m. In 68,394 cases legal proceedings were taken and yet we are told by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that we have failed to pursue the collection of income tax. I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard the table of the number of cases and the amounts sued for by States, which is in the official report of the Taxation Commissioner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I proceed now to the general question of whether the tax which was not paid at the time in respect of bottom-of-the-harbour activities has in fact been lost. The Opposition has quaintly ignored the fact that there has already been an announcement that this money will be pursued; that is, money that was evaded by fraud, in effect. There is no doubt that the statement made recently by the Treasurer clearly indicated that those people who have benefited as a result of fraud will be obliged to pay back the money involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The analogy I make is a simple one. If someone in a pub buys for $30 what he knows to be a $1,000 gold watch he has no good title to it and the owner can in fact, as I understand it, recover it. Certainly, that is the clear moral situation. When someone buys a thousand dollar watch for $30 he does not have good title to it. I use those figures because that is exactly the sort of proportion that was involved in bottom-of-the-harbour deals where someone would sell a company which had a net worth of nothing. It may have had, say, assets of $100,000-for example cash in the bank. But it may also have a bill due to the Taxation Commissioner of $100,000. So the one balanced the other. The company really had no net worth. Yet the vendor would sell that company to a promoter for $97,000, in other words less 3 per cent. He would get cash for the payment of a small commission just as the fellow in the pub would get a watch for the payment of a very small commission. I want it recognised that there is very little difference between the people who benefited in both cases-the man who bought a thousand dollar watch for $30 and the man who got cash by selling his company, knowing it to be worthless, for an enormous sum, such as $100,000. They are the very people that this Government is pursuing for the recoupment of that money. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggesting that nothing is being done indicates an extraordinary approach to reality. It seems to me not only that a lot has been done already, as the official statistics show, but also that a lot more is being done. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us deal with the question of how much has been lost. The most important point to be made in this respect is that the money has not been lost. Certainly the promoters of these schemes who perpetrated the frauds do not have the money to pay it back. They ended up with only the 3 per cent. They are like the fellow in the pub who sold the gold watch for $30. All they have is the $30. We want the thousand dollar watch back. We want the total proceeds. To carry on as though all we have to do is prosecute the promoters is arrant nonsense. We want the money back. The promoters do not have it and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows it. He knows that he is putting up an immense smokescreen which has absolutely nothing to do with recouping the money. This Government is keen on recouping the money rather than putting on an act. It is keen to recoup the money from the people who have benefited and that is why it made the announcement last month which is most significant and which, of course, was ignored by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition because it did not fit into his version of history, which is arrantly nonsensical. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked about the immense delays involved in getting things done. I remind him that when the Labor Government was in office it was perfectly well aware of the Curran schemes and all it got around to doing was making a 'Thou shalt not operate Curran schemes' statement. It did nothing more than that because it is very difficult to proceed in this way. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows that from his own experience in government. That is why I am so disappointed to hear the sorts of comments he made today. It seems to me that we have to recognise that this money is not lost. The announcement of 25 July foreshadowed legislative measures to be introduced to obtain payments from the vendor shareholders, the people who actually benefited and who, in effect, ended up with the gold watch for only $30 when they knew it was worth $1,000. The proposal to recoup the unpaid company tax from these strips indicated that a substantial amount of the $500m-odd attributable to such activities prior to the amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1980 which banned this sort of thing is capable of recoupment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us remember that this practice, this style of bottom-of-the-harbour activity, was in effect prohibited by action of this Government in 1980. The Opposition will say: 'Oh, but it hasn't worked'. Of course it has worked, just as a law against murder is fairly effective in diminishing murder. The existence of a law cannot assuredly prevent every murder. Even when people were being hanged for murder people still committed that crime. The question is whether these actions of the Government have prevented the continuation of these kinds of frauds. The answer to that is clearly that they have. The second question is what are we doing about recoupment. The clear answer is that we are proceeding to recoup the money. The question we keep on hearing is: 'Why don't you proceed against the promoters?'. Let us get this exactly clear: Last month a revised advice from the Solicitor-General came to the Government and in the light of that recent opinion action is being taken to bring before the courts the promoters and their associates under provisions of company and criminal law. </PARA>

We are concerned about the 97 per cent and about the people who got the benefit of the frauds. There is no doubt that we will proceed-I trust successfully, in the light of the amended legal opinion we now have-against the promoters. I do not know what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will then have left to say on this topic because the legislation that this Government has introduced has killed those kinds of devices; it has killed the whole industry. We did not hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition address himself clearly and unequivocally to the fact that this Government has prevented and has now killed off tax avoidance of this nature and certainly tax evasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

All the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has to do is to find out, if he can-no doubt the honourable member has appropriate people to find out from-whether there has been any continuation of this kind of activity. I am unaware of it. If the honourable member is aware of it, he would be doing his duty to the nation and certainly to the Australian Taxation Office if he reported those activities instead of coming into this House and pretending , with no information whatsoever, to know about these schemes which have been outlawed by this Government and in respect of which recoupment and prosecutions are under way. If he can do anything more than pretend that these actions, this kind of activity, have not ended, it would be his duty not to make a smart-Alick interjection but to provide some material so that action can be taken against the people who he apparently knows are proceeding with these activities. If he does know and if the Opposition knows, they have a duty to report it. They have failed to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no evidence of a continuation of these schemes because the Government has ended them. As the senior partner of this major accounting firm and many other commentators, including leaders of the accounting industry, have said, this Government has done more than any other government to end this kind of tax avoidance and to recoup the proceeds of tax evasion. The record is clear and unequivocal. The sorts of nonsensical statements made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and, by way of interjection, by other members of the Opposition, do their case no good. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contempt with which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) treats this matter has obviously been shown to this Parliament this afternoon by the Mickey Mouse reply to the allegations that were put forward in a hard form today by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). However, I would like to deal very briefly with a couple of matters from what the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) had to say, which included a fair amount of fairy tale stuff. He announced that Mr Roderick C. Cameron had said that tax avoidance was dead. We are supposed to end the debate on that issue. He then went on to point out that the High Court of Australia had presented problems to the Government. It has not presented any problems to the Government in respect of prosecutions under the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. That is what we are talking about and that is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was talking about. There have been no prosecutions under that Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macarthur then referred to a list in the report of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in relation to tax collected from other people. That is not what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was talking about. It is a pity that the honourable member did not have enough intelligence to understand what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was talking about. The only thing that came out of the speech of the honourable member was that the promoters of the schemes will be delighted because he indicated quite clearly that the Government will not be taking any action against them. Of course, that is something which we all knew. He then stated that there was no evidence that the schemes were still continuing. There is plenty of evidence that the schemes are still continuing. If this Government does not have the facilities or the intelligence, and if it does not know where the Corporate Affairs Office in Victoria is situated or how to search those companies, it is not our obligation to provide them. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in the Corporate Affairs Office in Melbourne, if the honourable member could be quiet and listen; I have told him that twice. The response of the Federal Treasurer to the McCabe-Lafranchi report was confirmation that his so-called fight against tax avoidance has been nothing more than hollow rhetoric . His first reaction was to brand the report as a political stunt. Within two days the Treasurer-a self-styled crusader against tax avoidance-was on the back foot desperately defending the hopeless record of the Government in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, he peddled the line that no action could be taken against the practices referred to in the report which took place prior to the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act 1980. I will deal with that matter once and for all because it is just another excuse for the lack of will by this Government to act on tax avoidance. The Treasurer yaps at the heels of the tax avoidance industry while it goes from strength to strength and continues to defaud the Commonwealth of revenue at the expense of the wage and salary earners of this country. On 26 November 1980 the Treasurer announced pompously in this House that the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Bill, under which there had been no prosecution to this date, would impose severe penalites on those who engaged in evasion of income tax or sales tax through the use of 'straw' companies and 'straw' trusts. It does not matter much what the penalties are if a government does not prosecute anybody, and that is what this Government has done. He went on to admit that the Bill did not in principle break ground that company and criminal laws had not already touched. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter dated 28 November 1980 the Law Institute of Victoria provided the Treasurer with two opinions, the reason for doing so being the unjustified opposition of the legal profession to the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill. Unfortunately, the reason for providing the opinions to the Treasurer was not very highly motivated. However, the opinions were important for other reasons. The opinion of Mr N. H. M. Forsyth spelt out that calculated and fraudulent tax evasion was already a grave criminal offence. The opinion cited section 231 (1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 86 (1) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and section 124 (1) and (3) of the Companies Act. These were only examples. The opinion also stated that other sections of the Companies Act, Bankruptcy Act, State crimes Acts and common law offences could have been used against calculated and fraudulent evasion of tax. The opinion further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> How it can be said that they--</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the sections-</PARA>
<PARA>are inadequate when they have not even been tested in such a situation, I find rather surprising. </PARA>
<PARA>Not once had this Government taken any steps under any of those Acts to take action against people who were defrauding the Commonwealth. Yet the Treasurer stated in the House on 26 November 1980 that he could not do anything. He was introducing this great new legislation which would solve all the problems! Now, 20 months later, we have still had no prosecutions. In his second reading speech the Treasurer dealt with the situation in which a company having a tax liability or a possible tax liability lends money to another company out of which it is stripped so that the first company cannot obtain payment of the loan. In such a case the opinion to which I referred cited the case of Walker v. Winborne (1976) ALJR 446 as authority that directors in such circumstances were guilty of misfeasance under the Companies Act and were liable to repay the money lost to the liquidator of the lender company. No action was taken and still has not been taken against people in those circumstances. A joint opinion of Mr G. L. Davies, Q. C., and Mr D. G. Russell, also provided to the Treasurer, supports this view.</PARA>
<PARA> Another offence clearly disclosed by the McCabe-Lafranchi report was to deprive the Commonwealth of Australia of revenue. These offences were covered by the Income Tax Assessment Act or in furtherance of a conspiracy by section 86 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. For the Treasurer to claim otherwise is nonsense. He is not fair dinkum on this issue and has shown himself incapable of enforcing existing laws against those who are prepared to use devices which have distorted the whole tax system in this country. Worse than the conclusion that the Treasurer was incapable of carrying out his job is the obvious conclusion that he lacked the will even to have a go. His grandstanding does not cover up his lack of action. Clearly the claim by the Treasurer that no action could be taken prior to the enactment of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 is incorrect. The fact is that he preferred to take the easy option, that is, to do nothing. The Act on which the Treasurer places so much reliance was passed 21 months ago in this House, yet we have not seen one prosecution-something which the honourable member for Macarthur did not understand. He has left the chamber, unfortunately-not that it would make any difference; if one told him again and again he would not understand. The time for the Treasurer to put up or shut up has long passed. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Australian Taxation Office, which copped a fair bit of flak when the whole situation blew up. Everybody said that it was the fault of the Taxation Office; they would have liked to transfer the blame to it. On 1 June 1982, members of the Taxation Officers Branch of the Federated Clerks Union challenged Mr Howard to 'explain why nothing has been done about this massive evasion of taxation by a wealthy section of the community'. There has been no reply to members of that union by the Treasurer. The president of the Victorian Branch said that none of the $200m in lost revenue had been collected and that no prosecutions had been launched against anyone involved in the schemes. I would like to lay odds about how much will be collected. We heard a great deal of nonsense today from the honourable member for Macarthur about how much money will be collected. </PARA>

He then started talking about retrospectivity. On the same day, Mr Howard asked Mr O'Reilly, the Commissioner of Taxation whether staffing of the Investigation Division of the Taxation Office could be strengthened. The chickens were coming to roost. What had the Treasurer discovered? He had discovered nothing. It was just another attempt to create a smokescreen. He knew that the infamous razor gang decisions taken last year imposed a reduction of 324 on the staff of the Taxation Office. These levels were appealed against, but staff levels had not been restored for nine months. As Mr O'Reilly, the Commissioner of Taxation, said, the most serious effect on the Taxation Office has been the loss of experienced staff in the audit and investigation areas. He added:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tax avoidance is the issue that it is in Australia today because of this Government's active campaign against it. It is an issue not because of anything that the Opposition may have done or may have thought that it has done, but simply because the Government, in its endeavour to ensure that there is a policy of ensuring that the tax burden is shared fairly across the community in Australia as a whole, is seeking to protect its revenue and to ensure that people are not getting away with tax avoidance in this country. This Government has done more than any other Government to stamp out tax avoidance in Australia. It is on the record that, since July 1977, this Government has brought in 30 separate measures to deal with specific tax avoidance arrangements . The Government, of its own making, has created an issue out of the tax avoidance industry in Australia. It has wiped out tax avoidance in Australia and the Opposition has done nothing other than to jump on a bandwagon which the Government has created.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been a lot of discussion here today-I think most of what the Opposition is trying to put to the House today is based upon it-of the report by McCabe and Lafranchi from Victoria. It needs to be understood that that report is historical. It describes what was done by certain companies and certain promoters before legislation was passed in this Parliament which has effectively stopped that practice. That is what needs to be understood. The schemes referred to in the report are no longer operating. They have not operated since legislation was passed in this House some time ago. I understand that the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission is drawing up a list similar to that which McCabe and Lafranchi drew up in Victoria. That will expose the names of those companies and those operators who have done in New South Wales what McCabe and Lafranchi exposed in Victoria. I have no problems-with the exposure; I think that is a good thing. The fact of the matter is that we have to recognise what it is. It is an exposure of something that happened before legislation was passed which has stopped the operation of those schemes. </PARA>

<PARA> Some points need to be made in relation to this matter of public importance which has been brought forward by the Opposition. The first point is that the revenue has not been lost. The revenue has not been lost until such time as assessments have been raised and contested and it has been found in favour of the taxpayer, or against the Commissioner, that the tax will not be collected. That is the first thing that needs to be understood. The second thing is that legislation is in place which makes virtually most, if not all, of these schemes inoperative. Further legislation is proposed by the Government to ensure that revenue which may be in doubt will in fact be collected. That is an important point. The third point that needs to be made is that new arrangements about taxation in dispute have been announced. The Treasurer has indicated in a recent statement that the penalty rate-</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Duffy" NAMEID="6G4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recent?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI7">Mr LUSHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recent, August. The Treasurer indicated that the penalty rate for late payment of tax will be 20 per cent whereas it has previously been 10 per cent; that the 50-50 rule under which taxpayers who have an amount of taxation in dispute pay half now and leave the other half until it is determined whether it is in fact due or will no longer apply; that all tax in dispute will have to be paid; and that if ultimately the finding is in favour of the taxpayer, he will get his money back and he will get interest on it. I believe those new arrangements will do a significant amount to ensure that the tax in dispute is not withheld from the revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to my friend the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) that these arrangements, which he keeps on interjecting are new-I do not dispute that they are new-were not brought about as a result of any action from the Opposition or any suggestions of the Opposition; they have been brought about on the initiative of this Government in exactly the same way as all the legislation to which I have referred has been introduced on the initiative of this Government. This Government is concerned to protect all taxpayers in Australia, to make sure that tax is collected and that no sectors of the community are immune from tax, thereby putting greater burdens on the rest of the community. Another point that needs to be raised in relation to the matter that has been brought froward is that the Taxation Office is still raising assessments against companies which were stripped before the Crimes (Tax Offences) Act became law. I believe that is a point which needs to be raised. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of the House, I need to make a few points about the effectiveness of what has been achieved by the Treasurer. I wish to give a few quotations. The first is a quotation from a Mr Keith Knight who is a former director of the Ward Knight and Dunn Merchant Bank, which was named before the Costigan Royal Commission into the Painters and Dockers Union as being a promoter of tax schemes. Mr Knight said:</PARA>
<PARA> John Howard has been more successful than any other Treasurer. He has effectively killed the tax avoidance industry for the general taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ron Crowe, the chairman of the national tax committee of Arthur Young &amp; Co., a national firm of accountants, said:</PARA>
<PARA> There are still trust stripping and sales tax schemes, but it takes a brave man to get involved in them. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made before further statements by the Treasurer which would have firmed it up. Mr Jon Kirkwood, a taxation partner at Ernst and Whinney, chartered accountants, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The use of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes would be a ridiculous risk for both the vendors and the purchasers. As for trust-stripping, there must be very little left in this area and what is left can only be said to be very risky. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has made it clear that he intends to stamp it out and I would not recommend it to a client. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bruce Fisk, a partner in Touche Ross and Co., another national accounting firm, when asked whether he believed the use of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes was still widespread, said:</PARA>
<PARA> No, at least not in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Our experience is that tax avoidance in the form of paper schemes are now not available in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>As the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) indicated earlier, Mr Roderick Cameron, the National Chairman of Coopers and Lybrand, another national accounting firm, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax avoidance is now dead. </PARA>
<PARA> The war has been won by the Treasurer and the public should be left in no doubt of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Howard deserves the highest praise. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is not enough, the Treasurer has revealed in recent days that the provisional tax receipts for the last financial year, 1981-82, were more than $ 200m above the Budget estimate. He claims that that is significant evidence of the success of the Government's campaign against tax avoidance. I agree with him . The Fraser Government has done more to stamp out tax avoidance than any other Federal or State government in Australia's history. This commitment can be evidenced by the number of announcements and pieces of legislation enacted by this Parliament. Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which has applied since 27 May 1981, was inserted into the Act to provide an effective general anti-avoidance provision. We overcame something which no previous government was able to overcome. The Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 provides five years gaol or $50,000 fines for persons who engage in evasions through straw companies or straw trusts. The Acts Interpretation Act has been amended to require the courts to pay attention to the law's intent and spirit instead of the strict letter of the law. During the Fraser Government's period in office the Treasurer has acted on 26 occassions, through 22 pieces of legislation, against 54 separate schemes. With the approval of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), to whom I have shown this tabulation, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a summary of tax avoidance schemes legislated against or proposed to be legislated against since 1 July 1977. </PARA>

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that while generous tax concessions benefit established sectors of the now internationally acclaimed Australian film industry, other vital film activities, which are ineligible for tax concessions, have had to be severely curtailed due to the lack of funds available to the Creative Development Branch of the Australian Film Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's Creative Development Branch is responsible for funding low budget films in order to develop new creative talent and ideas for the film industry to draw upon, it assists activities of major national significance such as the Australian Film Awards and the National Film Theatre, and it supports Film Festivals and film organisations in almost every State. All these aspects of the Commission's Creative Development work have suffered as a result of inflation eroding the Creative Development Branch's budget by over 40 per cent over the past five years.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore your petitioners call upon the Federal Parliament to provide the Australian Film Corporation with at least a 50 per cent increase in the Budget for its Creative Development Branch in the coming financial year. This would be an essential first step towards ensuring the continuation of a viable and developing Australian film culture and film industry.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Proposed Student Loans Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the introduction of a comprehensive student loans scheme will:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Restrict Access to Education-People from poorer backgrounds will be deterred from studying by the prospect of incurring large debts. These people, if they enrol, will be forced to amass loan debts. Richer students do not face this handicap.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Undermine the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme-TEAS should cover the basic living costs of students. Currently the scheme only assists 38% of full- time students and the maximum level of TEAS is a mere $49.67. Government statements indicate TEAS will be further downgraded if loans are introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Disadvantage Women-Women students would be disadvantaged by a loans scheme as they have a lesser ability to repay loan debts, because on average women earn less and have a higher unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Disadvantage Mature-Age Students-Usually mature age students forego income to study and already have large financial commitments. They could not return to study if it meant incurring substantial debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Distort Educational Choices-Mounting loan debts would force students into studying shorter courses or not continuing with post-graduate study.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Result in Massive Attrition Rates-Students will attempt to undertake extensive part-time work or overload courses to minimise their loans. Increased failure rates will result forcing students to 'drop-out' rather than continuing study and increase their debts.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Cause Administrative &amp; Financial Difficulties-Overseas experience shows high default rates will occur on student loans. Government money will be channelled away from TEAS to paying off banks. The government will also bear the administrative burden of pursuing defaulters.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the proposed student loan scheme will have disastrous effects on tertiary education, which we believe benefits the whole community, not just the individual student.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that:</PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 (1982). </PARA>
<PARA>The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals Nos 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 (1982) formally place before Parliament, as required by Law, tariff changes made by Gazette notice during the last recess. Proposals No. 13 which operates from 1 June 1982 contains changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on preparations, extracts and juices of meat. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendations except in relation to canned ham, canned poultry and frozen cooked turkey roll. A general rate of 15 per cent will apply to canned ham with imports from developing countries being entitled to admission under tariff quota to an initial level of 900 tonnes at a rate of 5 per cent. Imports in excess of that level from developing countries will be dutiable at the general tariff rate. Canned poultry, frozen cooked turkey roll, meat extracts and meat juices will be dutiable at minimum rates. All other goods under reference will be dutiable at 10 per cent general and free from developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 14 which operates from 17 June 1982 contains changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the IAC in its report on miscellaneous manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA>Group A:</PARA>
<PARA> Articles of stone, plaster, cement, asbestos, mica and similar materials ( excluding certain refractory products)</PARA>
<PARA>Group E:</PARA>
<PARA> Ceramics. In respect of certain insulating materials the IAC recommended a rate of 15 per cent. The Government has decided that the duties will be phased down to this level over a two-year period to allow for a more stable adjustment within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted the IAC's recommendations that:</PARA>
<PARA>Goods of asphalt, bitumen or pitch be dutiable at 25 per cent reducing to 15 per cent after 2 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Certain friction materials be dutiable at 25 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA>Sanitary fixtures be dutiable at 20 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA>Certain goods of stone, slate, abrasive materials, plastering materials, asbestos cement goods, mica and certain ceramic goods be dutiable at 15 per cent ;</PARA>
<PARA>Goods of cement and certain non-refractory construction products be dutiable at 10 per cent;</PARA>
<PARA>Other goods under reference continue to be dutiable at minimum rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 15 (1982) which operates from 1 July 1982 contains tariff changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations by the IAC in its report on miscellaneous textile products. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed it does. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendations except in respect of embroidery and articles of knitted or crocheted fabrics, elastic or rubberised. These latter goods are receiving further consideration by the Government. The Commission's recommendation to apply a duty of $2.25 per square metre to fabric not meeting the requirement of being embroidered over 10 per cent or more of its area has not been accepted. Embroidery will be defined specifically for tariff purposes and will attract a duty rate of 10 per cent with fabrics falling outside the definition attracting the duties applicable to the base fabric.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission commented in its report that the effectiveness of assistance arrangements for a number of sectors of the textile industry could be eroded by the substitution of similar products imported at lower rates of duty. The Government has decided that imports of coated bonded fibre fabrics, certain double side coated polyolefin fabrics and tarpaulins, chenille fabrics and fabrics of flax or ramie will be closely monitored. If the level of assistance is being seriously eroded appropriate action will be taken by the Government, as it always does. Also incorporated in these Proposals are the developing country quota arrangements for 1982-83 and provision for a new tariff quota permitting duty free entry for specific amounts of sawn Caribbean pine of Forum Islands origin. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals Nos 16 and 17 (1982) are new. Proposals No. 16 which operates from 27 May 1982 is an administrative change which restores phasing rates which were deleted from the Customs Tariff as a result of a drafting error. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 17, which operates from 20 July 1982, implements the Government's decision taken as part of its consideration of the Crawford report on the revitalisation of Australian shipping to remove the 2 per cent revenue duty applying to ships. A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House. </PARA>

I am aware of a textile and the International Harvester factory in my electorate where 2,000 employees have disappeared. I am sure that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) has similar problems in Tasmania with respect to both textile and other manufacturing processes. I hope that the Government can bring about a situation in which, as a matter of urgency, consideration of the problems in these areas is made without undue delay. The situation at the moment is that in Victoria and New South Wales, mainly in protected industries, up to 100 people a day are being retrenched.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These Bills are the culmination of probably one of the longest and most protracted examinations of a piece of legislation in Australian history. The Bills modernise-but do not necessarily completely modernise-the various laws which have applied to the Australian defence forces for disciplinary and other purposes and also other laws, which in the past have been subject to serious misunderstandings and complexities, in respect of relationships between civilians and the defence forces. It is, as was stated to me, a major improvement on the existing law. Therefore the Opposition does not propose either to oppose the Bill or to seek to delay significantly its passage. There are matters in respect of the Bill which we will raise in debate and it is my intention, at the Committee stage, to move an amendment-it can be done only at that stage-which would require the then Minister to appoint a board of review , after the Bill has been operative for three years, to examine its operation and make a report to the Parliament within a year of its appointment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at the history of this legislation one will find that it is extraordinarily difficult to obtain agreement on a review of this sort of legislation and to have that agreement brought before the Parliament. For the record I indicate that rather traumatic passage this piece of legislation is currently bringing to a conclusion. An inquiry into punishment and trial of military offences was ordered by the then Minister for Defence immediately following the conclusion of World War II. Mr Justice Reed delivered a report to the then Minister in 1946. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill represents the legislative outcome of an initiative which was taken over 30 years ago. Through a series of delays, reviews, and I think, periods of pigeon-holing, the current military code or laws which cover discipline and other related matters in the various defence forces have remained in operation for a period which would not have been tolerated in the civil law of any State or in any comparable country. The law as amended or as replaced by this legislation takes out such offences as those related to beating of the drums and other matters which only now similarly exists, as far as I can see, in the Commonwealth Electoral Act which has a similar dating process because of its lack of cleaning-up. </PARA>
<PARA> In this particular case some of the matters which still exist, and which will exist until this Bill becomes law, are of far more serious consequence. We have a case on record, for example, of an officer charged with an offence and found not guilty being re-charged under the existing law. This particular case was never tried because of ministerial intervention. Also there was the case of Papua New Guinea civilians being convicted and sentenced to death by an army officer during World War II who had no authority or jurisdiction over those civilians whatsoever. This proposed law clarifies that position and fairly specifically indicates where jurisdiction starts and ends and sets out, to a reasonable extent, the arrangements which exist between military law and civilian populations. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to the matter relating to civilian power and military assistance to the civilian power. The proposed new law is far better than that which now prevails but it is lacking in clarity. Certainly, in our opinion it does not give adequate cover to Service personnel in respect of protecting their position where they are in fact involved in activities of assistance to the civilian power. We believe that it would be absolutely essential that total clarity should exist in this area. There is one other part of the Bill in which the common law is applied and where there is some doubt about the meaning of its application. I hope that the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) will in his response to the second reading debate or during the Committee stage of the Bill set out quite clearly what applications of the common law are meant by clause 10 of the Bill and that he will specify to what extent that applies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the areas of criminal matters the Australian Capital Territory law is applied. That is a considerable improvement on the application of the variety of laws which had existed before. It does constitute one problem which in the future may have to be reviewed. At present the Australian Capital Territory law is the province of the Commonwealth Parliament and therefore represents the view of the Commonwealth Parliament on what the civil law should be. It is possible and probable that within a very short number of years Australian Capital Territory law may be made by persons representing the residents of the Australian Capital Territory, as is now the case in the various States. One would not be sure whether it would then be appropriate to apply that law to a Commonwealth activity. It may well be that we would continue to do so but it is an area where some future consideration may be necessary in order to ensure that the law as it applies to the defence forces is a law which would have been and which is approved by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> A second problem-as we see it-exists in clause 12 of the Bill. In that clause there is an onus of proof reversal which while existing in other Commonwealth law seems to be inappropriate, given the general application of common law and other legal aspects in respect of a person's defence. Under that clause of the Bill it is the defence which must prove its case rather than the prosecution. That clause is substantially in respect of a plea of insanity and a plea that the offence was committed under a pre-existing or an old law. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Sir James Killen" NAMEID="4U4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4U4">Sir James Killen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the case under the code and at common law.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5J4">Mr SCHOLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in a clause of the Bill at the moment. We suggest that this is not in line with modern legal practice. The matter will be argued further during the Committee stage and certainly will be subject to an amendment, I think, in the Senate. We are merely pointing out that we believe that the onus of proof should never rest with the defendant in the case of a serious charge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention to a number of other areas of the Bill. In the provisions for summary offences and other trials the Bill now requires that a pleading should be made either guilty or not guilty by the Service personnel. There is also a limitation of paid legal advice to the legal office of the defence forces. I think the first matter that one would be entitled to raise is that if legal advice is limited to the defence forces some provision for independent legal advice is necessary. It is also necessary that the serviceman should have access to legal advice at the time of charging, which is critical in any action taken against an individual, and also prior to any requirement to plead or the making of a decision which is of legal consequence to the person who is charged. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of areas of the Bill where decisions have to be made in respect of the future conduct of the case which rest with the defendant as opposed to the person who is prosecuting. I will point to one area which concerns the requirement that the defendant will determine whether a commanding officer or the person conducting a summary offences hearing will in fact pass sentence or whether the case will be referred to a magistrate or to some other area for sentencing. At that stage if legal advice has not been available or is not available the person who is making the pleading is doing so usually without full knowledge of the consequences of the pleadings which will be made. It would seem that legal advice should be available to the person concerned in the first instance in respect of the fact that the consequences of a plea of guilty or not guilty should be clearly known to the person who is charged and in the second instance in respect of the consequences of a request that sentencing should be passed to another area from where the charge has been heard. </PARA>
<PARA> One other area of some concern is in regard to the fact that the Act allows that a conviction may be entered but no punishment recorded. At this stage the Bill does not provide-it is a matter which one would think current legal practice should suggest should apply-for a conviction to be found but not recorded. It is possible for technical offences of some limited consequence to take place and it is legal practice in civilian courts that convictions can in fact be entered without being recorded on a person's record. We ask that that be looked at. It is an option which I think ought to be available to a sentencing authority. Where the case is of such significance that the person hearing the case does not want to enter a conviction or some other reason is apparent, that option should be open to that person. I do not think it should be a mandatory provision in a Bill that a conviction be recorded in cases where a conviction is obvious but need not necessarily be shown on a person's record. It is one of those situations in which, 20 years later, a conviction on the record would not reflect the circumstances at the time it was entered and it could be to a person 's serious disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> We think there is need for some modification of the requirements in the Bill that bar the Commonwealth Ombudsman or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from in any way involving themselves in a review of the proceedings or those matters related to the proceedings of a military tribunal. The situation suggested in the Bill is such that all proceedings will be reviewed by a reviewing authority. I do not believe it would be unreasonable in circumstances where it was felt that the reviewing authority particularly or the conduct of the case in general were contrary to proper practices for the Ombudsman's office or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have the right to review the case. I would not suggest that they should have the right to reverse a finding or to quash a trial but certainly they should have the right to advise on proceedings which have been conducted. It is an area in which one would think that a change in the present situation would not adversely affect the applications of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a very large and complex piece of legislation. It constitutes a major advance in the law in Australia and it is an even greater step forward in respect of the military law in Australia. The Bill constitutes what is practically a totally new area of law. There will be and are areas of some concern. I presume the Minister has had representations-I certainly have- claiming that it discriminates against homosexuals. I cannot find examples in the Bill to show that that is true. But there are some areas of the Bill, especially in the application of Australian Capital Territory law, where some discrimination could be seen. We do not propose to move in that area because I think the Bill is, in fact, relatively fair. Actually, it discriminates against all sexual activities because it makes them an offence on all military property. That is something I hope never to have to police. In respect of clause 61, I am told that it is possible that there may be some degree of discrimination. If so, one would hope that that could be cleared up. Certainly, there could be discrimination in other clauses of the Bill but those provisions are of an administrative nature rather than a legal nature and are not consequent upon the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Committee stage, I will be moving an amendment which is extraordinarily long for the purpose for which it was drafted. Nevertheless, the purpose of the amendment is to require that, after a period of operation of three years, the Minister shall appoint a board of review to examine the operations of the Act and to make a report thereon. It requires that that report come to both Houses of the Parliament. In proposing to move that amendment, we are also accepting that some parts of the Bill, which we will probably move to amend at this stage, will remain operative for a reasonable period. But we believe that a set of laws which is totally new, whose application has not been tried or tested and which may be found to have deficiencies, should be examined as a matter of automatic consequence after a reasonable period of operation. It is an amendment which I think the Government could and should accept. If one looks at the traumatic history of getting this Bill into the Parliament, one can see that the first draft of the Bill was presented 27 years after the first inquiry and this Bill has arrived 9 years after the first draft. I am not blaming anyone for that. Obviously Ministers of both parties were involved. Obviously it is an area in which very significant disagreements have existed over the years. It is probably a tribute to the former Minister that the Bill is in the House at all. It is probably a tribute to, I think, Lance Barnard that the legislation again started its tortuous progress towards this House in 1972-73 when he ordered the matter to be brought to a head. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is not opposing the Bill. There are a number of aspects of the Bill which we think probably could do with modernising. We do not intend to try to move the necessary amendments at this stage. We would hate to think that we have sent this Bill on another 30-year cycle before it comes back to this Parliament. The Bill improves military law materially. One hopes it can be passed through this Parliament expeditiously with the amendment agreed to so that a review takes place after three years of operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I particularly welcome the Defence Force Discipline Bill as it brings about several major reforms. Let me mention five of them. Firstly, it Australianises the military law. That is, it replaces British law with new and more appropriate Australian law. Secondly, it modernises our military law which, until now, has often been notoriously out of date. Thirdly, it provides a uniform code for the three armed Services. Fourthly, it simplifies the military law and its rules and procedures. Fifthly, it provides more lenient penalties in line with the reforming tendencies in civil criminal codes. Achieving the first of these three reforms-Australianising, modernising and uniformity-is significant in itself. The different laws formerly applying to the three Services have been complicated enough, but the situation has been further complicated by a mixture of British and Australian law where the British law has been already repealed in the United Kingdom itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All three Services have been subjected to these anomalies, but the Royal Australian Air Force has had to put up with the greatest mixture of anomaly and antiquity. It has been subject to three codes. The first is the United Kingdom Air Force Act of 1917. This Act is the United Kingdom Army Act of 1881 applied to the Royal Air Force. It was replaced by new legislation in Britain in 1955, but it still applies in Australia, as in force on 15 September 1939, as modified by Australian Air Force Regulations. But that is not enough. Secondly, the United Kingdom Kings Regulations and Air Council Instructions for the Air Force, which ceased to apply in Britain in 1953, continue to apply in Australia, as in force on 18 July 1940, subject, however, to some modifications made by our own Air Force Regulations. Thirdly, the United Kingdom rules for procedure of 1933 still apply to the RAAF as in force on 31 December 1956, although they have ceased to apply in Britain. Moreover, as well as Australian Air Force Regulations, certain provisions of the Australian Defence Act of 1903 also apply to the RAAF. Sometimes they parallel the United Kingdom Law and yet at other times they replace it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is easy to make fun out of the quaint archaicisms to be found in the codes that this Bill will replace. One is the offence of having taken a ship as a prize and failing to send the papers to a prize court-an offence taking one back to the days of Horatio Hornblower. To end this tangle of confusion, obscurity and archaicism is a definite achievement. More to the point, however, is the modernisation and rationalisation that the new code will bring about in matters essential to service discipline. </PARA>
<PARA> In place of the old tri-Service codes, which laid down vague offences of conduct 'calculated to prejudice both good order and discipline', a new uniform provision covers conduct likely to prejudice the discipline of the Defence Force or to bring it into disrepute. This rationalises and modernises the previous codes yet still meets the requirements of service discipline. The penalties under the new code are more lenient-three months gaol as a maximum penalty instead of the old penalties, which were cashiering for Army and Air Force officers and two years imprisonment for Naval officers and for other ranks in all three Services. The demands of discipline are still upheld, despite the lenient penalty in the new code, because under this code it is now possible to charge offenders under clause 60, covering 'prejudicial conduct', with offences covered by other clauses of the Bill. This replaces rather contradictory provisions between the three Services over this point in the old codes. </PARA>
<PARA> One piece of updating in the Bill is the section covering narcotics-clause 59. There was no specific mention of narcotics in the old mixed codes. Clause 59 is in line with the approach of the rest of the Bill in that it prefers, where possible, to refer matters to civil courts. Therefore, the general principle of clause 59 is that narcotics offences committed by Defence Force personnel in Australia will be dealt with by the civil courts of the land. However, the Bill in this clause, as elsewhere, seeks to make the law of the Australian Capital Territory the standard of reference for Defence Force law and in the matter of possession of small amounts of cannabis or the use of cannabis inside or outside Australia it prescribes the same kind of lenient penalties for these offences that obtain under Australian Capital Territory law; that is, a fine of $100 maximum. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar considerations apply to the Bill's approach to homosexuality. I noted what the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) had to say on this matter, but I am as surprised as he appears to have been concerning criticisms. Clause 61 of the Bill follows Australian Capital Territory law-the Law Reform (Sexual Behaviour) Ordinance of 1976-in not making any offence out of the conduct of non -incestuous consenting adults in private. Under clause 3 (14) the concept of privacy does not apply to Service premises-other than married quarters-Service ships, aircraft or vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the question of how a uniform tri-service code will benefit the discipline and morale of all the armed Services, mention should be made of the Bill's approach to the offence of mutiny. Clause 20 of the Bill not only clarifies and modernises but also replaces different definitions of mutiny among the Services by a single rationalised definition of the offence. Under the old codes there is no statutory offence of mutiny in Army or Air Force law, although in general mutiny has been taken to be collective insubordination or the combination of two or more persons to resist lawful military authority or induce others to do so. The Navy, on the other hand, has had a statutory definition of mutiny. This not only encompasses such conduct as the Army and Air Force codes seem to cover but also deals with conduct subversive of discipline or with the object of avoiding duty or service against the enemy or conduct which impedes the performance of duty or service in the Navy or co-operating forces. The Bill in fact both simplifies and makes the law more definite in this area as well as ensuring a unified approach throughout the armed Services. Care is taken to distinguish between conduct intended to overthrow authority and conduct which is merely the expression of discontent and which is not directed towards the general overthrowal of lawful authority. The latter kind of conduct is to be covered under the Bill's provisions regarding disobedience to lawful commands- that is, under clause 27. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In doing so, I present the Budget for 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA> The past year has been an extremely difficult one for the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> The international recession is now hitting us hard. Our overseas markets have shrunk. Economic growth has faltered. Unemployment is rising. Inflation remains far too high. Interest rates are hurting many of us. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst much of this is due to the state of the world economy, the excessive growth of wages in Australia has made matters worse. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when Australian industries should be more competitive we have made ourselves less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> These developments have affected all Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> To some, the past year has meant either the loss of a job or job insecurity. </PARA>
<PARA> To those paying off a home, the past year has seen unwelcome increases in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> To those Australians who live in many parts of our rural areas, the added burden of a widespread drought has compounded other difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> In many parts of Australia major increases in electricity and other State charges have added to the burden of balancing the family budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Prospects for a rapid recovery in the world economy are at best very faint. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore unrealistic to expect a major recovery in the Australian economy to occur in the near future. There are no quick, easy solutions to our present problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a background has made the framing of this Budget by far the most difficult since the present Government took office. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand it was necessary to recognise that present economic conditions cause real hardship to many Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, we must never lose sight of the need to maintain an economic strategy which is responsible and which effectively addresses those economic developments which have contributed to our present situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accordingly endeavoured to balance these two considerations in the fairest and most responsible way possible. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, we have done all we can to provide relief, assistance and incentive within the confines of a responsible economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This has necessarily meant some increase in the size of the overall Budget deficit compared with last year. </PARA>
<PARA> But the outcome-a deficit of $1,674m-is only one per cent of gross domestic product and produces a domestic surplus of $230m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is confident that this deficit can be financed in a non- inflationary manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal features of this Budget are:</PARA>
<PARA> some personal tax relief and other assistance specifically designed to give maximum help to Australian families especially those on lower and middle incomes ;</PARA>
<PARA> interest relief for people paying off their home;</PARA>
<PARA> a shift in emphasis towards capital works expenditure, including a special roads program, with beneficial employment consequences;</PARA>
<PARA> increased assistance for pensioners;</PARA>
<PARA> the introduction of a new Family Income Supplement to help certain low income families;</PARA>
<PARA> an increase in job training opportunities and other help for the unemployed; and</PARA>
<PARA> some increases in indirect taxation and a modest broadening of the indirect tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> These items should be looked at in conjunction with the major incentives provided to Australian industry by the measures announced by the Prime Minister a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</PARA>
<PARA> Few predicted the extent of the present world recession. </PARA>
<PARA> For a period we in Australia were fortunate not to feel its full effects. </PARA>
<PARA> Our economic policies and relative energy endowments created a more favourable investment climate in Australia than in most other countries. This sustained our economic growth beyond that of others. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the continued deterioration of economic activity around the world with all its implications for trade and commodity and energy prices ultimately affected our exports. </PARA>
<PARA> It also dampened enthusiasm for a number of mineral and energy related projects . </PARA>
<PARA> These adverse international influences were compounded by a significant worsening on the domestic wages front. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for maximum wage restraint has therefore been much in the Government's mind in framing this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Further progress on this front must be achieved if we are to become more competitive as a nation, thus reaping in full the benefits of a revival of the world economy when it comes. </PARA>
<PARA> The plain, inescapable fact is that Australia has priced herself out of many world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, last year wage levels in this country grew by some 3 or 4 per cent more than the rate of inflation. By comparison recent wage settlements in West Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom, countries that rank among our major trading partners, have been around or less than the rates of inflation in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless our relative performance is improved, our living standards will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> This problem can only be solved through a total community commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent tripartite discussions between the Government, employers and the unions have already made a valuable contribution in this context. </PARA>
<PARA> For its part the Government will continue to follow those policies which create the right general economic environment for wage restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> As a major employer the Government has recently sought a significant degree of wage restraint in respect of its own employees. </PARA>
<PARA> There have already been a number of private sector and State government responses to this lead which the Government welcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The unions too have a major role to play. All of us must become more conscious of the appalling consequences in terms of more unemployment which flow from excessive wage rises. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government welcomes recent statements by some trade union leaders acknowledging the importance of wage restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation relief and other assistance, particularly for families, contained in this Budget should be taken account of by wage and salary earners in making their wage claims. </PARA>
<PARA>THE OUTCOME FOR 1981-82</PARA>
<PARA> For the year as a whole both production and employment grew more slowly than in the previous year-and more slowly than expected at the time of last year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, private business fixed investment still grew very strongly in real terms. Real personal consumption expenditure rose by 3 1/2 per cent; however, private dwelling investment fell by 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Exports remained flat and imports rose strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> Gross domestic product rose by 3 per cent and non-farm product by 2 1/4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of these figures, however, disguise the marked slowdown in activity which occurred during the course of 1981-82 as the effects of the international recession and adverse wage developments began to take their toll on the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, non-farm product grew at an annual rate of only one quarter of one per cent during the second half of 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> For 1981-82 as a whole, average weekly earnings appear to have risen by about 14 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> That figure would have been serious enough. However, it conceals the jump in average weekly earnings at an estimated annual rate of around 20 per cent between the December and June quarters. </PARA>
<PARA> It also conceals the fact that, during the year, shorter working hours added further to labour costs. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this was occurring at a time when overseas wage and price inflation was coming down. </PARA>
<PARA> In consequence, Australia's rate of wage and price inflation moved sharply above those of our major trading partners and the competitiveness of much of our industry was severely eroded, despite considerable depreciation of our exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the year to June 1982 Australia's inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 10.7 per cent-almost 2 per cent above the rate over the previous twelve months and some 4 per cent above the average for our major OECD trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The profit share fell in the first half of 1982 to the average level of 1974-75 . </PARA>
<PARA> Employers reacted quickly by pruning their labour forces, and unemployment, which had been gradually rising over the second half of 1981, has increased sharply so far in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates in Australia were extremely high during 1981-82 in both real and nominal terms, reflecting in a major way interest rates abroad. </PARA>
<PARA> Our high interest rates also reflected, however, domestic influences including the increased demand for funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth demands on financial markets were again lower but other levels of government continued to increase theirs. </PARA>
<PARA> Corporate sector borrowing also remained strong, even while the growth of private investment was slowing, since the squeeze on profits and cash flows increased the corporate sector's need to borrow for working capital purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>THE BUDGET OUTCOME FOR 1981-82</PARA>
<PARA> The overall Budget deficit in 1981-82 was $549m, the lowest since 1973-74. The deficit represented about 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product, the lowest such proportion since 1971-72. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome, however, was $453m higher than the Budget estimate, due entirely to outlays being one per cent higher than estimated at Budget time. </PARA>
<PARA> Contributing to the overrun on outlays were greater than expected increases in public sector wages and salaries, unemployment benefits and public debt interest . </PARA>
<PARA> Total receipts were marginally above the Budget estimate although there were variations in some of the main components. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, net PAYE and other individuals' income tax collections were higher than predicted by $162m and $202m respectively, the latter reflecting our successful campaign against tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, 1981-82 and 1980-81 have been the only occasions in the past six years that provisional tax collections have exceeded Budget estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>OUTLAYS</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the main expenditure provisions of the Budget. Further details are provided in the accompanying Budget documents, particularly Statement No. 3. Relevant Ministers will also be issuing more detailed statements. </PARA>
<PARA> Total outlays for 1982-83 are estimated to be $47 067, an increase of 13.9 per cent on last year, or in real terms just over 2 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In putting together this Budget, the Government has placed considerable emphasis on capital expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA> This emphasis is evident not only in the funding provided for programs of assistance to the States and local authorities but also in the Commonwealth's own civil works program. </PARA>
<PARA> Major items in this field include increased funding for housing, particularly welfare housing, enhanced accommodation programs for the aged and disabled, a significantly increased roads program and expanded airport development. </PARA>
<PARA> The greater spending under these programs will enhance employment prospects in those sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>DEFENCE</PARA>
<PARA> The Government remains strongly committed to increasing defence preparedness and improving Australia's defence capability. </PARA>
<PARA> The $4622m which we are providing in the Budget for defence represents an increase of 11.8 per cent on 1981-82 and implies some further real growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provision is expected to represent about 2.9 per cent of gross domestic product, in line with our target of 3 per cent by 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA> Further details will be provided to the Parliament by the Minister for Defence later in the year. </PARA>
<PARA>SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided on an extensive range of measures aimed at increased assistance to those most in need, particularly to pensioners and other social welfare beneficiaries, certain low income families and the handicapped. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to increase family allowances in order to further assist Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, total expenditure on social welfare is estimated to increase by $ 1774m or 15.4 per cent to $13 272m in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> I will outline the more significant items here. Details of these and other measures will be provided in separate statements by the Ministers for Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Families</PARA>
<PARA>Family Allowances</PARA>
<PARA> The rates of family allowance for the first and second child will be increased by 50 per cent with effect from November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> This follows the decision in last year's Budget to increase the rates of family allowance by 50 per cent for third and subsequent children. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate for the first child will be increased from $15.20 a month to $22.80 a month and the rate for the second child from $21.70 a month to $32.55 a month. A family with two or more children will therefore gain by $18.45 a month. </PARA>
<PARA> In all more than two million Australian families will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes are estimated to cost $250m in 1982-83 and $375m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Family Income Supplement</PARA>
<PARA> Special consideration has also been given to the needs of families on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> To this end the Government has decided to introduce from May 1983 a tax free Family Income Supplement of $10 a week for each dependent child of a low income family not in receipt of social security type pensions or benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the same rate of assistance per child paid for the children of pensioners and beneficiaries, and will ensure that low income working families with children are not disadvantaged by comparison with those on unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The full rate of Supplement will be paid to families whose joint income does not exceed the income limit under the disadvantaged persons health care arrangements for a married couple without children. In November 1982, this limit will be $184 per week, and this amount is subject to further upward adjustment in May 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments of the Supplement will be reduced by $1 for every $2 of income beyond that level of joint parental income. </PARA>
<PARA> The necessary administrative arrangements required to put a new benefit of this kind into operation will mean payments cannot commence until May 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The Supplement is estimated to cost $3.5m in 1982-83 and $30m in a full year. The Minister for Social Security will announce further details. </PARA>
<PARA>Children's Services Program</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has undertaken a thorough review of the children's services program. As a result, total expenditure under that program will be increased by 28 per cent to $103m in 1982-83 and a number of innovations will be undertaken. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> an increase in the operational support grants to family day care schemes from $ 7 to $10 a week per child in full time care;</PARA>
<PARA> the development of an income test to determine eligibility for a fee rebate for pre-school day care for families in need; and</PARA>
<PARA> the three year pilot Youth Services Scheme has been extended for one year to 30 June 1983 to enable final evaluation of the Scheme. Additional funds will be made available to increase assistance to existing projects for this period.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security will announce further details. </PARA>
<PARA>Indexation of Pensions and Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> Basic pension and benefit rates will continue to be adjusted each November and May in line with movements in the consumer price index. In November the standard or single rate of social security pension, for example, will rise by $3.10 to $ 77.25 a week, while the combined married rate will increase by $5.20 to $128.80 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Later in this Speech, I shall announce details of a special tax rebate for pensioners designed to improve the relative position of pensioners with small non-pension incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>Rental Assistance for Pensioners</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises the special problems faced by many pensioners in rented accommodation. Following an increase of $3 in the maximum rate of supplementary rental assistance in February of this year, from November 1982 it will be further increased by $2 a week to $10 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> This is estimated to cost an additional $16.7m in 1982-83 and about $24m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Pension Income and Fringe Benefit Limits</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to increase the levels of private income that pensioners and supporting parents can receive without any reduction in their pension. The levels were last increased in 1972. The new levels will increase by 50 per cent to $30 a week for single pensioners and by 45 per cent to $50 a week for pensioner couples from November 1982; higher levels apply where there are children. </PARA>
<PARA> This will mean, for example, that a married couple in receipt of an age pension will be able to receive a total gross income of $178.80 a week before their pension is diminished on the basis of 50 cents for each $1 of non-pension income in excess of $50 a week. The pension will not be totally withdrawn until their gross income reaches $307.60 a week. Comparable figures for a single pensioner are $107.25 and $184.50 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The income limits for fringe benefit entitlement including pensioner health benefits are also to be raised. From November 1982, these will be increased by 35 per cent to $54 a week for single pensioners and by 32 per cent to $90 a week for pensioner couples. Additions to the limit for dependent children will be raised to a uniform $20 a week for each child. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are estimated to cost $72.2m in 1982-83 and about $110m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Unemployment and Sickness Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided on further measures to assist the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The non-indexed rate of unemployment benefit for persons 18 years and over without dependants will be increased from $58.10 a week to $64.40 a week and the rate of unemployment and sickness benefit for persons under 18 years will be raised from $36 to $40 a week. Both increases will take effect from November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The income tests for unemployment and sickness benefits are to be standardised with an increased uniform 'free area' of $10 a week and an increase to $60 a week in the upper limit to the range of non-benefit income over which the benefit is reduced on a 50 per cent basis. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are estimated to cost $68.1m in 1982-83 and about $103m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, eligibility for pensioner health benefits has been extended to all sickness beneficiaries irrespective of income. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance to the Handicapped</PARA>
<PARA> For 1982-83, we have decided on a range of measures that will meet many of the concerns expressed by groups of the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> The main initiatives are:</PARA>
<PARA> the introduction, from April 1983, of a non-taxable mobility allowance of $10 a week for severely handicapped people in employment or undertaking vocational training who are unable to use public transport;</PARA>
<PARA> a $12 a month increase in the rate of handicapped child's allowance, to $85 a month from November 1982; and</PARA>
<PARA> $750,000 to improve and extend regional services under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. </PARA>
<PARA>Accommodation for the Aged or Disabled</PARA>
<PARA> As already announced, additional capital funds will be made available for aged or disabled persons' accommodation. Over the next two years $170m will be provided for the program with $83m being allocated in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, $37m and $14m will be spent over the next two years on capital facilities under the Handicapped Persons' Assistance Program and on senior citizens' centres; $18.5m and $7m respectively are to be spent in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>Personal Care Subsidy</PARA>
<PARA> We have decided to increase the personal care subsidy from $20 to $30 a week for each eligible person in hostel-type accommodation, backdated to July 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The cost of this measure is estimated to be $12m in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance to Veterans</PARA>
<PARA> New measures of particular importance to veterans include the following:</PARA>
<PARA> the disability pension will be totally disregarded in the income test for service pension and fringe benefits;</PARA>
<PARA> repatriation treatment benefits are to be extended to veterans of World War II who receive not less than 50 per cent disability pension plus a service pension;</PARA>
<PARA> service pension eligibility is to be extended, with effect from 3 February 1983 , to Commonwealth and allied merchant mariners;</PARA>
<PARA> the disability pension at the 100 per cent general rate will be restored for pulmonary tuberculosis from 6 January 1983, for those veterans who were in receipt of the benefit prior to 2 November 1978;</PARA>
<PARA> the maximum rate of repatriation funeral benefit will be increased from $400 to $500 and the eligibility tests will be eased; and</PARA>
<PARA> there will be increases in many supplementary repatriation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> These initiatives are expected to cost $14.5 million in 1982-83 and about $24m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Aboriginals</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $164m-a 12.4 per cent increase-for Aboriginal advancement programs administered by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. $51.4m of this is for the Aboriginal Development Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, other expenditure programs directed specifically to assisting Aboriginals, including programs funded under other portfolios, total about $107m . </PARA>
<PARA>HEALTH</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $3379m for health services, an increase of 16 per cent on 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>Pharmaceutical Benefits</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to introduce a three-tier Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from 1 January 1983, to provide further benefits to pensioners and the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> These new arrangements will operate as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> those pensioners and beneficiaries who have been receiving their pharmaceutical benefits free of charge will continue to do so;</PARA>
<PARA> a new concessional contribution rate of $2.00 per benefit item will be introduced for health care card holders and their dependants and all pensioners not already entitled to free pharmaceuticals; and</PARA>
<PARA> the general patient contribution rate will rise from $3.20 to $4.00 per benefit item. </PARA>
<PARA> The expected net cost is $2.8m in 1982-83 and about $7m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Payments to pharmacists for dispensing pharmaceutical benefit items were increased from 1 July at an estimated cost of $8m for this year. In addition, the Government has agreed to an increase in drug prices-3 per cent on the price to chemists plus 9 cents per benefit item-from 1 November 1982 with an estimated cost of $12.4m for 1982-83 and $24.8m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83, total direct outlays on education are estimated to increase by 13.5 per cent to $3792 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of these funds-over $3000m-are being spent on the programs administered by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education and Schools Commissions. Details of the funding for these programs in 1983 have already been announced. </PARA>
<PARA>Student Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> In making its decisions in this area, the Government has had in mind the high level of youth unemployment, lower participation rates in education and the difficulties faced by many very low income families in meeting the cost of their children remaining at school or attending a tertiary institution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has therefore decided on a number of changes in student assistance programs for the 1983 academic year. </PARA>
<PARA> Allowances under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the Secondary Allowances Scheme will be increased by 20 per cent and allowances under other student assistance schemes by 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 the number of Commonwealth Post-graduate Awards will be increased by 100 to 900 and the basic allowance raised from $4620 to $6850 per annum, an increase of 48 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The income test requirements of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme will be eased with the limits being increased by 11 per cent for 1983. In addition, the limits for the Secondary Allowances Scheme will be adjusted to the same level, an increase of over 44 per cent in limits for this Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of these two Schemes is estimated to increase this financial year by $ 17m and the number of beneficiaries to increase by over 10 000 in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>Student Loans Scheme</PARA>
<PARA> The foreshadowed Tertiary Student Loans Scheme will commence from the beginning of 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to a means test, loans of up to $1000 per year to a total of $8000 over the period of full time tertiary study will be available, with a generous interest rate subsidy and exemption from repayment for up to two years after completion of study. </PARA>
<PARA> Thereafter a repayment period of up to 10 years is provided for. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Education will announce further details. </PARA>
<PARA>HOUSING ASSISTANCE</PARA>
<PARA> Over recent months the Government has announced significant improvements in housing assistance measures. The total of $571m provided for housing expenditure in this Budget includes:</PARA>
<PARA> a significant increase in welfare housing assistance to at least $333m-an increase of 27 per cent on 1981-82 outlays-which can be supplemented by additional funds nominated by the States through their works and housing programs; and</PARA>
<PARA> $147m, an increase of about 28 per cent over 1981-82, as grants to first home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, $20m has been provided as the Commonwealth's contribution to a new Mortgage and Rent Relief Program to provide assistance to families facing severe financial hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to ask the Reserve Bank of Australia to consider making a release of one percentage point from the Statutory Reserve Deposits it holds from the major trading banks for the special purpose of lending for housing. Any such release would, of course, be additional to the amount of $400m the major banks agreed to increase their home lending by earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall be announcing further housing assistance measures later tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING PROGRAMS</PARA>
<PARA> Increased unemployment, particularly amongst young Australians, which the current economic difficulties have produced, requires further emphasis on employment and job training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Last financial year we spent $206m in this area. In 1982-83 this will be increased by 21 per cent to $250m. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall continue to give special weight to assistance programs for the young unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Employers will be encouraged to provide more opportunities for unemployed young people to obtain work experience and job skills and to become established in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure on assistance for work experience is to rise by $20m or 37 per cent to $74m in 1982-83. This will allow for over 74,000 new work experience placements in 1982-83 and increases of up to 36 per cent in the rate of subsidy to employers. </PARA>
<PARA> Support for the apprenticeship intake will also be maintained through significant increases in CRAFT rebates, with effect from the beginning of 1983. Total outlay on CRAFT in 1982-83 is estimated at $84m. This will enable employers to receive assistance in respect of some 111,000 apprentices in 1982- 83, compared to 99,000 last year. </PARA>
<PARA>CULTURE AND RECREATION</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $501m for culture and recreation activities in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Broadcasting Commission will receive $256m, which will permit some expansion of activity. </PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $12m has been provided for the installation of new transmitters and translators, including $1m to commence a three year program for the extension of multicultural television. </PARA>
<PARA> The Special Broadcasting Service has also been allocated $26.2m in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Other expenditures of note are:</PARA>
<PARA> 34m for the Australian Council including about $3.7m for the Australian Opera, more than $3m for the Elizabethan Theatre Trust orchestras and about $1.8m for the Australian Ballet Foundation;</PARA>
<PARA> $15m for the Australian National Gallery, which is planned to open in October this year;</PARA>
<PARA> $26m for sports programs, which includes $4m for operating expenses of the Australian Institute of Sport, over $8m for payments to State and Territory governments to develop international sporting facilities, and assistance for sport and recreation for disabled people; and</PARA>
<PARA> an increase of over 50 per cent in expenditure on the Australian War Memorial. This includes a significant provision for the Memorial's permanent exhibition and its collection and very necessary repairs and maintenance to Memorial buildings. </PARA>
<PARA>FOREIGN AID</PARA>
<PARA> A total of $713m is provided for foreign aid expenditure in the Budget, an increase of $72m on last year's expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Priority will continue to be given to bilateral assistance to Papua New Guinea and countries in South-East Asia and the South Pacific region in addition to continuing support for various multilateral and regional organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>ASSISTANCE TO INDUSTRY</PARA>
<PARA> In his Statement of 19 July last, the Prime Minister announced major new incentives for Australia's manufacturing, mining and rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, these included more generous depreciation provisions, a continuation of the Industrial Research and Development Scheme and a significant strengthening of the Export Market Development Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Depreciation allowances were also introduced for all new non-residential income producing buildings. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures were introduced in recognition of the subdued level of economic activity at present and the special need to make all sections of Australian industry as competitive as possible, particularly those striving to win export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> A revival of the fortunes of those Australian industries now experiencing difficulties and an expansion of job opportunities within those industries will depend very largely upon an improvement in general economic conditions, particularly at the international level. However, the measures announced by the Prime Minister will greatly enhance the ability of Australian industry to take part in a revival when general economic conditions do begin to pick up. </PARA>
<PARA> This year total Budget outlays for industry assistance and development are estimated to exceed $1,000m for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA>Rural Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> The extended drought in many parts of Australia has already had an extremely serious effect on large sections of our rural industries which are so vital to our export earnings as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have made an interest free advance of $10m to the New South Wales Government for drought relief purposes in that State. The Government has the drought situation under constant surveillance and stands ready to provide appropriate further assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision in 1980 to allow immediate write off of the cost of water storage facilities as a drought relief measure has been of considerable help to primary producers. Tax savings as a result of this to primary producers to end 1981-82 are estimated at more than $30m. </PARA>
<PARA> Net payments from this year's Budget to rural industries are estimated to total $313m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will seek passage of the phosphate and nitrogenous fertilizer subsidy legislation in this Parliamentary session. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the depressed conditions being experienced in the cattle and meat industries, the Government has decided to write off the industry debt in respect of the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign, estimated to be $23.5m . </PARA>
<PARA> Charges under the Campaign of up to $4 per head will be levied from 1 October 1982 and reviewed annually to ensure contributions cover the industry's share of future costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Water Resources Programs</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides $41.7m for the National Water Resources Program, an increase of 27.5 per cent on 1981-82 expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> A further $6.5m is expected to be provided in 1982-83 for the construction of the Burdekin Dam. </PARA>
<PARA>Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme</PARA>
<PARA> Total expenditure on this Scheme in 1981-82 amounted to some $148m. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has in recent times become concerned that the Scheme could be the subject of some abuse and fraud which might have caused some of the significant cost increases which have occurred in the operation of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> It has therefore been decided that the Scheme should be the subject of a thorough review. Pending the outcome of the review the Scheme will be amended to subsidise freight cost differentials in excess of 1 cent per litre instead of 0. 44 cents per litre as previously applied. </PARA>
<PARA> Further details will be announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. </PARA>
<PARA>TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION</PARA>
<PARA> Total Budget outlays on transport and communication are estimated to increase by 25 per cent to $1,475m. </PARA>
<PARA>Roads Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> Under the normal roads program the Commonwealth will provide $734 million to the States and the Northern Territory this financial year as part of our undertaking to provide a total of $3,650m for roads over the five years to 1984- 85. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition-and as a major initiative to bring about a lasting improvement in the road and transport system of the nation-the Government has decided to establish an Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. </PARA>
<PARA> Its goals are to be achieved by 1988, our Bicentennial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The special Bicentennial Road Development Program will include national, arterial and local roads in all parts of Australia and also provide for upgrading elements of our urban transport network. </PARA>
<PARA> The priorities and allocations under this Program will be finally determined by the Commonwealth Government. It will be a fundamental requirement of the Program that the States and local government at least maintain in real terms their expenditure on roads and in other areas touched by the Program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Program will be entirely funded by a special surcharge on motor spirit and distillate. This will initially be set at 1 cent per litre, with expenditure under the Program totalling $150m in 1982-83. The surcharge will be increased on 1 July 1983 to 2 cents per litre. </PARA>
<PARA> The proceeds of this surcharge will be paid into a special trust fund so that none of those proceeds can be used for purposes other than the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. </PARA>
<PARA> About $2,500 million is expected to be provided under this Program over the period to 1988-89. Further details will be announced tonight by the Minister for Transport and Construction. </PARA>
<PARA>Air Navigation Charges</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to increase air navigation charges for domestic trunk and regional airlines by 20 per cent and for the general aviation sector by 12 per cent, effective from 1 October 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional recoveries of $8.4m in 1982-83 and $12.5m in a full year are expected from these higher charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Charges for the international sector, where there is already full cost recovery , will remain unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA>Rail</PARA>
<PARA> Budget outlays are estimated to be $94.5m for rail transport in 1982-83 of which $21.8m is allocated to mainline upgrading and $3m is provided for the continued planning of the proposed Alice Springs to Darwin railway. </PARA>
<PARA>Domestic Communications Satellite</PARA>
<PARA> A further equity contribution of $18m will be provided to AUSSAT Pty Ltd, which will own and operate the proposed domestic satellite communications system to be introduced in Australia in 1985. It is planned that, in due course, the private sector will be invited to take up a substantial equity interest in AUSSAT Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>The New Australia Telescope</PARA>
<PARA> The work of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization has won world respect, not least in radio physics through the work of the radio telescope at Parkes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has now decided to fund the construction by CSIRO of a new radio telescope to cost a total of $25m to be known as the Australia Telescope and to be completed by our Bicentennial year 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>PAYMENTS TO THE STATES, NORTHERN TERRITORY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT</PARA>
<PARA> The major decisions affecting payments to the States have already been announced. </PARA>
<PARA> Total net payments to the States, the Northern Territory and local government, including all specific purpose payments, are estimated to increase by $1,956m or 13.9 per cent in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Special assistance totalling $105m for various capital purposes is also being provided to a number of States. This assistance is expected to have beneficial employment consequences. The details are:</PARA>
<PARA> $20m to Western Australia for sewage works in the Cockburn Sound area with $12. 1m being made available this year;</PARA>
<PARA> $10m to Tasmania for tourist road development in 1982-83;</PARA>
<PARA> $10m to South Australia for upgrading water supply facilities in 1982-83; and</PARA>
<PARA> $35m to Victoria, $20m to Queensland and $10m to South Australia in 1982-83 for upgrading their transportation systems. </PARA>
<PARA> In this same general context it should be noted that removal of the $1 a tonne coal export levy, at a cost to revenue of $25m this year, will be of particular benefit to New South Wales, which is the source of the great bulk of export coal in this category. </PARA>
<PARA>CAPITAL WORKS</PARA>
<PARA> Taking direct capital expenditures together with capital grants and net advances, the total provided by the Budget for capital purposes in 1982-83 is over $4,000m, an increase of more than 17 per cent on similar outlays in 1981-82 . </PARA>
<PARA> By far the major part of this amount will fund capital works. </PARA>
<PARA>Budget-Financed Civil Works</PARA>
<PARA> Some $336m in 1982-83 is for civil works financed directly from the Budget. This is an increase of $136m or 68 per cent on 1981-82 expenditures and will provide a boost to the building and construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Airports</PARA>
<PARA> Airport works approved for commencement in 1982-83 are estimated to cost a total of $355m over the next four years and $49m in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Included are major development works for Brisbane, Perth and Townsville airports and the upgrading of facilities at a number of other airports. </PARA>
<PARA> Also included is $12m under the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan for the upgrading of a number of country airports in New South Wales and Queensland to permit the introduction of medium jet aircraft to those centres and for new developments associated with the transfer of Government airports to local ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> Total expenditure in 1982-83 under the Plan is estimated at $38m. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Civil Works</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to proceed in 1982-83 with major redevelopment works at Repatriation General Hospitals at Daw Park and Hollywood, extensions to the National Library, and the construction of an indoor sports training facility for the Australian Institute of Sport. </PARA>
<PARA>RECEIPTS</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the revenue proposals. Total receipts are estimated at $45,393m, an increase of 11.3 per cent on last year or, in real terms, of only 0.3 per cent. This is the smallest real rise in receipts for ten years. </PARA>
<PARA> A major factor in producing such a small rise in revenue collections is the impact of the slowdown in economic growth on collections of income and company taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Revenue collections have also been affected by the taxation reductions in certain areas which I am about to announce. </PARA>
<PARA> As will be apparent from recent decisions and from other announcements contained in this Speech, the Government remains committed to effective measures against both tax avoidance and evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> In a separate statement tonight I shall indicate steps we shall take to recover unpaid Division 7 tax in 'bottom of the harbour' cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Our past legislation has proved effective. The most recent evidence of this is the fact that the Commissioner of Taxation has informed the Government that this financial year it will not be necessary to make an adjustment to projected revenue collections to allow for tax avoidance losses in the way that has been done in the last several years. </PARA>
<PARA> Our continuing success on this front played no small part in making it possible to provide some personal tax relief in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Personal Income Tax</PARA>
<PARA> We propose to make a substantial reduction in the personal income tax burden and, in so doing, give particular attention to those on low to average incomes and to the needs of families. </PARA>
<PARA> With these objectives in mind, three changes in the tax scales are proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the tax-free threshold is to be increased by $400 per annum, from $4,195 to $4,595. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that no tax will be payable until a taxpayer's annual income exceeds $4,595. As a result of this change alone about 300,000 pensioners and low income earners who would otherwise pay tax in 1982-83 will not now do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the standard rate of tax is to be reduced from 32 per cent to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the top of the standard rate step, namely the point above which a taxpayer commences to pay 46 per cent of each additional dollar he or she earns in tax, is to be increased from $17,894 to $19,500. </PARA>
<PARA> The most direct and highly beneficial consequence of this change is that many thousands of average wage and salary earners now have the incentive to earn additional income without fear of moving into a higher tax bracket. </PARA>
<PARA> This change will also mean that about 75 per cent of all Australian taxpayers will be on the new and lower standard rate after 1 November. </PARA>
<PARA> The combined effect of these three measures will be to provide the largest proportionate tax reductions to those receiving lower taxable incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Detailed tables illustrating these changes at various income levels are being provided. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a taxpayer on average weekly earnings of about $344.60 will receive a boost in his take home pay of $7.65 as a result of the changes I have just explained. </PARA>
<PARA>Single Income Families</PARA>
<PARA> To give additional help to single income families with dependent children it is proposed to increase the dependent spouse rebate by $200 per year, from $830 per annum to $1,030 per annum, where there are dependent (including student) children. </PARA>
<PARA> For a taxpayer on the average wage with a dependent wife and children, this particular measure will mean a further tax saving of $3.85 per week, additional to the saving of $7.65 arising from the general tax reductions outlined earlier.</PARA>
<PARA> These same levels of rebate will apply for a housekeeper or daughter- housekeeper where there are dependent children. The sole parent rebate will also be raised by $200, to $780 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>Commencement Date and Cost</PARA>
<PARA> All of these changes will take effect from 1 November 1982 and will be reflected in PAYE instalments, and hence paypackets, from that date. </PARA>
<PARA> For assessment purposes, the rate scale applied to 1982-83 taxable incomes will be an average of one-third of the present scale and two-thirds of the new scale.</PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the increase of $200 per annum in the rebates which I have mentioned will average $133 for the 1982-83 income year, reflecting the operation of the higher level for two-thirds of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of the various personal income tax measures I have mentioned is estimated at $1,570m in 1982-83 and $2,567m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Net PAYE income tax collections will be 2 per cent lower in real terms this year than last. </PARA>
<PARA>Pensioner Rebate</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past year there has been growing concern amongst pensioners in Australia that, in the absence of corrective action, their pensions would increase to the point where the pension alone would become taxable. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major reasons for our decision to increase the tax-free threshold to $4,595 per annum, or approximately $88 per week, was to stop this occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in addition, we have decided to introduce a special pensioner rebate for income tax purposes. This will ensure that people wholly or mainly dependent on a taxable pension do not bear tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum rebate will be $250 per annum. This means that a pensioner can have a total income including a pension of $5,429 per year without having to pay any tax. For every additional dollar of income that a pensioner has over and above $ 5,429 per year, the amount of that rebate will be reduced by 12 1/2 cents, so that by the time a pensioner's income reaches $7,429 the rebate will no longer be applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> The rebate will take effect from 1 November 1982 and, for assessment purposes, the level of 1982-83 maximum rebate will be $167, with corresponding shading-out provisions above $5,007. </PARA>
<PARA> Married pensioners will each be entitled to the same rebate as a single pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA> This rebate is estimated to cost $7m in 1982-83 and $36m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the increased income to pensioners as a result of the combination of cash benefits and reductions in tax from November this year, ranges from up to $12.79 per week for a single pensioner to $17.08 per week for a couple, along with the extension of fringe benefit entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA>Non-resident Taxpayers</PARA>
<PARA> At present the first $4,195 of taxable income of non-resident as well as resident individuals is free of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the reasons for freeing residents from tax on the lowest slice of income seldom have much relevance to non-residents, and there is already no tax free amount for withholding tax purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore proposed to withdraw the effect of the zero rate from non- residents, other than those in receipt of taxable social security and repatriation payments, and subject that slice of income to tax at the standard rate. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure will have some anti-tax avoidance benefits and is in line with overseas practice. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure which, subject to some matters mentioned in Statement No. 4, will take effect from tonight is estimated to yield $1m in 1982-83 and $15m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Home Loan Interest Rebate</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to provide some taxation relief to people who are paying off their home, irrespective of whether it is their first home, thus broadening in a significant way the housing interest relief which I announced on 18 March this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The new rebate will allow persons paying off their own home to claim (in 1982- 83) a rebate at the standard rate on the amount of interest they pay on their housing loan, from any source, over and above 10 per cent on up to $60,000 of mortgage or other loan arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a taxpayer paying interest at 13.5 per cent on a mortgage from a savings bank of $25,000 would obtain a rebate of $5.05 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, if a taxpayer had a building society mortgage of $30,000 at an interest rate of 15 per cent, the rebate would be $8.65 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligibility for this scheme will, of course, be restricted to the sole or principal residence of a taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the present scheme, the new rebate will not be limited to first home owners nor the first five years of home ownership, and the amount of rebate will not be subject to specified ceilings. </PARA>
<PARA> First home buyers will still be able to use the existing scheme, rather than the new scheme, where it confers the larger rebate. </PARA>
<PARA> PAYE instalments can be adjusted to allow for the rebate from 1 November 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The rebates scheme already in place would, on its own, have cost $100m in 1982- 83 and $230m in a full year. It is estimated that the effect of the new measure will be to add $55m in 1982-83 and $185m in a full year, to the overall revenue cost. </PARA>
<PARA>Rebate on Dividend Income</PARA>
<PARA> It is a fundamental part of the philosophy of the Government parties that maximum encouragement be given to small investors. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result we have had under study for some time submissions from many suggesting that there should be some relief given from so-called double taxation of dividend income. This issue was the subject of recommendations by the Campbell Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided-as from 1982-83-to allow a rebate at the standard rate of tax on up to $1000 of dividends included in taxable income received by resident individual shareholders from resident companies. Certain exceptions are noted in Statement No. 4. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is estimated to cost $36m in 1982-83 and $75m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Employee Share Acquisition Schemes</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also received many representations to provide a greater incentive for schemes whereby employees can purchase shares in the companies which employ them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government sees merit in this idea. We have therefore decided to provide an incentive whereby employees will not be subject to tax on any benefits arising from the price at which shares are issued under an approved scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that this course of action will provide benefits to productivity and industrial harmony. There is much to commend the view that employees should feel an increasing stake in the fortunes of the companies employing them. </PARA>
<PARA> Guidelines for approved schemes will include the important requirements that the shares are offered to all employees on a non-discriminatory basis and that, at the time of allocation, the discount on market price does not exceed 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This is estimated to cost $5m in a full year, but will not affect revenue in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>Retention Allowance for Private Companies</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has previously indicated that it would examine further the distribution requirements on private companies under Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> We now propose to increase the retention allowance for trading or business income by 10 per cent, ie from 70 to 80 per cent, for distributions from taxable incomes of 1981-82 and subsequent years. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that in the time it has been in office this Government will have increased the retention allowance for private companies from 50 per cent to 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> No change is being made to the 10 per cent retention allowance for property income or to the rule that there is no retention allowance for dividends received by one private company from another. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is estimated to cost $2m in 1982-83 and $30m in a full year and should be of considerable benefit to the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Gift Provisions</PARA>
<PARA> A number of conservation organisations will be given access to the gift provisions of the income tax law. Full details of eligible organisations are provided in a separate release. </PARA>
<PARA>Company Groups</PARA>
<PARA> Both the Asprey and Campbell Committees expressed support for provisions which would allow losses by one company in a group to be offset against profits of others in the group, where there is effectively 100 per cent common ownership of the companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government proposes to introduce measures to give effect to such a provision, supported by various safeguarding and other technical provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax Evasion through Cash Payments</PARA>
<PARA> In recent times, much of the debate on tax avoidance and evasion has tended to concentrate almost exclusively on sophisticated tax avoidance arrangements and has therefore largely ignored the enormous losses to revenue which occur through the so-called cash economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that as much if not more revenue is lost through outright evasion and non-declaration of income together than under artifical tax avoidance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore as part of its ongoing policy against both tax avoidance and evasion the Government has taken a firm decision to introduce from 1 July 1983 a system of deducting at source an amount on account of tax in respect of certain payments for labour and services. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be separate from the normal PAYE system although it will operate like that system in respect of payments to which it applies. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certain industries where evasion poses particular problems. </PARA>
<PARA> An information paper on the proposed new system is being released tonight. The new system will be the subject of extensive discussion and consultation with relevant industry groups and representatives of the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Government has taken a firm decision to launch the new system it wishes to fully consult affected groups regarding implementation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will take particular care when implementing this system to protect the separate status of sub-contractors. The thrust of the change is to ensure that the honest sub-contractor is not put at a competitive disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> The revenue effects of this measure will begin to be felt in 1983-84 and I am advised that the revenue gained in that year from these measures will be in the order of $500m. </PARA>
<PARA>Indirect Taxation</PARA>
<PARA> Although the overall taxation burden in Australia is relatively low amongst industrialised countries our reliance on direct personal taxation as a source of revenue is relatively high amongst those countries. The Government has always seen merit in gradually moving away from an over-reliance on personal income tax as a source of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget contains significant net reductions in personal income tax and the opportunity has been taken to achieve a modest broadening and deepening of the indirect tax base. </PARA>
<PARA>Sales Tax</PARA>
<PARA> Two measures are proposed in the sales tax area. </PARA>
<PARA> First, after tonight each of the three rates on goods at present taxable will be increased by 2 1/2 percentage points, raising an estimated $370m in 1982-83 and $490m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, it is proposed that a number of goods which are at present exempt be made taxable as from 1 January 1983 at a rate of 7 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This broadening of the sales tax base is to include goods such as hand tools, construction equipment and manchester. It does not include what some have regarded as the 'necessities of life'. </PARA>
<PARA> Further details are given in Statement No. 4 and in the legislation being introduced tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> This extension of the sales tax base is estimated to yield $44m in 1982-83 and $105m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Excises</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to excises. </PARA>
<PARA>Off-Road Use of Distillate</PARA>
<PARA> Exemption of excise duty on diesel fuel is allowed at present for all use off public roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption arrangements have proved difficult to administer so as to prevent abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also some evidence that because of price advantages excise-exempt distillate is being used for purposes such as heating and power generation for which other fuels would be more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> The concession also ensures certain competitive advantages, for example, rail transport as against road transport. </PARA>
<PARA> As from tonight, all diesel fuel will bear the full rate of excise duty, irrespective of its end use. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall however introduce a system to allow users to claim rebates of this excise in respect of certain categories of off-road end use-broadly, domestic use, hospitals, nursing and convalescent homes and in the agricultural, mining, fishing and forestry industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will contain provisions allowing claims to be made in respect of diesel fuel purchased from tonight in the specified end uses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce will advise the Parliament of further details. </PARA>
<PARA> The changed arrangements are estimated to yield a net increase in revenue of $ 161m in 1982-83 at the previously existing excise rate of 5.155 cents per litre and $176m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA>Beer and Tobacco Excise</PARA>
<PARA> Excise rates on beer and tobacco products have not been increased since 1978; the real rates of such duties during this period have declined by about 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Beer and tobacco products excise rates will increase by approximately 15 per cent and 20 per cent respectively with effect from tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in excise on beer-only the fourth in twenty-four years-will be by 8 cents to 60 cents per litre. </PARA>
<PARA> While retail price effects will depend on mark-up practices in the industry, the increase in the price of a glass of beer as a result of the rate increase could be 3 or 4 cents. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure is estimated to yield an additional $113m in 1982-83 and $135m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Excise rates on tobacco products will rise by approximately 20 per cent to $29. 70 per kilogram for cigarettes, $15.10 for manufactured tobacco and $25.34 for cigars. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures are estimated to raise about $98m in 1982-83 and $125m in a full year and could raise the retail price of a packet of 20 cigarettes by about 12- 14 cents. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no increases this year in the rates of excise on potable spirits.</PARA>
<PARA> However, some spirits are subject to sales tax and will therefore be affected by the general sales tax increases I announced earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> For each of the excise increases announced tonight, there will be commensurate increases in the corresponding customs duties on imports. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax on Bank Transactions</PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the Government's desire to broaden the indirect tax base, it is proposed to introduce a tax on certain bank transactions, with effect from 1 January 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax will apply to all debits to bank accounts that are subject to operation by cheque or like payment instrument, whether or not the particular debit arises from a cheque (or like) transaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Four rates of tax will apply, ranging from 10 cents on debits of less than $100 , to $1 on debits of $5000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA> Full details will be given in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This measure is estimated to raise $80 million in 1982-83 and $200 million in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> All these measures are detailed in Statement No. 4. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duty</PARA>
<PARA> Several amendments of a technical nature are proposed for stamp duties in the Australian Capital Territory, with the aim of removing anomalies and bringing the ACT duties more into line with those of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Their revenue effect is negligible. </PARA>
<PARA>THE BUDGET'S IMPACT ON FAMILIES</PARA>
<PARA> As I have already said, the Government is particularly concerned at the effect of current economic circumstances on average Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation and other assistance measures of a general character contained in the Budget have been designed to give maximum help to the generality of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, in a genuine sense, this Budget deserves the description of a family Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me illustrate by referring to the impact of this Budget on a family comprising a sole breadwinner with a dependent spouse and two dependent children , who in 1982-83 will have an income of $300 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also assume that the person is paying off the family home and has a mortgage liability of $25 000 at an interest rate of 13 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This family will receive the following main benefits as a result of the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> The personal tax changes from 1 November will mean an extra $10.54 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> The home loan interest rebate will mean an extra $5.05 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in family allowances will mean an extra $4.25 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> The total benefit from these measures will therefore be some $19.84 per week to this family. </PARA>
<PARA> If we assume that this famiily has a consumption pattern similar to the weightings for the CPI and spends all of its disposable income, the direct effect on it of indirect taxes in this Budget could be about $3 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the net weekly benefits for this family of this Budget would be about $16.84 per week. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me stress again that the above is an average example only and subject to qualification on that account. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it does illustrate the substantial family benefits contained in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Detailed tables illustrating some of the Budget's effects on families in different situations will be made available. </PARA>
<PARA>BUDGET OVERVIEW</PARA>
<PARA> Total outlays in 1982-83 are estimated to increase by 13.9 per cent to $47 067m ; this is an increase of 2.6 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Total receipts are estimated to increase by 11.3 per cent in 1982-83 to $45 393m; this is an increase of 0.3 per cent in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall Budget deficit is therefore estimated at $1674m, an increase of $ 1125m on the outcome for 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> After allowance for transactions abroad, there will be an estimated domestic Budget surplus of $230m. </PARA>
<PARA>ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</PARA>
<PARA> In framing the Budget the Government has tried to give relief and assistance to those in the community who most need it within the confines of a Budget which is economically responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget does not represent a change in our economic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be seen as lessening our commitment to achieve a substantial and sustained reduction in inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this year's deficit is bigger than last year's outcome, it remains at only 1 per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> For only the third time in the last eight years a domestic surplus is being budgeted for. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is intent that the deficit will be financed in a non- inflationary manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Our armoury of monetary policy instruments has recently been greatly improved. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of recent Loan Council decisions regarding the setting of the interest rate on Australian Savings Bonds and the move to a tender system for selling Treasury Bonds, we now have much greater freedom than in the past to use those instruments in the achievement of our monetary objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates on each of the three types of Commonwealth security can now vary with the requirements of the market so as to ensure adequate sales to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with those requirements, we have already increased the rate of interest on Australian Savings Bonds and conducted the first, quite successful, Treasury Bond tender. </PARA>
<PARA> In last year's Budget, I announced an M3 projection of 10 to 11 per cent over the course of 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome, at 11.3 per cent, was very close to that projection. </PARA>
<PARA> On a number of occasions I have expressed reservations concerning the June on June basis of measurement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is prone to erratic and unpredictable short-term factors, particularly in the closing months of the year, which can give a misleading indication of underlying monetary developments. </PARA>
<PARA> This year's projection will therefore be expressed as an annual average growth rate; that is, in terms of the movement in the average level of M3 between one financial year and the next. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government in fact gave serious thought this year to formally abandoning the announcement of a monetary projection. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from anything else, there are many who would argue that M3 is a less than representative measure of overall credit and monetary conditions and that a complete assessment of the monetary situation necessitates a review of a range of aggregates. </PARA>
<PARA> But because a projection is generally seen by the market as important to expectations and as a useful indication of the Government's intentions, we decided to retain it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would want to make it clear that the projected range is in fact a projection only and should not be taken as a firm target. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not, as some would wish to make it, become a formal measure of the success or failure of monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, the Government will be seeking to restrain the growth of financial aggregates to a degree consistent with growth in M3 within the range of 9-11 per cent for 1982-83 as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Monetary policy will be directed at enhancing the recent signs of slowing in the growth in wages and encouraging settlements in the major wage agreements in the months ahead that will provide a basis for improving business sector profitability and thus arresting the recent sharp deterioration in the employment situation. </PARA>
<PARA> A more market responsive system of wage determination could also help produce wage outcomes closer to the capacity of individual firms, and hence the economy, to bear. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the initial steps that have been taken, we remain well short of such a system and the Government will be seeking to achieve further progress in this direction during 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is, present indications are that average weekly earnings in 1982-83 as a whole could rise by 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard it should be noted that when allowance is made for increases affecting 1982-83 already determined, further increases of only about 6 per cent during the remainder of this financial year are consistent with the 12 per cent assumption. </PARA>
<PARA> Such an outcome would be below the increase in 1981-82 and would entail some slowing from now on but it would still be well above what is required for resumption of sustained employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Consumer Price Index in 1982-83 as a whole could increase at a rate of about 10 3/4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The direct price effects of the revenue measures announced this evening amount to about one per cent-so that, those aside, the underlying rate of 9 1/2 to 10 per cent is much the same as in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> With continuing uncertainty abroad and at home, it is more than usually difficult to forecast the Australian economic outlook with any confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> That said, I have to add that barring an unexpectedly rapid improvement in the world economy, or a sharp drop in business costs, it is difficult to envisage any real growth in domestic non-farm product in 1982-83 as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Business fixed investment, which has grown at record real rates in recent years , and which during that time has been the single most important feature distinguishing the Australian economy from its overseas counterparts, could well decline a little in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, and notwithstanding the personal tax reductions announced tonight, personal consumption expenditure in 1982-83 is likely to grow considerably more slowly than the 3 1/2 per cent rate recorded in 1981-82, at about 1 1/2 per cent . </PARA>
<PARA> Even with the measures announced both last March and this evening, real private dwelling investment is still forecast to decline faster in 1982-83 than in the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other factors, an adequate supply of private housing finance will be critically influenced by the extent to which specialist housing financing institutions are able to offer competitive interest rates on their deposits. </PARA>
<PARA> Farm production is, as always, subject to considerable uncertainties but, given the severe nature of the present drought, will decline in 1982-83 from the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the basis of this outlook, there is unlikely to be any growth in employment in 1982-83 so that, with the labour force continuing to grow, unemployment therefore seems likely to increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The outlook for the balance of payments will reflect the developing outlooks both at home and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The prospect of some growth in world trade should result in a modest increase in export volumes in 1982-83, while import volumes may remain broadly unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA> After taking account of some increase in the invisibles deficit, the current account deficit may be broadly similar to that in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> As always, that deficit will need to be financed by capital inflow, principally on private account; monetary policy settings will need to be tailored accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances a surplus on private sector foreign exchange transactions of around $1500m is expected. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA> This Budget represents the endeavour of the Government to provide a fair and workable response to the very difficult economic problems which Australia faces at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not been insensitive to the fact that many Australian families need help. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also not been insensitive to the fact that many young people, especially those out of work, might need special help at a time when job opportunities are declining. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that help to these groups and others is being provided in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we have not ignored the compelling necessity to maintain an anti- inflationary economic strategy. To abandon that strategy would be to condemn the Australian economy to much greater travail than it presently experiences. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not put this Budget together in isolation from the views expressed to us by different sections of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> We have endeavoured to structure personal taxation relief in a way which meets the reasonable aspirations of the average Australian wage earner. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been aware that the level of taxation, particularly for the PAYE taxpayer, influences wage and salary claims. </PARA>
<PARA> In a very real sense we believe the taxation and other family assistance provided by this Budget provides a basis for the exercise of wage restraint across the broad spectrum of the Australian workforce. </PARA>
<PARA> If this restraint can be achieved, a major blow will have been struck for the cause of economic recovery in Australia and many jobs will be saved in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Budget to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA>This Bill seeks appropriations of the Consoli- dated Revenue Fund in 1982-83 totalling $1,976,195,000. Of this amount, $797,209,000 was authorised by the Supply Act (No. 2) 1982-83; the balance of $1,178,986,000 would be authorised by this Bill. The Bill provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, certain advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital expenditure and expenditure on new policy initiatives for which legislation has not previously been provided. Provision is also made for grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory. An amount of $100,000,000 is included under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, the same level as provided in the past four years. Details of the proposed expenditures are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill and the main features were outlined in my Budget Speech. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is to provide appropriations for the parliamentary departments. The Bill seeks appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1982-83 totalling $ 30,208,000. Of this amount, $10,902,000 was authorised by the Supply Act (No. 1) 1982-83, the balance of $19,306,000 being authorised by this Bill. The Bill arises from the Government's consideration of, and response to, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing which was tabled on 19 August 1981. Two of the principal recommendations of the report dealt with the provision of a separate parliamentary Appropriation Bill and with the Parliament's control of its funding. Honourable members will recall that the Government agreed to the provision of a separate Appropriation Bill which, consistent with the Select Committee's recommendations, will not be treated as a Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government. Honourable members will also recall that the Government recognised that detailed control over individual expenditure items for the Parliament was not necessary. Accordingly, the Government proposed that it would approve the overall recurrent and capital expenditure provisions of the Bill. This has been done and the amounts included in the Bill have been agreed to between the leaders of the Houses and the Presiding Officers. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills will give effect to the Budget proposal to increase the various rates of sales tax by 2.5 percentage points. The Bills will increase the respective rates from 5 per cent to 7.5 per cent, from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent and from 30 per cent to 32.5 per cent. These Bills do not alter any of the exemptions from sales tax that are conferred by the first Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Some deletions of existing exemptions are, however, proposed by another Bill that I will shortly introduce. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Schedule to the exemptions and classifications Act identifies the goods that are to be taxed at the top rate, now to be $32.5 per cent. Goods embraced by the second Schedule include radio and television receivers, record players, cameras, household-type video recorders, films and photographs, non- commercial slide projectors and viewing equipment, watches, jewellery, cosmetics , fountain pens, certain goods made of precious metals and furs. Goods in the third Schedule to the exemptions and classifications Act have attracted a rate of 5 per cent, which is now to be increased to 7.5 per cent. This covers household furniture, appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and a range of household goods. Motor cars and commercial motor vehicles are in the fourth and fifth Schedules to the exemptions and classifications Act and they, together with goods not coming within any Schedule to the Act, are at present taxed at 17.5 per cent. It is proposed that they be taxed in future at 20 per cent. Other goods also now to be taxed at 20 per cent include boats, confectionery, stationery, computers, soft drinks, potable spirits and imported wines and beers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is customary for changes in the rates of sales tax to take effect on the day following the introduction of amending Bills and these Bills, when enacted, will accordingly operate on and after 18 August 1982. The sales tax is basically a tax on sales at the wholesale level and, in the ordinary case of sales by a wholesaler to a retailer, the increased rates of tax will accordingly apply to sales made after Budget day. As usual, an explanatory memorandum covering technical aspects of the Bills and providing, on this occasion, a detailed listing of the goods affected by these measures is being made available to honourable members. The net result of the changes in sales tax rates will be an increase in revenue estimated at some $370m in 1982-83 and $490m in a full year. I commend the Bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>As announced in the Budget Speech this evening, the Government has decided on two sales tax changes. Legislation for one of them-an increase of 2.5 percentage points in existing rates-has just been introduced. The Bill I am now introducing deals with the second aspect and will impose sales tax of 7.5 per cent on a range of goods that are now exempt from tax. This extension of the sales tax base will have effect on goods that pass the taxing point-normally the last wholesale sale-on or after 1 January 1983. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) drew attention last year to the clear advantage that lies in effecting some change in the mix of direct and indirect taxation. I again emphasise the potential that such a change generates for desirable reduction in direct taxes, particularly personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The technical effect of the Bill will be tax at 7.5 per cent, on and after 1 January 1983, goods which are at present exempted by items 53, 58, 105, 107 and 113F, sub-items (4), (5A), (6), (7) and (10) of item 120 and item 120A in the first Schedule. The broad classes of goods which fall within the scope of the items other than 113F, are maps, hand tools, motion picture films, household drapery and soft furnishings, cleaning and polishing cloths, braid, ribbon and tape, blankets, handkerchiefs, cleaning sponges and engine-cleaning cotton waste . The goods covered by item 113F are, very broadly, servicing equipment and construction equipment. More particularly, this equipment covers servicing equipment used to service, repair or recondition motor vehicles, aircraft, ships or railway rolling stock or in retreading and repairing of tyres and repairing of footwear for human wear. The item also covers equipment used for constructing , maintaining or repairing buildings or other structures, roads, dams, pipelines , drains, trenches, tunnels or other works.</PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that this item deals with equipment et cetera which is used in the course of servicing, repair or construction as the case may be. It does not include goods which become part of the goods being repaired or the structures built. Using buildings as an example, equipment for use in construction of a building will become taxable at 7.5 per cent but the materials used to construct the building and thereby become part of the building will remain exempt from sales tax. I emphasise that goods falling within any of these categories will still be exempt from sales tax if they are sold in circumstances in which an overriding exemption in the first schedule to the Sales Tax ( Exemptions and Classifications) Act applies. Similarly, where a manufacturer purchases such goods for use as 'aids to manufacture', the goods will remain exempt under the 'aids to manufacture' head of exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that I need to go into greater detail at this stage. As usual, however, an explanatory memorandum covering technical aspects of the Bill is being made available to honourable members and this provides details of the goods affected by these measures. The net result of the changes will be an increase in revenue estimated at some $44m in 1982-83 and $105m in a full year. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is one of several measures to give effect to the new diesel fuel duty payments and administration arrangements foreshadowed by my colleague the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his Budget Speech earlier tonight. On and from 8 o' clock tonight the existing diesel fuel certificate scheme, wherein certificates were issued to purchasers of diesel fuel for 'off road' use to obtain the fuel at duty free prices, will be terminated. In its place this Bill will introduce a new rebate system which will require all purchases of diesel fuel to be made at the duty paid price with rebates payable to persons in certain categories for their 'off road' use. I have already revoked the relevant Customs and excise by- laws which provided the authority for the issuance of diesel fuel certificates under the previous scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill contains amendments to a number of pieces of legislation including amendments to the Diesel Fuel Taxation (Administration) Act 1957, to terminate the operation of that Act on and from 8 o'clock tonight. Any purchases of diesel fuel for 'off road' use made at duty free rates under the certificate scheme up to 8 o'clock this evening will remain subject to the end use provisions of that Act. Similarly, purchasers who, before 8 o'clock this evening, purchased diesel fuel at duty inclusive prices and used that fuel for 'off road' purposes will be entitled to rebates as provided for under the old arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the Customs Act and the Excise Act to introduce new provisions into both of those Acts relating to the new rebate system. I would now like to outline some of the details of the new rebate system. As from 8 o' clock tonight all diesel fuel sales will be required to be made at a price inclusive of the duty. This means that no users of diesel fuel will be able to purchase, as they did in the past, duty free diesel fuel from oil companies, agencies or distributors. The users of diesel fuel in the categories defined in clause 5 of the Bill who use the fuel for 'off road' purposes are eligible for a rebate of the duty paid on the diesel fuel used in their operations. To obtain the rebate the user must lodge a claim with a collector of Customs. The categories I have just referred to relate to the use of diesel fuel in the agriculture, mining, forestry and fishing industries, in domestic premises, hospitals, aged persons homes and nursing homes. The overriding qualification for rebate will be that the fuel so used will be used otherwise than for the purposes of propelling a road vehicle on a public road. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been necessary to include in the Bill powers that are similar to those powers contained in the Diesel Fuel Taxation (Administration) Act. These investigative powers are essential for the protection of the revenue and for the effective administration of the new rebate system. It is proposed that the Customs and excise regulations be amended to require certain information to be submitted by claimants for rebate and for claimants to keep records of their purchases and use of the fuel for a period of not less than two years from the date of their purchase of the fuel. Claims for rebate for domestic use may be lodged on a continuous basis but all other claims for rebate will be limited to a minimum rebate amount of $100. Claims for rebate will not normally be payable unless they are lodged within 12 months of the date of the purchase of the fuel. Claims will be processed after the date upon which the amending legislation receives the royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Industry and Commerce will be issuing an information pamphlet detailing eligibility and operation of the new rebate scheme and copies of this pamphlet will be available from Customs offices, oil companies, their agencies and distributors. It is expected that the rebates paid to claimants under the new scheme will amount to approximately $112m per annum. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In his Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Howard) made reference to a number of initiatives in the social security area. I should like to expand upon some of the points he covered and give the House a more detailed account of what this Budget has achieved in terms of the Government's social welfare objectives. In this year's Budget the Government has allocated $11,983m for social security pensions and benefits, other welfare programs and services and housing programs administered by the Department of Social Security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the year the Department has acquired important new functions relating to housing, and the allocation for these programs in 1982-83 is $512m, an increase of 31.6 per cent over last year's expenditure. In the area of more traditional social security and welfare programs, spending has increased from $9,997m to an estimated $11,471m, an increase of 14.7 per cent. However, just as the apparent increase in expenditure announced last year was slightly reduced effectively by an extra pension pay-day that had to be accounted for, so this year's figure is increased. This means that the effective rate of increase in social welfare spending is some 18 per cent. I have a table illustrating this, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

While this is a larger increase than we have seen in the welfare areas in recent years, in terms of the assistance it will provide I believe it is an increase that represents particularly good value for money. This is because many of the initiatives included in this year's welfare budget are designed as incentives to welfare recipients to improve their own positions and so become less dependent on government for direct assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Budget provides valuable benefits to many groups who are clients of the Department. We have taken significant steps to improve our total package of assistance for Australian families. We have moved to improve the financial position of many age pensioners. We have provided additional help for many unemployed people, and provided greater opportunities for them to supplement their benefits through part time work. We have developed new schemes of assistance for the disabled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have also introduced measures in the field of housing that will be of benefit both to individual home buyers and, through increased activity, to the housing industry as a whole. Before I go into detail in each of these areas I should like to say something about the overall strategy that the Government has adopted in framing this year's welfare Budget. Decisions we have taken in this Budget complement the important measure adopted by the Fraser Government in 1976, to protect automatically most pensioners and beneficiaries who receive the basic rate of pension against inflation, by twice- yearly adjustments in pension rates linked to consumer price index increases. These automatic increases are the best indication that Australian pensioners could have of the Government's continuing concern for these people in Australia who have nothing to live on except the pension or benefit they receive from the social welfare system. Because those changes have been made automatic it is easy to overlook the fact that they are an important and costly commitment. In November 1982 and in May 1983 increases will cost about $770m in a full year. Indeed, the provision we have had to make for indexation accounts for some 40 per cent of this year's increase. That is a substantial basic commitment when you are beginning to shape a Budget. There are other areas of increase too that could not be avoided, such as expected increases in the number of welfare beneficiaries. These, and other increases already built into the system, account for over 30 per cent more of the overall increase. So, in total we were committed to an extra expenditure of more than $1.3 billion before we began to look at any new policy initiatives-and that $1.3 billion accounts for some 75 per cent of our expenditure increase. Given this, our aim has been to spend the funds we felt able to allocate for new initiatives in a way that would alleviate the particularly pressing problems in the welfare system and also to give taxpayers good value for the extra dollars we proposed to spend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is aware that there are some areas falling within the scope of the welfare system where inflation has caused special problems for particular groups of people. Many of the initiatives we have adopted this year are aimed at alleviating these problems. They will also, as I have already mentioned, provide greater incentives for people to improve their own positions and become less dependent on government. </PARA>
<PARA>Help for Families</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In developing our package of assistance for families we have had in mind the additional costs that all parents undertake in bringing up children, and the particularly harsh impact of inflation on families with low incomes. To help in meeting these extra costs we have decided to increase the rate of family allowance by 50 per cent for the first and second children in a family from October 1982. This will bring family allowance for the first child to $22.80 a month and for the second child to $32.55 a month. This increase, which is part of the Government's tax relief measures in this Budget, will cost some $250m in 1982-83 and will consolidate the increases for third and subsequent children we introduced in last year's Budget. While it will be of particular benefit to the 1.6 million families in Australia who have one or two children, all 2.1 million families with children will gain. In addition to this general assistance for families, we will introduce, from May 1983, a tax free family income supplement for low income families apart from pensioners and beneficiaries of up to $10 a week for each dependent child. This not only reflects our recognition of the particular cost burden borne by low income families who are bringing up children , but it also helps to avoid the unfair and clearly undesirable situation where an unemployment beneficiary can be better off financially than a person in similar family circumstances who is in employment, but earning low wages. </PARA>
<PARA> The income limit for this supplement will be closely linked to the income test for health care cards. However, full details of the new arrangements will be announced well before the implementation date, which has been set in May 1983. The Government is anxious to get this new scheme of assistance operating as soon as possible, and has settled on May as the earliest date by which the necessary administrative action to introduce a completely new benefit can be completed. Because the family income supplement is a completely new benefit aimed at assisting low income families who are mainly in employment, the Government will monitor it closely to ensure that it meets its objective of relieving hardship among those families who are not pensioners or beneficiaries. Low income families will also be assisted by a rise in the qualifying limits for health care cards which, as a result of CPI-linked increases and adjustments to the income test for unemployment benefit to which they are linked, will go up from November to $184 per week for a married couple without children plus $20 for each child in the family. Holders of the health care cards will be able to get certain pharmaceutical items at concessional rates from 1 January 1983 under the new scheme announced by the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton). There will also be changes in the rates and income tests for certain education and living allowances, details of which will be announced by the appropriate Ministers-but parents who receive allowances for children under the Secondary Allowances Scheme and related schemes will not also be able to get family income supplement for the same child. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been widespread concern recently about the growth in the number of sole parent families in Australia. There has also been particular concern about the growth in the number of such families receiving income support from the Commonwealth. On the other hand, there is no doubt that some sole parent families are among the most needy of all families in the Australian community. In shaping its policy of asistance to families the Government has kept these concerns in mind and has sought to strike a balance which recognises the particular problems faced by sole parents, but, as far as possible, avoids creating further financial incentives for separation and reduces disincentives for forming new, lasting relationships. The increases in family allowances, the introduction of the family income supplement, and the adjustments in personal income tax announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) will have a significant impact on the disposable income of many Australian families. I have a number of tables detailing the gains for families in various circumstances, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K4">Mr WILSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tables 1 to 12 show, in particular, the impact of our proposals on single income families, two income families and sole parent pensioners. The Government has also taken the opportunity to remove two unintended anomalies in the treatment of sole parent pensioners and beneficiaries. If supporting parent beneficiaries get maintenance of more than $6 a week for a child, the excess will, from February 1983, be treated as the parent's own income for income test purposes. This will bring the treatment of maintenance for the children of supporting parent beneficiaries into line with that applying to widow pensioners . From November 1982 it will be no longer possible for a supporting parent beneficiary to be regarded as a dependant of another person for the purpose of any payment of pension, benefit or allowance, although existing recipients will be exempted from the affect of the change. In addition, existing provisions in the Social Security Act concerning the requirement to take reasonable steps to pursue maintenance action will be reactivated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Children's Services</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government also proposes to develop a rationalised and extended program of children's services. To this end there will be an increase of almost 50 per cent in funding for child care services under the Children's Services Program for 1982-83 from an expenditure of $47.56m in 1981-82 to $70.04m. Under the program the States and the Northern Territory will also receive $33.09m as a contribution to pre-school education. In future not less than 75 per cent of funds under the Children's Services Program, apart from the pre-school grants, will be spent on 'mainstream' services-that is, day care services for young children. The Budget allocation for the 1982-83 year will, broadly speaking, enable the Government to continue to support existing services and, where necessary, increase grants to maintain their viability; direct additional assistance to those people in the community who need it most, through revised funding arrangements for day care services ($6.86m has been specifically earmarked for this purpose); carry out a pilot testing of the feasibility of providing a subsidy to enable the children of parents with modest incomes to attend commercial child care centres ($200,000 has been allocated for this in 1982-83); fund new projects to meet high priority needs for children's services ($5m has been specially set aside for this purpose). </PARA>
<PARA> The revised funding arrangements for day care will ensure that economically needy families are not denied access to care because they cannot afford to pay the fees. The major aspects of the new funding package are: There will be an increase in the operational support grant for family day care schemes to $10 per week per equivalent full time child. This new rate will represent an approximate overall increase of 33.3 per cent over the amounts payable under the existing formula and will be paid from 1 July 1982. A new fee rebating arrangement for economically needy users will be introduced. This will replace existing special need arrangements where appropriate, and will provide each service with funds according to the need for fee rebates among its economically needy users. This will be known as the Special Economic Need Subsidy. New grants will be introduced to assist children with particular development and cultural needs. These will be known as Supplementary Services Grants. </PARA>
<PARA>Housing Assistance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Another area where we have recognised the adverse impact of inflation is in housing. To tackle some of the problems here, we have increased our commitment to direct assistance to home buyers and improved funding arrangements for welfare housing. Our housing initiatives will not only provide significant additional assistance for families in need but will serve to boost activity and employment in the housing industry. The new arrangements the Treasurer has announced for taxation relief in respect of mortgage interest payments will be a significant measure to assist Australian home buyers and will extend the assistance already provided through the housing package announced in March this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Funding for the various components of that package in the 1982-83 Budget is as follows: A total of $147m has been allocated to meet commitments under the Homes Savings Grant Scheme and under the new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme which has replaced it. This compares with expenditure of $114.6m in 1981-82. The sum of $ 20m has been allocated for distribution to the States to fund the new mortgage and rent relief scheme which will help low income families who face severe financial difficulty with their mortgage or rent payments. The tax rebate for first home buyers announced in March is expected to cost some $100m in 1982-83, although in a full year of operation it will cost some $230m. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been an increase of 27 per cent in direct funding to the States and Northern Territory for welfare housing, with specific allocations earmarked for the high priority areas of housing for pensioners and Aboriginals. In addition to these increases in funding, the money available for the family crisis accommodation program, which provides short term emergency accommodation for families, has been doubled to $4m for 1982-83. A total of $6.7m has also been allocated in 1982-83 to subsidise new and existing services for homeless people under the Homeless Persons Assistance Program. Of this total, $3m has been earmarked for new capital projects. In addition, from 1 October 1982, the subsidy paid to funded organisations for food and accommodation costs will increase to $1.35 a person a day and the subsidy for a meal provided to a homeless person who does not stay overnight will rise to 45c. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Pensioners</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Adjustments to the pension system in conjunction with the adjustments to the income tax system announced by the Treasurer will benefit invalid pensioners, widow pensioners and supporting parent beneficiaries, as well as age pensioners. Tables 11 to 16 of the tables I referred to earlier show the impact of these adjustments on the disposable incomes of pensioners in different circumstances. Retired people on fixed incomes have been among the groups hardest hit by inflation in recent years, and many have suffered a significant erosion of their living standards. We have made a number of adjustments to the pension and benefits system designed to improve the position of such people, and also to act as an incentive for people who want to improve their position by savings or by casual employment. We have therefore liberalised the income test, both for the basic pension and for fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> From November 1982, single pensioners will be able to have $30 of private income a week without affecting their entitlement to a full pension. Couples may have $50 a week. This compares with current rates of $20 a week for single people and $34.50 for couples. The Government has also decided to increase the income limit for pensioner health benefits to $54 a week (single) and $90 a week (married couples) to take effect from November 1982. A new uniform increased limit of $20 for each dependent child in a family, on top of the base limits, is also to apply. The additional income limits for children currently vary between $11 and $17 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners who qualify for a pensioner health benefit card are entitled to a range of Commonwealth concessions, the most important being free medical and hospital treatment, free pharmaceuticals and telephone rental concessions. The Government was concerned that a number of pensioners had lost entitlement to fringe benefits, perhaps through no action of their own, because their incomes had risen above the limits set in 1979. It was also concerned that others might have placed themselves at a disadvantage by arranging their financial affairs so as to keep their incomes below the current limits and qualify for a card. The increase in the income limits should help people in both these categories. The higher limits will also apply to eligibility for pensioner funeral benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, all pensioners who are not eligible for fringe benefits, including all supporting parent beneficiaries and people over 70 who get an income-test- free pension, will be able to get pharmaceuticals at a new concessional rate of $2 under the proposed new three-tiered pharmaceutical benefits scheme to be announced by the Minister for Health. A further small but important change is that from November 1982 wife pensioners resident overseas may qualify for a widow's pension without having to return to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Supplementary Assistance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to increase the maximum rate of supplementary assistance by a further $2. It will go up to $10 a week from November 1982. In particular all pensioners and long term sickness beneficiaries paying private rents above $26 a week and with private income below $16 a week will gain from this change. At the same time, to ensure that pensioners do not suffer any loss of entitlement to a pension or supplementary assistance, rent subsidies paid to private tenants by State public housing authorities will be excluded from the definition of income for pension, benefit and supplementary assistance income test purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>Increased Subsidies for Services for the Aged</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> We have also extended our assistance for aged people by increasing the money available for subsidies for accommodation for elderly people and services for old people living at home. Funds available in 1982-83 for capital grants under the aged or disabled persons accommodation program have been increased by more than 46 per cent, compared with expenditure of $56.7m in 1981-82. This includes an additional allocation of $18m to expand the program in 1982-83, the last year of the current three-year funding period. The additional allocation will effectively allow the approval of approximately 100 new projects. Funding of $ 87m for 1983-84 under this program has also been approved. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act the maximum building grant has been increased to $14,000 for each single unit or person housed and $16,240 for double units. Under the Aged or Disabled Persons Hostels Act the maximum grant is now $21,000 per person housed. Both changes apply to contracts entered into on or after 1 July 1982. Subsidies for land components, furniture and so on remain unchanged. The subsidy paid to organisations caring for frail aged people in approved hostels will be increased to $30 a week for each eligible person from July 1982. This is an increase of 50 per cent on the present level, or 100 per cent since October 1980 when the rate was last increased from $15 to $20. It will help to ensure that a high standard of care continues to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA>Help for the Unemployed</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In its overall Budget strategy, the Government has been concerned to introduce measures that will improve the employment prospects for many Australians. However, we are aware that unemployed people, and particularly those who are unemployed for long periods, have special difficulties. We have taken steps to help them by a series of initiatives that will raise the level of payments for many unemployment beneficiaries and increase the scope for them to obtain additional income and valuable work experience through casual employment. From November 1982, single unemployed people age 18 years and over who have no dependants will get a rise of $6.30 a week in their benefit, bringing their weekly rate to $64.40. Single unemployed people and sickness beneficiaries aged 16 and 17 years will also get a rise. They will get an extra $4, giving them a total of $40 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the regular automatic adjustments for CPI increases will mean a rise in the maximum single and married rates of benefits by $3.10 for a single person and $5.20 for a married couple. The new rates will be $77.25 a week for single people over 18 with dependants and $128.80 for a couple. To encourage unemployed people to take advantage of opportunities to earn extra income and gain job experience by casual work, they will also be allowed to earn more without losing their benefit. This will apply to people receiving sickness benefit as well as to the unemployed. The more generous income test will mean that everyone who receives unemployment or sickness benefit will be able to have $10 a week of private income without affecting their rate of benefit. The amount allowed currently is $3 a week for single people under 18 and $6 for everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> People who have more than $10 a week of private income will lose 50c benefit for every $1 of extra income up to an income limit of $60. This represents a substantial increase in the amount of extra income that can be earned before the benefit is reduced by $1 for every $1 of income. At present the upper limit is only $40 for single people under 18 years and $50 for others. </PARA>
<PARA> Eligibility for health cover will also be extended. Unemployment and special beneficiaries will be eligible for heath care cards under the higher pensioner fringe benefits income limits I have already outlined. All sickness beneficiaries will be eligible for pensioner fringe benefits. Tables 17 to 22 of the tables I referred to earlier show the impact of welfare initiatives in this Budget on the assistance received by unemployment and sickness beneficiaries in different circumstances with different levels of income. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also specially concerned about young Australians who are homeless because of family breakdown or violent family relationships, or for other reasons. Many of these young people are also unemployed and have particular difficulties in finding suitable accommodation. Long term measure to help in this area will be considered in the light of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare's recent report on the problems of homeless youth and in the light of the final evaluation of the Youth Services Scheme. However, as an interim measure, $300,000 has been allocated in 1982-83 to help non-profit organisations provide accommodation or other assistance for homeless single people under 18 years of age who receive unemployment, sickness or special benefit. The Government hopes that an additional effort in this area will help to prevent many young people from falling into a pattern of homelessness and chronic poverty. </PARA>
<PARA>Assistance for Disabled People</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government's wish to encourage people to help themselves by finding employment is also reflected in its proposals for assistance to disabled people. Our initiatives in this area have a basic orientation towards helping people to get into employment that is sound in economic terms and reflects the wishes of disabled people themselves, particularly as they were conveyed to the Government during the International Year of Disabled Persons in 1981. At the same time there are initiatives in this Budget that will be of assistance to all disabled people, whether in terms of improving their financial position or increasing the services available to them. Invalid pensioners, for example, will benefit directly from the package of adjustments to the pensioner system which I outlined when speaking of our initiatives to help aged people. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, we have introduced a series of measures that will be of particular assistance to disabled people who are in the work force or who want to work. From April 1983 a mobility allowance of $10 a week will be introduced for severely handicapped people who are in employment or undertaking vocational training and who are unable to use public transport to travel to their work or training because of their disability. This benefit, which will cost some $18.2m in a full year, will be free of any income test or income tax. It will not, however, be available to those receiving the benefit of sales tax exemptions on new motor vehicles. The new allowance recognises the additional travel costs incurred by disabled people who undertake employment or vocational training. The Government has decided to move as quickly as possible in this area to meet pressing needs but will keep the scheme under review to make sure it is effective in its operation. On a related front, we have also decided to carry out a pilot study to test alternative modes of attendant care assistance. Additional funds have been earmarked for this purpose and $100,000 will be available in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> From March 1983, a new form of income maintenance payment will be introduced for people who undertake a Commonwealth rehabilitation program and who otherwise would be eligible for another social security pension or benefit. The new rehabilitation allowance will be at the same rates and under the same conditions as invalid pensions; that is, income-tested but income tax free and attracting the same fringe benefits. It may be paid during the rehabilitation program and for up to six months afterwards. The plans announced in June for the extension and development of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service are also to be set in train during 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> During IYDP the Government also had put before it the views of numerous invalid pensioners who feel that existing invalid pension arrangements prevented them attempting to take up employment. The Government wishes to give as much help as possible to invalid pensioners who feel able to make the transfer to open employment. A major concern is the loss of pensioner health benefits. To meet this concern we have decided to grant health care cards to people who give up an invalid pension or sheltered employment allowance to take up open employment. The card will last for 12 months and will not be subject to an income test. The Health Insurance Act will be amended to enable this provision to be introduced from 1 January 1983. This decision should improve incentives for invalid pensioners and people in sheltered employment to attempt to enter, or to re- enter, the open work force. It will also protect them against any above average health costs during the period of adjusting to employment. As health care card holders they will be eligible for free medical and hospital treatment. They will also qualify for concessional charges for pharmaceuticals, because the Government has decided to introduce a concessional $2 rate of contribution for health care card holders under its proposed three-tiered pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Their other major concern is that, should their efforts to retain employment be unsuccessful because of their disability, the very fact of having made the effort might disqualify them from regaining their pension. Therefore as a further means of encouraging invalid pensioners to take up employment where possible, the Director-General of Social Security will be arranging for them to be reconsidered for a pension immediately if they have to give up work within 12 months. In some cases the pension will be granted again without the need for a medical review, and in others they will be given priority in arranging such a review. </PARA>
<PARA> From November 1982 the incentive allowance paid to people in sheltered employment will be increased to $10 a week. In addition, from February 1983, eligibility for incentive allowance will be extended to invalid pensioners undertaking activity therapy and adult training centre programs under the Handicapped Persons Welfare Program. In all the above cases the incentive allowance, unlike the supplementary assistance which it replaces, will be paid regardless of the income a person receives or rent paid. These measures remove the anomalies that previously existed in the treatment of handicapped people attending these different categories of special services. Another change will affect people who get a sheltered employment allowance. Currently they enjoy a more liberal income test for fringe benefits, particularly if they are single. It is not proposed to increase the current income limit for single people, which at $68 a week will still be $14 higher than the general limit proposed. However, for married people the income limit will increase from $73 to $90, the same as for other married pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> To improve incentives for invalid pensioners to participate in activity therapy and adult training centres, the higher income limit of $68 a week for fringe benefits will also apply, from November 1982, to single invalid pensioners participating in the programs of such centres. Families with a severely handicapped child who is cared for at home will be assisted by an increase in handicapped child's allowance by $12 a month to $85 a month from November 1982. Increased funds are to be provided to subsidise building projects under the handicapped persons welfare program, which makes grants to non-profit organisations providing prescribed services for disabled people such as training , activity therapy, sheltered employment and associated residential accommodation. Details are provided in the Minister for Social Security's news release of 11 August 1982. The increases mean that, during the financial years 1982-83 and 1983-84, some $37m will be available to subsidise capital projects, of which about $21m will be ear-marked for entirely new projects. In addition there will be a new provision for new services not requiring building subsidies and $500,000 will be available for this in 1982-83. The money available for funding recurrent expenditure such as salaries, rent, equipment, minor works and the payment of Handicapped Children's Benefit and for upgrading services provided under the program has also been increased. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In summary our welfare Budget for 1982-83 has addressed many areas of need within the welfare system, particularly those that have been exacerbated in recent years by the effects of inflation. Addressing those problems has meant that the total expenditure in the welfare area for 1982-83 will be close to $12 billion. Some will inevitably see this as inadequate; others will see it as extravagant. At the beginning of this statement I provided figures showing how the increase in total estimated expenditure for 1982-83 is made up. However, in looking at the total size of the welfare budget it should be borne in mind that $1,360m for family allowances, which shows up as welfare expense, could more correctly be presented as a reduction in taxation for families with children. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the dependent spouse rebate and the former dependent child tax rebates, family allowances provide an offset to tax in recognition of the lower capacity to pay tax of taxpayers with dependants. For this reason, the Government decided to increase the rates of family allowances for first and second children this year as part of its review of the personal income tax system. The cost of this initiative-$250m in 1982-83-is a substantial component of the overall increase in expenditure in the welfare area this year. I believe that we have spent the additional funds allocated to welfare wisely-on initiatives that, as well as being on a sound welfare basis, have many spin-off benefits in encouraging people to do more to help themselves, providing incentives for pensioners and beneficiaries to make better use of their savings, and providing a significant boost to the housing industry. I hope this Budget will be welcomed as a constructive attempt to come to grips with the problems our community faces in 1982. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this late hour of the evening there are only two brief observations that I wish to make on the ministerial statement. Firstly , I think it should be observed that nothing concentrates the mind of this Government so wonderfully on the needs of the poor as the nearness of an election. Secondly, the figures given in the statement clearly underwrite the accuracy of the costing of the Australian Labor Party's health plan. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has announced the Government has decided to review the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme. This review will commence immediately and will enable the Government to examine the objectives of the scheme and options for ensuring that it is not subject to abuse. The Government's objective in introducing the scheme was to assist in achieving equality in the price of petroleum products between city and country locations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under present arrangements the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority determines maximum justified wholesale prices for each of the major oil companies. These comprise a base wholesale price-the capital city price-plus a maximum justified freight differential for various country locations. The operation of the freight subsidy scheme ensures that maximum wholesale prices in country areas are not more than 0.44c per litre above the maximum capital city prices. Despite the freight subsidy scheme variations exist between retail prices for petroleum products in various localities. While the scheme has ensured that freight is not a significant cause of these variations, there are other factors at work including differences in State fuel taxes, discounting and differences in reseller margins between capital city and country areas, reflecting differences in throughput volumes and the degree of competition. These factors will of course be taken into consideration in the review. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the scheme was introduced the Government has become concerned that it is being abused by certain parties. Investigations have led to some successful prosecutions for fraudulent claims, while there have been allegations that the scheme is being manipulated in other ways by certain distributors for gain. The Government has also become concerned at the escalating costs of the scheme, which rose to $147m in 1981-82 compared with a Budget estimate of $129m for that year. As the Treasurer has also announced, pending the outcome of the review, the scheme will be amended to subsidise freight costs in excess of 1c per litre, instead of the 0.44c per litre which previously applied. Although this will mean a slight rise in the freight component paid by consumers, the scheme will continue to make a significant contribution to reducing freight differentials.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-For the information of honourable members I wish to announce that the updated building budget for the design and construction of the new Parliament House is $370.4m at March 1982 prices. It is the Government's intention to report periodically to Parliament on the updated budget for the new building, and honourable members will recall that in September 1981, when this House approved the latest declared stage, the building budget was $303.9m at June 1981 prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In accordance with the Government's determination to contain costs on the project, the Parliament House Construction Authority has succeeded in containing the increase in budget figures between June 1981 and March 1982 to the inflationary effects of movements in the cost of labour and materials. I, therefore, wish to stress that the budget originally approved by Parliament, plus approved variations amounting to only 2.9 per cent, is being maintained in real terms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1738) Dr Blewett asked Mr Fife, then representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the provision of pharmaceuticals to social security beneficiaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme the only Social Security pensioners or beneficiaries who receive pharmaceutical benefits free of charge are those who are in receipt of age pension, invalid pension, widow's pension, supporting parent's benefit, sheltered employment allowance or sickness benefit under the Social Services Act 1947 and who qualify after being subjected to a special income test under that Act. Their dependants are also eligible to receive pharmaceutical benefits free of charge.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to this some other Social Security beneficiaries, namely unemployment beneficiaries and special beneficiaries who qualify after being subjected to a special income test are issued with a Health Care card. Health Care cardholders and their dependants are entitled to free medical treatment and free hospital treatment at public hospitals, which would include the supply of pharmaceuticals at those hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> In this time of Government expenditure restraint it is not possible at this stage to extend the provision of pharmaceutical benefits free of charge outside public hospitals to Health Care cardholders or to other groups in the community .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2335) Mr West asked me a question without notice, concerning a report by the National Energy Advisory Committee entitled 'Nuclear Power in Australia: Regulation and Control.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The following is in answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The National Energy Advisory Committee advises the Minister for National Development and Energy on matters relating to national energy policy. The Committee comprises representatives from industry, academic institutions, and Commonwealth and State agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> The report to which the honourable member referred is the 16th such report in a series on energy matters.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered questions which it thought would need to be answered if nuclear power stations were to be introduced into Australia in the next 20 years. The report did not consider whether Australia or any of its States should actually embark on nuclear electricity generation. The report examined various aspects of the nuclear energy scene to determine what action would be necessary if nuclear electricity generation were to be adopted in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that legislation, regulation, and inspection functions should be identified and responsibility for these assigned before nuclear electricity generation could proceed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The report notes the decision by the Government announced on 5 June 1981 that far reaching changes to Commonwealth legislation on nuclear matters were required. The Government as announced by the Minister for Trade and Resources and the Minister for National Development and Energy had decided to establish a new legal base developing, with the States and the Northern Territory, appropriate State legislation complemented as necessary by Commonwealth legislation to ensure that Australia's national obligations and concerns were fully honoured. A principal Commonwealth responsibility was to ensure the observance of Australia's national obligations under the International Non- Proliferation Regime.</PARA>
<PARA> The report recommends that the Commonwealth State and Northern Territory Governments should develop, with minimal delay, a legal framework, using complementary legislation as appropriate, for licencing and regulating health, safety, and environmental and third-party liability aspects of nuclear power generation.</PARA>
<PARA> This work is proceeding in close consultation with the State and the Northern Territory. The intent of the Government is to see that there is an adequate legislative base to ensure that any nuclear development in Australia in whatever form and wherever it may occur is subject to proper control and that Australia's obligations under its international treaties covering non- proliferation and safeguards are fully met.</PARA>

The company is also seeking to sell Bundoora and District Private Hospital.)</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Such information received in the context of foreign investment is considered confidential between the Government and the parties concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Commonwealth does not have statutory power to prevent the construction of additional private hospital beds in the States or to make directions as to where any such beds ought to be located. These matters are the responsibility of the States. Consequently, my Department has not made assessments on the supply of hospital beds in the localities of the above-mentioned foreign owned hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of the Commonwealth's changes to hospital funding arrangements has been to encourage the States to take up their full constitutional responsibility for the control of their total hospital system, encompassing both public and private hospitals. In such circumstances, it is appropriate for a State to determine whether a particular proposal in that State for a private hospital development by an Australian or foreign interest is in the interest of the hospital system of the State. In this context the Commonwealth has expressed its concern to the States that any growth which does take place is consistent with the proper planning of an efficient and effective hospital system in the State, complements the public hospital system and does not exacerbate any existing maldistribution of public and private hospital beds.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Fuel freight subsidy payments are based on freight differentials calculated by the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority (PPPA).</PARA>
<PARA> When the Prices Justification Tribunal (PJT) assumed the responsibility for calculation of freight differentials in 1974, there existed a list of differentials for certain petroleum products supplied to 28 ports outside the refining centres which had not been changed for some years. With the exception of freight differentials for aviation fuels and lubricants, they have not been altered since. Differentials for aviation fuels and lubricants supplied to these ports, and all petroleum products supplied to ports not included on the list are all adjusted regularly to reflect current costs. The frozen differentials applying to the 28 ports would now account for only a small part of the costs of shipping products from the refinery centres.</PARA>
<PARA> In its March 1981 report on petroleum product prices, the PJT estimated that the costs of sea transport to ports outside refining centres 'to be of the order of $50m per annum'. Most of these costs would relate to transport of subsidised products.</PARA>
<PARA> The 28 ports referred to above are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Cairns, Qld</PARA>
<PARA>Port Pirie, S.A.</PARA>
<PARA>Townsville, Qld</PARA>
<PARA>Port Lincoln, S.A.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Apart from the differentials referred to in (1) above which have not been altered for some years, freight differentials are reviewed approximately each 6 to 9 months on a State by State basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The PJT's March 1981 report drew attention to the situation described in (1 ) above and its implications were discussed in paragraphs 7.29 to 7.31. The effect of the freezing of differentials for the major petroleum products at the relevant 28 ports is that increases in sea transport costs have been recovered through base wholesale prices which apply to the entire distribution network.</PARA>
<PARA> Following on from the comments made in the March 1981 report on the PJT, the PPPA has the matter under current investigation.</PARA>

<PARA> I am aware of the order of cost of sun screen preparations and the high incidence of skin cancer in Australia.</PARA>

To provide such sun screen preparations as pharmaceutical benefits, for which the prescription of a medical practitioner is required, would add substantially to the cost of such items to the community as, in addition to the medical practitioner consultation, a prescription dispensing fee would apply.</PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of health insurance benefits, a number of registered health funds provide benefits under their supplementary ancillary tables towards the cost of drugs and medicinal preparations not available under the pharmaceutical benefits arrangements. However, most funds provide such benefits for prescriptions only and require the contributor to meet a patient contribution (currently $3.20) equivalent to that payable for pharmaceutical benefits prescriptions.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no specific provision under the health insurance legislation governing the operation of supplementary ancillary tables. As a result, health funds are free to determine for themselves the nature and extent of any supplementary ancillary benefits they wish to provide. The Government's role in this area is largely one of ensuring that the contribution rates are sufficient to finance the benefits being provided.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The National Health and Medical Research Council recommends that (in areas where the water supply is not fluoridated) daily fluoride supplements of 0.25 milligrams for infants aged less than one year and 0.5 milligrams at one year of age.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is no satisfactory way that the figures for fluoride intake which the honourable member has requested, can be given accurately. The fluid intake of infants varies greatly. Also, it is most unlikely that after six months of age, an infant would be totally bottle-fed. Estimates of the average and maximum fluoride intakes of infants of three weeks of age, totally bottle-fed using powdered milk preparations and juice concentrates, are of the order of 0.5 ( average) and 0.75 (maximum) milligrams respectively. It is inappropriate to estimate the fluoride intake of a 12 months-old child on this feeding regime because, as already mentioned, a child of this age is most unlikely to be totally bottle-fed.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no known hazard at the levels of fluoride intake indicated in (2) above. Occasionally some minor mott- ling of the teeth may develop, which would not even be of aesthetic significance.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. On 12 January 1982 the North West Shelf Joint Venture participants announced that some elements of investment on the project were to be deferred. The Joint Venture decided to defer the second production platform and to review some aspects of work on the onshore LNG plant. On 1 March 1982 the North West Shelf LNG sellers and the Japanese buyers issued a statement indicating that the target date for the commencement of LNG exports had been deferred to around April 1987 with deliveries building up to plateau levels in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A rescheduling of this type to take account of economic circumstances is not unusual in a project of this scale, which has a development phase of some ten years. Construction of the domestic gas phase of the project is proceeding on schedule and Woodside, operator of the project, advises that it has made secure arrangements for all the finance it expects to need for this phase of the project. Woodside has consistently maintained that it will not be able to arrange funding for its participation in the more costly LNG phase of the project until sales and purchase agreements for LNG are completed. The rescheduling of the target delivery date for LNG has not changed this position, and does not threaten Woodside's position in the domestic gas phase.</PARA>
<PARA> These developments reflect the Joint Venture's appraisal of the current international situation and its concern for prudent financial planning, pending the final conclusion of the sales contracts. I believe the Japanese electricity and gas utilities will adhere to undertakings given to me to strive for an early conclusion of the negotiations. The Government will continue to monitor the progress of this major resource project.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The report to which the honourable member refers shows that children using fluoridated water had an average of 1.3 less decayed, missing or filled permanent teeth than children living in areas where the water was not fluoridated.

<PARA> (2) (a) In the school dental services the estimated costs of treating an average cavity by filling is approximately $11. This does not include a component for capital costs of establishing the clinics.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The annual operating cost for fluoridating water is approximately 50 cents per person. Assuming reticulated water is available to some 90 per cent of the population, the annual operating cost for fluoridation of these water supplies would be approximately $6.7m.

<PARA> (1) (a) The Australian Wool Corporation has identified the following activities involving preparation of wool for export:</PARA>
<PARA> Receiving wool at dump from brokers store;</PARA>
<PARA> Marking bales for shipment;</PARA>
<PARA> Dumping bales;</PARA>
<PARA> Packing dumped bales into containers;</PARA>
<PARA> Cartage of container to terminal; and</PARA>
<PARA> Co-ordination of wool movements.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (b) Through membership of the Wool Commodity Group for Europe, the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) has been involved in discussions with shipping companies on the question of splitting the freight rate into separate components for ocean transport and on-shore activities. The aim is to create a more competitive environment by identifying the separate charges involved.</PARA>
<PARA> The AWC is also participating in studies of wool preparation activities in main wool ports throughout Australia in order to evaluate the need for more efficient preparation facilities and procedures and to determine the present level of charges for services currently provided.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) On-shore costs for wool as a proportion of total transport and distribution costs vary according to overseas market destinations. It is estimated that the on-shore charges from broker's store to ship's side in Australia average approximately a third of the total transport and distribution cost of delivering wool from broker's store to overseas ports.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (b) For average type wools, greasy basis, the on-shore (Broker's store to ship-side) component and the sea freight (including insurance) component are equivalent to around 2.4 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, of the landed price of wool at an overseas port.</PARA>
<PARA> There are in addition some costs, prior to the delivery from store, which have not been included in the figures just given; these costs, which relate to transport from farm to store and warehousing, are equivalent to about 2.5 per cent of the landed price of wool at an overseas port.</PARA>

<PARA>  The revised estimate for 1981-82 indicates that a saving of $95,000 is expected in this item mainly due to a delay in establishing administrative arrangements with the New South Wales waste disposal authorities in regard to the disposal of shipboard refuse at Port Kembla. It is expected these details will be agreed to during 1982-83 so allowing construction to commence in that financial year. The saving of $150,000 in 1981-82 is partially offset by an estimated increase of $45,000 in commissioning costs at the South Australian ports and an additional $10,000 required for the facility under construction in Hobart.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (a) All employees of this Department undergo pre-appointment medical examinations. In addition, employees are examined at Commonwealth expense whenever symptoms are reported which might be connected with work related illnesses or disease. In the Department's production factories a number of biomonitoring programs are in operation for the protection of employees working with chemicals or materials which may be deleterious to health. These programs are under the supervision of the Director General of Health.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Department's Central Safety Section, in conjunction with establishment safety officers routinely inspects all workplaces. Ergonomic aspects are taken into consideration along with other safety and health matters. Redesign of work- places, improved work layout and organisational aspects such as job rotation are all used as strategies to overcome work situations which may lead to repetitious injuries. Where practicable, National Health and Medical Research Council recommendations will be implemented when available. In the interim, information sources such as Standards Association of Australia and the Working Environment Division of Department of Employment and Industrial Relations are used by this Department. The Department has an approved policy on Manual Handling, designed to reduce injuries or physical stress related to repetitious handling tasks.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Due to the large number of workplace situations arising in this Department' s industrial undertakings, it has not yet been possible to closely survey all work areas from a purely ergonomic point of view. However, the system of regular safety surveys, backed up by the existence of active worker-management Safety or Area Committees, ensures that areas where repetitious injuries might occur are regularly assessed and brought to the attention of senior management.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Recommendations made as a result of these surveys have been carried out subject to availability of resources.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Based on information supplied by Australian firms which were successful tenderers for overseas contracts, it is estimated that the remuneration of their employees which would be exempt under section 23AF of the Income Tax Assessment Act would involve a cost to income tax revenue of about $50,000 in respect of the 1980-81 income year.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Income tax relief for Australians working overseas on approved projects was introduced to enhance the ability of Australian consultants to obtain a greater share of the growing market overseas for consultancy and contracting services.</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the introduction of this initiative, Australian firms had to cost their tenders for overseas projects on the basis that the earnings of Australians performing services for them were subject to tax in Australia at normal rates if the overseas country did not tax them. This placed Australian firms at a disadvantage because competitor firms from a number of other countries have been able to cost their tenders on the basis that they will be able to pay their employees at lower rates because the employees' earnings have been wholly or partly free of tax in their home country.</PARA>
<PARA> The tax exemption now provided allows Australian firms to reduce their costs while maintaining the after-tax value of remuneration paid to persons working on approved overseas projects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The Office of Road Safety (ORS) in my Department commissioned the Road Safety and Traffic Authority, Victoria, (RoSTA) to undertake the study using Loder and Bayly as consultants. Loder and Bayly were selected by a steering committee of ORS, RoSTA and Sandringham City Council ahead of three other consultants who were also invited to submit proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. (a) Physical devices including humps, road markings, warning devices, street lighting, road narrowing, and signs were installed experimentally in two streets to deter through traffic and reduce speeds.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) I am advised that Sandringham City Council has spent $20,000 on the trial implementation of these techniques.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. Filming and editing are being controlled by Film Australia in consultation with ORS. Marketing will be in accordance with Film Australia's standard marketing procedure.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Retention or dismantling of the devices involved is dependent upon performance and acceptability to residents during the trial period and will be a matter for the State and local government jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) (a) Loder and Bayly have been engaged under a standard arrangement for the engagement of consultants. They will be paid a total of $79,000 for their consultancy services in relation to the research and traffic engineering investigations involved. I am advised that a principal of the firm and a staff member may be seen on film at a meeting and the principal was interviewed for the film. This was incidental to the consultancy task and is not being separately remunerated.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Financial assistance is being provided by:</PARA>
<PARA>$  RoSTA  46,000  ORS  33,000</PARA>

<PARA> (c) The study was initiated and is being managed by the steering committee referred to in (1) above. The estimate of expenditure was derived by ORS and RoSTA based on the requirements and scope of the study coupled with experience of previous consultancy arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> The film is largely concerned with recording the process of public participation in identifying problem areas, posing solutions and evaluating measures employed in the trial. The film therefore complements an earlier ORS film ''Streets are for Sharing''. The earlier film showed what could be done to improve the local street network while the current film is intended to show local authorities how to go about involving the local community in making changes.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI7">Sir Phillip Lynch</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Commonwealth Government bodies involved in the promotion of North Queensland as a tourist destination are the Australian Tourist Commission and Qantas Airways Limited. Details of the nature and extent of their involvement are given below.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Tourist Commission (ATC)-There is no simple answer to the question, 'how much is spent by the Australian Tourist Commission on the promotion of North Queensland tourist facilities' as much of this promotion is incorporated in Australian umbrella campaigns and an apportioning of funds to specific regions is misleading.</PARA>
<PARA> Further, expenditure by the ATC is often in the form of 'seed money' where a relatively small amount by ATC is placed in such a way as to bring forth major contributions by other organisations (for example, journalist and publicist programs).</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, many significant and productive activities require no money at all (for example, tour planning and design work by ATC executives in association with overseas wholesalers and producers).</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the foregoing, ATC's activities can be categorised into four groups, viz., those dedicated to North Queensland, those umbrella-style operations with North Queensland components, 'seed money' activities with low ATC financial contributions, but manpower commitment, those with insignificant expenditure and high productivity.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Dedicated Promotions-The main source market, with the introduction of the Townsville services, is North America. In 1981-82 $70,000 was specifically invested to promote the Townsville service and North Queensland. This was spent in association with funds from the States and individual producers.</PARA>
<PARA> In Japan $24,200 was invested. In addition, $430,000 is being spent on a consumer campaign, of which a major component is North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> In the U.K. and Europe, $5,000 was earmarked for North Queensland. This is appropriate to these markets where their stage of development does not respond well to regional promotions.</PARA>
<PARA> In New Zealand, $15,000 is set aside to promote the region through the Townsville service. This is in conjunction with the State, and Qantas, and a $60 ,000 campaign will result.</PARA>
<PARA> The total ATC investment is in the order of $150,000 which is at least trebled by contributions by other organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Umbrella Promotions- (i) ATC produces publications appropriate to service consumer and trade information needs in each market.</PARA>
<PARA> In the U.K. and North America there are two publications. In each other market there is one. In addition to ATC's editorial references to regions and products, operators are encouraged to use these publications as vehicles to promote their own products.</PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of publications devoted to North Queensland are:</PARA>
<PARA> Worldwide Travel Planner</PARA>
<PARA>5 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> North America</PARA>
<PARA>9.5 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> New Zealand</PARA>
<PARA>3 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> U.K.</PARA>
<PARA>13 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Europe</PARA>
<PARA>10 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> Asia-currently being produced</PARA>
<PARA> These publications are supported by distribution costs amounting to some $ 1/2m , in addition to gross production costs over $800,000.</PARA>
<PARA> There is in addition to these publications a high prestige book devoted totally to North Queensland and the Barrier Reef which is distributed throughout ATC offices.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) ATC also initiates and co-ordinates umbrella promotions where the Australian producers meet overseas wholesalers and retailers.</PARA>
<PARA> North Queensland operators are encouraged to join these events, and do so. The region is also reflected in stand publicity materials, posters, et cetera, as well as the ATC publications being distributed at these events. The cost of mounting these events exceeds $400,000, though this cost is partly shared by industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 'Seed Money' Promotions-This vital form of promotion takes place in all markets across a diverse range of activities, and accordingly it is not possible to define precise amounts. However, the following will serve as indications:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) In the 1981-82 financial year to date, on ATC's journalist/publicist programme whereby editorial opinion leaders are sponsored to Australia, 31 participants have spent 139 days (that is, 4,309 man days) in North Queensland. Articles from these visits are generated for at least several years and therefore it is not possible to quantify the total return. However, ATC's Japan expenditure of $15,000 returned $115,000 worth of publicity within 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) ATC encourages media around the world to undertake editorial specials on Australia through the financial support of an advertisement or journalist assistance. The editorial result is far beyond the value of the advertisement.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Insignificant Expenditure but High Productivity-ATC offices around the world provide advice and assistance to both the trade and consumers throughout all useful markets. This is generated through extensive contacts within the travel trades of the world, and ATC's willingness to meet anywhere there is an opportunity to develop tourism to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> North Queensland is strongly promoted at any such opportunity. Discussions with the trade are often in the area of itinerary planning by wholesalers and most wholesaler programmes are directly influenced, if not initiated, by ATC senior executives.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, ATC maintains film lending systems around the world. One of the ATC's most recently produced films is devoted to the Great Barrier Reef and this film is being used extensively.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the ATC's priority to develop promotional programmes in co-operation with those who will commercially benefit from the promotion-the effectiveness of any regional promotion is a function not only of ATC's expenditure, but also the effort and expenditure of the industry in that region in supporting the ATC activity and the method used to employ these available funds.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the best estimate of funds expended specifically in reference to North Queensland would be $200,000 to $300,000 (out of a total budget for 1981- 82 of $9.2m), but such an estimate does not reflect the true 'investment' given to this or any other region.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Qantas Airways Limited-Qantas Airways has been most active in promoting Townsville as a point of disembarkation for international visitors both in anticipation of and since the commencement of its services to Townsville from Los Angeles and Auckland in February 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> In New Zealand Qantas has spent over NZ$100,000 in television, radio and Press advertising, and in the production of promotional literature and merchandising material, in the last 12 months. New tour programmes have been launched in conjunction with New Zealand-based tour wholesalers which use Townsville as a point of disembarkation in Australia. The emphasis on Townsville as a gateway from New Zealand has been heightened following Qantas's decision to operate non- stop services from Auckland to Townsville commencing April 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> In North America, the launch of new services to Townsville and Brisbane in February 1981 was heralded by a major promotional blitz early last year. Thirty- five presentations were made to over 3,400 travel agents, featuring an audio- visual on Northern Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef, recommending a selection of tours using Townsville as the gateway and highlighting the new Qantas service. Door prizes at each function were tickets on Qantas from U.S. West Coast to Townsville. Over US$100,000 was spent by Qantas on this launch. Additionally the Townsville gateway to Australia has featured strongly in all print and television advertising in the U.S.A. and Canada throughout 1981, with a budget in excess of US$800,000 being dedicated to promoting Queensland as an important Qantas destination from North America.</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia Qantas has worked in close partnership with the Australian Tourist Commission, the Queensland Travel and Tourist Corporation, inbound tour operators, hotels and attraction operators to ensure the best possible presentation available through the Townsville gateway in overseas markets. Several of its senior officers have visited Townsville and Northern Queensland frequently to speak to industry groups and to extend this partnership to the mutual benefit of all concerned. Qantas's objective has been to increase the numbers of overseas visitors from all over the world to Northern Queensland and to encourage them to extend their stays there.</PARA>
<PARA> Promotional activities planned for 1982 include increased effort and expenditure not only in New Zealand and North America, but also in the U.K., Europe and Asia, with the advent of new services from London and Singapore direct to Townsville which commenced in April 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the above, increased tourism flows to North Queensland are facilitated by the availability of a number of package holidays at reduced prices to the region offered by the domestic airlines-as well as the inclusion of Townsville and Cairns on some of the round Australia routes offered by the airlines at below normal economy airfares (viz., TAA's 'Discover Australia' fares and Ansett's 'Explore Exciting Australia' fares).</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Australian Embassy officials have attempted to attend the following trials since 21 July 1981:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Chernobilsky, Boris, (b) Krasnogorsk, (c) 9 December 1981, (d) (i) Section 191 (2) RSFSR Criminal Code-offering resistance to those seeking to protect the public order, (d) (ii) 1 year, (e) 'Court full', (f) No representative permitted to attend-UK, USA attempted.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) During my visit to Israel earlier this year I spoke with Mrs Shcharansky about her husband's circumstances and, at her request, made further inquiries about him. Since my meeting with Mrs Shcharansky the Government has also made representations to the Soviet authorities on her husband's behalf. No new initiatives to obtain the release of Dr Orlov have been launched since 13 October 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) I am advised by my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that (a) the following family reunions of Soviet citizens who wished to join relatives in Australia occurred in (i) 1979, 27; (ii) 1980, 36; (iii) 1981, 17.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The total number of persons emigrating to Australia from the USSR was (i) 1979, 106; (ii) 1980, 152; (iii) 1981, 79.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No explanation can be offered for fluctuations in these figures from year to year.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As my predecessor noted on 18 September 1980, the question of establishing a Standing Parliamentary Committee is a matter for the Parliament. I should, however, reiterate the Government's position which is to agree with the reservations expressed by several members of the Committee, including its Chairman, on Recommendation 65.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that existing structures offer adequate opportunities to canvass human rights issues. In Australia, for example, the Australian Human Rights Commission, which came into operation on 10 December 1981, now plays a significant role in safe-guarding human rights in areas of Commonwealth responsibility. State Governments have their own machinery for monitoring human rights in their areas of jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA> Internationally, in addition to direct bilateral representations on cases of human rights violations, Australia pursues its concerns through various multilateral channels, including the United Nations, Commission on Human Rights and the UN General Assembly. The Government maintains its firm commitment and support for UN and other international human rights bodies as the most effective means of promoting increased respect for human rights in all parts of the world.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, members of parliament retain their freedom to raise domestic and international human rights questions in both Houses and to refer such questions to the appropriate existing committees, such as the two Foreign Affairs and Defence Committees. The Parliamentary Amnesty Group has also provided an informal and often singularly effective channel for action.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government therefore believes that existing channels provide ample scope for action aimed at promoting and protecting human rights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Liability for indirect taxation falls upon registered taxpayers who pass the tax on to their customers in the price for which they sell the goods. The taxpayers, therefore, do not bear the cost of the tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Any incentive for avoiding such a tax is, therefore, substantially less than may be the case under a direct tax system.</PARA>
<PARA> A much smaller number of taxpayers is required to account for indirect taxes as compared with the number required to pay direct taxes. Administration of an indirect tax system is more easily controlled.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes, it is not necessary to assume the proposition in the question. It is a fact.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The 'cash' economy is part of the field, also described as the 'grey' or ' hidden' economy, in which tax evasion and avoidance are considered to be practised. This field also includes the 'cashless' economy, where barter takes the place of money transactions. Numerous estimates have been made of the revenue losses through these unrecorded transactions but none can be regarded as firmly-based because of the lack of hard evidence, in terms of statistical or financial aggregates. I need scarcely mention that the activities covered by the cash economy are usually concealed and, therefore, not readily capable of measurement.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has been concerned with the problem of deficits in State and Commonwealth-owned railways and their impact on Government revenues for some time. The Commonwealth has taken positive steps to improve the position of the railways in the past. These include funding of projects proposed by the States for the improvement of the quality, capacity, efficiency and safety of urban public transport in major cities such as new rolling-stock in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide and electrification of certain suburban lines in Brisbane, and the funding of standard gauge rail links between all State mainland capitals, the remaining link to Adelaide being currently under construction.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is currently providing funds under the National Railway Network (Financial Assistance) Act 1979 for mainline upgrading, and played a significant and active role in establishing and subsequently funding the Australian Railway Research and Development Organisation (ARRDO).</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to realise that such initiatives are necessarily undertaken in close co-operation with the States. In this regard, I am particularly pleased that ARRDO's 1981 Report recommendations support the Commonwealth's ' commercialisation' of its own railway, Australian National, as a deficit- reducing measure, and I hope the States will give serious consideration to pursuing a similar policy with their own railway systems. In addition I look forward to further discussions with my Australian Transport Advisory Council colleagues on such questions as cost recovery in the land transport sector and future investment in government railways-matters which our advisers are already examining.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is also carefully examining its own role in the railway area in the light of the ARRDO Report with a view to developing new initiatives and policies for the future. Such initiatives cannot be viewed in isolation and must reflect the overall budgetary priorities of the Commonwealth Government and recognise that many of the railway problems identified by ARRDO lie entirely within the States' area of responsibilities.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TE7">Mr Hodges</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The question of extending the Telephone Interpreter Service (TIS) to remote areas like the Pilbara, Riverina and Mount Isa was raised in the policy statement of 30 September 1980. For some years, automatic telephone diverters have been used with success to extend the Telephone Interpreter Service to remote localities. Now that the INWATS system is available within the Telecom network, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is examining with Telecom the possibility of using the INWATS system to extend TIS not only to the above centres but to Australia generally. INWATS would allow calls to be made from any location in Australia to a TIS centre or centres for the cost to the caller of a local telephone call.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No extension of the service has taken place using automatic telephone diverters since 30 September 1980 because the better technology provided by the INWATS system will probably replace the existing diverters and any others which may have been contemplated in the short term. In the meantime, callers in localities not presently served by a TIS centre or an automatic telephone diverter make use of the nearest TIS centre on a reverse charge call basis.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to the Review of Australia's Demographic Trends, 1982, presented to Parliament on 4 May 1982, by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and, in particular, the fact that the proportion of settler arrivals in the family reunion category has fallen from 26.2 per cent in 1977 to 17.6 per cent and arrivals in other categories have risen from 54,000 in 1977 to 91,600 in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Given that settlers in the other categories are likely to require a higher proportion of separate accommodation than family reunion settlers will he explain why the Government has reduced Federal outlays on public housing and held down home building activity in the private sector.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI7">Sir Phillip Lynch</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is little data available on the accommodation occupied by settlers in the short term after their arrival, however it is likely that the honourable member's implication that settlers in other categories require a higher proportion of separate accommodation than family reunion settlers is correct. In this context it should be kept in mind that the housing requirements of new settlers account for a minority of the total addition to housing demand in each year, the remainder being a result of new household formation by existing Australian residents. On the subject of the Government's actions in regard to the housing industry and public housing, the Government has not acted to hold down building activity in the private sector. The Government's housing package, announced by the Treasurer on 18 March, contains measures to increase the availability of finance to home buyers, and also provides a range of other measures to make home purchase easier for first home buyers. The effect of this package should be to reduce present constraints on home building activity in the private sector, and there is already some evidence that such an effect has been achieved. In the area of public housing, the Government remains committed to providing housing assistance for those most in need. Under the present Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement the Commonwealth has undertaken to provide the States with a guaranteed minimum level of funding for welfare housing of $ 200m for each of the five years of the Agreement. Additional funding will also be provided to the States each year to the extent that it can be afforded in the context of the Budget. In the current financial year, a total of $62.2m was provided in this way. The Commonwealth's total budget outlays for housing and accommodation purposes have increased from $554.7m in 1980-81 to $723.2m in 1981 -82. Commonwealth funds are not the only source of finance for public sector housing, and decisions on funding levels are taken with due regard to what other funds are available to the States. In recent years the States have received increased general revenue moneys from the Commonwealth, which they can also direct to welfare housing where they recognise housing as an area of priority.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) There was no minimum age pension in 1968-69.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The means test on age pensions was abolished for persons aged 70 to 74 with effect from 1 May 1975 (75 and over from 4 October 1973). The maximum rate of age pension thus became the minimum rate for 70-year-olds. This rate, in money terms and as a percentage of seasonally adjusted average weekly earnings in the June quarter 1975, was-</PARA>
<PARA> $36.00 a week for a single pensioner (23.3 per cent);</PARA>
<PARA> $30.00 a week for a married pensioner (19.4 per cent);</PARA>
<PARA> $60.00 a week combined for a pensioner couple (38.8 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this measure, the minimum age pension payable to 70-year-olds for 1974-75 as a whole was $360 (single), $300 (married) and $600 (pensioner couple)-each figure representing five fortnightly payments. Dividing these amounts by 52 gives weekly average rates for the year as a whole of, respectively, $6.92, $5.77 and $11.54.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Amount of income not affecting the pension under the means or income test, as the case may be. For 1968-69 and 1974-75, when the means test applied rather than the present income test, the amounts shown are the free areas of 'means as assessed' divided by 52.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Supplementary assistance was not payable to a pensioner couple in 1968-69. A married pensioner whose wife attracted 'wife's allowance' was entitled to supplementary assistance if the couple's income was below $3.00 a week (4.3 per cent of AWE for the year).</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Amount of non-pension income at which a single pensioner or pensioner couple lose entitlement to Pensioner Health Benefits (1980-81) or Pensioner Medical Service benefits (1968-69 and 1974-75). The method of calculation for 1968-69 and 1974-75 corresponds to that in footnote (c).</PARA>
<PARA> (f) All pensioners were entitled to Pensioner Medical Service benefits in 1968- 69. Thus in effect the point where eligibility ceased was the sum of the 'free area' under the means test and the maximum rate of pension. The figures shown have been calculated by adding the weighted average weekly rate of pension for the year as a whole to the relevant 'free area' which applied throughout the year.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Assuming pensioner is a resident of age pension age and thus entitled to the age allowance. This allowance had the effect of ensuring that a single aged person did not pay tax unless his or her taxable income was $1,249 ($24.02 a week) or more. The corresponding figure for a married aged person who derived all of the couple's non-pension income, and contributed to the maintenance of the spouse was $2,185 ($42.02 a week) or more. Age pensions were not subject to tax in 1968-69.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) Assumes pensioner of age pension age.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Assumes both partners of age pension age and that all non-pension income derived by one partner.</PARA>
<PARA> (j) For 1974-75 and 1980-81, assumes no expenditure-related concessional deductions or concessional rebates, respectively (assumption not relevant in 1968-69).</PARA>

<PARA> (2) In relation to the current proposals for the introduction of wide body jet aircraft and the provision of facilities for the introduction of international services at Adelaide, the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has agreed that while these works and the associated air services will have some environmental effect, at this stage an Environmental Impact Statement is not required to meet the object of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. A draft Environmental Impact Statement and Provisional Master Plan covering the environmental and social consequences likely to be associated with the continued development and use of Adelaide Airport as the sole primary airport serving the Adelaide region will be released for public comment in July 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The draft Environmental Impact Statement will address, among other issues, the effects of any significant increases in international air traffic at Adelaide Airport.</PARA>

<PARA> Source: Derived from Australian Bureau of Statistics data. For details of method of calculation, refer to my Press release No. 35 of 31 March 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Adjusted income payable overseas is derived by adding to income payable overseas an estimate of the equity of overseas portfolio investors in the undistributed profits of companies in which they hold shares. This estimate is based on the assumption that the companies concerned ploughed back one-half of their profits each year.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Since my Press release of March 1980, revisions have been made to the Australian Bureau of Statistics data used to derive the proportions of total company income payable overseas in 1977-78 and in earlier years.</PARA>
<PARA> The table indicates that the proportion of total (adjusted) company income payable overseas fell from 34.2 per cent in 1979-80 to 28.9 per cent in 1980-81. This compares with the increase in the ratio between 1974-75 and 1977-78.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the proportion of company income payable overseas is subject to a good deal of short-term fluctuation and apparent trends may be subject to reversal as revised and more recent data become available. Moreover, the proportion, apart from being calculated from data that are subject to problems of statistical estimation, would be affected by various influences in addition to the level of foreign ownership in the economy. These include any tendency for the profitability of enterprises in which foreigners have invested to differ from that of other Australian enterprises and for the profitability and taxation payments of sectors in which foreign ownership is relatively high to vary relative to other sectors. For these reasons considerable care must be exercised in drawing any conclusions relating to the extent of foreign participation in the economy from the data.</PARA>

<PARA>1 April 1982   Two leaking joints were discovered on a pipeline between the Waste Rock Run Off Pond and Evaporation Pond 2 and repaired immediately.

<PARA>29 July 1981   The recycle water tank overflowed spilling process water from No. 3 Pond in the neutral thickener bund area. Some of the water and a minor amount of tailings solids was pumped into the storm water collection pond which discharges to No. 2 Pond during the wet season. The estimated volume pumped was 40m3.</PARA>
<PARA>25 August 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Week ending 31 July 1981   Fugitive slaked lime dust from a lime transfer operation was blown by a strong wind onto the surface of Djalkmara Billabong and this was reflected in a pH of 9.3 detected during routine water monitoring. The impact on the small billabong was minor and the problem is not expected to occur again as subsequently slaked lime has been sprayed with water before and during loading.</PARA>
<PARA>25 August 1981</PARA>
<PARA>5 August 1981   The clarified pregnant liquor tank and the associated clarifier tank overflowed into an enclosing bund due to an operator's error. The overflow was stopped by adjusting the process flow rate. The liquor was pumped back into the tanks. During the overflow the radiation intensity increased slightly around the bunded area but the incident was minor.</PARA>
<PARA>25 August 1981</PARA>
<PARA>August 1981   For the commissioning of the grinding mills counter current decantation thickeners and tailings disposal system, waste rock was used. The ground waste discharged into the tailings dam accumulated at one point in the dam, grounding the discharge pontoon and exposing some of the material to atmosphere. This situation has been corrected and now that tailings are being discharged into the dam, the routine for moving the pipe has been established.</PARA>
<PARA>25 August 1981</PARA>
<PARA>13 August 1981   It was brought to notice that a sewerage manhole at the Coonjimba camp was overflowing at about 3-4 litres per minute and the effluent was flowing along the track to Coonjimba billabong. The leak was due to a failure in the automatic pump controls which did not allow the pump to start.</PARA>
<PARA>25 August 1981</PARA>
<PARA>3-23 November 1981   The NT Department of Mines and Energy discovered that two islands about 20 square metres in all had appeared in the tailings dam whereas the then existing Authorisation called for a 2 metre cover of water. The Department closed the mine for 4 days while reviewing the Authorisation. Following the issue of an amendment which did not specify a minimum depth of water but simply required that free water be maintained over the settled tailings, the mine was re-opened. This amendment was along the lines recommended by the Supervising Scientist in June 1981. The infringement was of a technical nature and did not pose a hazard to people or the environment.</PARA>
<PARA>23 November 1981</PARA>
<PARA>23 November 1981   A spillage of concentrate from a drum occurred outside the Concentrate Store during an unloading operation. The spillage was cleaned up in accordance with safety procedures and a check by the health physicist showed the clean-up to be satisfactory. This was verified the following day by a Department of Mines and Energy inspector.</PARA>
<PARA>24 November 1981</PARA>
<PARA>25 November 1981   There were two observed emissions of concentrate dust from the scrubber stack on the product building, the estimate of total discharge being 2 to 4 kg. The cause was failure of an interlock system due to an electrical bridge which had been left behind during commissioning. To avoid a recurrence of such an event, the bridge has been removed and a revised operating procedure has been formulated.</PARA>
<PARA>30 November 1981</PARA>
<PARA>26 November 1981   An operator was found wading in bare feet in the tailings dam while hosing down one of the beaches formed in the dam. This should have been done while wearing boots. Both the operator and his supervisor were instructed on the importance of preventing recurrences of this nature.</PARA>
<PARA>1 December 1981</PARA>
<PARA>11 December 1981   A small amount of tailings on the floor within the perimeter of the tailings dam had leaked from a pipeline joint. The material was covered with soil as water had not reached that level.</PARA>
<PARA>12 January 1982</PARA>
<PARA>14 December 1981   A small spillage of tailings occurred from a breather valve on a tailings line onto the inside perimeter of the top of the tailings dam embankment. This was removed into the tailings dam and placed under water by people suitably protected. These breather valves have been removed as they are not essential and this will preclude such spillages in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>12 January 1982</PARA>
<PARA>22 December 1981   No. 3 Sewage Retention Pond overflowed but was not noticed until the daily check because of the absence of the injured operator, a contractor (unbeknown to the mining company). To prevent recurrences of this nature the sewage treatment plant will now be operated by the mining company. Dilution of the effluent by heavy rainfall meant that environmental impact was very minor.</PARA>
<PARA>12 January 1982</PARA>
<PARA>28 December 1981   An operator was sprayed with ammonium diuranate (ADU) while trying to locate and rectify a pipeline blockage. He showered and changed immediately and had his eyes washed at the first aid post. Subsequent urine tests showed that he had been effectively decontaminated. In future any employee sprayed with radioactive material will also be checked after showering for skin contamination. A drain valve has been installed on the line to prevent a recurrence of the incident.</PARA>
<PARA>4 January 1982</PARA>
<PARA>2 January 1982    A break in a tailings disposal line on the inside wall of the northern embankment eroded part of the dam wall. The wall was repaired with waste rock and the line was repaired with more suitable material. The frequency of inspections of the tailings pipelines and dam has been increased to enable earlier detection of any malfunctions.</PARA>
<PARA> 12 January 1982</PARA>
<PARA>5 January 1982   Yellowcake was spilled from two drums being transported by forklift outside the packing area. The spillage was cleaned up under the supervision of the Radiation Safety Officer and a representative of the Department of Mines and Energy. The forklift will no longer be used to carry drums any great distance with the drum clamping device. An improved drum loading procedure will reduce the possibility of drum deformation which can lead to sealing difficulties and hence make spillage more likely.</PARA>
<PARA>8 January 1982</PARA>
<PARA>22-23 January 1982   About forty fish (boney bream) were found dead in Coonjimba Billabong. Water quality checks showed nothing abnormal. Fish kills occur naturally in the region from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA>28 January 1982</PARA>
<PARA>18 February 1982   A leak in a tailings disposal line was detected. The line was immediately shut down and flushed out and the Radiation Safety Officer notified. When the Mines Inspector arrived on site one hour later repair of the line and clean up of the tailings had been organised. The tailings were contained in the restricted release zone and supervised area. There was no danger to health or the environment. The company agreed to build a bond along the top of the tailings dam wall in order to prevent any loss of tailings from the dam wall in the event of any future leak from either of the tailings lines.</PARA>
<PARA>2 March 1982</PARA>
<PARA>25 February 1982   Acid mist eliminators in the sulphuric acid plant became flooded owing to a blocked drain line and acid mist levels exceeded the specified limits. The plant was shut down and the problem corrected. By 3 March the plant was running satisfactorily and within specification.</PARA>
<PARA>1 April 1982</PARA>
<PARA>4 March 1982   A small island of tailings of about one square metre and an above water height of 2cm formed in the tailings dam on nightshift. The solids were quickly dispersed and were covered by water. A planned change of pipelines on the previous night had not taken place.</PARA>
<PARA>1 April l982</PARA>
<PARA>16 March 1982   The SO2 analyser on the acid plant was damaged by acid. Reich SO2 tests were carried out on the exit gas once per shift pending the arrival of spare parts. Values were below the allowed limit.</PARA>
<PARA>1 April 1982</PARA>
<PARA>25 March 1982   A bleeder valve at the tailings discharge pipeline leaked a small amount of tailings onto the inside top of the embankment. This was sluiced into the dam by water truck and hose.</PARA>
<PARA>1 April 1982</PARA>
<PARA>20 April 1982   About 30 cubic metres of organic pregnant uranium solution overflowed from the organic dump tank decant sump into the storm water system to No. 2 pond. The transfer operation which caused the overflow was stopped and the sump is to be modified to avoid a recurrence of the event.</PARA>

<PARA>SO2 emission levels from the acid plant stack exceeded the allowable limit of 2 kg per tonne of acid produced when measured over the period 22 January to 2 February 1982. It was determined that this situation had most likely existed since 17 July 1981.The cause of the problem was that a spectacle plate was installed where a blank plate should have been. Subsequent to the rectification of the problem the emission level has averaged around 1.3 kg per tonne of acid produced. Routine shift monitoring of the stack gas is now being carried out and should prevent such a problem recurring.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr Thomson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The survey referred to was a pilot trial for a research project by university staff at Repatriation General Hospital, Concord. It was not a Departmental Survey.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (A) (a) and (b) (i) No Veterans' Affairs Department officers were involved in the preparation of the survey.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b) (ii) Associate Professor C. Tennant, University of Sydney, attached to Repatriation General Hospital, Concord, prepared the survey.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b) (iii) No other persons were involved in its preparation.</PARA>
<PARA> (B) The questionnaire was submitted to the Branch Office Medical Research Advisory Committee in the usual way and approval was granted subject to the development of a suitable consent form and subsequent reference to the Central Office Medical Research Advisory Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> The Branch Office Medical Research Advisory Committee is chaired by the Director (Medical Services) who was absent on this occasion and was represented by Dr O. G. Curteis, General Medical Superintendent, Repatriation General Hospital, Concord. Other committee members were Professor M. Pheils, Professor of Surgery, University of Sydney; Professor J. Lawrence, Professor of Medicine, University of Sydney; Dr G. Crane, Senior Staff Specialist, Haematology; Dr A. Breslin, Departmental Consultant (Chest Diseases); Dr O. Peiris, Visiting Medical Specialist and Mr D. Eagleson, Assistant Deputy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. The intention of the research project proposed was to question only Vietnam veterans who were psychiatric in-patients at R.G.H. Concord, and wider distribution could have had an adverse effect on the research. Pending Central Office Medical Research Advisory Committee approval a draft questionnaire was given to five Vietnam veterans who were in-patients at the time, as a pilot trial. This pilot trial was undertaken without the knowledge of the central administration of my Department or of myself and when it was brought to my attention, further work on it was suspended.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The purpose of the questionnaire was to obtain information for a research project, by a university staff member based at Concord, with a dual purpose. The primary purpose was to enable assessment of any relationship between experiences in Vietnam and the subsequent occurrence of psychiatric disorder, and the secondary purpose was to compare the experience of Australian and American Veterans both in Vietnam and subsequently.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Nil.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The research project and its methodology is being re-considered and a decision is not available. If the project is supported as valid in objectives and methodology, a questionnaire may be used.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) No. The questionnaire involved was a draft being used for a pilot trial. It has no endorsed status and should not be published for that reason. Furthermore, if a decision were to be taken subsequently to permit the research project to proceed, it could be invalidated by prior publication of the questionnaire.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The questionnaire was based on the most widely used questionnaire in the United States of America, one which has been used in Veterans' Administration Hospitals, presumably with Veterans' Administration approval. It was designed by Professor Charles Figley. For the purposes of comparison of the American and Australian experience it was thought necessary to follow as closely as possible the methodology used in the United States.</PARA>

<PARA> Government nursing homes are nursing homes operated by or on behalf of the Government of a State or Territory. Patients in Government nursing homes are eligible for Commonwealth nursing home benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> Participating nursing homes are mainly private enterprise nursing homes. There are some charitable and benevolent nursing homes which do not wish to operate under the deficit financing arrangements in this group. Patients in participating nursing homes are eligible for Commonwealth nursing home benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> Deficit financed nursing homes are homes in which the approved budgeted deficit is met by the Federal Government. These homes are mainly charitable and benevolent homes. Commonwealth benefits are not payable in these homes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The number of beds that have been approved but not yet established is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales  3,061  Victoria  1,626  Queensland  1,570  South Australia 1, 191  Western Australia  185  Tasmania  180  Northern Territory  54 Australian Capital Territory  60</PARA>
<PARA>  Total  7,927</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) For Government and participating nursing homes the Federal Government pays nursing home benefits under Part VA of the National Health Act. The current maximum basic benefit levels in each State, from 5 November 1981, are:</PARA>
<PARA> NSW and ACT-$23.00 per patient per day</PARA>
<PARA> Vic.-$31.65 per patient per day</PARA>
<PARA> Qld-$20.40 per patient per day</PARA>
<PARA> SA and NT-$27.60 per patient per day</PARA>
<PARA> WA-$18.55 per patient per day</PARA>
<PARA> Tas.-$20.65 per patient per day</PARA>
<PARA> Patients needing and receiving extensive nursing care as defined in the National Health Act receive an additional $6 per day extensive care benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that the Federal Government will provide some $410m in 1981/82 by way of basic and extensive care benefits. This represents an average subsidy for the financial year of $20.82 per bed per day for the 53,951 Government and participating nursing homes as at 31 March 1982. However, as indicated above, the actual rates of benefit paid (including the $6 extensive care benefit) are higher than the overall average indicated because the average subsidy figure includes four months (June to 5 November 1981) of effective lower basic benefit rates prior to the last increase from 5 November 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in the answer to Question 1, patients in deficit financed nursing homes do not receive a direct per day benefit as such. Instead, the approved operating deficits of the homes are met by the Federal Government. It is estimated that the deficit financing program will cost the Federal Government $ 165m in 1981/82. This represents an average subsidy of $27.85 per bed per day for the 16,232 established beds as at 31 March 1982. The actual subsidy per bed would, of course, vary from home to home and State to State depending on the cost of operation of each home.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) In determining an appropriate period for airport concessions due recognition is given to a number of factors, including the size and nature of the particular concession and the extent of capital investment required of the successful tenderer.</PARA>
<PARA> The Parafield Airport concession had been previously operated only as a limited canteen service. However, public tenders were invited when interest was shown in the commercial prospects of an upgraded facility with a longer term lease. In addition there is a long term planning need to relocate the concession. As a consequence it is anticipated that the successful tenderer will be required to invest a relatively significant amount of capital in fixed improvements.</PARA>
<PARA> While it is hoped that the increased earning potential of an improved facility will encourage the necessary capital investment, this will be a matter for the commercial judgement of the market place. It was considered however that a term of 15 years would attract offers and be sufficient to enable the concessionaire to recover his capital investment together with a reasonable profit.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) These matters are kept under review and I refer the honourable member to the Senate Hansard of 21 April 1982, page 1437, which records my reply to a somewhat similar question raised by Senator Tate.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) The majority of Australia's imported supplies of crude oil is procured under contractual type arrangements at official prices and very little is procured on spot markets. Moreover, if purchases of overseas crude oil supplies were made at reduced prices this factor would be taken into account by the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority when determining maximum justified wholesale prices. In these circumstances there is likely to be little scope for oil companies operating in Australia to make significant windfall profits.</PARA>
<PARA> Two further points are worth mentioning. First, while spot prices were generally well below official prices earlier in the year, this is no longer the case. Secondly, exchange rate movements-as well as crude oil price movements- have an impact on the price of crude oil and petroleum products in Australia; decisions by the PPPA this year to allow increases in maximum wholesale prices have included the higher costs of imported crude and products as a consequence of exchange rate movements as well as changes in the import parity price. As I indicated in my Press Statement of 24 June 1982, the most recent increase in the import parity price for indigenous crude oil is attributable mainly to the reduction in value of the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar over the 6 month period to June 1982.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is a fact that the published paper referred to by the honourable member states that most of the increase in the proportion of children with caries-free teeth occurred before 1967.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) A maximum limit of 0.2 parts per million of fluoride in water used for dialysis was suggested by a joint working party set up in 1979 by the Australian Society of Nephrology and the Australian Kidney Foundation Dialysis and Transplant Committee. There is no evidence that skeletal fluorosis occurs under these conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Claims that skeletal fluorosis was observed in India, Qatar and Japan were reported in 1961, 1961 and 1950 respectively in areas where the fluoride content of the drinking water ranged from 0.8 to 3.4 parts per million. I am not aware of any confirmation of these findings.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1979, the World Health Assembly of the World Health Organisation reaffirmed its support for the fluoridation of water as being a safe and effective method for the prevention of dental caries. The World Health Organisation has recommended fluoride levels in drinking water within the range of 0.6-1.7 parts per million depending on annual average maximum daily air temperature.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) There is no confirmed evidence that skeletal fluorosis occurs in persons with kidney damage, whose drinking water contains the recommended levels of fluoride.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) In the treatment of osteoporosis, gastro-intestinal symptoms have been reported with doses of 23 to 34 mg of fluoride per day. I am not aware of evidence of gastro-intestinal symptoms in cases where daily doses of 9 mg of fluoride per day have been used.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The effect of fluoridation on health has been the subject of extensive investigation. There is no substantiated evidence that fluoride, at the levels recommended for water fluoridation, affects skin, digestive or nervous systems. The matters of allergy and intolerance to fluoride were considered by the American Academy of Allergists. In 1971 the Academy adopted the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA> 'There is no evidence of allergy or intolerance to fluoride as used in the fluoridation of community supplies.'</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Claims that fluoridation of water supplies increases the risk of Down's Syndrome are based on three papers which were published in 1956, 1959 and 1963. These claims were severely criticised by the Royal Commission into the Fluoridation of Public Water Supplies in Tasmania (1968) as being unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA> Several other studies both before and since the Tasmanian Royal Commission have failed to demonstrate any association between fluoridation and Down's Syndrome.

<PARA> (b) There is no single percentage answer to this question. The facts are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) generally operators spend 85 per cent of their day on operating duties. However, these operating duties include non-keying tasks such as reading documents, work recording, liaison with supervisors and customers, etc. The time spent on these non-keying tasks varies but can be as high as 50 per cent of the time spent on operating duties.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) approximately 5 per cent of operators' time is spent on 'other' duties such as completion of flextime forms, completion of training documents, etc.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) and (ii) This varies according to the requirements of each situation.

<PARA> On the other hand, the output of Word Processing Operators is not evaluated in terms of Keystrokes because of the necessity for a great deal of interaction with the computer programs in progressively editing and correcting documents.

<PARA> (1) Following a meeting of Commonwealth officers with representatives of the Pitjantjatjara Council in November 1980, I wrote to the Chairman of the Council on 30 January 1981 offering a program of soil tests and personal medical tests. Since no contemporary record has been found of the 'black mist' incident, I asked the Council to provide a description of its precise location and the names of the people involved in it. There has however, been no response from the Council to my letter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In September 1977 the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) directed that a Working Party be established to review available data on sodium in the Australian diet. In September 1978 the NHMRC directed that the matter of the sodium content of Australian water supplies be referred to the Working Party .</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently the Working Party on Sodium in the Australian Diet was established with the following terms of reference: 'To inquire into and report to the Nutrition Committee on the sodium content of the Australian diet and the public health implications thereof'. The Working Party considered amongst other things, the available data on the sodium content of drinking water in Australia and the health implications of consuming water of high sodium content.</PARA>

<PARA> * milligrams per litre</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (a) (i) No standards for total dissolved solids for water quality are recommended by the Federal Government. The joint National Health and Medical Research Council/Australian Water Resources Council guidelines 'Desirable Quality for Drinking Water in Australia' recommended a current desirable criterion for total dissolved solids of 1500 mg/L with a long term objective of 500 mg/L.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) Neither the World Health Organisation nor the Federal Government has recommended an acceptable level for sodium in drinking water.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) (ii) and (b) (ii) Responsibility for water quality in the States lies with the health authorities in those States. In the Australian Capital Territory, where responsibility lies ultimately with the Minister for Health, levels of sodium and total dissolved solids are so low as not to be a matter of concern to public health.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Present criteria for total dissolved solids are based on taste considerations. Waters with high total dissolved solids are not necessarily high in sodium. At present there are no widely adopted criteria for determining acceptable levels of sodium in drinking water.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr Carlton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The National Health Act and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act, both of which are administered by my Department, provide for the payment of daily rates of nursing home benefits in respect of individual patients and for the provision of financial assistance to eligible non-profit organisations in meeting approved operating deficits incurred in conducting nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA> Both of these Acts require that, in considering an application for approval for the construction or acquisition of new nursing home accommodation or for the provision of any additional nursing home accommodation at an existing nursing home, regard shall be had to the adequacy of the existing accommodation available (including premises proposed to be approved as nursing homes) in the area in which the additional accommodation is to be provided. The Acts also provide that before reaching a decision on an application for approval-in- principle my Department must consult with the State authority responsible for the administration of nursing homes. For this purpose a Commonwealth/State Co- ordinating Committee on Nursing Home Accommodation has been established in each State.</PARA>
<PARA> These co-ordinating committees consider applications for new nursing home accommodation and forward a report and recommendation in respect of each application to my Department for final decision.</PARA>
<PARA> A proposal was received from St Mary's Concord Community Centre for the Frail Aged for a 40 bed hostel and a 20 bed nursing home. The Commonwealth/State Co- ordinating committee examined the nursing home proposal but recommended in its report to my Department that the proposal not be granted approval-in-principle. The Co-ordinating committee's recommendation for non-approval, which was supported by the representatives of the New South Wales Health Commission and was, in fact, unanimous, was based on its assessment that there are sufficient nursing home beds in the area without the additional 20 beds sought. Based on the Committee's report my Department endorsed the recommendation for non- approval and the organisation has since been advised to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA> However the relevent legislation empowers me to review my Department's decision in such cases and, should the organisation request such a review, I would be pleased to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of any indication of approval for the proposal by the New South Wales Minister for Health but in any case approval-in-principle and subsequent approval in substance is, in the context of the honourable member's question, purely for the purposes of paying federal financial assistance to the nursing home. The New South Wales Government bears virtually none of the financial burdens that accrue from the approval of new, privately operated nursing homes. It would therefore not be appropriate for the New South Wales Minister for Health to indicate, unilaterally, approval for such proposals, at least insofar as such action may be taken to imply that federal financial assistance will be forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The question of capital funding of eligible nursing homes is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social Security and his Department. However, I understand that the Department of Social Security will only consider such funding proposals when and if my Department grants approval-in-principle for the nursing home to proceed. The question of capital funding for the 40 hostel beds mentioned is one for the Department of Social Security and such proposals are not subject to consideration by Commonwealth/State co-ordinating committees or by my Department.</PARA>

<PARA> What measures (a) have been taken and (b) are planned, to fully implement recommendations 29 to 34, and 37 to 40 of the 4th Report of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations entitled 'The provision of roads: A Report on the relations among the 3 spheres of Government in Australia 1981'.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="173" SPEAKER="Hunt The Hon R.J.D." NAMEID="GH4" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="SHORTLAND">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Recommendations 29 to 34</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b). These recommendations deal with the establishment of an Australian Roads Council (which would form, to all intents and purposes, a part of ATAC) to discuss roads matters relevant to local government. Representation of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations and the Bureau of Transport Economics on the ATAC Road Group is also recommended.</PARA>
<PARA> Any decisions on implementing these recommendations would, therefore, need to be taken by ATAC. Before doing so State and Territory Governments would need to implement ACIR Recommendations No. 35 and 36. ATAC Ministers have noted these recommendations but, so far, have not implemented them.</PARA>
<PARA> ATAC is the main forum for consultation on transport policy matters for Commonwealth/State/Territory Governments. While Ministers responsible for roads policy originally met separately, and still do so from time to time, a conscious decision was taken in 1975 to meet as ATAC. After having met separately the current practice is still to report to ATAC-acknowledging the paramount role of this body on roads policy issues. The ACIR Report itself recognizes this.</PARA>
<PARA> The principal roads issue in which the Commonwealth becomes involved in ATAC is that of funding. I have urged my State and Territory counterparts in ATAC to consider the development of a global funding plan for roads which would involve a collective assessment of the total future road needs and funding requirements in Australia. My proposal is being considered.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to local government representation, initially as an observer on the ATAC Road Group, this would of course require the agreement of State and Territory Ministers. To date they have not considered it appropriate to provide for such representation. As to Recommendation 34, the BTE is represented on Road Group as an observer.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 37</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b). Current road studies being undertaken by the BTE will lead to a series of reports on issues relevant to future road funding decisions by Government. These reports will address, inter alia, the question of the physical condition and performance of Australian roads. The BTE is also working towards developing a better understanding of non-economic factors, particularly in respect of Local Roads, relevant to road expenditure decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to take account of assessments made by the BTE in its deliberations on road funding.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations 38 and 39</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b). The BTE has been established as a research body within the Department of Transport and Construction to assist the Commonwealth Government in the formulation of policy in all modes of transport. Its primary function is to advise the Commonwealth Government on the economic, technical, and financial aspects of transport in Australia. The BTE has a secondary function of providing assistance to State and local governments, Commonwealth and State instrumentalities and the private sector to identify and address transport problems.</PARA>
<PARA> While the BTE is formally reponsible to the Commonwealth Minister for Transport and Construction, the Bureau has and does respond to ATAC requests for advice which are addressed through the Commonwealth Minister. The Bureau is represented on ATAC Road Group as an observer.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 40</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b). The Australian Road Research Board is registered in Victoria as a company limited by guarantee. While the Commonwealth, along with the States and Northern Territory, is represented on the Board, the Commonwealth alone is unable to implement the ACIR's recommendation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) Equal employment opportunities are recognised as an important objective by my Department, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Personnel Officers attend Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) seminars and the publication 'Equal Employment Opportunity Selection Guidelines' is made available to all staff involved in recruitment and advancement procedures. The facilities of the Equal Employment Opportunities Bureau are availed of.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Treasury and the ABS do not have specific Equal Employment Opportunity programs, personnel practices are designed to preclude discrimination and are considered to provide equal employment opportunities in staff recruitment, advancement and work content. In addition, the ABS has an officer specifically nominated to liaise with the Public Service Board's Equal Employment Opportunity Bureau and to alert ABS Management to possible action needed to ensure equal employment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Taxation Office has had an Equal Employment Opportunities program for several years which has had a growing priority and has been developed as resources permitted. The aim of the program has been to ensure that all persons able to contribute to the work of the organisation have been given the same opportunities for appointment to, and promotion within, the Office. As well, with Aborigines and disabled persons, positive support is given to Public Service Board generated programs and requests to employ and, with women, there is a deliberate policy of non-discrimination in employment. Matters concerning EEO are canvassed, with other matters, at half-yearly meetings between management and Federal Officers of staff organisations represented in the ATO. It is assessed that the Office's program has had significant success; for example the number of women in the ATO, as a percentage of all staff, is significantly higher than in the Australian Public Service as a whole and the ATO is among the APS leaders in the employment of the disabled.</PARA>

<PARA> The estimated underspending reflects a reduction in the amount of work, principally contract work, which it is now estimated will actually be completed by 30 June 1982. Much of the preliminary planning work being undertaken can only be done in the 'dry' and there were delays in arranging for work to be done in the first part of the financial year 1981-82.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of the Department of the Treasury:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Public Service Board Memorandum 81/418 of 23 October, 1981 was circulated to all word processing supervisory staff on 30 October, 1981 and the need for sufficient breaks from operating visual display units is well recognised by supervisors and by operating staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) No prescribed time; however, approximately 70 to 75 percent of working time is estimated to be spent by word processing operators in the operation of visual display units.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) approximately 25 to 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) Word Processing Operators do not have a prescribed number of keystrokes to complete in a working day.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Statistical sampling averages show 37,500 keystrokes per operator per day and 19,000 keystrokes per steno-secretary per day. However, there would be large variances to these average figures.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Australian Taxation Office:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Taxation Office has for many years been aware of the need for data processing operators to have adequate breaks. An allowance of 1 hour 34 minutes is provided each day specifically for breaks.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) 71.4 per cent, i.e. 5 hours 15 minutes in 7 hours 21 minutes.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) 28.6 per cent, i.e. 2 hours 6 minutes incorporating collection and return of work and and rest breaks.</PARA>
<PARA> (NB) There are two types of equipment in use in the Taxation Office data entry areas. These are blind keysets for original entry of data and combined VDU/ keysets for verification of data. Operators rotate on a regular basis between these equipment types. The work content is quite different on each and has the effect of providing variety of duty, albeit in the same area, and a break from continuous keying duties.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) Data Processing operators are required to key a range of transaction types totalling around 300. No transaction type has a required keying rate of greater than 12,500 characters per hour although the majority of the major transactions are of the order of 11-12,000 characters per hour.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) A day's work is allocated to groups of data processing operators at the beginning of each day on the basis of the determined keystroke rates referred to in (i). Performance is measured by the group completing or not completing the day's work. Normally groups complete their day's work which means that, on average, operators achieve the determined keystroke rate.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Bureau of Statistics:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) In accordance with Public Service Board Memorandum 81/418 of 23 October, 1981, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has reviewed its procedures for staff operating screen based equipment and, in consultation with the relevant staff associations, developed a related policy. The policy provides for eye testing, rest breaks, accommodation and furniture standards and checks of radiation levels.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) and (ii) As the Australian Bureau of Statistics operates a diverse range of screen-based equipment and individual staff usage of such equipment varies from a few minutes each day to full time operation, it is not practicable to implement a standard procedure for staff to take rest breaks. However, in areas where staff operate screen based equipment full time (e.g. word processors ) the work is planned to allow for the operators to take a break of up to 30 minutes after each 2 hours of work.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) and (ii) The nature and usage of the equipment does not necessitate the recording of keystrokes required or achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Australian Industry Development Corporation:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to (c) The Corporation does not employ any fulltime operators of visual display units and screen-based equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) While the Corporation is not bound by the provisions of the Public Service Board Instructions generally (and hence specifically Memorandum 81/418), it is conscious of the need to ensure operators of visual display equipment are provided with a working system/environment designed to minimise general fatigue, eyestrain, etc. The Corporation, through its member banks and subsidiary companies, uses a considerable number of VDUs and screen-based equipment. In some locations (e.g. accounting areas), the equipment is operated full time whilst, at the other end of the scale (e.g. in the travel service), it is in only periodical use. The Corporation, under the auspices of the Chief Medical Officer and the Central Committee on Occupational Safety and Health, has monitored the results of research, both overseas and locally, into the possible detrimental effects of the use of VDUs and related equipment, and is conducting on-going studies in this area of office machinery usage.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) and (ii) Supervisory staff, as well as the operators, are aware of the benefits of breaks from operating screen-based and visual display equipment. Apart from morning and afternoon tea breaks, it is deliberate management policy to provide the full time operators with frequent short periods away from their keyboards, through an arrangement whereby the operators collect and deliver batches of work and assist with sorting.</PARA>
<PARA> The Corporation has no maximum fixed period which operators are expected to spend on keyboard duties. However, on average they would perform keyboard duties (with regular short-period breaks) for no more than approximately 80 per cent of their working day-say, six hours per day overall.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) and (ii) Keystroke rates vary widely due to the range of applications the operators perform. Supervisory staff monitor operations closely and constantly reassess output to ensure keystroke rates are maintained at a reasonable level. There is no specific keystroke requirement per average working day.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Reserve Bank of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Bank has prepared a set of guidelines which incorporate the recommendations of the Public Service Board Memorandum 81/418 with respect to work breaks for operators of VDU equipment, as well as other matters such as suitable furniture, light and work environment. Supervisors are instructed to ensure that the guidelines relating to work breaks are observed.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) and (ii) The practice varies. Few operators are employed full time as VDU operators and most perform other duties in addition to operating VDUs. All are subject to (a) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) and (ii) No formal target of keystrokes is set and statistics are not available.</PARA>

<PARA> Within my Department and the statutory authorities under my portfolio there are a large number of visual display units installed which are operated on a full time basis for data processing while others are used by staff on a part time or intermittent basis for inquiry or retrieval of information related to their work . Because the question of rest breaks refers particularly to full time operators I have confined my answer to that group which comprises data processing operators, word processing operators and photo-typesetters.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Public Service Board's memorandum referred to in the question has been promulgated throughout all areas of my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) Word processing operators are expected to spend most of their time on operating duties. Up to one hour per day is allowed for rest breaks which can be taken intermittently throughout the day by arrangement with the Supervisor.</PARA>
<PARA> Data processing operators spend between 4 1/2 and 6 1/2 hours on operating duties with rest breaks ranging between 30 minutes and 1 hour.</PARA>
<PARA> Photo-typesetters on day shift spend about 7 1/3 hours of their 8 hour shift keyboarding from hard copy. They have a morning tea break and a  1/2 hour lunch break. Night shift operators spend approximately 8 3/4 hours of their 10 hour shift on terminals (1 1/4 hours includes lunch, two tea breaks and personal time ).</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0N7">Mr Nixon</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The proposal referred to was a scheme of supplementary assistance to apple exporters, introduced in 1974 by the then Labor Government. Initially the scheme was to operate for 1974 only and was restricted to apples.</PARA>
<PARA> All States were given the opportunity to participate on the same basis in the scheme of assistance which was to be funded on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the Commonwealth and the States. In the event, New South Wales did not participate and South Australia did not participate after the 1975 season.</PARA>
<PARA> The scheme of assistance has been progressively extended to cover all subsequent seasons up to and including 1980. Pears were included from 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> Following an inquiry into the apple and pear industry by the Industries Assistance Commission in 1980, the Government introduced a package of measures designed to assist the industry over the period 1981 to 1985 while at the same time changing the basis on which assistance would be paid.</PARA>
<PARA> Included in this package were changes to the stabilisation scheme for apple and pear exports that had been in operation since 1971. Under the new arrangements, support for pears was terminated at the close of the 1980 export season while support for apples is being phased down over the 1981 to 1984 export seasons.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a new scheme of export underwriting was introduced in 1981 to operate for five years. This scheme is designed to protect the industry against sudden sharp falls in the export returns while at the same time ensuring that the industry is made aware of changes in the market place.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognised that these changes could cause some further adjustment pressures in the industry and accepts the IAC's recommendation that supplementary assistance be made more flexible and continued for the 1981 to 1984 export seasons. In line with this recommendation, the Commonwealth made available $3m for apples and $800,000 for pears under the supplementary assistance arrangements over the period 1981 to 1984, subject to the States contributing an equal amount.</PARA>
<PARA> The money was to be used to assist the industry to adjust to the new levels of Commonwealth support for exports through a program of agreed reconstruction and related research projects as well as to provide supplementary price support for apple exports if States so desired. However, if supplementary assistance were to be used for price support, limits were to be put on the amount of money made available for this use in each year so that it phased out in line with stabilisation. There was to be no further supplementary price assistance for pears.</PARA>
<PARA> Discussions have been held with relevant State departments and money has been made available for reconstruction/related research programs. Most of these programs are well under way and are expected to make a valuable contribution to future developments in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Discussions have been held between the Commonwealth and all participating States (that is, all States except New South Wales and South Australia) to ensure that money is spent in line with the objectives of the scheme.</PARA>

Is the Minister able to inform the House whether it is possible to tap into telex lines and send bogus messages? Is the Minister able to inform the House also whether it is possible to send telex messages using another subscriber's telex number? If not, would it be correct to say that the telexes in question sent with the telex numbers leased by NBN Channel 3 and Phillip Short Public Relations were sent by these organisations? The Sydney Morning Herald reported that I could be the sender, which I denied. Will the Minister make inquiries through his Department as to who did send these bogus telexes?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom Australia, is:</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Yes, but this could be done only by a person with a detailed technical knowledge of the operation of the telex system and the particular telex circuit involved.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr Carlton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In the early stages of the current health insurance arrangements, there were representations from community organisations and medical practitioners requesting that doctors continue to have the discretionary power to treat patients as disadvantaged. However, as the new arrangements have developed, there appears to be a general acceptance of the current system whereby Health Care cards are issued to identified groups.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) People on high incomes bear a larger burden of the cost of Government assistance in the health area than people on lower incomes. This is because the significant Government subsidies provided for health are financed through the taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA> Up to three million people-that is, in excess of 20 per cent of the population- are entitled to 'free' public hospital accommodation and treatment, and medical services paid by the Federal Government at 85 per cent of the Schedule fee with a maximum payment by the patient of $5 where the Schedule fee is charged. Where the doctor bulk bills there is no residual cost to the patient.</PARA>
<PARA> The income limits for people in special need are regarded as generous. For example, as from 1 May 1982, the cut-off point for a married couple ($172) is close to 57 per cent of average weekly earnings (December quarter 1981). This figure increases by $20 for each child, so that a married couple with three children receive $232 or 77 per cent of average weekly earnings and qualify for 'free' care. Health Care card holders are able to exceed their income limits by up to 25 per cent within a 4 week period before becoming ineligible for benefits .</PARA>
<PARA> People outside these limits are encouraged to take out heavily subsidised basic medical and hospital insurance cover whereby families experiencing much illness are further protected by the community rating principle under which healthy insured people subsidise the sick.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr Carlton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My colleague, the Minister for Social Security, has advised:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security, through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, can provide a wide range of aids and appliances to disabled people who are eligible under the Social Services Act and who are accepted for comprehensive rehabilitation treatment and training programs. An aid may be provided if it is an essential factor in the person's achieving his rehabilitation goal.</PARA>
<PARA> Aids which have been provided by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service include the Optacon and the braille shorthand machine. The Service has also sponsored switchboard modifications to assist blind people in obtaining a job. Talking computer terminals, word processors and bionic laser canes have not as yet been prescribed for persons referred to the Service for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> The provision through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service of new designs and concepts of aids for blind people is subject to evidence that the equipment is an effective advance over existing proven equipment. Expert evaluation is sought and notice taken of user opinion. In this regard comments by several blind people who have used the aid described at (e) express limited enthusiam for the electronic cane as an advance over the long cane and the separate electronic sensors currently available in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also considered that its high cost and lack of servicing facilities in Australia will limit its use for some time in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department is currently reviewing its total aids policy to ensure that its provision of aids and appliances is to the greatest benefit of those eligible for its services.</PARA>
<PARA> My colleague, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, has advised:</PARA>
<PARA> There are no limitations on the type or range of aids which may be provided to eligible Repatriation beneficiaries. An aid is issued where medical opinion establishes that it would contribute to the maintenance of the beneficiary's customary pattern of living with maximum independence, consistent with practical and economic considerations.</PARA>
<PARA> Each case is individually assessed and issue of the particular aids referred to by the honourable member would therefore depend on medical necessity, appropriateness to the beneficiary's requirements, and an assessment of all practical options to ensure that economic factors are considered in meeting the beneficiary's needs. The Department does not have material on the performance of the equipment referred to in the question, but it was established that, if the items would assist the veteran, and there were no more economic alternatives, they would be issued.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Health administers the Program of Aids for Disabled People ( PADP) under which certain aids to daily living may be provided to eligible persons. The range of aids available initially under PADP has been determined and does not include any of the aids referred to in the honourable member's question.</PARA>
<PARA> However, given the current economic climate, and the unwillingness of taxpayers to pay more tax, it is unlikely that PADP will be extended to include additional aids in the immediate future; nevertheless, the opportunity will be taken to review the aids available at an appropriate time.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) to (3) As the Minister having general responsibilities in relation to Government information services, I advise the honourable member that it is normal for Ministers to decide, as required for particular aspects of their responsibilities and/or as the need arises on particular occasions, the manner of any announcements of Government actions or initiatives whether or not they impact on particular electoral divisions or are of wider relevance.</PARA>
<PARA> For example, the honourable member will already be aware, from the answers given to her Question Nos 2810 and 3354, of a practice followed in the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA> Where an announcement is made by the Minister concerned in relation to a matter affecting an electoral division represented by a member of the Opposition it is, of course, the right of that representative-and, in any case, the right of Opposition senators and other representatives of the Opposition-to make whatever public comments they may wish on their perceptions of the merit or otherwise of the particular Government action or initiative and their views in likely effects on the livelihood of people within that division.</PARA>
<PARA> As a further example of particular practices I might add that it is my general practice to write to honourable members advising them of significant property transactions within, or adjacent to, their electorates and which may be of interest to them. Similar advice is normally sent to senators in respect of transactions in the towns or cities in which they reside.</PARA>

In addition, an amount of $ 100 million was included by my colleague the Minister for Finance in the Budget estimates (but not in the Appropriation Bill) to bring into account prospective additional costs in 1981-82, which could result from possible future increases in rates of pay after the estimates in the Bill were prepared.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The implementation of the decisions announced by the Prime Minister in his statement to the Parliament of 30 April 1981 has been and continues to be the responsibility of individual Ministers under the general oversight of the Review of Commonwealth Functions Committee of the Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA> (2)-(6) Details of decisions taken as a result of the Review were listed in the Prime Minister's statement, which also indicated those decisions involving the transfer or abolition of functions. As has been stated before, the Review was not primarily an exercise in cost cutting. The focus was on streamlining and fining down Commonwealth operations by withdrawing from areas more appropriately handled by the States and private enterprise, and rationalising a number of Commonwealth activities.</PARA>
<PARA> Financial and staff savings have been and will continue to be made as a result of the Review, both directly and also indirectly arising from those measures designed to contribute over time to efficiency of government. In answering questions asked in another place about the expenditure implications of the Review (see the reply to Senate Question Nos 1257-1282 in the Senate Hansard for 23 February 1982, pages 297-8) it was explained why precise figuring of the type sought on savings cannot be provided. The effects of Review decisions on Budget outlays are combined with those of other government decisions and with variations in other factors affecting expenditures. It is not practicable to separate out the financial effects of each of the many interacting influences on the financial estimates.</PARA>
<PARA> Similar considerations apply in respect of questions seeking to identify the staffing effects of Review decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I am bound to say to the honourable member that any attempt to provide a detailed reply to omnibus questions seeking information in respect of each of the decisions taken as a result of the Review would involve an unjustifiable commitment of resources.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (2) and (3) My Department and the statutory authorities within my jurisdiction are monitoring reported incidence of repetitious strain injury, and are awaiting the occupational health guide which is being prepared by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

<PARA> No comprehensive medical examinations are carried out within my portfolio. Staff are required to undertake a medical examination for permanent appointment and may be referred for medical examination where an illness or injury is such as to affect work performance and warrant possible redeployment or retirement on medical grounds. Staff reporting possible health problems associated with work are encouraged to seek medical attention and appropriate treatment. The relatively small number of diagnosed cases of tenosynovitis and carpal tunnel syndrome identified among staff within the portfolio has meant that any full- scale ergonomic assessment of work processes, tasks, and environments had not been considered justified on both economic and resource grounds.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (a) The Department of Transport and Construction, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, the Australian National Railways Commission and the Australian Shipping Commission encourage/arrange medical examinations for officers or employees who report symptoms of apparently job-related illness. Apart from these, there are no comprehensive medical examinations routinely conducted beyond those included in the appointment process.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) The Department of National Development and Energy issued to operators of screen based equipment a statement of Departmental policy based on Public Service Board Memorandum 81/418. Supervisors are aware of the need for such operators to have a sufficient break having regard to the nature of the task and the need for substantially different activities during the break. The latter would normally take the form of operating ancillary equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> Statutory Authorities within my jurisdiction involved in screen based equipment operations on a regular basis, have made operators aware of the need for sufficient breaks.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) and (ii) Due to the diverse nature of the operation undertaken using screen based equipment, the time that individual operators actually operate this equipment varies considerably. Word and data processing operators generally spend up to 80 per cent of the day operating the equipment. Computer systems officers and professional and technical staff make use of screen based equipment as their need demands. Their rate of usage would vary from day to day.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) and (ii) Because of the varied nature of the work being undertaken and of operational requirements, no keystrokes rate has been prescribed. The Department and Authorities do not monitor actual operator rates.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) 33,069.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) 24,653</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 8,416.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) These persons have been employed in a total of over 480 occupational categories. The major occupational categories were: retail sales, factory hand, tradesman's assistant, clerk, typist, office assistant, storeman, farm hand, machinist, driveway attendant, kitchen, checkout operator, packer, waiter, receptionist and assembler.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) At the end of March the number of young people in training was: (a) Standard SYETP-4,652 and (b) Extended SYETP-3,796.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) 54 per cent of all current SYETP trainees are female. The major occupations in which female trainees were employed are: retail sales, typist, office assistant, clerk, machinist, factory hand, checkout operator, receptionist, waitress and kitchen hand.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Recent surveys undertaken by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations indicate that the average period of subsidised training for Standard SYETP was 13.4 weeks and for Extended SYETP 22.6 weeks. This does not take account of those trainees who were retained beyond the subsidised training period.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) A training plan is agreed to by both employer and the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) at the beginning of the training period and incorporated in a training agreement which is signed by both parties and becomes the basis for subsidy payment. This agreement includes provision for the employer to notify the CES should he/she propose to alter the training plan. The CES is required to make two supervisory visits to the employer to ensure adherence to the training agreement. Where it is established that an employer has breached the training agreement, payment of subsidy may be suspended. Where the breach is not remedied, provision exists for the subsidy to be recovered.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) To the end of March 1982, expenditure on SYETP (including SYETP in Commonwealth Departments and Instrumentalities) was $42.92m.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The material at Derrimut was stored above ground in an isolated, locked, brick building and was packaged according to the nature of the radioactive materials. Radiation levels were reqularly monitored and access strictly controlled.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The containers for sealed radiography sources, other sealed sources and miscellaneous, contaminated components were, respectively, approved sealed metal cans, the appropriate service packs and plastic bags.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) At the time responsibility for the disposal of surplus Commonwealth property was vested in the then Department of Supply. The decision to store the material at Derrimut was taken in the light of the need to provide a safe isolated storage site pending a better long term storage arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The material was removed from Derrimut to St Marys in New South Wales in June 1979. The decision to do this was taken by the Controller Munitions Supply in the then Department of Productivity (under whom both establishments came) for reasons of consolidating holdings in one location. The health authorities of the two States involved (Victoria and New South Wales) were fully aware of this action.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The material is now stored at Munitions Filling Factory, St Marys, New South Wales in a secure area within the complex, in an isolated building which has thick reinforced concrete walls and roof with fire proof doors. The material is still in its original containers and the building is securely locked with access strictly controlled. Radiation levels outside the building, which are monitored regularly, are such that there is no danger to employees or local residents.</PARA>
<PARA> Proposals are being developed by the Department of National Development and Energy, in consultation with the States, for the co-ordinated management and disposal of radioactive wastes.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr Carlton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No investigation at the federal level is proposed into the claims concerning telodrin in the article 'After Spraying, a Shroud of Secrecy' or into the matters under investigation by the Victorian authorities and reported in the article 'State Study Being Planned'. Legislation relating to the registration, including availability and use, of pesticides is a State responsibility. The unforeseen problems associated with the use of telodrin were quickly identified by the Victorian authorities and the product was withdrawn from sale. The illnesses reported at the time among people were mild, transient and not wide- spread. The incident was reported in the Report of the Commission of Public Health, Victoria, for the year ended 30 June 1964 and was also referred to in the Report of the Commission for the year ended 30 June 1965.</PARA>
<PARA> The article 'State Study Being Planned' refers to the Federal Government's epidemiological studies into the health of Australian Vietnam veterans and their offspring. These studies are proceeding. The honourable member will be aware of the Inquiry being conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. This Inquiry will also be looking into the use of pesticides, particularly phenoxy chemicals and chemicals containing dioxin. The Committee is dealing first with the possible effects on Vietnam veterans of exposure to herbicides including 2, 4-D and 2, 4, 5-T which are phenoxyacetic acid derivatives.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Pesticide registration is a matter for the individual State authorities and the date of registration can vary between States. In all Australian States legislation introduced since 1945 requires that agricultural chemicals are registered prior to sale. I understand that telodrin was first registered in 1961.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) At the time of the incident my Department was not directly involved in the arrangements for registering pesticides, the States being responsible-as they still are-for these. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH and MRC) in 1952 and again in 1963 made recommendations to the States on setting tolerances for residues of pesticides in food for human consumption. Since 1969 the NH and MRC has become more closely associated with the registration of pesticides and agricultural chemicals through its representation on Technical Committees, convened by the Department of Primary Industry, which advise State authorities concerned with registration. My Department provides technical and secretarial staff to committees of the NH and MRC concerned with the evaluation of the health aspects of pesticides and agricultural chemicals prior to their registration and other related matters. It must be remembered that during the early 1960s the evaluation of pesticides prior to registration was less stringent than it is today because the co-ordinated approach to the assessment of toxicology, efficacy and safety, through the NH and MRC and the Australian Agricultural Council, was still being developed. Moreover, the science of toxicology was far less predictive of possible adverse health effects as compared to the present day situation when more extensive toxicological assessments are required for all new agricultural chemicals.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="203" SPEAKER="Newman The Hon K.E." NAMEID="WM7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="GRIFFITH">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been advised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) No. The above claim was made in a study by the Metal Trades Industry Association (MTIA) and uses as a base the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) estimates of assistance to agricultural industries included in its 1979-80 Annual Report. In its 1980-81 Annual Report the IAC updated these figures.</PARA>
<PARA> The revised figures included taxation concessions of $103m which were specifically excluded from its earlier figures. Further, assistance to non- metropolitan residents and consumers is not considered by the IAC to be assistance to agricultural industries but is included in the MTIA estimate of assistance to 'rural commercial producers'. This amounts to some $506m. Measures to aid non-metropolitan residents and consumers are of assistance to a range of activities in rural areas including manufacturing and service industries. The MTIA estimates also include as assistance a range of measures of which the purpose and incidence for agricultural industries is either incidental or highly debatable. Such measures include the exemption from sales tax of goods used by agricultural industries. However, with few exceptions such as certain four wheel drive motor vehicles and some motorcycles, comparable exemptions generally apply to goods used in manufacturing activities.</PARA>
<PARA> The remaining differences between IAC and MTIA figures arise because the MTIA equates the value of assistance to primary producers with the cost to the Budget in terms of revenue forgone. This leads to significant overestimation in several important cases. For example, revenue forgone resulting from the immediate deductibility for tax purposes of certain expenditures which would otherwise be depreciable does not represent the value of assistance, because the measure provides a deferral rather than an elimination of the tax liability. In this instance, the assistance derived takes the form of an interest-free loan arising from the deferral of tax payments.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commission's powers and functions are defined in the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973. Under Section 45 of the IAC Act the Commission is required to report annually on, among other matters, 'the assistance provided to industries by the Commonwealth Government and the effect of that assistance on the development of those industries'.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Most industrial activities receive some assistance in the form of tax concessions, subsidies, government supported research and development, and government regulations in the capital market and other areas. Details of the scope and coverage of the estimates of assistance afforded to both rural and manufacturing activities, which were published in the Commission's 1980-81 annual report, are provided in Appendices 1.2 and 1.3 of that report. The Commission has not, as yet, presented estimates for activities in the mining and services sectors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1631) Mr Adermann asked me the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister for Primary Industry conversant with the severe concern of the pineapple industry about pineapple products being imported into Australia under conditions which often closely approximate dumping? Has an agreement for processing of pineapple products involving China and the IXL company been contemplated or concluded? If so, what is the nature of that agreement? Will the product be marketed in Australia? What effect, if any, will that have on the domestic pineapple industry in Australia or on Australian markets?</PARA>
<PARA> Further to my comments of 21 April 1982 I have now further details of the agreement between Henry Jones (IXL) and the Government of China. Those details are:</PARA>
<PARA> A joint venture agreement for growing, processing and marketing pineapples was concluded in September last year between Henry Jones (IXL) Ltd of Melbourne and the Nanning Agricultural, Industrial and Commercial Complex of Nanning City, China.</PARA>
<PARA> The agreement was made possible through a Protocol to the Australia-China Trade Agreement on Commercial and Industrial Co-operation. The agreement is initially for 20 years with provision for extensions of 10 year periods. The joint venture company is known as Nanning Jones Co. Ltd and has registered capital of US$460,000. The objective of Nanning Jones is to initially establish pineapple plantations on an 3,300 hectare agricultural farm, and then at a later stage assess the feasibility of establishing a canning factory. This feasibility study will be completed in the fifth year.</PARA>
<PARA> Henry Jones (IXL) expects that ninety per cent of the fresh and canned pineapples produced will be sold to the Chinese domestic market, Europe, North America and Japan. However, firm marketing strategies have yet to be established.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian industry's concern about the level of imports of canned pineapple into Australia, is currently under consideration by the Industries Assistance Commission which is due to report by 31 August 1982. The Commission found no evidence to justify a case for interim assistance to the pineapple industry for the 1982 season.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Minister for Communications aware of anomalies that have arisen following the recent introduction by Australia Post of new parcel rates, in particular the large increase in the charges for residents of Eyre Peninsula who are faced with an increase of 125 per cent in the charge for a parcel of up to two kilograms forwarded to Adelaide; that is, an increase from $1.60 to $3. 60? Is he aware also that if the same parcel is sent to Mount Gambier, a further 350 kilometres, the charge is only $2? Will the Minister take steps to have these anomalies examined and rectified?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Postal Commission, is:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes. Australia Post advises that it is aware of the anomalous nature of the increase in parcel charges for the Eyre Peninsula area of South Australia. A revised proposal for charges in that area is to be considered by the Australian Postal Commission shortly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Subject to the comments outlined below regarding workers' compensation legislation, I am not aware of any Commonwealth or State legislation which contains provisions requiring companies to insure against liability for radiation damage resulting from accidents in the uranium industry or in the transport of radioactive materials. In the case of workers' compensation legislation, inquiries by my officers indicate that, even if not specifically mentioned in the relevant enactments, radiation damage is normally covered by the provisions of that legislation and that workers' compensation cover in the nuclear industry is identical to that available to other workers. These inquiries also indicate that insurers do underwrite nuclear risks associated with normal commercial operations (such as the use of radioactive isotopes and the handling and transport of yellow cake).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Whether the Commonwealth or any State Government would be liable to meet the costs resulting from nuclear damage would depend on the facts of each particular case. Any liability of Government would depend on principles which would apply equally to private persons or corporations. Where Commonwealth or State Governments use radioactive materials, or are directly responsible for their use, they could be liable for any consequent damage under general principles of liability.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In the absence of any legislative provision (apart from workers' compensation legislation), the question of liability and compensation for nuclear damage is governed by common law. The adequacy of the financial protection thus afforded to persons who sustain radiation damage is at present under consideration as a result of Commonwealth action. Pursuant to a Commonwealth initiative, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is currently considering the state of the law relating to liability and compensation for nuclear damage. The Standing Committee has not yet reached a decision thereon. In addition, a Commonwealth Interdepartmental Committee ( chaired by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet) is undertaking a review of the Atomic Energy Act and related matters in accordance with arrangements announced by the Government in June 1981. That review has not yet been completed. It is intended that the results of the Standing Committee's deliberations will be taken into account in the review being undertaken by the Interdepartmental Committee.</PARA>

<PARA> The 1977 review did, as the honourable member suggests, identify certain questions concerning the application of Convention No. 65 to Australia. However, the existence of obligations which might be applicable to Australia under the Convention depends on there being a 'dependent indigenous population' in Australia within the meaning of that term as used in the Convention. A more recent review by the then Department of Industrial Relations has shown that there is agreement in both the State and Commonwealth jurisdiction that while Aboriginals are 'indigenous' they do not as a group constitute a 'dependent indigenous population' within the meaning of the Convention as opined by the appropriate supervisory body within the International Labour Organisation. Given the above, the question of penal sanctions in Australia does not arise.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to comments by Mr G. M. Niall of the National Mutual Life Association, reported in the Australian Financial Review of 24 February 1982, to the effect that the ease with which fire and general insurance premiums can be exported from Australia to purchase insurance and reinsurance in overseas markets is one factor contributing to unsatisfactory conditions in the general insurance industry; if so, is there any substance in this claim.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is it a fact, as claimed by Mr Niall, that the official figures of premiums flowing overseas to non-resident companies fail to capture the true magnitude of these outflows.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Are there any deficiencies in the statistics available on the role of Australia's general insurance industry in our balance of payments account.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Can he say whether large overseas countries are increasingly addressing themselves to the gathering of such information.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Can he also say whether European Economic Community markets, of which the United Kingdom is a member, do not allow the free flow of direct-writing premiums for certain classes of business across international borders but that, as there is discussion of this under EEC directives, a procedure is being drafted for the collection of such statistics should any flows be considered; if so, will this mean that the United Kingdom will have to observe the EECs requirements, whereas it enjoys complete freedom in respect of the Australian market.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Can he state whether the increasing role of off-shore based tax havens is making the collection of insurance statistics even more complicated with the recent creation of the Isle of Man tax haven by the United Kingdom in November 1981, reportedly designed to serve the European areas.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Does the Government accept Mr Niall's conclusion that there is a case for an official review of the current and prospective levels of premium outflow so that its implications, for the economy and for Australian insurers, may be fully assessed; if so, what action will he take and when; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) It is a fact that sub-section 113 (4) of the Insurance Act 1973, which provides for collection of statistics showing the volume of insurance premiums which are sent directly out of the country, has not been proclaimed by the Government, if so, when will it be proclaimed, and what is the reason for it not having been proclaimed.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) I am aware of the Press article mentioned by the honourable member. It is true that purchasers of insurance and reinsurance have available to them the choice to purchase their cover from the local or overseas markets. The Government does not believe it should deny purchasers of insurance access to the overseas insurance markets if they so wish. It is, of course, particularly relevant that the spreading of risks through reinsurance is an inherent part of a sound insurance operation and that Australian insurers could be adversely affected if they were denied ready access to the reinsurance facilities available from the overseas markets.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) No. The information currently available to me is not sufficiently detailed or authoritative to enable me to make a statement of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) I am aware that some countries place restrictions on the levels of insurance premiums that may flow outside their borders. However, I am not in a position to provide information on the implications with regard to premium flows of possible future measures that might be taken by the United Kingdom and other member countries of the European Economic Community.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I am not aware of any additional complications that have arisen in Australia with regard to existing collections of insurance statistics by the Commonwealth that could be directly attributed to the role of offshore tax havens such as that in the Isle of Man.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) See (1) and (2) above. I should add that as a result of work carried out by officials in accordance with decisions taken by the Government in the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, certain statistical collections in the general insurance area are being reviewed with a view to exploring the possibility of savings in this area and rationalisation as between collections of the Office of the Insurance Commissioner and those of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The review will take into consideration the provisions of sub- section 113 (4).</PARA>
<PARA> (8) I refer the honourable member to part (8) of my answer to his Question No. 415 of 24 February 1981 (Hansard of 5 June 1981, page 3308). See also (7) above.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr Carlton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There are three categories of registered nursing homes, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> Non-government nursing homes approved under the National Health Act for purposes of receipt of Commonwealth nursing home benefits for approved patients. These homes are conducted by private enterprises and by benevolent organisations . Such homes are known as 'participating' nursing homes;</PARA>
<PARA> State Government nursing homes approved under the National Health Act for purposes of receipt of Commonwealth nursing home benefits for patients accommodated;</PARA>
<PARA> Nursing homes which are approved under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act for purposes of deficit funding by the Federal Government. These homes are conducted by charitable and benevolent organisations, or local government bodies.</PARA>
<PARA> The numbers of registered nursing homes in the electoral Division of Sydney in each year since 1979 are:</PARA>
<PARA>1979-80 1980-81 Currently</PARA>
<PARA>Participating nursing homes  6 6 6 State Government nursing homes  . . . . 1 Deficit financed nursing homes  5 6 7</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The information requested is contained in Table A below. In relation to 2 ( c) the fees charged in deficit financed nursing homes are prescribed in the Regulations to the Nursing Homes Assistance Act and are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Insured</PARA>
<PARA>Patients</PARA>
<PARA>(to 1.9.81)</PARA>
<PARA>Workers'</PARA>
<PARA>Compensation</PARA>
<PARA>and Third</PARA>
<PARA>Prescribed Party</PARA>
<PARA>Fee Patients</PARA>
<PARA>$ a week $ a week As at 1.7.79  50.90 146.45 From 8.11.79  54.95 162.05 From 8.5 .80  57.75 164.85 From 6.11.80  60.20 186.90 From 7.5.81  62.65 189.35 From 5.11 .81  65.10 226.10 From 11.2.82  67.90 228.90 From 6.5.82  71.75 232.75</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of deficit financed nursing homes the raising of a fee (equivalent to Commonwealth benefits) for insured patients above the prescribed fee ceased as from 1 September 1981, as the Federal Government assumed responsibility for those payments from that time.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) The names and occupations of persons owning and operating participating nursing homes are not known except to the extent of the names of the proprietors which in many cases are private companies. Generally only the person acting as director of the company is known and not shareholders. Similarly only the name of the administrator or secretary of a deficit financed nursing home in required by the Department. The information available is set out in Table A below.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Department is not in a position to assess accurately profit levels in view of the cost based nature of the fees control scheme and Departmental cost figures that are available could be considered by proprietors to be commercially confidential.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of deficit financed nursing homes, approved operating costs, less income from patients, are met by the Federal Government. In theory each home operates on a break-even basis as far as profits are concerned. However deficit financed nursing homes may acquire additional funds by way of donations in traditional fund raising activities which are not regarded as income for the purposes of the deficit financing arrangements. The question of profit levels for State Government nursing homes is a matter for the State Governments. The Federal Government's role in this area is limited to the payment of nursing home benefits.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Part IV of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 applies the principles embodied in the Warsaw Convention to domestic aviation and non convention traffic and sets liability limits at $45,000 for death or injury to passengers, $300 for loss or damage to registered baggage and $30 for loss or damage to unregistered baggage.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Amendments to the passenger limits were in the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Act 1976 and the baggage limits in the Civil Aviation ( Carriers' Liability) Amendment Act 1970.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (5) On 24 March 1982 Mr Hunt introduced into the House of Representatives legislation aimed at increasing the domestic and non convention limits of liability prescribed under Part IV of the Act to $100,000 for death or injury to passengers, $900 for loss or damage to registered baggage and $90 for loss or damage to unregistered baggage.</PARA>

<PARA> France-Franc 500,000 (approx. $A72,000) Legislation was proclaimed on 6 May 1982 increasing limit from Franc 300,000 (approx. $A43,000). The carrier is presumed responsible up to this limit, but beyond it fault or negligence must be proven.</PARA>
<PARA> United States of America-No federal legislation effecting a domestic interstate liability regime exists within the United States of America. I understand certain States have imposed limitations in the case of death, not injury, and amounts differ from State to State.</PARA>
<PARA> Canada-There is no legislated upper limit on domestic passenger liability. However, there is normally a contractual limit established by the carrier.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd (VCD) is not a Naval Dockyard but rather a commercial undertaking operating on Commonwealth owned premises, in accordance with a Trading Agreement and the Lease between the Commonwealth and the Company. In general terms, the arrangements provide for the Commonwealth to meet overhead costs, irrespective of whether they were incurred during abnormal periods ( strikes, industrial action) or not. However, to the extent that the Company is able to obtain and carry out commercial work the Commonwealth's share of these overhead costs is reduced.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Where other commercial establishments undertake work for my Department on a cost plus profit basis and the 'Standard Conditions for the determination of Costs of Contract issued by the Department of Administrative Services', apply then the Commonwealth would be liable for similar payments.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The variation in submarine refit expenditure of $3,203,000, indicated in the Additional Estimates for 1981-82 reflects slippages in the refit programs of HMA Submarines Orion and Onslow due largely to industrial disputes.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr Sinclair</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Original planning had been to undertake HMAS Supply's 1981 refit in two parts: the first by contract; and the second by Garden Island Naval Dockyard. This arrangement was made in order to accommodate the ship's operational commitments. The first part was achieved as planned at the State Dockyard Newcastle between 5 January 1981 and 1 April 1981. Subsequently, it was thought that Garden Island Dockyard would not have sufficient capacity for its part of the refit, and accordingly provision (totalling $3m) was made in the 1981-82 budget for the remaining element of the work to be carried out by contract.</PARA>
<PARA> In the event, however, Garden Island Dockyard did have capacity and work began there as originally intended on 7 September, 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> The costs of contract work would have been chargeable to Appropriation Division 235 and would have included not only direct labour costs, but also costs attributable to materials and overheads, together with a margin for profit. In the case of Departmental dockyards, only the direct labour costs are chargeable to Division 235, other related costs being chargeable to the relevant Appropriation Items.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Although budgetary provision had been made, the stage was never reached where the work was allocated to a particular facility and an order placed. Consequently, the question of compensation or other offsetting payment does not arise.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (a) Medical examination have been made of certain workers, additional to those associated with appointment processes. Medical examinations are encouraged and arranged when officers or employees report symptoms of apparently job- related illnesses. The Australian Taxation Office arranged for all available data processing operators in one office to be examined by doctors to determine the incidence and possible cause of repetition strain injury. The findings in that office were used as the basis of a number of national recommendations for all identical data processing officers.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Department of the Treasury-Treasury conducted ergonomic assessments of its Automatic Typing Pool (Forerunner to word processing) in 1972 when advanced automatic typewriters were being installed. Each operator was interviewed by a Senior Medical Officer of the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, University of Sydney. Treasury's Word Processing Centres are currently being re- accomodated and close attention is being given to ergonomic and environmental considerations, including light control, glare and reflection control, acoustic levels as well as to provide a visually pleasant working environment.</PARA>
<PARA> No ergonomic assessments have been carried out in the Royal Australian Mint as a direct consequence of repetitious injuries, as no such injuries have been reported.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Taxation Office-The Taxation Office has carried out ergonomic assessments of the work environment and furniture in all its major offices.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Bureau of Statistics-The Bureau of Statistics carried out ergonomic assessments of the work process, tasks and work environment in its Sydney and Melbourne Offices and, following a recent increase in the number of occurrences of repetitious injuries in Central Office, an ergonomic study has commenced.</PARA>
<PARA>Reserve Bank of Australia-The Reserve Bank of Australia has also undertaken ergonomic assessments of areas where repetitious injuries have occurred or are thought may occur.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC)-Ergonomic assessments have not been carried out in the AIDC because no cases of repetitious injuries have been reported.</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Banking Corporation-The Commonwealth Banking Corporation has not carried out formal ergonomic assessments although staff members claiming work related injuries are medically examined and restrictions placed on their employment are strictly observed.</PARA>
<PARA>(2) (a) Department of the Treasury-Following the review of general problems relating to keyboard operations in 1972, continual assessment of keyboard working conditions is undertaken by an officer familiar with ergonomic principles. Suggested improvements are implemented.</PARA>

<PARA>Reserve Bank of Australia-As part of the Reserve Bank's occupational health and safety programme, on-going assessments of work areas have been undertaken continuously for at least 5-6 years.</PARA>
<PARA>(b) Department of the Treasury-Following assessment, new ergonomic desks were designed for the equipment; they have recently been replaced by more suitable desks. Ergonomic chairs were also purchased but their early design features dictated a short life expectancy. New ergonomic chairs are proposed for purchase in 1982-83.</PARA>
<PARA>Document holders have been used in the past and all WP staff will be provided with them in future. Operational procedures and training will incorporate familiarisation with basic ergonomic principles for example, posture, document holders, and the need for non-screen based tasks to be intermingled with screen based tasks.</PARA>
<PARA>Australian Taxation Office-In general terms, and not necessarily applying to all offices, the following matters were highlighted for consideration and improvement without any precise recommendations being advised; provide fully adjustable chairs; brighten up visual environment; provide adjustable tables; modify lighting levels as necessary to accord with Australian standard; eliminate glare from windows; eliminate reflections from overhead luminaires; test document holders.</PARA>
<PARA>Bureau of Statistics-Sydney-Regular change of posture and movement patterns, training in correct posture; More variety in the work; Adequate staff numbers to cope with peaks in workload, even in less busy times staff are under-utilised; More independence for the individual to organise own work patterns and to have social contact with fellow officers; Better chairs which conform to ergonomic criteria, and training in their use; Provision of appropriate holders for the display of source documents and some further investigation into the suitability of the keyboard design.</PARA>
<PARA>Bureau of Statistics-Melbourne-Proper use of adjustable seating, wrist supports and copy holders; Advice to be sought from the Australian Taxation Office on keyboard workstation design; and use of a consultant to plan ergonomically designed workstation layout for keyboard operation when move to new premises in 1983.</PARA>
<PARA>Reserve Bank of Australia-Change of equipment for counting notes and coin. Change of work routines in clearing and in cafeteria areas. Work breaks for operators of VDU equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>(3) Department of the Treasury-Yes; see answer to 2(b).</PARA>

<PARA>Bureau of Statistics-Most of the recommendations have been, or are in the process of being, implemented in the offices concerned. While it is inappropriate to maintain staff numbers at a level to cope with seasonal peak workloads, this situation is kept under review and data entry work is moved between States to avoid overloading of staff.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) My department has a statement of policy on eye testing for operators of screen based equipment. The statement was developed following talks with appropriate staff organisations and addresses the need for operators to have regular rest breaks. I will forward a copy of this statement to the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA> My department is also developing an educational package for screen based equipment operators. This package will cover repetition injury and the need for rest breaks, and consider ergonomic aspects of the work place and general safety precautions.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) and (ii) Operators of screen based equipment in the Department are generally engaged solely for that purpose. However, ADP personnel and other clerical staff may operate screen based equipment from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA> In situations where the work-load does not require an operator's full-time attention, and this will vary from office to office and from time to time, the operator performs other clerical duties.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) and (ii) The only category of staff in the Department to which key stroke rates are applied is Data Processing Operator. Most operators are employed in Regional Offices and a recent review of these positions recommended that operators should be expected to achieve 40,000 key strokes per day. However , in reality it is unlikely that all operators would reach this level because of such problems as:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) inexperience of the operator;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) staff absences;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the machine being off line for part of the day; and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My Department has developed a proposal to allow the safe importation of fertile avian hatching eggs. A high security egg hatching facility is presently planned for construction on the Torrens Island Animal Quarantine Station.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) $490,000 has been provided for construction of the facility.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Draft conditions of importation for commercial hen eggs have been developed by an expert working party and these are currently under discussion with appropriate Government and industry organisations. A detailed functional brief for the design of a microbiologically secure egg hatching facility has also been developed in consultation with officers of the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory and designs completed by officers from the Department of Transport and Construction. The combination of the conditions of importation and the secure facility would provide the technology not previously available to ensure the degree of quarantine security required to allow safe importation.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) It is intended that facilities will be available on an equitable basis to interested parties. It is envisaged that each application to import hen eggs will be considered on its merits. As indicated above, the quarantine conditions have not yet been finalised. In summary, however, provision will be made for selection of fertile eggs from countries and flocks of approved disease status; several series of tests and fumigation procedures in the flocks of origin; secure transport procedures; hatching and rearing in the high security facility, and a further series of tests while in quarantine. The importation of live birds is not envisaged.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) 48,674 new first year apprentices were the subject of CRAFT claims for the first time in the period 1 July 1981 to 31 March 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) During 1981-82, 30,031 apprentices attracted the CRAFT technical education rebate to end March 1982. A further 18,643 apprentices attracted other components of the CRAFT claim as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> CRAFT $1000 rebate scheme-9,480 apprentices</PARA>
<PARA> CRAFT off-the-job training rebate-6,386 apprentices</PARA>
<PARA> CRAFT living away from home allowances-2,777 apprentices.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The reason for this is that the various components of CRAFT are to meet different purposes-</PARA>
<PARA> technical education rebate (TER) is designed to compensate employers for the costs of releasing apprentices to attend basic trade courses in technical colleges</PARA>
<PARA> the off-the-job training rebate (OTJR) supports special skills training in off- the-job training centres in the first year of apprenticeship, thereby making apprentices more productive earlier</PARA>
<PARA> the $1000 rebate (now terminated) provided an additional incentive to employers to increase apprentice intakes</PARA>
<PARA> the living away from home allowance (LAFHA) assists apprentices to meet the costs of board and lodging when they are required to live away from home to undertake an apprenticeship.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to separate out data on apprentices who have attracted more than one component of CRAFT.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The number of apprentices attracting CRAFT TER is the best indicator of the numbers being assisted. In the financial year to 31 March 1982 some 72,329 apprentices had generated such payments.</PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of apprentices generating TER between 1 July 1981 and 31 March 1982 by trade group were:</PARA>
<PARA> Metal  41.5 per cent  Electrical  15.5 per cent  Building  19.4 per cent Printing  2.7 per cent  Vehicle  3.9 per cent  Food  4.1 per cent  Other  12.9 per cent</PARA>
<PARA> (5) By 30 April 1982 some $69.2m had been expended under the CRAFT program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Management of spent fuel elements from HIFAR includes the review of holdings and arrangements for their disposition, security, safeguards, health and safety aspects, as well as the actual handling of fuel elements. Spent fuel elements are stored for two weeks in the HIFAR storage block, then transferred to the pond in the active handling bay for 12 months to allow radiation levels to decrease. The inactive sections are then cropped from the fuel elements, and the elements are transferred to the HIFAR spent fuel element storage facility.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In 1963, spent fuel elements were reprocessed by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) Products of reprocessing and wastes arising from spent fuel elements referred to in (2) became the responsibility of the UKAEA. Spent fuel elements at Lucas Heights are stored in a spent fuel element storage facility which is subject to IAEA and Australian Safeguards Office surveillance and inspections. The approximate volume (contained uranium aluminium alloy) of spent fuel elements reprocessed by the UKAEA or currently in storage at Lucas Heights is 1.4 cubic metres.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) In the 12 months ending 31 March 1982, there were 186 appeals in which the Social Security Appeals Tribunals recommended the appeal be upheld but that recommendation was rejected by the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Of the 186 appeals referred to in (3), in 45 cases an appeal was lodged with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as at 31 March 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Since the Administrative Appeals Tribunal assumed jurisdiction in Social Security matters from 1 April 1980, there have been, as at 1 May 1982, 87 decisions of that Tribunal which were concerned with a review on the merits of the case. That is, the statistic excludes cases considered solely on points of jurisdiction. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has wholly or partly set aside the decision of the Department of Social Security in 56 per cent of those cases.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Social Security Appeals Tribunals are comprised of legal, medical and welfare members (who are not officers of the Department) as well as an officer who is seconded from and independent of the Department of Social Security. These officers are full-time members in all States except Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory where the volume of work does not justify full time membership. There is a total of 80 Tribunal members throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The current levels of remuneration for members of the Tribunals other than full time members are set out below.</PARA>
<PARA> Actual amounts paid to individual members depend upon how often they have sat on Tribunal hearings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In its policy statement of 30 September 1980 the Government announced an ' expansion of the Family Support Services Scheme ($10m over three years)'.</PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with this commitment, the Government will provide the $10m over the period 1 January 1982 to 31 December 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Family Support Services Scheme was introduced as a national three-year pilot program in January 1978, with total funding of $8.73m allocated for the period. The Scheme commenced in Victoria, with projects being approved progressively in other States and Territories. Because of the varying commencement dates, some projects were not due to complete the third year of funding until late 1981/early 1982. Victoria received an additional $0.867m in 1981 for a fourth year of funding under the pilot Scheme, as for the most part Victorian projects were due to terminate twelve months before those in other States. Similar but shorter bridging periods were approved in some States. The commencement of the extended Scheme from 1 January 1982 subsumed some late- terminating projects.</PARA>
<PARA> Because the Scheme is administered by the State and Northern Territory Governments, with a system of quarterly advances based on reports of actual and estimated expenditure, the amounts paid out by the Commonwealth each financial year do not relate to the funds received by approved projects in that year. Only in the Australian Capital Territory are payments made direct by the Commonwealth to approved organisations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The percentages shown were derived from the various organisations' annual reports.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) I am advised that the major reason for variations between the State ratios of management expenses for Medibank Private was the differing economies of scale that applied in respect of each State. The general position was that fixed costs incurred in the smaller States were, in relation to income, proportionately greater than in the larger States.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The management expense ratios of Medibank Private were higher than those of the other major funds for a number of reasons. The Health Insurance Commission had a legacy of excess staff from the abolition of Medibank Standard. (The Commission was required to the greatest extent possible to use the same staff for the operations of both Medibank Standard and Medibank Private.) Substantial reductions in staff have since taken place. Also, the Commission's salary rates are based on those of the Australian Public Service and, for the bulk of its employees, are generally higher than the rest of the health insurance industry. There are, in addition, associated higher costs such as the cost of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. Other factors that contributed to Medibank Private's relatively high management expense ratios were of a transitional nature (e.g. a redeveloped computer system more suitable for Medibank Private than Medibank Standard and the opening of branch offices).</PARA>

<PARA> (1) In June 1947 eight files relating to chemical warfare experiments during World War II were transferred along with a large quantity of other records from the 4th Military District Headquarters in South Australia, to the custody of the Australian War Memorial repository in Melbourne. The Australian War Memorial has advised that the eight files were further transferred to the Archives Division of the Commonwealth National Library (now the Australian Archives) in 1952. The Australian Archives has carried out an extensive search for the files and it now appears that they were among a large group of files from the Department of Army in South Australia destroyed in 1959.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr Street</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of a number of press reports in November 1981 concerning a report on International Atomic Energy Agency (I.A.E.A.) safeguards prepared before ceasing duty in July 1981 as an employee of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission by Mr Emanual R. Morgan, a former I.A.E.A. inspector. Some of the press have quoted Mr Morgan as reporting that the I.A.E.A. is 'incapable of detecting the diversion of a significant quantity (of nuclear material) in any state with a moderate to large nuclear establishment.' However, as quoted by the publication 'Nuclear Fuel', Mr Morgan reported it was his personal conclusion that '. . . the Agency is incapable of detecting the diversion of a significant quantity or of several significant quantities, by partitioning, in any state with a moderate to large nuclear energy establishment'. The term ' partitioning' is explained in answer to 2 (b) below.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The publication 'Nuclear Fuel' of 23 November 1981 contains an extensive description of and quotations from Mr Morgan's report.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The I.A.E.A. has prepared a paper containing information and clarifications with respect to the major points raised by Mr Morgan's report as published in ' Nuclear Fuel'. The paper has been made available by the I.A.E.A. to interested persons, including to the media.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to Mr Morgan's conclusion referred to in part (1) above, the I.A.E. A. has made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Mr Morgan discusses a hypothetical diversion scenario-while using language appropriate to a factual statement-where a State having many nuclear installations would divert from each facility a small quantity of nuclear material so small that it might escape detection (partitioning). Such a strategy would involve different types and classes of material, a concerted effort by a large number of nuclear installations, operators and their staff and therefore an unattractive high-risk strategy. The detection goals used by the I.A.E.A. have to be realistic and credible and have to take account of the technical capabilities of the available verification measures. In designing safeguards approaches for individual facilities the I.A.E.A. uses significant quantities as guidelines for setting inspection goals. The existence of other facilities is taken into account in considering the diversion possibilities of individual facilities. Technical studies have however shown that the I.A.E.A.'s capability to detect ''diversion by partitioning'' is not significantly affected by using these quantities on a facility basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The basis for the statement by Mr Morgan seem to be unavoidable uncertainties of measurements leading to inventory differences-material unaccounted for (MUF)- in material balance areas in bulk handling plants; but it would be wrong to conclude that this would provide an easy possibility for diversion of nuclear material in quantities within uncertainties of MUF'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) See response to Question No. 4294.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The author of the report, Mr E. Morgan, has been quoted as stating that ' the I.A.E.A. does not teach languages to inspectors and does not assist inspectors to learn the language of the country which he inspects. . . . Often the inspector cannot communicate with the party being inspected'.</PARA>
<PARA> The I.A.E.A. has stated that it runs intensive language classes for its inspectors in seven languages, including its four working languages of English, French, Spanish and Russian. Plant operating records and reports to the I.A.E.A. follow a prescribed format or content and are kept in one of the I.A.E.A.'s working languages. The I.A.E.A. has stated that language problems have not seriously hampered safeguards implementation.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) (i) and (ii) Mr Morgan has been quoted as stating that 'the Agency does not attempt to find undeclared fuel'; that one waste handling facility in the F.R.G. is 'not subject to I.A.E.A. safeguards'; and that an 'operator and state had refused to permit the Agency to apply timely detection continuous inspection' at a certain facility. The type of facility is not specified.</PARA>
<PARA> Safeguards agreements between the I.A.E.A. and a member state are premised on the declaration by the state of all nuclear material required to be subject to safeguards. The Agency has no right of search for undeclared nuclear material, but it is entitled to seek information regarding nuclear material subject to safeguards. The Agency's safeguards approaches assume the possibility of undeclared facilities and nuclear material.</PARA>
<PARA> The I.A.E.A. has stated that it is 'not aware of the (timely detection) situation referred to, that safeguards agreements provide for the I.A.E.A.'s legal right to apply continuous inspection in plants of a certain type with high inventory throughput, and this right is being exercised.'</PARA>
<PARA> (d) According to 'Nuclear Fuel', Mr Morgan said that 'in a country such as F.R. G. all waste is transferred to a central waste handling facility which is not subject to I.A.E.A. safeguards'.</PARA>
<PARA> The I.A.E.A. has stated that the nuclear waste involved (measured discards) contains 'nuclear material in minute quantities, the recovery of which is quite impracticable. In view of the quantities involved and the technical effort required to recuperate such material this is regarded as an implausible diversion scenario. However, the problem is being addressed'.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) According to 'Nuclear Fuel', Mr Morgan stated that 'in one facility, there was no record kept of the final disposition of plutonium samples. Such samples were said to be returned to the process . . . . the Agency simply does not concern itself with material control at that level of detail'.</PARA>
<PARA> In reply, the I.A.E.A. has stated that the minimum information to be available from a country's records is prescribed by that country's safeguards agreement(s) with the I.A.E.A. and adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Mr Morgan has been quoted as saying: 'The Agency also uses paper seals. According to expert authority . . . they can be duplicated by a good printer'.</PARA>
<PARA> The IAEA has stated that 'seals placed on nuclear material are not easily counterfeited or duplicated. A special ''fingerprinting'' system and periodical change of seals for subsequent detailed investigation make IAEA seals highly tamper resistant. Paper seals are used by the IAEA as well as in domestic safeguards systems as a stress indicating device. They are used only for a short period of time or under special conditions of low safeguards relevance.'</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) All non-nuclear weapon states parties to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) are obliged to place their entire civil nuclear industries under IAEA safeguards. Nuclear weapon states parties to the Treaty are not obliged to place any of their nuclear activities under IAEA safeguards. However, the United Kingdom and the United States have both concluded voluntary offer safeguards agreements to cover their civil nuclear activities and the USSR has offered recently to accept IAEA safeguards on selected non-military facilities. France, a nuclear weapon state not a party to the Treaty, but which has declared its intention to act as if it were a party, has also concluded a voluntary offer safeguards agreement. The majority of non- nuclear weapon states not party to the NPT have accepted IAEA safeguards on all their existing civil nuclear facilities. A minority of such states have not accepted safeguards over certain sensitive facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The agreed safeguards approach for a particular facility is that IAEA inspectors have routine access to specified points of the facility. These specified points are detailed in the subsidiary arrangements to IAEA safeguards agreements. The subsidiary arrangements are confidential to the parties to the agreements. Safeguards agreements also provide for ad hoc inspections for specified purposes and for special inspections in cases of suspected loss, breach of containment or inadequacy of information. Such inspections may involve access to information or locations in addition to the points specified for routine inspections.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The objective of IAEA safeguards applied pursuant to the NPT is the timely detection of diversion of significant quantities of safeguarded nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities to the manufacture of nuclear weapons or of other nuclear explosive devices or for purposes unknown, and deterrence of such diversion by the risk of early detection. This unique verification system cannot physically prevent diversion. However, the capacity to detect in a timely fashion a diversion of nuclear material, as well as the international action which is called for in such an event, has constituted an effective deterrent.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The manpower available for IAEA inspection work is necessarily limited by the financial restraints imposed on the IAEA as for all other international organisations. Expenditure on safeguards is the largest area of IAEA activity, representing approx. 30 per cent of the IAEA budget. In the past year there has been a 25 per cent increase in the available man-years of inspection. A number of member states, including Australia, are providing extra-budgetary technical and financial assistance to the Agency's safeguards system. Permanent 'on the spot' inspection staff are provided for certain sensitive facilities. Also, in order to try to increase inspector availability without significantly adding to costs, a field office has been established in Canada and a group of inspectors have started long-term assignments in Japan. Safeguards inspection is supported by continuously operating automatic instrumentation.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Safeguards agreements, like all international treaties, constitute legally binding undertakings by the parties to implement their provisions. Safeguards agreements also provide for sanctions to be applied in the event of non- compliance. Safeguards agreements are the measure through which the non-nuclear weapon member states rely upon the IAEA to confirm that their actions conform to their stated intentions not to acquire nuclear weapons. In order to assure the international community of their continuing non-nuclear weapon status, it is in these states' interest that the safeguards applied pursuant to the agreements should be effective.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The Government is firmly committed to the maintenance and development of IAEA safeguards. It is contributing to this process through the implementation of relevant obligations in Australia's nuclear safeguards agreements and through participation in international activity directed towards improving safeguards; through its support for the Agency as an institution including its annual contributions to the regular budget of the IAEA; and through a separate programme of assistance funded by a voluntary contribution estimated to cost $541,000 over three years.</PARA>
