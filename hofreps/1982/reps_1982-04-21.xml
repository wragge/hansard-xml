<PARA> That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 6 April 1982 of Mr Horace James Garrick, member of this House for the Division of Batman from 1969- 1977, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>All members of this House will be saddened to learn of the recent death of one of our former colleagues. Horace Garrick was the Australian Labor Party member for Batman from 1969 to 1977. He was born on 26 August 1918 in Melbourne and was educated at the Hawthorn West Central School and Swinburne Technical College. He was elected to Parliament at the general election on 25 October 1969 succeeding the then independent member for Batman, Sam Benson. He retired from the House on 10 November 1977 just before the general election. </PARA>
<PARA> In his maiden speech on 11 March 1970 Mr Garrick referred to the problems of urban living and the importance he saw for local government in our three tiered system of government. He was concerned about the quality of life especially in the suburban environment and, of course, was able to speak of this with first- hand knowledge and experience. He became a member of the Collingwood Council in 1957 and Mayor of Collingwood from 1960 to 1961 and again from 1968 to 1969. He therefore made an important contribution to the local government scene in Victoria. Additionally, he was a commissioner with the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works from 1964 to 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Garrick was re-elected at the general elections of 1972, 1974 and 1975 and throughout this period served the Parliament as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Library from 3 March 1976 to 10 November 1977 and as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Works from 18 July 1974 to 11 November 1975. He was a member of the Australian Parliamentary Mission to the United States and Mexico in June-July 1972, a member of the Inter Parliamentary Union spring meeting held here in Canberra in April 1977, and attended the sixty-fourth IPU conference in Sofia in September 1977. I am sure his sporting activities in his electorate will be fondly remembered. He was a keen footballer and athlete himself, as well as being a member of sporting organisations in the area-the Collingwood Football Club and Fitzroy Bowling Club. He was also a member of the Northcote Returned Services League and the Preston Social Club. Members of this House have lost a friend and colleague, one who was vitally interested in civic affairs and who served the electors of Batman well. To his family we extend our deepest sympathies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a melancholy occasion for members of the Australian Labor Party to acknowledge the passing of Horace James Garrick who served in this Parliament as an ALP member and as the member for Batman from 1969 to 1977. Horace Garrick is remembered by those who served with him as a man of infectious personality, with a deep commitment to the cause the Labor Party represents and a determination to serve the people who had sent him to this Parliament. He had a great belief in this country and what it could achieve for its people in succeeding generations. Horrie was a true and sensible nationalist just as he was a loyal and dedicated Labor man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before entering Parliament, Horrie Garrick served the community in local government. He was a professional man by employment and was a caring husband and father. The community is diminished by the loss of a man of Horace Garrick's qualities and standards. I speak for all members of the Labor Party when I express my very deep sympathy to his widow and surviving members of his family. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Batman)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pay tribute today to my predecessor in the seat of Batman, Mr Horrie Garrick, who died on 6 April. Horrie Garrick was distinguished for his long service to the Labor movement, as a Labor councillor in the City of Collingwood Council for 19 years from 1957 to 1976, as a commissioner of the Board of Works and and as the honourable member for Batman for eight years from 1969 to 1977. Horrie died suddenly at his home on the Tuesday following the great Labor victory in the Victorian State election on 3 April. Fittingly, his last contribution to the movement was assisting John Cain's campaign in the seat of Bundoora, a new outer suburb, where Horrie had resided in the last years of his life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It will be as a long-standing Labor man in turbulent inner-city politics that Horrie Garrick will be best remembered. He first nominated for the seat of Batman in 1969 when the electorate was based in the inner city areas of Clifton Hill, North Fitzroy and the Northcote areas, with which he had a great familiarity due to his long-standing involvement with the Collingwood Council. His period coincided with dramatic upheavals experienced in the inner city areas of Melbourne, such as Collingwood. Areas such as Collingwood were the victims of government intrusion through freeway expansion or block clearance. As a local representative Horrie fought to redress the powerlessness felt by inner city residents at the hands of government and often private investors. </PARA>
<PARA> Horrie was a socialist and a staunch defender of the Labor movement against the attacks from outside groups following the Labor split in 1955. He was a firm unionist with long-standing membership of the sheet metal workers union and of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia. As a parliamentarian he served on a number of committees to which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has referred. He was a member of the Australian Parliamentary Mission to the United States of America and Mexico in 1972. On his return from that visit, Horrie made a strong call for increased efforts to provide adequate water supplies to the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA> Intrinsic to Horrie's character was a great involvement in community affairs. A distinguishing mark of this involvement was his sensitivity to and encouragement of ethnic groups in the community long before multiculturalism became popular. In those days migrants, particularly southern Europeans, Greeks and Italians, were arriving in large numbers in inner city areas such as Collingwood and Fitzroy. The reception that they received was often inhospitable and overcrowded housing, dirty jobs and hostility from the wider community. As a local councillor and then a parliamentarian, Horrie showed a deep concern for the problems that migrants were experiencing. He took up their cause on many occasions. It was not surprising that he should be chosen by the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, to head a task force of migrants in the early days of that Government's first term of office. The work of that task force assisted in laying the groundwork for many of the reforms in ethnic rights, such as the provision of interpreter services and multilingual education. </PARA>
<PARA> His community involvement meant that he was extremely well liked as a local figure. He was identified with local sporting clubs, particularly football and athletics clubs. He had many loyal friends at the North Fitzroy Bowling Club. Finally, Horrie was a dedicated and caring family man. He is survived by his wife and three daughters. I am sure that all members of this House will join with me in offering our condolences to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Prime Minister. I refer to the proposed inquiry into the Bureau of Customs which the Prime Minister foreshadowed in his statement to the House yesterday concerning the resignations of the former Ministers for Health and Business and Consumer Affairs. I ask: Is it intended that the Customs Bureau and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs should investigate themselves? Are the activities of those senior officers who were involved in the six months long chain of misinformation surrounding the former Health Minister's Customs examination on 5 October last to be included in the terms of reference of the proposed inquiry? Are the investigating officers to be empowered to inquire into allegations of intimidation and conspiracy, as supported by the file of documents tabled by the Government yesterday? Will the Prime Minister announce to this House the terms of reference at the earliest opportunity? Finally, will the Prime Minister now reconsider his earlier rejection of the Opposition's call for an open judicial inquiry as the only proper means by which these serious matters can be resolved?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a short statement that I issued over the weekend on this matter I indicated very plainly that there needed to be a full disclosure of the facts. Going beyond that, to what the Leader of the Opposition has just said, I did not yesterday reject any particular form of inquiry. I said that there would be an examination; the form and nature of that examination were yet to be determined by the Government. This morning there has been discussion between the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the Attorney-General and other Ministers. Those discussions are not yet complete. We need a further report from the Attorney-General and from the Minister. We will be making decisions about the nature of the examination as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one matter, I think, that I can and should lay at rest. We do not propose to establish an inquiry in which Caesar would be investigating Caesar. In other words, the Department would not be investigating itself in relation to these particular matters. Whatever was done would be consistent with what I said on the first occasion, in a short Press statement over the weekend, that there should be a full disclosure of the facts.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ML7">Mr McVEIGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to advise the House that the reports that appeared in the media were inaccurate in several instances. The apprentice concerned, Mr Linterbrink, was advised, like all other people who enter into apprenticeships with the Department, that on completion of his apprenticeship he may not be able to be employed. He understood that. The union to which he belongs also understood that. The Department's policy is not merely to train the number of people that it can employ at the termination of their apprenticeships but rather to use its full capacity to train people. This year the Department employed 75 apprentices. At present 400 are in employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Additionally, the Department's policy is to help people obtain employment when their apprenticeships have been completed. They are kept on for three months after that point has been reached. In this case, the Department obtained a position for Mr Linterbrink at $300 a week but he would not take it. Additionally, private enterprise offered him a position at $325 a week and he said that he couldn't take that job because he needed a little holiday. Therefore, the Press publicity inclines me to the view that he is but a puppet of the union and one questions his integrity and the reason for his statement.</PARA>
<PARA> The other inaccuracy in the Press report was that the departmental employees and apprentices are not looked upon with great respect by industry. This is not true. In fact, the Department can produce many examples of recognition being given. One that comes readily to mind is a letter from Mr Schnelle of Chemineer Engineering which states that the Department's apprentices are better educated and have better all-round ability than those trained by private enterprise.</PARA>

Is the Prime Minister aware that in the 41 pages of documents tabled yesterday there are included only two documents concerning reports made at the time of the incident itself? Is it a fact that there are no file notes, records of conversation, or other files made during the first 48 hours after the incident at Sydney Airport on 5 October last year? Is it also a fact that eight of the 13 documents tabled yesterday were compiled in the last five days after the matter became public in the Press?

That question, as I understand it, was asked more than once. Checks were made in New South Wales because the documents that have been tabled, as I am advised, mostly come from files held in New South Wales rather than head office. Subject to what the Minister may say, it is also my understanding that the files were sent to Canberra so that there could be a double check through head office as to whether there are any additional pieces of paper relevant to the issue. On the advice that has been given to me, all pieces of paper that are relevant to this issue have been tabled in the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the honourable gentleman has been fairly forceful in trying to persuade the Telecom authorities that the lines presently available out of the electorate of Lyne and the southern North Coast area of New South Wales are less than adequate. There have been a number of major growth areas in Australia, of which the honourable member's electorate is one, and in order to offset those problems the Telecom authorities have been providing an enormous capital allocation to try to ensure that switching gear and new phone installations are able to meet demand. As a result of some reappraisal of funding priorities within Telecom an additional $20m has been provided for capital works in this financial year. With an expenditure of $1,285m throughout Australia, Telecom is hoping to be able to provide the maximum service that it can to meet the exploding communication needs of the Australian population, and this certainly includes the constituents of the honourable gentleman. Indeed, a group of representatives from Telecom recently visited the electorate of Lyne and other areas on the North Coast of New South Wales and met with the honourable gentleman and others to try to identify whether there could be, through the allocation of that additional $20m, some improvement in the facilities presently available. Certainly I recognise that there are major difficulties in respect of the number of lines, the switching gear, people being able to get the numbers they call when they want to and even to get phones installed when they want to, not only in that area but also in other areas of Australia. I have taken up both those matters with Telecom and I shall also pass on to it the honourable gentleman's question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be happy to talk about interest rates. The current indications are that the deficit for this financial year will be in the order of $1,000m. The projection at the time of the Budget was $146m. The House has already been advised in some detail of those matters which have added to the deficit both on the revenue side and on the expenditure side. Naturally, the course of revenue collections during the remaining months of the financial year could have an important bearing on the final outcome. As those who follow these matters closely know, the collection, particularly of provisional tax, can vary somewhat against predictions. As things lie and look at the moment, that will be the general outcome. I think that we ought to put into perspective the fact that, although that outcome will be about $700m to $800m more than what was projected at the time of the Budget, as a percentage of gross domestic product it will be well below one per cent. The Budget deficit of that figure compares with figures of 4.9 per cent in 1975 and 3.3 per cent, 3.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent in the subsequent years. In 1979-80 there was a very major reduction to 1.8 per cent and last year the figure was somewhere just under one per cent. So even that larger figure would represent, in any language, a very responsible outcome and one that is very broadly consistent with the Government's objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to reports that a reign of terror has been imposed by the Ugandan Army in that country and that 'life is far more perilous than it ever was under the rule of Idi Amin'. Is it a fact that a Roman Catholic bishop of Uganda has accused elements of the Ugandan Army of inhuman behaviour and that on 24 February there was heavy fighting in Kampala where four Australian Army personnel are stationed as part of the Commonwealth training team attached to the Ugandan Army? Is the Minister able to assure the House that the lives of the Australians are not in danger and that, given President Obote's rule and the Army's activities, the participation of the Australian team will now be reviewed? Further, is the Minister in a position to say when an officer from the Australian High Commission in Nairobi last visited Uganda?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two matters of fact which I will need to check. The first relates to the last part of the question regarding the date of the last visit to Uganda by an officer from the Australian High Commission and the second relates to the reference to the Roman Catholic bishop. I am not aware of those matters but I will check them. The continuing allegations of human rights abuse in Uganda are of deep concern to the Government. We have made clear to the Ugandan Government our expectation that it will make the most determined efforts to improve that situation. We have also noted statements by President Obote asserting that his Government has a commitment to the preservation of human rights. A major factor in Australia's decision to join the Commonwealth assistance program was our assessment that it would help the human rights situation in Uganda to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has referred. The disarray and indiscipline of the armed forces is clearly a contributing factor to these abuses of human rights. Therefore it could be expected that an improvement in military discipline would bring a corresponding improvement in the human rights area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our decision to contribute to the Commonwealth training program was a carefully considered one. We acknowledge that risks are involved but we consider that positive action by the Commonwealth now will make a valuable contribution to the future internal stability of that unhappy country. The Commonwealth Secretariat and the Ugandan Government are jointly responsible for the protection arrangements for the Commonwealth military training team. Whilst the internal security situation there is undoubtedly unsettled at this stage, on our assessment there is not a serious risk to our personnel. Were this assessment to change, the Government would not hesitate to reassess our involvement in the team, in consultation, of course, with the other governments concerned and the Commonwealth Secretariat. In an emergency the senior Australian officer, if in his judgment Australian lives are at risk, has the authority to implement withdrawal as he sees fit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman, indeed all honourable members, will be aware that Australia Post is charged with the responsibility of providing its services at a charge which covers the cost of their provision. Consequently, adjustments to charges for parcel post were made by Australia Post taking into account that responsibility. However, recently there has been a realignment of areas within which postal charges are set. No doubt the situation which applies to Eyre Peninsula and the particular instances to which the honourable gentleman 's question was addressed are part of that reappraisal. I am not aware of the particular circumstances of Eyre Peninsula or of postage rates to the two destinations, Mount Gambier and Adelaide, which he instanced. However, I will take that up with Australia Post and refer the honourable member's question to it. I say, however, to all honourable members that it needs to be borne in mind that there have been significant labour disabilities within Australia Post. As I mentioned to this House on another occasion, industrial troubles prior to Christmas 1981 cost Australia Post something like $7m. One of the reasons for the present adjustment in postal charges can be sourced directly to the disruption caused by industrial troubles at that time. Those troubles certainly have added to the postal charges as well as to the parcel charges, the matter to which this question is related.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am able to report that the brucellosis and tuberculosis campaign is progressing very satisfactorily. I think that it is up to, or even ahead of, schedule. Many areas in southern Australia are provisionally free of both brucellosis and tuberculosis, and the campaign is now being carried out mostly in the northern parts of Australia. As the honourable member will know, the Northern Territory is very much a central part of that campaign. It is imperative that the campaign be continued and finalised. There is no doubt that the future of cattle markets and of the cattle industry in the long term is dependent on that campaign being appropriately completed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member talked about the Commonwealth Government's contribution. I think there is a misunderstanding throughout the industry that the Commonwealth has a commitment to provide some 15 per cent of funds for the campaign. I have checked the record and am unable to find any such commitment. Nevertheless, the volume of money that the Commonwealth has paid to this point- some $32.6m-is about 12 per cent of the cost of the campaign to this point. In the three-year period that the recent announcement covers-from 1984 to 1987-it is anticipated that the Commonwealth Government again will be called upon to provide about $12m out of an estimated expenditure of somewhere between $54m and $84m. So, the Commonwealth's contribution will be in the range of from 22 per cent, at its highest, to 14 per cent, at its lowest.</PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member will know, the campaign has been funded by a levy on the industry. Because of a variety of circumstances not enough funds have been available to meet the demands of the campaign. Therefore, the Commonwealth has on-lent funds to the industry, to the tune of some $16m, to keep the campaign up to its program. There is now a debt of some $22m, made up of that $16m plus interest. This is of major concern to the industry. It is concerned that it is unable to meet its commitment to repay the loan and meet the interest payments as well as maintain the campaign as it ought to be maintained. The Cattle Council of Australia met with the Prime Minister and me last night and put its concerns to us. We recognise, as it does, that the campaign is an important and imperative one and we recognise the difficulty that will be caused to the industry in meeting its commitments totalling approximately $22m.

Unlike some of his colleagues who automatically adopt the views of other sections of the Australian community without query or interrogation, we form our own assessments. I do not accept the submission put by the Council on that occasion. I think it was put to explain away the conduct of some of its members. I do not think it is a valid analysis of the situation. We have never argued that monetary policy is the only policy that can be used to bring about wage restraint. Obviously other elements can be introduced; but any climate of successful wage restraint over a period must include a monetary and fiscal policy which is not accommodating to excessive wage settlements.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian iron and steel industry is in a state of shock and depression. Production of pig iron in the three months to February was 12 per cent down on the equivalent period of last year. Production of raw steel fell 16 per cent over the same period. Steel plants have been closed or reopenings deferred, in Newcastle and Port Kembla in New South Wales and Kwinana in Western Australia. Four hundred workers are being laid off in Kwinana. Recently one hundred and fifty jobs were lost in Newcastle and the work force in Port Kembla is falling by an average of 30 every week. My colleague the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West), who will follow me in the debate, will say more about the problems in the Port Kembla district, but I am informed by Mr Lloyd O'Neill, the Australian Labor Party's successor to Mr Laurie Wallis in the seat of Grey, that management expects to reduce from 6,300 to 5,000 the work force in the steel industry of Whyalla-a shattering reduction for such a regional centre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Further, I have been reminded that a question upon notice by the honourable member for Grey goes further and expresses concern that statements by the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd indicate that 3,000 jobs could become redundant in the Australian steel industry generally, thus affecting the steelmaking centres of Whyalla, Newcastle, Port Kembla and Kwinana. From what I have said already, and from other indications, over the course of 1982, 3,000 of Australia's 60,000 steel industry jobs appear certain to be lost. The social and economic consequences of this industrial decline are, of course, concentrated on Australia's four regional steel centres of Newcastle, Port Kembla, Whyalla and Kwinana. </PARA>
<PARA> The medium and longer term future appear just as bleak, as BHP has apparently made the strategic decision to halt expansion in steel and put all the emphasis on job-displacing productivity improvement. It is virtually surrendering a long- term export capacity. Already, for the first time in several decades, our imports of iron and steel actually exceed our exports. Trade statistics released only last week show in the last half year a 9 per cent fall in the value of iron and steel exports and a 27 per cent rise in imports. These trends in the industry are catastrophic. They are an indictment of both the monetarist philosophy and the failed manufacturing policies of this bankrupt and increasingly talentless government. No wonder there is an overwhelming perception of a smell of decay pervading this Government as it lurches from one crisis to another. </PARA>
<PARA> In the immediate future the problems of the industry can be seen to arise from a failure to maintain international competitiveness, plus the depressed condition of the domestic market. Each of these problems can be substantially blamed on the economic incompetence and stupidity of the Fraser Government. As the Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd has been repeatedly stressing, the Government has maintained an exchange rate for the Australian dollar which bears no sensible relationship to our recent dismal trading performance. Even with the devaluation of recent months there remains a market overvaluation of the dollar which is now being supported by Government overseas borrowings and a ludicrously high interest rate policy aimed at forcing the private sector to borrow off- shore. This is the factor which has had the most damaging impact on our steel trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Added to this has been the continued procrastination and crisis in Government administration in the long delay for a decision on the BHP and Lysaght ( Australia) Limited requests for temporary assistance and anti-dumping measures. These requests have been circulating in understaffed bureaucratic circles for several months while the industry situation has slipped from bad to worse. I have learned that some of the fault perhaps is with the management of BHP, but that is no consolation to the workers of BHP. I hope that this debate today will bring forward the Government's excuses for these applications having been lost in the bureaucracy for so long. No doubt the latest loss of a Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs will add to the delay. The Fraser Government has now had five Ministers in this post and presumably we will get a sixth, to be announced in the coming days or weeks. The delay has been despite the disruption caused by dramatically increasing imports which should have triggered at least the commencement of temporary assistance inquiries months ago. These immediate problems in relation to imports should be dealt with promptly. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to the current Government's monetarist philosophy-a philosophy which is proving universally to be a total failure and little better than a quack cure peddled by simple ideologues. Monetarism, which has seen Australian interest rates reach record levels, is being reinforced further by the Fraser Government. In the year to February money supply growth at 10.5 per cent fell below the rate of inflation. Inevitably, a critical squeeze has been imposed on the economy as the real volume of money falls. Business confidence has collapsed . A recent survey by the Metal Trades Industry Association, which comprises the main customers of the steel industry, confirms this crisis. The reason given for the reduction in expectations was overwhelmingly a 'lack of demand'-a lack of demand resulting from deliberate Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the direct production and employment consequences of this recessionary monetarist approach, the high interest rates have dampened BHP's ability and motivation to invest in new plant. A recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development steel industry symposium was told by American representatives that it is difficult to contemplate modernisation with interest rates at 17 per cent and 18 per cent and higher with below average profits. BHP's circumstances and environment are very similiar to America's, and largely because our governments are each blindly pursuing the monetarist path. But these immediate problems are not the only ones for which this Government must stand condemned in relation to this basic and vital industry for Australia' s economy. </PARA>
<PARA> For decades the Australian steel industry has been the exclusive province of a single, monopolistic company. In the past, the management of that company has served Australia reasonably well, and I fully expect that it will continue to do so. However, the Australian Labor party is concerned that the strategic decisions being taken in relation to the BHP steel division may not optimise the potential benefits which can be gained through this industry. We believe that the national Government has a role, indeed a responsibility, to involve itself more fully in such strategic decisions of such great importance to the Australian national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There are several reasons for the Government taking a role in the longer term planning of this industry. I want to go through those reasons. Firstly, the steel industry already receives special assistance from the Government in the form of accelerated depreciation and protective tariffs. The Labor Party supports these assistance measures but considers that, as they are provided on the basis of national interest objectives, the Government should seek to ensure that the industry does meet national objectives. Secondly, we believe that a system of national economic planning would assist in the task of moving Australia to a higher growth path. Obviously the steel industry would benefit from and be a major part of such a higher growth strategy. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), who is sitting at the table, was seeking to interject. I only wish that a Minister would take part in this debate but I have my doubts about whether one will. It ill becomes him, a senior Government Minister handling an economic portfolio, to sit there half listening to this debate and not enter it and defend the Government's poor record in relation to the steel industry in particular and the national economy in general. </PARA>
<PARA> I am going through the list of the several reasons for the Government taking a role in the longer term planning of this industry. The third reason I give is that we note that there is heavy government involvement in the steel industry in many other countries. The European coal and steel community has for many years pursued the restructuring of its steel industries in order to meet increased competition and the more exacting quality requirements of customers. A tripartite consultative committee has operated to assist this process in Europe. Governments have been involved in trading arrangements to avoid disruption. In many other countries, including those competing with Australian steel, the governments have owned or substantially influenced the development of steel industries, often giving them a competitive advantage. In these circumstances we in the Labor Party believe that the Australian steel industry deserves much closer attention and help from government. We do not accept that because BHP has a pessimistic outlook the local industry must fall by the wayside, which it is in danger of doing. </PARA>
<PARA> We observe that in other countries very different strategies are being pursued. Following entry to the European Economic Community the Irish steel industry fully restructured and maintained its competitiveness. Malaysia is now building two medium size steel plants, each with an annual capacity of about 600,000 tonnes. They will open in 1984-85 and will probably use Australian raw materials . Although developing countries are expanding their capacity it is expected that the more rapid growth of these countries will mean they have a continuing need to import steel in net terms. The long term future of steel has been assessed as bleak by BHP. But in many other countries expansion and restructuring are being pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that as many as a quarter of a million jobs in the steel industry have been lost over the past decade in the industrialised countries. But Australia has unique advantages in terms of energy, iron ore and its location adjacent to the most rapidly growing industrial zones of the world. With all those advantages there is no reason for our record to be the same as other countries. It is the responsibility of the Government to fully assess whether these advantages lead to a conclusion that the industry should be expanded rather than diminished, as BHP believes. If, after proper and exhaustive study, it is found that BHP's assessment is right, then the Government's responsibility shifts to preserving the rights and opportunities of the people in our four great steel cities. </PARA>
<PARA> The European and Japanese industries have rationalised in the context of measures to secure the livelihood of those affected. Social policies provide for readaption of workers, early pensions, income maintenance, the creation of alternative jobs and the training of workers to fill them. Whatever strategy is found appropriate for Australia, the Government must accept the responsibility to ensure that it is a correct decision and one that leads to security for those affected. Instead, at present we face uncertainty and crisis. The workers laid off at Kwinana believe they have have not had a satisfactory redundancy scheme. This threatens industrial trouble in many other centres as well. We have not seen for many years an adequate effort to improve competitiveness and efficiency in the Australian steel industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is very concerned to note that the price of steel used in metal fabrication manufacturing industry has accelerated more rapidly in recent years than has the consumer price index. Prices rose by 11.1 per cent in 1979-80 and 14.1 per cent in 1980-81. The price in March this year was a further 11.6 per cent above the previous year's figure, despite the recession and despite increased imports. These figures suggest that steel is a serious scource of cost pressure in the Australian economy. This is of very great concern to us. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should establish immediately a tripartite task force to review the future of the Australian steel industry. Company, trade union and government representatives should jointly review strategic options for the industry indicating what the requirements are for a wide range of alternatives. This industry has no effective liaison with Government. There is no equivalent to European joint consultation. There is no industry advisory council. A dumping evaluation committee was established last year but this has a very narrow focus and we have yet to see any tangible benefit from it. While a steel industry task force will help devise a more growth-oriented and socially responsible strategy for the industry, it will continue to face a slump in demand unless this Government also changes its disastrous macroeconomic policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) has taken a typical tilt at the Government's industry policy-in this case the steel industry-but the charges he makes and the whole thrust of his criticism of the Government are mischievous and misleading, and based on incomplete information. He charges that the Government is sitting around with no interest in the steel industry and doing nothing about it. I draw his attention to item No. 14 on today's Notice Paper which contains a very important measure to assist the steel industry-a Bill to provide a very favourable rate of depreciation for the industry, the effect of which will be to allow the industry to write off its capital investment over five years compared with a period previously of around 12 years.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will make it much more competitive-it is the best single measure one can take to make industry more competitive. Yet the honourable member for Adelaide charges, and Australians are led to believe, that the Government is sitting around with no interest in the industry and doing nothing. The fact is that the Government is very well aware of the situation in both the domestic and the international iron and steel industry. The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) and the Department have in fact been in very close contact with the industry over recent months. It certainly has to be appreciated that the Australian industry is operating in a world steel industry environment characterised by serious over-capacity and very depressed prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For instance, in Sweden last year apparent consumption was down about 8 per cent compared with the previous year. Crude steel production was down 11 per cent to its lowest level since 1965, with 8 per cent of the steel work force permanently laid off. In Japan, crude steel production was down 8.7 per cent. In the United States of America shipments out of the steel works were admittedly up slightly in 1981 but have since declined very sharply and in January this year were 26 per cent below the figures for January 1981. There were 68,000 workers laid off and 22,000 on short time. The European Economic Community would have to go back to the late 1960s to find a comparable year with the extent to which production and employment are down in that industry. Further the general world consensus is that increases in demand in the foreseeable future will be very small. Economic growth generally is likely to be below recent predictions, and growth in steel demand even less than the growth in total production, GDP, due to progressive reductions in steel intensity. For instance EEC industrial production was down 1.5 per cent last year but steel production was down 7 per cent. The usage of steel as against other materials in various products, for instance motor cars, has declined. </PARA>
<PARA> I cite those figures because the world steel market situation, together with measures adopted by a number of overseas governments to enable their industries to survive such conditions or at least to adjust more slowly, have resulted in greatly intensified import competition for the Australian industry. Also, naturally, Australian export markets have been affected. The Australian industry has traditionally exported upwards of 20 per cent of its output but under current trading conditions such sales have become increasingly unremunerative. The Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd has therefore indicated that it is curtailing its export marketing activities. The closure of the Kwinana blast furnace, for example, reflects directly the loss of export markets. Previously more than half of that furnace's output of pig iron had been exported, mainly to China, but with China now having entered export markets and with other new producers also competing in the Asia-Pacific market I would say that BHP was faced with no real alternative but to close the furnace. Production over the last few months has been stockpiled for future domestic requirements. In that way employees have been given more time to find alternative work. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Government recognises the industry's difficulties. Clearly, it did so during its consideration last year of the Industries Assistance Commission report on the industry. I have already referred to the fact that we have a specific measure to allow for a faster write-off of new investment. It was introduced in the last Budget. It is applicable from the date of presentation of that Budget-that is, 18 August last year-and will apply until 1991. This measure was introduced to provide an incentive to the industry in terms of improved cash flow to introduce modern technologically advanced plant and equipment. As the BHP Executive General Manager for Finance, Mr Hunter said recently:</PARA>
<PARA> If increased productivity is not forthcoming, the group faces a permanent loss of its steel export markets and the further erosion by imports of the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA>A particular initiative taken by the Government-I think this ought to be considered carefully in the light of the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide-in recognition of the parlous state of the world's steel industry, as I have outlined, and in conjunction with the decision to which I referred on the IAC report, was the establishment of the iron and steel joint industry dumping evaluation committee. This is a joint industry-departmental committee to facilitate the submission of prima facie cases of alleged dumping in respect of iron and steel mill products. </PARA>
<PARA> Following reports from the committee the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs has carried out a number of dumping investigations and is continuing its activities in that area. Since the Government announced its decision on the IAC report last April and it introduced the accelerated depreciation provision in the August Budget, as I have said, the world steel market has continued to deteriorate. Consequently we have a situation in which more overseas producers are looking to export to the Australian market. Countries which previously did not do so, such as Brazil, South Africa and even Spain are now doing so, as are established exporting countries such as Japan and Korea, which have more product available. The inevitable end effect in the market-place has been depressed prices, price cutting and very intense competition. The honourable member for Adelaide referred to two requests for temporary assistance; one from John Lysaght (Aust.) Ltd covering a variety of flat steel products and the other from BHP covering certain hot rolled flat steel products, pipes and tubes. The John Lysaght request was notified publicly by the Department of Industry and Commerce on 4 January this year and the BHP request was notified by the Department on 30 March this year. </PARA>
<PARA> As all honourable members will be aware, there are established procedures for industries wishing to have their level of assistance against import competition reviewed. Part of that procedure is for them to demonstrate that a prima facie case exists for a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission or to the Temporary Assistance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of that process the Department publishes details of requests for temporary assistance and provides them to all interested parties to give them the opportunity, firstly of knowing that such a request has been made and, secondly, of submitting their point of view to the Department. Discussions have also taken place between the Department and steel users, processors, importers and representatives of overseas suppliers. These discussions have assisted in gaining a more detailed appreciation of the market situation and outlook, the factors which have contributed to the present situation as well as the implication of any change in assistance levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not take a decision separately on the John Lysaght application quite deliberately as it had become known that BHP was considering making an application covering different but related products. It should be remembered that a number of sectors of the industry were under pressure at the beginning of the year, not just the John Lysaght product range. So the position is that the Department of Industry and Commerce is at the moment awaiting receipt of essential statistical information from sectors of the industry itself . I do not know why the Labor Party has raised this matter of public importance at this particular moment. However, the position is that the Department has to await receipt of essential statistical information from sectors of the industry itself before it is able to finalise its report to the Minister. I let that be known for the information of the honourable member for Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is then that there has been continuing contact between the industry and the Department to facilitate the preparation and submission of the requisite data. Until the industry provides this data the Minister is unable to determine whether a prima facie case exists for the reference. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit that decisions taken by the Government so far-I have referred to the accelerated depreciation and the setting up of the committee-and the urgency being given to reviewing the industry's present difficulties clearly illustrate the Government's concern for the continuing viability of this industry which is very important in both an economic and a strategic sense. The House can be assured that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will make his decision as a matter of urgency as soon as this information is forthcoming and the report is received. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about the provision in the Bill before the House. I previously referred to accelerated write-off to encourage new investment in the iron and steel industry. I take this opportunity to suggest to the Government that there is in fact an urgent need to achieve faster capital recovery in other industries-indeed, in all industries-as perhaps a key element in meeting the urgent need to regain, maximise, our international competitiveness. Indeed, this should be a key feature of a positive industry strategy for Australia. The difficulty with the existing pattern of write-off provisions is that there is a bias towards repair and maintenance expenditure on equipment which is deductible in the year of expenditure. But that bias has a very serious long term impact on the modernity, the extent of modern plant and equipment in industry. That, of course, has serious implications in terms of reduced competitiveness and profitability. I venture to say that the ideal would be to adopt the British system of free depreciation. I suggest to the Government that while that is a long term ideal objective towards which we might work, a start might be given by having a shorter write-off period than now exists, such as the five-year period provided in the legislation of the steel industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I ask: What positive suggestions for this industry, for industry policy generally or for economic policy generally have we had from the Opposition in this debate today? In listening to the honourable member for Adelaide I detected a suggestion that yet another authority should be established. The honourable member has a great penchant for suggesting the establishment of additional regulatory authorities. A suggestion was recently made for the establishment of an Automotive Industry Authority. The Opposition's formula is always for more planning, more control and more smothering bureaucracy. I should like to quote the key passage of a statement made by the honourable member for Adelaide. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the context of substantial Government support for the industry,</PARA>
<PARA>In that case, the motor car industry--</PARA>
<PARA>it is essential that the Government be involved in the formulation of plans--</PARA>
<PARA>Note the small 'p'; in short, planning--</PARA>
<PARA>for the industry's future structure. It is also necessary that the Government monitor and regulate to the extent necessary, pricing and component sourcing decisions of the major vehicle assemblers. A Labor Government will establish an Automotive Industry Authority to achieve this planning and regulation of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Adelaide said the Authority would 'regulate pricing decisions' of the major companies. We might as well nationalise the industry straight out. If this were done perhaps we would see a repetition of what happened to the vehicle and other industries in the United Kingdom. As I said at the outset, it is totally misleading of the Opposition to use the words it has; its argument is based on inadequate information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I want to put it on record that the Opposition is most disappointed and wants those involved in the steel industry- both corporations and labour-to know that we are very sorry that the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch), although he is in the Parliament somewhere today, has not seen fit to come into the chamber to debate what is undoubtedly a developing situation of relative crisis in the steel industry. There is no argument about that. The Government, the Opposition and the unions involved in the steel industry may differ on the facts, on the course the industry is taking and on the policy requirements, but in my view there is no argument about what are the problems. The problems in the Australian steel industry centre upon falling production; slack domestic demand caused mainly by the economic failures of this Government, by rising imports, an erratic export market, a declining return on investment of funds employed; and a very poor industrial relations record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very difficult to assess the basis accurately. The Opposition has put in a lot of work, in contrast to the Government, on establishing exactly what is going on in the steel industry. There are a number of reasons why this is difficult. The Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd steel division and Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd traditionally run a closed shop. They generally scorn public accountability and they generally run a very rigid industrial relations system. They are inclined to deal formally with government and government bodies such as the Industries Assistance Commission. This can make the situation very difficult . </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to indicate to the House the position in terms of actual statistics and facts so far as I have been able to ascertain them. I refer to production. In the year ending May 1976, steel production at the biggest plant in the country, Port Kembla, was 4.7 million tonnes, raw steel weight. Last year , at the end of May 1981, it was only 4.8 million tonnes. The yearly figure six months later, to the end of November, was 4.5 million tonnes only. At the end of November last year, on an annual basis, less steel was being produced at Port Kembla than in 1976. So far as imports are concerned, in 1976 504,000 tonnes were imported into Australia in terms of ingot equivalent. Up to May 1981 the figure was 914,000 tonnes. In areas directly competitive to BHP, 760,000 tonnes of raw steel equivalent were imported into Australia to the year ended September 1981. That was an increase of 40 per cent over the figure for the preceding 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a source of great concern and worry to us that the proposed new gas pipeline from the North West Shelf development to Perth will not contain, at this stage, one single tonne of Australian steel. Yet imports have risen by 40 per cent over the past year. The figures show that 210,000 tonnes of pipe will be used-100,000 tonnes will be supplied as finished pipe from Japan, 70,000 tonnes of pipe will come from Italy, and 40,000 tonnes will be supplied by Steel Mains at Kwinana. But that is to be manufactured from Japanese plate. BHP and the steel division of Australian Iron and Steel have informed me that they had the capacity to supply that steel but because of a lack of government intervention to help them not one single tonne of Australian steel will be going into the North West Shelf pipeline to Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> Steel exports are very erratic and are difficult to assess. In the year ended 31 May 1972, 280,000 tonnes were exported from Port Kembla. By 1978 that had risen to 1 1/2 million tonnes but by 1981 it had dropped to 761,000 tonnes for the comparable periods. Since July last year there has been a blip in exports. About 660,000 tonnes have been exported from Port Kembla in the months July 1981 to February 1982. That is an increase of 280,000 tonnes on the comparable period a year before. But the company says that the export market is significantly weakening once again. Two points need to be made here. There has been a very rapid decline over 4 years. In 1978 the export component of production was 35 per cent from Port Kembla. It had declined to 16 per cent of total production up to May last year. It can be said that although there has been an increase in exports over the last few months the company has been selling at a very marginal profit mainly to keep production rolling and employment stable. But, as I will show, that has not actually occurred. Profitability in the industry is well down in terms of funds employed. BHP indicated that in the year to November 1981 its steel division made a loss of $139m. Two points should be made about that. BHP employs an accounting method known as fixed asset utilisation. Using normal accounting procedures it made $128m profit to November 1981. However, $105m of that was made up till May, and in the next six months it made only $23m profit. I am sure this House will agree that that is not very much profit to make on funds invested of between $2 billion and $3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The points I want to raise are: Where is this industry going? What is the Government doing about it? Where are the industry policies? What is the situation as a result of the facts and figures I have just outlined? At Kwinana, steelmaking has shut up shop. The blast furnace has closed and over 400 jobs have gone. In Newcastle one blast furnace is out of action and one coke oven battery has been closed down. At Port Kembla two blast furnaces are out of action. The No. 2 blast furnace has not been brought back on line since an expensive reline. I refer now to employment. At the Port Kembla steel division of Australian Iron and Steel 19,900 people are employed. That labour force is down-by attrition; that is non-replacement-by 682 since September last. That attrition is continuing at the rate of 30 people per week. If it continues, this means that in Port Kembla alone, the biggest steel mill in the country, there will be a decline in the labour force of 2,200 permanent jobs just in Australian Iron and Steel, without taking into account the multiplier effect, in one and a half years. Mr Burgess, the General Manager of the AIS Steel Division, said recently-this received some national publicity-that 3,000 jobs would go in the steel industry over the next 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> If this were happening in the car industry, in textiles or in footwear, the protests would reverberate around the country. But because it is happening in steel, there is silent attrition, the silent loss of employment, and this Government is lamentably silent. We are faced with the loss of 2,200 jobs in one particular area, the Illawarra district. I hope that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) will make some protest about that. I see that he will be speaking next in the debate. The Minister has not done so. In the area of Warilla the Commonwealth Employment Service private statistics show that in February of this year the unemployment registrations for people under 21 were up by 66 per cent on February of last year, and yet we shall have there a situation in which up to 2,200 jobs could be lost, over the 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, Australian Iron and Steel is looking at this from a purely productivity point of view and is saying that this will continue unless it can improve productivity per capita by about 50 per cent. As I have said, that is pretty hard on the workers, because the figures that I have just given are indisputable. There should be means, other than shedding labour, by which productivity can be improved, and that is by the introduction of new technology. The record there is not very good, because at Port Kembla we have seen a new coke ovens battery undertaken for $140m and new extensions to the basic oxygen plant for $150m, but that is not really adequate investment in the biggest steel area in the country when one considers that last year this Government made available $54.4m to the AIS Steel Division in terms of the investment allowance and the depreciation allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> We want to know what is going to happen. Obviously, the steel industry waits on domestic economic recovery. Under this Government it will wait a long time. It is worried because the share of the construction phase of the resources boom that never was has not eventuated, yet this Government still remains silent. We still want the Government to come up--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) will be quiet for a while. He kept on talking when it was my turn, anyway. The honourable member, who is my next door neighbour electorally, naturally is expressing the sort of concern that he should express-I express it also-about the decline in employment in our region as a result of what is happening in the steel industry. The difference between us, of course, is that he, like the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), found the reason for this downturn in employment and production in Port Kembla and other steelworks around Australia as being due to-and I quote the honourable member for Adelaide-'the incompetence and stupidity of the Australian Government'. I wonder whether the honourable member for Adelaide can explain in the same terms the fact that in Sweden the steel industry has just put off 8 per cent of its steel work force permanently, or that in the United States 68,000 steel workers have been laid off and another 22,000 are on short time. I wonder whether it is due to 'the incompetence and stupidity of the Australian Government'-once again to quote the honourable member for Adelaide-that in the European Common Market there has been a fall in employment of 48,000 steel workers in 1981 as a result of consumption going down 11 per cent. In other words, what we have just listened to from the Opposition is utter bunkum. To try to blame the Federal Government for what is happening in the steel industry around the world is typical incredible nonsense from the Opposition, and I am astounded that that kind of line, from men who know the reality of this industry, should proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall take up a couple of points made by the honourable member for Cunningham . It is intriguing to notice that in his introduction he mentioned that industrial disruption was a factor in what had had happened in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Poor industrial relations-I stand corrected. The honourable member shrinks from using the term 'industrial disruption', but that is the accurate description of what has happened. The honourable member for Cunningham, like me, went to talk to the executives of Australian Iron and Steel, in Port Kembla, because both of us are concerned about what is happening there. What interests me is to see that the honourable member comes into the House and curiously decides to omit some of the most significant segments of the briefing that we both received. Let me state what that significant section is. It is that industrial disruption in the six months to last November caused an estimated loss in sales value of $115m from Australian Iron and Steel's Port Kembla plant alone. The tonnage of raw steel lost within the plant itself as a result of internal disputes was 229,581 tonnes. External disputes, such as that extraordinary tug dispute in Port Kembla when the whole port was held up for ages because someone hit someone else on the jaw-they were both employees on a tug; it must have been the most expensive knock to the jaw, including any that Mohammed Ali managed-cost another 230,000 tonnes of raw steel. There was a total loss of production, in the six months only, of almost half a million tonnes of raw steel. Is it not incredible that the honourable member for Cunningham, in joining with the honourable member for Adelaide in saying that it is all the Government's fault, omitted to mention these enormous costs of industrial disruption--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Mr BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What AIS said-I have it written down-was this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We lost the contract because basically price was the major factor in BHP not achieving any of the tonnage. </PARA>
<PARA>It was price. BHP could not compete because of a mixture of things, particularly -I stress this-the incredible volume of industrial disruption which has added enormously to the unit cost of production of steel in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If only the union movement would recognise, in these areas where there are so many ridiculous disputes, the impact of this kind of industrial disruption on the capacity of Australian firms to compete against imports or to compete in export markets, surely then it would realise that it is costing it jobs. The losses of jobs in the steel industry in Australia are partly due-not entirely; I accept that-to the incredible and unnecessary volume of industrial disruption. I think it worth pointing out that as a result of this kind of activity and as a result of the effective competition that has taken place in nations such as Korea, where there is a will to work and a determination to make the industry succeed-we have at present in Australia a delegation from Pohang Steel in Korea- people of those nations find that they are able to compete with Australia. They come here, and they buy their iron ore here-much of it, by the way, from BHP. They buy their coal here. They take it all away to Korea. But because there is greater productivity and greater determination to work, they can produce steel at a price that is relatively so low as compared with Australia's that they can export the finished product back here and undercut us. Certainly there are allegations that to some extent they have an ability to do this because they are dumping the product; they are selling it at artificially low prices. That is the area in which the Government quite rightly can and does intervene. As the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) said, a reference in respect of that kind of problem quite properly is being investigated and being prepared to go to the Temporary Assistance Authority. That is the area in which the Government can and does help. It is also helping in regard to depreciation rates, as the honourable member for Berowra said, in order to try to make this industry more efficient despite the industrial disruption that persistently goes against it and despite the pressure for shorter working hours. At a time when we are being priced out of markets the union movement is deciding that the way to solve this problem is to hike up wage rates and make it even more expensive to produce Australian steel. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at how this policy of getting paid as much as possible for, regrettably, very minimal productivity, has proceeded. I have some charts concerning BHP which illustrate this aspect. They were shown to the honourable member for Cunningham but he chose not to refer to them. They show that in Australia, for example, the index of hourly labour costs has gone up from a base level of 100 to a level of 329-there has been something like 230 per cent rise in BHP's labour costs between 1971 and 1980-while the index for productivity has gone up only 8 per cent. That is the worst record of any of the steel producing nations of the world, except, of course, Britain. We should compare it with Germany, where hourly labour costs have gone up from an index level of 100 to 213. However, productivity per man has gone up from 100 to 136. Throughout the world there are incredible increases in productivity whereas in Australia we have a very modest rise and an enormous rise in costs. It seems to me that while many points about the need for some assistance to the Australian steel industry are accurate, they must be seen in the context that the world market for steel is in disarray and the union movement has yet to recognise that every time it adds to the industry's costs by reckless industrial disruption it is helping to sign the death warrant of thousands of jobs in that industry. </PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourble the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as has already been the case with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That if, as is likely, the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty years leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests .</PARA>
<PARA> That it is also quite clear, on past evidence, that these interests will have the full backing of the Queensland government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government .</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people under its constitutional powers since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your Petitioners' sincere belief that it failed to act in 1976 and thus, failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Excise tariff Act 1921 to enact the excise tariff alterations made by Excise Tariff Proposals No. 3 (1981) and No. 1 (1982). Excise Tariff Proposals No. 3 (1981) were moved in the House on 25 August 1981. These proposals, which operate from 1 July 1981, increased the excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil from $174.08 to $177.53 per kilolitre and on naturally occuring liquefied petroleum gas from $36.67 to $37. 07 per kilolitre. </PARA>
<PARA> Excise Tariff Proposals No. 1 (1982) were moved in the house on 17 February 1982. These proposals, which operate from 1 January 1982, further increase the excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil from $177.53 to $186.26 per kilolitre but reduce the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas from $37.07 to $20.46 per kilolitre. </PARA>
<PARA> The alterations accord with the Government's policy of adjusting the price of indigenous crude oil to world parity, as determined by the Minister for National Development and Energy, on 1 January and 1 July each year. This policy is well established and widely understood by the Australian community. It is based upon sound economic and conservation principles. </PARA>
<PARA> The crude oil levy is an important aspect of the policy. It ensures that a fair share of the income from import parity price adjustments goes to public revenue. Without the levy, taxation would need to be significantly higher in order to finance the services demanded of government and the gains from import parity pricing would go to the oil producers as a windfall profit. The success of the Government's crude oil pricing policy has been based upon its openness, predictability and equitable sharing of income gains. That policy requires that, in the interests of conservation and responsible management of scarce liquid fuel resources, prices of petroleum products be set at realistic levels. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Honourable members will recall that I introduced the Plant Variety Rights Bill 1981 on 7 May last year. I indicated then that it was not my intention to proceed any further with the Bill at that stage as I was keen to give interested people and organisations adequate opportunity to study the proposals. I wanted to encourage informed public debate and therefore improved understanding of the intent of this legislation. I believe such debate has occurred and we are therefore in a position to proceed further with the Bill .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the time between last May and now I have received numerous letters from a wide cross-section of the community on various aspects of the plant variety rights issue. Furthermore, I am aware that a number of seminars have been conducted, and the matter again considered by the Australian Agricultural Council, at its last meeting in Adelaide on 8 February of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Following that meeting I announced my intention to proceed with the legislation . My decision was based on the fact that nine months had passed to allow for public discussion and that there was general support for the scheme in the Agricultural Council from the States of Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. There is also general support from all national rural industry organisations with a direct interest in the legislation, including the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, the Australian United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, the Australian Seed Producers Federation, the Australian Nurserymen 's Association and the Australian Seed Industry Association. I did give an undertaking at the Agricultural Council that I would take into account the views of the States before proceeding further with the legislation, and this has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> The plant variety rights issue has raised considerable interest within the community. I believe a number of points of general concern and misunderstanding remain, on which I would like to comment. Perhaps the most important point to stress about this legislation is that it will be entirely voluntary-in other words, there will be no requirement for a breeder of a new variety to register it under the scheme unless he wishes to do so. Also, the scheme will be open only to new varieties. All existing plant varieties will be ineligible for inclusion. These are fundamental points, which have tended to be overlooked by opponents of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people believe that plant variety rights will give rise to monopoly control of our food supply and restrict public access to plant material. This is not so. As all varieties existing at present will not be eligible for grants of rights, it can be expected that they will continue to be available for any purpose, so long as there is a demand for them. With regard to new varieties registered under the Scheme, the public will be able to reproduce and sell them for food or fuel or manufacturing purposes or other utilitarian purposes which do not involve the actual growing of the plants. The permission of the owner will be required only for the sale of the variety for growing purposes. There are provisions in the Bill to prevent monopolistic practices, in that the owner of a right will be obliged to supply reasonable quantities of the variety at reasonable prices. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most persistent arguments against plant variety rights is that the scheme may lead to takeovers of Australian seed firms by multinational chemical companies. I can only reiterate what I told the House last May: Take-over bids can occur in any business activity, including the seed industry. There is nothing unusual about that in a free enterprise system. However, I am confident that if any takeovers should occur in the Australian seed industry they will in no way be as a direct result of plant variety rights legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the view that the criteria of distinctness, uniformity and stability would encourage the narrowing of the genetic base of commercial plant varieties. Distinctness, uniformity and stability are the universal criteria required for recognition of a new variety irrespective of whether it is a candidate for rights. The same criteria are required by established registers such as the Australian Herbage Cultivar Register, the Oilseeds Register and the Coarse Grains Register. Dependence on uniformity is a trend throughout the world. With efficiency in production being increasingly linked to mechanised handling of a uniform crop and consumer demand for a uniform product, it is a function of modern farming and is not related to plant variety rights. </PARA>
<PARA> A related issue concerns the preservation of plant genetic resources for use in future breeding programs. This is certainly an important issue but it has nothing whatsoever to do with plant variety rights. It is a totally separate issue. Gene banks, or seed collections, particularly for the major crops, are already in existence in Australia and are expanding. Work on improving existing collections and establishing new ones is continuing-but, again, quite separate from plant variety rights. </PARA>
<PARA> It is being claimed by some that with PVR public breeding will decline. However , while there has been a tendency in some European countries for public breeding efforts to be directed increasingly towards basic research, information from New Zealand indicates that PVR has increased the effectiveness of State plant breeders, with more and better varieties being released. My view is that Australian agriculture has been well served by the high quality of its public breeding programs and I can see no reason why this situation will not continue. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fear that farmers and consumers will be forced to pay higher prices for seeds and plants registered under the scheme. While it might be expected that the owner of a right will set a premium on his variety, it must be remembered that farmers will still be free to choose the variety they wish to use. Farmers would buy a patented variety only if it were in their interests to do so. Also, breeding firms will not be successful unless they offer a product which is competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that PVR creates a fundamental injustice toward those countries of the Third World where much of the world's breeding material is derived. This is simply not true. If a Third World country wishes to receive compensation from overseas collectors of wild varieties it is a matter for those countries to pursue. It is not a matter related to the Australian plant variety rights scheme. It should be recognised that the collecting of germ plasm has taken place for years, well before plant variety rights was ever thought of, and is essential to the broadening of the genetic base of our economic plants. </PARA>
<PARA> The view has been expressed that Australian native flora should not be subject to plant variety rights. Let me reiterate that no existing variety of plant, native or otherwise, will be eligible for a grant of rights. Furthermore, no variety which is merely discovered will be eligible. Therefore, all Australian native flora varieties will be ineligible for registration. A variety bred or developed from a native plant could be eligible, but then it would not be part of our native flora. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the establishment of a plant variety rights scheme may not be the best way to stimulate effort in plant breeding. Options open to the Government for stimulating plant breeding have been carefully examined. It was concluded that the most appropriate way to stimulate plant breeding in Australia while also providing access to desired overseas varieties was by the use of plant variety rights which would provide a fair reward for investment by both Australian and overseas breeders. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of merit testing has also had some airing over recent months. Some people appear to be of the view that, in considering the granting of a right, the merit or the quality of the variety should be a criterion for the right. However, the granting of a right to a particular variety in no way implies that the variety is better than an existing one-merely, that it is different. To the best of my knowledge, no other countries with plant variety rights legislation include merit testing as an integral part of the Scheme. I believe it is very much up to the market-place to determine whether one variety is better than another. Coupled with this is the question of a national list of plant varieties which are permitted to be sold. Some European countries do have such lists. However, there is no intention to develop a national list for Australia. This means that there will be no list which regulates or stipulates what plant varieties can be legally sold. </PARA>
<PARA> There have also been claims that the lack of a PVR scheme in Australia has not prevented plant breeders from obtaining breeding material from overseas. There are many examples where requests for overseas varieties have been refused because Australia has not had a PVR scheme. Varieties of nectarines, peaches, cherries, plums, grapes, ornamental plants and some field crops are some examples. Plant variety rights will enable Australia to have access to a far wider variety of plants from overseas, and this must benefit the local industry. It is also nonsense to suggest that PVR will lead to the production of poor quality farm crops that are more susceptible to pests and disease. Farmers and gardeners simply will not buy varieties which are susceptible to pests or disease, when they can continue to buy existing varieties which have already been proven. Neither are breeders going to develop, register and market new varieties which cannot compete in the market-place against existing varieties. </PARA>
<PARA> Claims that PVR will lead to restrictions on public availability of seeds and information are also without foundation. Plant variety rights will encourage investment by breeders in Australia and this must lead to a greater variety of seeds and plants being available. The New Zealand experience in this regard has been an increase in the flow of scientific information and breeding material since PVR was introduced there in the mid-1970s. No decision has been made that Australia become a member of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants-UPOV. Its purpose is to assist member countries with the operation of their schemes by exchange of technical information and to encourage reciprocity arrangements between countries. Membership is entirely voluntary, and it is not seen as necessary for Australia to be a member. This, of course, could be considered at a later stage, if State governments and industry thought it worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of funding, it is intended that ultimately income from fees will meet the cost of administering the scheme. In the meantime, the Commonwealth will accept responsibility for funding, which is estimated initially to be $100,000 a year. Registration fees will be set shortly. It is expected that they will be in line with comparable fees overseas, which are mostly less than $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that the purpose of the Bill is to make possible the granting of proprietary rights, somewhat similar to a grant of patent rights , to people who breed or develop new plant varieties. As a result of the consideration and debate that have been undertaken since last May, a number of changes are proposed to the Bill as it currently stands. These amendments have resulted largely from decisions taken at meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council, from consultations between Commonwealth and State officials, and from representations received from the public. Honourable members will recall that I authorised the circulation of the proposed amendments last month. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most significant amendments calls for the deletion of the sub-clause which currently provides for the scheme to be restricted to cover only horticultural, ornamental and other selected pasture and fodder species. The intention now is that the scheme will be open to any new plant species approved by the Australian Agricultural Council. At the outset no species will be included in the scheme. The fundamental aim of the Bill, nonetheless, remains as it was when initially introduced. That is to say that the scheme, as set out in the Bill, will permit a plant breeder who has developed a new plant variety to apply to a registration authority for the grant of a right to confer sole ownership of that variety on him, if he so wishes. Such rights will allow plant breeders to collect royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> The detail of the amendments can be dealt with individually during the debate and I do not propose to go further into them at present. I thank the House for allowing me to make this statement. I believe this Bill opens up prospects for encouraging greater development of small plant breeding firms in Australia and, therefore, an increase in the number of new plant varieties available and improvements in the efficiency of Australian plant industries. </PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 10 and 11 (1982). </PARA>
<PARA>May I at the outset thank the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) and the House for their indulgence to enable me to move these Customs Tariff Proposals. I am indebted to the honourable member for his assistance. I have moved the Proposals described as Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 10 and 11 (1982) in the terms of the printed proposals which are now being circulated to honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals No. 10 (1982) formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff changes made by Gazette notice during the last recess. These Proposals, which operate from 1 April 1982, contain changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on works trucks, certain mobile machines and pallet trucks. The Government has accepted the broad thrust of the IAC recommendations contained in this report.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government did not, however, accept the long term duty rate of 20 per cent recommended by the IAC for most of the goods under reference. The Government preferred the slightly higher rate of 25 per cent because it will allow for more significant local manufacture with very little resultant cost burden for users; and it is more consistent with the duty levels applying to other goods with similar inputs, technical skills and production processes. In addition, the Government did not accept the recommendation by the IAC to cease licensing restrictions on imports of second hand goods, because of the uncertainty and disruption this could cause to the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall effect of the Government's decision is that tow tractors remain dutiable at minimum rates; fork lift trucks, manual stackers and pallet trucks will be dutiable at 30 per cent for one year before reducing to the long term rate of 25 per cent; other works trucks under reference will be dutiable at 25 per cent on implementation; and import licensing ceases for battery electric works trucks but will continue on used, secondhand and disposal equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 11 (1982), which operate from tomorrow, are new and arise from the Government's decisions on recommendations by the IAC in its reports on fruit and fruit products; miscellaneous edible foodstuffs; and miscellaneous manufacturing (Group G)-Writing and marking equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of fruit and fruit products, the Government has accepted the recommendations by the IAC except in respect of cherries preserved in sugar, for which the period over which rates are to be reduced has been lengthened to allow a more stable adjustment within the industry. The overall effect of the Government's decision on fruit and fruit products is that certain processed fruit products and passionfruit and passionfruit products will reduce to 15 per cent; fruit preserved by sugar, except cherries, will be dutiable at 15 per cent ; cherries preserved in sugar will be dutiable at 30 per cent initially, reducing to 15 per cent over four years; and other fresh or provisionally preserved fruit under reference will be dutiable at minimum rates. Such duties will simplify the Customs tariff and largely maintain current assistance levels.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of miscellaneous edible foodstuffs, the Government has accepted all recommendations of the IAC, subject to a variation in the rates to apply to canned sweet corn. Imports of canned sweet corn from New Zealand, the main source of import competition, will be dutiable at 10 per cent that being the general rate recommended by the IAC. Imports from general country sources will, however, be dutiable at 20 per cent to allow a margin of preference to New Zealand in accordance with the Australia-New Zealand Agreement on tariffs and tariff preferences. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the Government's decision on this report is that macaroni, spaghetti and similar products and textured or hydrolysed vegetable protein will be dutiable at 10 per cent; canned sweet corn will be dutiable at 20 per cent; and other foods under preference will be dutiable at minimum rates. </PARA>
<PARA> Local production of these goods is currently lightly assisted. The continuation of low levels of assistance is considered adequate to encourage efficient local production. In respect of writing and marketing equipment the Government has accepted the recommendations of the IAC except in regard to the phased reduction of rates for typewriter and similar ribbons of textile materials where the Government has lengthened the period over which the rates will reduce to allow a more stable adjustment within the industry. The Government's decision on this report means that: Typewriter and similar ribbons of textile material will be dutiable at 30 per cent initially, reducing to 20 per cent over two years; pens, penholders, propelling pencils, pencils other than slate pencils, ink pads, typewriter and similar ribbons of other than textile material will be dutiable at 20 per cent; and other goods under reference such as sealing or numbering stamps, sealing wax and copying paste will be dutiable at minimum rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The long term rate of 20 per cent for most of these goods will generally maintain the existing levels of assistance. The new duty arrangements will also simplify the Customs tariff by replacing the existing combinations of specific and ad valorem duty applying to some goods and will align assistance levels with related goods. A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not implacably opposed to the Plant Variety Rights Bill 1981, but we have profound doubts about it. We have doubts mainly for agricultural reasons but for many others as well. We are opposed because we are of the opinion that it does not meet Australia's additional plant breeding needs. We are opposed because it will cause a diminution in, if not complete disruption of, present Australian public plant breeding. We are opposed because it poses dangers to Australia's agricultural producing and marketing systems and institutions. We are opposed because it will subject Australian primary producers to inadequately tested so called 'new' varieties bred either locally or introduced from overseas. We are opposed because it does not meet many contemporary scientific and practical qualifications and objections to PVR. We are opposed because it is being introduced at a time when serious questioning of the various plant variety systems in the world is taking place and reviews are under way. We are opposed because there are some fundamental questions as to the world's food and plant genetic resources that need to be answered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today I gave notice of a motion for the formation of a select committee of this House to examine publicly the pros and cons of this very complex and multifaceted issue. The Opposition welcomes the chance for a long debate in the Parliament on this subject. We will be indicating many of our objections to the Bill by moving amendments when we are in the Committee stage. Quite frankly, I must say that the Bill is a dog's breakfast. The Bill should have been withdrawn and reprinted. I find it very hard to deal with when it has 27 amendments, to which I will be moving another 41 amendments. It shows what a mess the Government is in when it presents a Bill which has been on the table for nearly a year and which comes up for debate as two documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments we will be putting are the minimum the Australian Labor Party would accept for this to be a Bill that goes some way to being a Bill that meets Australian agricultural requirements. No doubt most of them will be rejected, but they will indicate very clearly that we are not implacably opposed to any system of plant variety rights. However, the Opposition believes that what we really need first is a proper searching public inquiry-an investigation into Australia's plant breeding needs and deficiencies in our plant breeding organisation, safeguards that will ensure Australian plant growers have a chance of being able to get better seeds and plants and the whole question of alternatives to and the implications of existing PVR schemes. At the outset I must say I have never been so heavily lobbied on any issue in my political life. One or two people have actually written to me in favour of the Bill. I have never spent so much time as I have in reading about PVR, investigating PVR and in talking to people for and against PVR. I am still learning of new aspects to the question and will not cover one-twentieth of what I would like to say on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not just an agricultural Bill. The groups and individuals opposed to the Bill range from fringe loonies-those people who generally vote for the National Country Party-to alternative lifestylers, theologians, botanists, scientists, ideologists, consumers, conservationists and the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations. One can have doubts or be opposed to the Bill on ideological, philosophical, theological as well as scientific and practical grounds. I respect most points of view in this category as being as legitimate and valid as I do the ideologies in favour of PVR. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many views in opposition that, frankly, I do not understand. Some views are quite crazy. Some views are mistaken. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has spoken of some of those today. Some views are overstressed. Some views are misplaced. Some views reflect ideological or hypothetical arguments which have little to do with PVR per se, but I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the views of the orthomolecular nutritionists who have written to me are just as firmly held as those who want PVR to make more money, and who are not concerned with any wider issue. The views I will be putting by way of opposition or qualification concern agriculture. I will leave it to other honourable members to canvass wider but possibly more peripheral arguments for and against. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot deny that there are many people working in agriculture who are opposed to the Bill. The Bill was held up because the Country Party Minister in Western Australia and the Western Australian Department of Agriculture were opposed to it. I have been told that Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia are not really that keen for cereals to be specified species under the proposed Act. Farmer organisations still have strong reservations about the Bill. Many people in the rural establishment are opposed to the Bill-off the record. The fact that the Minister will bring forward 27 amendments to a Bill that has been about 11 years in the making is evidence of the many doubts about the Bill in the Australian Agricultural Council and the qualifications agriculturalists and technicians have seen as necessary before the Bill could even be presented for debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill, if amended, will still not meet all the objections of people in favour of PVR. Many more nurserymen have written to me opposed to the Bill than in favour. Of Australia's 28 to 30 public cereal breeders at least 10 are either vociferously opposed to the Bill or have serious doubts for a range of reasons. I can mention names such as Sparrow, Pugsley, Rathjen, Hollamby, Gladstone, et cetera, as public plant breeders strongly opposed to PVR. In the United States, the National Farmers Union and the National Sharecroppers Fund oppose PVR. Norman Borlog, an eminent United States plant breeder and Nobel Peace Prize winner, is opposed to PVR. CIMMYT, the international maize and wheat improvement centre in Mexico, does not recognise the right of any country or organisation to apply for exclusive breeders' rights on material produced in its program. It is only now in the United States that an independent evaluation of PVR is being carried out, by the University of Wisconsin. New Zealand has recently deleted some important items from its PVR lgislation. </PARA>
<PARA> People in and elements of the scientific community are both for and against the Bill for a range of scientific, institutional and philosophical reasons. I have had only one farmer write to me in favour of the Bill. Hundreds have written in opposition. Several farm groups have written opposing parts of the Bill, but it is true that most agricultural organisations now accept PVR, even if in a qualified way. No-one disagrees that we need to assess thoroughly Australia's plant breeding needs and that the future of plant breeding in this country is very important. There is great potential and exciting technologies are in the offering. It is a topic that we really do need to take on board very seriously from an agricultural point of view. I have been driven to near desperation by thousands of people writing in opposition-ranging from cliched predictability to tirades of abuse. Only three people or groups have written to me in favour of the Bill. Even then I had to seek out the main proponents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is complex but plant variety rights are even more complex and raise fundamental questions which cannot be blandly dismissed by thinking people. I have given all these qualifications to my views because I hope that the Government does not simply label any opposition as being always ill-placed or simply ideological. I put it to the House that the Australian Labor Party has never considered an agricultural issue in as much depth as it has this one. I hope that the Minister will actually enter the debate rather than simply read speeches or repeat his Department's comments. This is a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> In a nutshell PVR is about giving patent rights to plant breeders for new varieties of plants. The scheme is voluntary and applies only to new varieties. The ostensible motivation behind the scheme in Australia is to encourage private plant breeding. The main difference between the proposal and patents for things such as drugs is that the material is living and one can engage in semantic argument as to what is an invention. As much of the capitalist developed and communist worlds have plant breeders or plant variety right systems, it is held that Australia is being denied access to varieties that grow well in overseas environments and may grow well here. It can be seen that the Bill is about plant breeding in Australia and about plant buying from overseas. On the face of it, it is reasonable to point out that PVR will lead to more plant breeding because a right will grant a quasi-monopoly and therefore there is an incentive for new entrants to enter the plant breeding field despite the very high cost of entry. It is assumed that more breeding equals better breeding. Also, due to the fact that our market is small for many species, little work is being carried out. It will advantage particularly horticulturalists if new varieties can be introduced . </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition accepts that both these propositions may be true. We accept that horticulturalists, floriculturalists and nurserymen are being denied access to varieties due to the requirements and practices of overseas patent rights holders. However, there are several qualifications that need to be discussed with respect to introduced varieties. Firstly, while a variety may grow well overseas there is no guarantee that it will do as well in our environment. For example, there is no sense in growing red chief apple here if it proves to be not as good as other varieties, or it turns brown. A nurseryman is not particularly interested in whether a variety is objectively better so long as it is different; what he is concerned about is diversity. This is not so for people wishing to earn a living from the new plant variety they have bought. In other words there is a need for a commercial and environmental test and in some instances a nutritional test. Also, if horticulturalists such as vegetable growers gain access to a higher yielding variety and it is subsequently shown that it yields higher in the Australian environment, it does not follow that the grower will gain all the potential benefit. Many vegetable growers are bound by contract to processors and any economic benefit will be shared in an economically competitive system by producer, processor, wholesaler, retailer and perhaps the consumer. Also, it is possible that it will be the processor- integrator who buys a right and, for example, by controlling it, denies potato growers, other than those contracted to him, the variety. </PARA>
<PARA> There are factors other than variety that affect the commercial situation of orchardists. Even if there are varieties of apples so good that orchardists are unwise not to grow them, it does not follow that they will make more money or that they will be attracted to growing that variety. For example, at present in Australia we are pulling out apple trees due to the fact that previous markets, particularly the European market, are denied to us. As it will take ten years really to test how much better a new unknown variety is, it is uncertain that there will be real benefits. The nursery trade will certainly reap windfall profits if certain nurserymen gain the right to a redder rose or a greener pot plant-or things which I do not think there is any need for a test on. But not all nurserymen will have access as it will be sensible commercial practice to give quasi-monopoly rights to a handful of Australian nurserymen- propagators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Science and the Evironment recently investigated the nursery industry in Australia from the point of view of the export potential for foliage plants. The report was brought down quite recently in 1982. At no place in the report were plant variety rights mentioned as a needed incentive for a business which is, fortunately, doing well and has been expanding rapidly. The more evident possible benefits for horticulturalists were the main reason why my colleagues, the Honourable Jack Hallam and the Honourable Dr Julian Amos, were concerned that the Australian Agricultural Council discuss alternatives in more depth. The fact that the original Bill was basically only for horticultural varieties is evidence that the Government-or the Australian Agricultural Council -was of the view that we may have a restricted PVR system and thereby potentially gain most benefit. This would have been a naive approach. I stress that overseas varieties, to be used in commercial Australian agriculture, cannot revolutionise our plant production although many people see great gain from it. Qualifications need to be put forward and I will put forward some of them. We need to have commercial varieties which have determined yield, disease-resistant and environment-specific qualities which meet the demands of our market. For new varieties to meet these criteria they will need testing, either formally or by some reliable procedure. After six years of PVR in New Zealand there were rights for only 23 varieties-17 were for roses and six for barley. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to the Opposition's views on the main purpose of this Bill; that is, plant breeding as opposed to plant buying. When I was in the United Kingdom earlier this year I was told by Mr Murphy, the man in charge of Britain's PVR system, that his country's system was mainly about cereals and that, unlike Australia, most growers buy their seed each year. I might add that the British system covers many of the Opposition's objections to the Bill. But the Government is not proposing the British system which has safeguards and which was designed to guarantee a place for public plant breeding and a proper comprehensive system of performance testing so that farmers know that new varieties are better. If the Government should quote the evaluative work of Silvey on British PVR, there are many qualifications that the Opposition would like to put forward. The fundamental thing is that Britain is different from Australia. When I saw the main proponent group in Australia about PVR I was told that its main motive was to get into open pollinated varieties-cereals and field and pasture species-where large potential markets exist. The Australian market is too small for an intensive breeding effort for species such as, for example, radishes. What the group is interested in is propagation of seeds and breeding new varieties where there is a big market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's most trenchant agricultural opposition to this Bill concerns cereal breeding and our belief that PVR will not meet the needs of Australian cereal growers nor the requirements of our marketing and agricultural institutions as it is now proposed. PVR will probably cause only disruption to our present highly developed and largely successful public cereal breeding institutions. If all this Bill is about is a cynical pragmatic device to gain plant material that we cannot buy-everyone is assuming but not saying that private cereal breeding will not take place-it is a dangerous sledgehammer to crack an indeterminable nut. But I do not think it is just about a cynical exercise. I think some people do think that they can get into the cereal breeding game. </PARA>
<PARA> I will set out some of the ALP's more general opposition on agricultural grounds to the Bill as well as the specifics of cereal breeding. No appropriately representative group has publicly deliberated on Australia's plant breeding needs, the deficiencies in our plant breeding effort and how we should best go about meeting those deficiencies. I am told that the matter has been discussed by technicians and public servants for the past 11 years. But it has been almost entirely a private commercial approach to a very complex matter involving governments which want to get out of spending money and technologists who quite sensibly want to experiment with new systems and methods. The public interest has not been involved where it is clearly required to be expressed. We do not know what alternatives to PVR have been debated over the past decade or whether anyone really believes that PVR is the only solution. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major qualification is that the public plant breeding programs that have served Australia so well, particularly for cereals, need to be protected and upgraded and guarantees of continued public plant breeding need to be given by the AAC. The State Governments command high ground in plant breeding. Only one Minister, an outgoing one, has given any such guarantee and in conversations I have had with State department officials there is a belief that the tendency is for State governments to want to spend less, not more money. For example, the Tasmanian Government has got out of some species in its breeding programs. An approach recently by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation to levy more funds for wheat breeding research was not reciprocated by the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is an impossible demand to require any politician or government to give a guarantee to maintain a level of funding. People would be sorely disappointed. But there is a more basic problem with this Government. Who could trust this Government in terms of any guarantee it gives in respect of spending on public programs? It has got out of the soil conservation area. It is getting out of research and extension. It is putting the screws on the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. A Senate committee is presently inquiring into spending on research. In any area one looks-extension, science and research and development-the government is trying to get out of any public obligation. Quite frankly, the Opposition probably would not even believe anything said by the Fraser Government on those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get back to wheat breeding. Australia's present wheat breeding programs are very institutionally bound. We have a system of varietal control administered by the State governments that conduct most of our public plant breeding. The breeding is intrinsically bound with performance testing, quantitative and qualitative assessment and comparison with existing varieties. Varieties are bred and adapted for our various environments. For example, one can point to the release of new varieties in Western Australia and to a grain varietal conference in Queensland. The latest edition of Wheat Australia details four new wheat varieties in Western Australia which were registered for sowing in the low rainfall northern, north central and central areas of the State. The varieties developed by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture are wialki, eradu, canna and bodallin. That publication goes on to give their characteristics and variety. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria, a significant advance in breeding wheat for resistance to cereal cyst nematode (or eelworm) has been made at the Victorian Crops Research Institute with the development and release of the variety katyil. </PARA>
<PARA>A conference was recently held by the Queensland growers on new guidelines for breeders. I have an edition of their newspaper of 7 April. Again Queensland farmers have released a set of priorities. The conference took a lot of time pointing out that wheat breeding must be guided by market requirements, that there should be uniform sized shape, that no single variety should dominate and that there should be seasonal tolerance. It also points out what resistances should be desirable. If one looks at the present situation and at what a wheat breeder has to go through with the existing system, one sees that a massive document has to be produced containing all the test results before the State Government will release the variety; and then only for certain areas. There are virtual monopolies in grain handling which are required to engage in tests of quality and type to make segregations for the monopoly wheat marketer-the Australian Wheat Board. The system is very institutionally bound. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is proposing that a system be set up which will allow private breeders or overseas companies to introduce varieties not necessarily tested in any way but only required to pass criteria requiring the seed to be distinct, uniform and stable. At present wheat breeders in Australia have to submit new varieties to very exhaustive tests. I have already pointed to 13 pages of documentation for one such new variety that did not get up. The distinct uniform and stable criteria test discourages diversity and many of Australia's outstanding varieties would not have passed this test. I agree with some of the things the Minister said today about that but I still want to point out that while it can be argued that the scheme is voluntary I believe growers would be reluctant to purchase a variety which is neither distinct, uniform, stable nor properly tested. Testing is essential, as the boil smut incident with maize has demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA> Disruption could be caused to our public plant breeding institutions for a range of reasons. From correspondence I have been given between the Minister and some of these people, I can see that he still does not understand their fears. Disruption can be caused if breeders are approached by private firms and if private breeders take material freely available from public institutions and simply make one small change to it. Disruption could be caused to the present free interchange of plant material, ideas and techniques. There is evidence from overseas that private breeders are reticent to speak at industry, scientific or academic conferences. Industries in Australia that are limited by some geographic, institutional or environmental factor are already well set up for plant breeding by a combination of grower liaison and funding by public and private bodies. For example, the rice, sugar, cotton and tobacco industries have plant breeding systems that meet their needs. Why should a system be imposed that potentially exposes the industries to additional costs?</PARA>
<PARA> The people who put it to me that they wanted to get into some of these areas say that if they could get the royalties that would be a real incentive to get into cereal breeding. In Australia about one per cent of the wheat planted each year is bought. It costs about $300 a tonne. If a 5 per cent royalty is put on to that we get about enough to pay and set up one plant breeder. We already have 25 plant breeders. This is the reason why there is so much worry. Public plant breeders are concerned at the effects PVR would have on breeding programs. It is thought it will distort the allocation of breeding resources away from basic research into applied research to give short term results. This would mean a long term loss in diversion in funds away from basic programs, for example, disease and climatic resistance. At present Australian plant growers are obtaining plant varieties by a range of mechanisms besides public plant breeding which allow commercial entrepreneurs to gain profits. The practices of price discrimination, control of outlets, advertising and market lead all allow this. Practices such as certification, royalities and licensing all allow access to material. Hybridisation gives inbuilt PVR. The whole question of the promise of biotechnology is not one that can be properly encompassed by this Bill. But it is important to realise what the potential is and how this may affect future optimum plant breeding systems in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Many hypothetical economic arguments against the Bill have been put up and they are hard to deal with. However, it is feasible to suggest that monopolisation and denial of choice may occur because existing economic-market pressures are causing this to occur in all other industries. United States experience shows that while there has not been absolute monopolisation a handful of the larger companies gain nearly all the rights for many grain, field and pasture crops. As PVR implies quasi-monopoly, it is reasonable to suggest that if a variety did give a yield increase of 20 per cent and was suitable in every other way a firm would be inclined to make four releases somehow guaranteeing a yearly increase of 5 per cent each time. That would be sensible commercial practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of consumer protection and the legal position of people contesting rights as well as the legal implications of patent law have been raised with me. The Senate reviewed our existing industrial patent law and raised severe doubts about its advisability. One does not really know what will happen until the Act is in force. But, for example, I would not want to be a small plant breeder engaged in litigation with the Shell Co. of Australia Ltd. The whole question of costs and public plant breeding needs to be addressed. I am of the view that one of the main benefits of the PVR debate may be to highlight the need for a lot more effort in new directions for plant breeding and in the acquisition and holding of more basic genetic material. I think for a long time this has been a suggestion by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The collections Australia holds at present are only large for wheat and a few other crops. At present growers pay levies for some of their public plant breeding programs. If private breeders do provide alternative varieties, why should growers be expected to pay both a levy and a royalty?</PARA>
<PARA> While I do not believe that multinational oil, chemical and fertiliser companies will necessarily breed chemical and fertiliser dependent varieties I am sure they will not give pest and disease resistance as high a priority as yield; that is, quality may decline. The Minister has canvassed that today and many arguments have been put forward about the dangers of multinationals, monopolisation and problems for the Third World with PVR. While I hold no great faith in the propriety and humanity of the actions of multinationals-one can instance numerous cases of irresponsibly launched chemical products or the case of the sale and promotion of milk formula which allegedly caused the death of a million children in the Third World-I do not see how Australia's adoption of PVR will necessarily change anything. </PARA>
<PARA> I will sum up some of my arguments with respect to plant breeding for agriculture. There is a high potential benefit from plant breeding. For instance a one per cent increase for some crops could bring a 4 per cent increase in profits. But there is a need for careful yield comparisons throughout Australia and wheat gains are more problematical. High rates of improvement are possible at present for oats, barley, rapeseed and lupins. But the gains are not necessarily permanent due to disease or pest resistance breakdown and therefore there is a need for breeding to be carried out on a wide front. That is what our systems have been set up to do. To be fully effective plant breeding has to be conducted as a long term continuing program-up to 10 years to 15 years. For example, the Western Australian varieties I mentioned a moment ago have been 14 years in the making. We do not want cosmetic breeding; we want thorough plant breeding programs. Genetic engineering does not help a great deal. There is a need for varieties matched more specifically to particular environments. The quality, particularly for export, is a major concern for Australian primary production. Therefore, there is not only yield. This Bill emphasises only distinct uniform stable criteria and does not talk about performance testing. I understand the reason for this is that merit testing is not envisaged in Australia because it is too costly and difficult to determine merit under the diversity of environmental conditions in Australia. The State governments do not want to look at it in a formal way and the Federal Government is not going to pick up the can. But I still say that the growers, particularly the cereal growers, want some idea of what they are buying and not just a pig in a poke. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said today that there is no intention to establish a national list . I guess we will have to wait and see what will happen. But over 90 per cent of seed sold to United Kingdom farmers in 1979 was on the recommended lists. What we are worried about is that farmers will be presented with a plethora of information on varieties which are only marginally different-for example, different coloured flowers. This emphasis on distinctness, uniformity and stability is one of our major worries. We are worried that a lower priority will be given to other characteristics in the breeding program, such as disease resistance or productivity increases. The English breeders have said that the rate of yield improvement has been halved in this way. They also have said that it is easy to produce, in large numbers, new varieties which differ just enough in superficial characteristics to qualify as distinct for plant variety rights purposes and which are at least not clearly inferior to the parent and other existing varieties. They pointed out that much commercial breeding in Europe is of this type. That suffices in Europe because, as I have said, particularly for cereals, most people buy their seed every year. </PARA>
<PARA> The uniformity requirement presents a worry with respect to delays in release. Single plant selection has to be continued for two or three further generations. As an example, the release in Australia of Warigal wheat, which is known to be heterogeneous, has been delayed to achieve uniformity. The estimated loss to Western Australian growers in 1981 alone is $6m. The Minister referred to the claim and said that there is no risk of loss of genetic diversity. But it has been said to me that breeders have been tempted to choose for plants they are breeding parent stocks with generally similar characteristics in order to shorten the time of development and to achieve homozygosity more rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> I leave the subject of distinctness, uniformity and stability and turn to the matter of consumer protection. Some elements of this are covered in the Bill, but farmers will receive much commercial information and little real information . I think we can say that no farmer can reasonably expect to evaluate critically a new crop variety in the initial years. For the reasons I have outlined I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-submitted when it and other relevant matters have been considered by a select committee of the House of Representatives because the Bill does not meet Australia's plant breeding needs, will cause disruption to, if not a diminution in, public plant breeding, will pose dangers to Australia's agricultural producing and marketing institutions, will subject Australia's primary producers to inadequately tested ''new'' and introduced varieties, will not meet scientific and practical objections to existing forms of plant variety rights systems and may affect Australia's role in the preservation of the world's food and genetic plant resources'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must initially apologise to the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) for missing the early part of his speech. I was not aware that this matter would be debated quite so early in the day. I guess it is true to say that, as was prophesied, in his notice of motion earlier today, he is seeking to employ what we can only regard as another delaying mechanism in relation to the passage of this Bill. The facts are that this Bill has been requested by plant breeding experts and establishments for nearly 10 years. The Bill was introduced by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) some 12 months ago. It has lain on the table for all that time. Many people in the community have pondered on the Government's delay in introducing a Bill so vital to the Australian plant breeding establishment, to Third World countries to which we provide food and to a wide variety of agriculturalists, particularly those involved in the vegetable, horticultural and general pasture seed growing sections of the industry-that is not to omit by any means the cereal growers. Put in perspective, what I say is quite correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We now have to put up with this delaying mechanism. If I understand properly the remarks of the honourable member for Werriwa, the majority of members of the proposed House of Representatives select committee referred to in his amendment are to be Government members. There is little doubt that after a lapse of time this House would come down in favour of the Bill. That, of course, is not the problem. The problem is what will happen to the legislation in another place. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8C7">Mr GILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may well be. I anticipate that the honourable member for Hunter is optimistic enough to think that some alterations may be made in this House. I do not look on that as a practical possibility. Therefore, what we have before us is what is known in parliamentary circles as a pious amendment. That usually means that an Opposition cannot quite make up its mind whether it is opposed to or supports something. Let there be no doubt that this is what is commonly known in the trade union of parliamentarians as a pious amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was not able to note all of the matters at which the honourable member for Werriwa suggested the committee should look. However, the first matter that I did write down was the suggestion that the committee should consider whether this legislation meets Australia's needs. Surely there is no doubt about that. The merit of this Bill to the Australian seed and plant industries and to the Australian community is quite clear. If honourable members care to look at item (i) of the Minister's blue covered brief they will see a list of species of new plant varieties grown in the world today that are not available to the Australian producer and, in many cases, are not available to the Australian plant breeder. That list is growing longer as every day passes. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Bill is not passed we will effectively deprive this nation of a right to receive hundreds of new species of crops, grasses, shrubs, flowers and fruit trees from countries that currently have those species and have plant variety rights legislation. Speaking from memory-I have not checked this-22 countries have plant variety rights legislation. Any move to defeat this Bill either in this House or in another place would deprive this nation of very valuable new species and small farmers, big farmers and medium sized farmers would be condemned to the dust bowl, if I might use a slightly exaggerated phrase. There is a great need for this nation, which exports the produce of plants, such as cereals, and animals which are fed on plant species and grasses, to keep up to date with its competitors. Any move to defeat this Bill will affect that objective. There is a lack of plant varieties and, as I have said, the list is growing longer every day. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter that is of prime importance is this: Experience has shown quite clearly that investment in the industry has increased greatly in countries which have plant variety rights legislation. In some cases investment in growing plant seeds is up to three times what it was prior to the introduction of PVR. If we defeat the Bill here we will deprive a new and vital industry within Australia of the ability to grow. Surely that is of great regard to any members of parliament who have the interests of this nation at heart. Overseas experience shows quite clearly that such legislation encourages investment in plant breeding generally, right across the board. The higher number of new species has significantly increased yield and quality, increased disease resistance and increased beauty in the case of roses, shrubs and trees. Furthermore, for those who are interested in indigenous wild flowers and species of that sort, work done in the United Kingdom has increased markedly the capacity of that country to reintroduce reclamation work on its indigenous wild flower species. We do not worry about that at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The example of overseas countries shows that the strong-minded environmentalist quite clearly supports added investment in plant breeding activity. I am perpetually asked this sort of question: Will this yield apply to wheat in Australia? Honourable members will recall that a few minutes ago I dealt with wheat at the bottom of a list of species. The answer to the question is quite clear. In this country we grow wheat with a high alkaline pH. At this stage in our development we do not grow wheat with a high acidity pH. Our species of wheat, therefore, are geared to grow in alkaline soil reactions. Our export wheat industry, which is faced with huge costs of transport to overseas markets, does not and, I think, never will reply on huge doses of fertilisers in order to increase its yield. The use of superphosphate and nitrogenous fertiliser in the cereal growing industry in this country is comparatively small. I suggest that it will remain so. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads me immediately, of course, to the question of the impetus that will be given to wheat breeding in this country in future, over and above the public sector wheat breeding that currently occurs. This is only a matter of judgment but the answer probably is comparatively little in that major industry. When we move to growing wheat in safer areas, higher rainfall areas-rainfall areas where the soil reaction is inclined to be acid-it will lead possibly to the use of new wheats from Europe and other areas. I think of the more acid soils of Victoria where currently not wheat but oats are grown. Oats have been bred in this country for adaptability to soil type, but wheat has not. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another question which I am constantly asked: Why are some plant breeders in Australia against plant variety rights? I think the first point I should make is that some years ago the vast majority of plant breeders in Australia probably were against plant variety rights. Today I know of only two. No doubt if one hunted around one would find others. I do not think that plant breeders should be against plant variety rights. A bit of healthy competition will not hurt the better plant breeders. On the experience of other nations it is obvious that new varieties will increase the productivity of Australian farmers. There is little doubt of that. I suspect that some breeders want to protect their own positions. They are funded by the public purse, by the taxpayers, and I think that some of them do not fancy the idea of competition. </PARA>
<PARA> The next question I am commonly asked is this: Will worthless varieties be foisted on farmers? All I can say is that those people who ask this question do not have the respect for farmers that I have. The farmers' livelihoods are at stake. Cold, hard judgment will be exercised before any new varieties are planted extensively. Farmers will want to look over the fence before planting or purchasing new varieties. They will probably then plant seed trial strip. One can ignore that type of attack on the legislation. Another question I have been asked is: Will poor varieties of seed be sold to farmers because of the impact of advertising? As I see it, there will be no change in the position after the introduction of plant variety rights. An option to purchase is available now. I hope that option always remains. A former member for Wakefield, Bert Kelly, used to say that he respected the right of his cockies to go broke in any way they saw fit. I do not go so far as that but farmers today have the option to grow what varieties they wish. </PARA>
<PARA> At a seminar on Monday which was attended by three members of the Australian Labor Party-I thank those who attended-an Australian Democrat senator and members of the Liberal and National Country parties we heard from one farmer who grows a Tasmanian wheat in the middle of New South Wales. That is his judgment. In his view he does better. Surely, that is what this matter is all about. Farmers and gardeners buy the seed which they judge most suitable to their climatic and soil conditions. In this island continent, we have nearly every possible soil condition and nearly every possible climatic condition. There is need for diversity. If it is rare for a New South Wales farmer to grow a wheat which is bred in Tasmania, does that not point to the need for diversity? Does that not point to the fact that we need a greater number of varieties to cope with the wide scope of environmental conditions in Australia? Of course it does. The experience of every other country, including small countries such as the United Kingdom, is that that is precisely what happens. </PARA>
<PARA> The next question I am asked by the growers is: 'Can we buy the seed we used to buy?' The answer is that of course they can. The plant variety rights legislation deals only with new varieties. Old varieties will still be available for anyone who wants them. The next question I am asked is: What happens to wheat farmers when they breed their own seed? I am concentrating on wheat for the moment. I am asked whether a patent right allowed for a new variety prohibits the common habit of Australian wheat farmers of growing the seed for the planting of next season's crop? There should be no such worry. Provision for that situation is built into the legislation if any honourable member wishes to have a look at it. Total approval for that process is written into the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the argument put by various anti-plant variety rights groups that international firms are likely to control food production. There is a dim possibility that that could be so with food genetics-seeds. But to talk of it in terms of food production is surely absurd. It is surely an absurd proposition. We could rephrase that question and ask: Is there any fear that big international firms will control seed distribution and seed breeding? The answer is that there is no evidence from the 22 countries involved that that is occurring. The nearest one could get to that situation is probably in the United States. One could perhaps argue also that co-operative breeding establishments in England have geneticists and plant breeders all over the world working on new varieties. In that case, of course, it is not a multinational involvement, it is not the involvement of a frightful big American company. In fact, a group of farmers is involved. If one looks at the situation right across the world one realises that the greatest involvement is from small nurserymen. </PARA>
<PARA> The next question I am asked is: Who is going to pay the royalties that will be given to big firms or indeed to small nurserymen? The straight answer to that question is that, so far as I am aware, under this system there will be no royalties. I think people are confusing royalties with a sum payable by a plant breeder who wants to register a new seed. As I see it, there will be no royalties under the Australia legislation. Quite clearly the process will be as follows: Someone invents a new species. He goes to the Registrar and says that he has a new species that he wants to register. His application is then put before a meeting of the Agricultural Council, which comprises all State Ministers and the Federal Minister for Primary Industry, to see whether that variety, be it apricot or wheat, will be accepted. At this stage this Bill does not register anything. Registration will be done in response to applications as they are received. Those who have studied the New Zealand legislation will know that the New Zealanders started with roses and barley. </PARA>
<PARA> What happens is that the plant breeder who has a patent right over a variety breeds it up. He then puts it on the market. He does not put it on the market at a price so high that nobody will buy it. He puts on the market at a price which growers can afford. Growers will buy it only if they know that it has disease resistance. They will buy it only if they know it will give them increased productivity. I refer honourable members to a very good, albeit hard-hitting, speech by Hugh Roberts, a former Nuffield scholar in agriculture from Cootamundra. He cited the example of Brussels sprouts. A farmer in the United Kingdom might pay 20 times as much for a new variety of seed but because the yield is so much greater he finishes up a ton of Brussels sprouts per acre better off than he would have had he bought the normal variety. But that is in the area of the farmer's judgment. The market-place will decide whether the price of some fancy thing is too high, and the market-place will establish whether it will sell. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to touch on just two or three of the arguments that I have heard. In the last few minutes I should just like to say this: It should be quite clear to Parliament that some of the most exciting prospects in the world in this decade, and in the next one, are in the area of plant breeding. The decades of the 1960s and 1970s were those of chemical control-undue use of weedicides and pesticides. The next few decades will be involved in biological control, and they will be involved in the most exciting bit of plant breeding that we can imagine-new species requiring less chemical control and less fertiliser. It is quite clear from the experience of other countries that plant variety rights is giving impetus to this very trend. We must encourage this trend away from the use of chemical control wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA> What is in the offing? First of all, more species available for a wider diversity of environments; secondly, disease resistance; thirdly, high yields based on that disease resistance and based on higher yielding varieties themselves; and fourthly, a possible saving in fertiliser usage and in chemical treatments, and therefore in costs. Last year for instance, for the first time, there was a cross soya bean-sunflower. It lived for just over two months. It was the first example of a self-fertilising cereal. Does that not mean something to our capacity to feed ourselves and those countries that cannot feed themselves? This will be the most exciting era of innovation, that I believe can materially alter the farming scene in Australian-if Parliament passes the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> If Parliament does not pass the Bill, those voting against it will really stand condemned, and rightly so, by not only the community at large but, more particularly, by those who have been in touch with the sort of reality that I have tried to describe during the last few minutes. If the Bill does not pass, they will condemn small farmers and medium farmers and the type of innovation and technological advance which will keep them abreast of farmers in the rest of the world. I count there cereal farmers, small horticulturists, vegetable growers, nursery men specialising in flowers, shrubs, trees and wild flowers, and the regeneration projects that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the debate which will ensue, not only in this House but also in the other place, will not be a debate that becomes fringed out in sometimes irrelevant detail-or as others might say, with relevant detail. I hope that the thrust of the Bill, which is a very responsible Bill and has the enormous weight of evidence on its side, will be rationally accepted by members of parliament in both Houses. I support the Bill and shall vote against the only amendment of which I am aware at this stage, that moved by the honourable member for Werriwa. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This very deep and complicated piece of legislation has created enormous interest throughout the whole of Australia. The public debate generated by the legislation is only just beginning. We have just heard the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) telling us how long the legislation sat on the table and that there has been time for public debate. I challenge that view strongly. Clear evidence about this is very apparent when one considers that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has seen fit to put forward some 27 amendments to the original Bill which he introduced on 7 May 1981. It has been argued that sufficient time has been allowed for informed debate to take place. However, the 27 amendments were introduced only in March of this year-only three weeks ago. Every honourable member has been receiving reams of mail from people-some informed, some misinformed. The public is taking an enormous interest in this issue-much more than the farming community has up to the present. It concerns me that the Bill is going through the House at this stage and we appear to have a strong interest coming from the public sector and very little from the farming sector. The farming community is very much unaware of what this legislation really means. In fact, I contend that it is not the farmers who are pushing to have this legislation introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister has provided a kit to assist honourable members in the debate on the issue. While the kit has been of some assistance, it has by its very presentation provided a good case on administration grounds for the need to withdraw the Bill and re-submit it when other relevant matters have been considered. The Minister has not even provided a clear one-piece document on the Bill which includes the amendments that he proposes to his original Bill. There seems to be an urgent rush to have the legislation dealt with, even to the extent that we cannot put together one document on the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Considering the importance and the implications of this Bill for the future, it is amazing that those of us who have to consider the Bill are not even in the position of being able to receive a document from the Government which clearly indicates what it proposes. We have to go from one document back to the amended document to find out just what the Minister is on about. By his own actions he has admitted that the Bill, in breaking new ground, is creating problems. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), in his reply to the Minister's speech, has outlined the major issues which concern the Opposition. Our opposition is not based on way-out reasons which cannot be substantiated. Some of the debate taking place in the community lacks credence, but the majority of it coming through from the public is very good and very solid, and needs to be aired. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to canvass some of the reasons why we on this side of the House wish to see the Bill withdrawn and re-submitted when all the relevant matters have been considered. The first and most logical reason is that we have 40-odd amendments to the Bill based on research that the Opposition has been able to collate. There is every reason why this Bill should be withdrawn and re- submitted in a more logical form in the future. Let me take some points. First, does the Bill meet Australia's plant breeding needs? What are those needs? Are they in cereals, which is a major seed area involving major export products? Or is the Bill designed to help in the areas of vegetables and horticulture and in other areas?</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wakefield clearly indicated that wheat was not the major reason for the Bill. The major export product from this country in the agricultural scene is not the major reason for the Bill being presented. A survey of the varieties of species listed by the Minister in his kit which are at present denied to Australia clearly does not show a deficiency in the cereal growing variety. Our major crops are very well funded with public plant breeding and will continue to be so and should be protected. The honourable member for Wakefield admitted that wheat itself was not to be a major ingredient of the Bill. He said that we would not be going in for strong fertiliser and nitrogenous approaches to our planting of wheat, and he could not see that changing in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Murray said, we have not got one irrigated wheat in this country. Looking at the wheat situation and the costs involved, I do not think that expensive irrigation water could be envisaged as being used for wheat at this stage. Plant variety rights, as envisaged by the Bill, by creating a diminution in public plant breeding, particularly under a Liberal Government, could have a deleterious effect on Australia's agricultural scene. There is no clear evidence that PVR as envisaged at present will generate the development of new plant varieties which will benefit Australia or Australians to any noticeable degree. At this stage I should like to take issue with some of the information provided in the information kit supplied by the Minister. I draw attention to section J-the overseas experiences regarding PVR. This section purports to summarise:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most recent information concerning PVR provided to the Department of Primary Industry from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading 'United Kingdom' reference is made to a report by Mr Murphy, the comptroller of PVR at Cambridge in the United Kingdom, in a 1980 United Kingdom report by a Mrs V. Sylvie. After mentioning the big improvements in yield in wheat in the United Kingdom since 1947, the Minister's kit includes the following:</PARA>
<PARA>and of this by far the largest part of increase in yield appears to be the result of improved varieties as opposed to husbandry techniques. It is impossible to say with certainty what the contribution of the plant breeders right system has been but the implication is that it has been substantial. </PARA>
<PARA>I turn to the actual statement made by Mr Murphy in his address to the symposium on genetic resources. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to say with absolute certainty what the contribution of the plant breeders' rights system has been--</PARA>
<PARA>The words which follow in the Minister's document, 'but the implication is that it has been substantial', were not quoted by Mr Murphy but were placed there by the Minister to add credence to his case for PVR. I believe that was a rather shoddy means of providing information to members of Parliament. I now quote from the section of Mr Murphy's paper to which the Minister added his extra wording for maximum effect. Mr Murphy was speaking about the study of Mrs Sylvie of the National Institute of Agricultural Botany in Cambridge, United Kingdom. On page 3 of the document it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> During the last 10 years by far the larger part of the increase in yield appears to be the result of improved varieties--</PARA>
<PARA>I must point out that he says 'appears to be'-</PARA>
<PARA>as opposed from the contribution of improved husbandry techniques. This is based on England and Wales information but it will be interesting to learn whether there has been a similar phenomenon in other countries, because if this trend is going to continue in the future, I think it does have significant implications in that very much the greater part of the net increase in productivity that we can expect looks as if it will have to come from the improvement of plant varieties. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not much doubt. We in the Opposition do not take issue with the fact that the greater part of that increase in productivity looks as if it will have to come from improvement in plant varieties. But that is not the argument before the House. This Bill has been hastily put together and in our opinion it does not do justice to the Australian scene. I strongly emphasise that we do not oppose the need to have a reward system in the development of plants for the future. We do not oppose the fact that we need to encourage investment in the future but we do not believe that this Bill is the ideal way of doing it. I read on from Mr Murphy's document. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> If other countries have information similar to that which Mrs Sylvie has produced they might look at this point because I think we would be interested in the United Kingdom to have a comparison with the experience in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA> If other countries have information similar to that which Mrs Sylvie has produced they might look at this point. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that we need to look at this point. From overseas experience there is not enough evidence available to substantiate the type of Bill before the House. We, as perhaps the custodians of the food production future of South East Asia, should not rush in and produce a piece of legislation which has not been completely studied and about which many people are very concerned. Mr Murphy continued:</PARA>
<PARA> We know, therefore, from this information what plant breeding can contribute and the UK experience over the past thirty years is quite clear. The important question today however is to establish what role, if any, plant breeders' rights have played in the process. It is impossible to say with absolute certainty what the contribution of the plant breeders' rights system has been.</PARA>
<PARA>Regardless of what one might read into it, that is clear from the study he put forward at that symposium. It is not clear what role plant breeders' rights have played in the process to this time. It is clear from this evidence, presented by the Government itself, that there is a need to withdraw this legislation and for Australia to take a position of caution and perhaps even adopt a more conservative approach to this type of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now take up another matter. I refer again to the latest information provided by the Government and to Mr Murphy's document. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We now have had 15 years experience with plant breeders' rights but it is only recently that many agricultural and vegetable species have been offered protection. We started in 1965 with just five species. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Wakefield virtually said that this Bill would assist mainly those concerned with agricultural and vegetable species, and the small sectors of the economy. The point I wish to make is related to the fact that whilst the United Kingdom has had 15 years to gain experience, it is only recently that many agricultural and vegetable species have been offered protection. This Bill, if passed, will allow Australia to face the consequences of almost immediate release of some agricultural and vegetable species onto the Australian market. What would be the consequences of this? Have the ramifications been considered?</PARA>
<PARA> I highlight a scenario which could occur. A vegetable of great significance, both economically and in respect of our food production in Australia, is the humble potato. The potato industry needs to develop new varieties to suit Australian conditions. There is no doubt about that. However, the market is not large and it is often oversupplied. The industry has become very specialised, with mechanisation and contract growing for big companies. With the passing of this Bill an overseas company or a company with overseas connections could justify the importation of a new variety of potato to serve a particular purpose . However, the granting of sole rights to a company which can control who will grow the certified seed and also issue contracts to growers to plant that seed and produce the product could create serious problems. The potential to build up a complete tier of control is very real and I do not think the Government has considered this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill does not provide protection against this type of operation. There is a real need to have a section inserted relating to the appointment of an advisory committee. The Minister says that is not even accurate. I refer him to the amending page-we cannot go to the actual Bill; we have to go to the document added to it-and to the characteristics of plant varieties originating outside Australia. This is what concerns me. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the purposes of this Act, where a plant variety in respect of which an application has been made was originated outside Australia, the variety shall not be taken to have a particular characteristic unless-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a test growing of the variety carried out in Australia has demonstrated that the variety has that characteristic;</PARA>
<PARA>That would not take very long in the potato industry; 12 months would be enough to generate that situation. The amendment goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Secretary is satisfied that-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a test growing of the variety carried out at a place outside Australia has demonstrated that the variety has that characteristic;</PARA>
<PARA>It would not take much for the potato industry to put together those two requirements. The legislation continues:</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the test growing of the variety carried out at that place is equivalent to a test growing of the variety carried out in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>That would not take much proving, either. Hence we have a situation where an overseas variety of potato could be brought in by an overseas company which works under contract. Only the company with the licence would be able to get hold of that certified seed. The only people, then, who would be able to plant that seed in this country would be those who received it from that company. It is quite clear in the potato industry that certified seed is the major ingredient to a good crop but there is nothing to stop people growing approved seed or producing just an ordinary run-of-the-mill crop. Under this legislation that would be impossible because such a company would have virtual say over who could use the certified seed. The Minister says that parts of the Bill would rectify that situation in that appeals could be lodged, but there is no doubt in my mind that one of the consequences of this Bill that no one can justify is that a big company could have complete and utter control over that section of the potato industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not need it at the moment because they use a very suspect breed of potato. There is no doubt that they will quickly look to a new breed of potato because they are very concerned about the one they are using now. We do not argue against PVR; we argue against the structure of this Bill. In the way in which it is structured there is no advisory committee to have a look at that problem. I envisage that these plants might not be made available to New South Wales. the particular company concerned is Amatil Ltd, which develops its farm produce in my area in Victoria. It could keep seed strictly for Victoria and Queensland and there would be no way that the seed could be made available to New South Wales. I doubt whether anyone can justify that situation. I do not think it is logical for any piece of legislation to give that sort of power to any company.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the main reasons put forward by the Government for PVR is the restriction of overseas varieties. It can be debated that new varieties of vegetables hastily introduced could have a disastrous economic effect on some of our small industries. New varieties brought in will lead to fewer farmers being required to grow the crops and so we will create more unemployment in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me indicate clearly the position that the Opposition takes. We are quite emphatic that there is a need to encourage plant breeding, but there is also a need to be fully aware of its implications. If there is evidence that all of the implications have been considered, it has not been presented to this Parliament. As I said earlier-and it is quite clear from the mail that parliamentarians are receiving-the public does not consider that all of the implications have been studied. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the amendment to the second reading, moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), to the effect that the Bill should be withdrawn and resubmitted when it and other relevant matters have been considered by a select committee of the House of Representatives. The Bill does not meet Australia's plant breeding needs. It will cause a disruption, if not a diminution, in public plant breeding. It will pose dangers to Australia's agricultural producing and marketing institutions. It will subject Australia's primary producers to inadequately tested new and introduced varieties. It will not meet scientific and practical objectives to existing forms of plant variety rights systems and may affect Australia's role in the preservation of the world's food and genetic plant resources. I support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Werriwa. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always considered that it must be a great problem to be a member of the Opposition. I guess Opposition supporters have a responsibility to oppose, but today I do not really think that their heart is in it. That may be some consolation to rurally-based voters who still feel that there may be some benefit to be gained by farmers in having socialist governments. In 1602, in the case of Davis versus Allein, Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason wherefore such a privilege is good in law is because the invention bringeth to and for the Commonwealth a new industry. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that Australia needs new industry at this time, but new industry will not develop without an incentive. Normally in our free enterprise society the incentive is the making of a profit. The time scale and hazards of plant breeding must in the first instance require a stout heart. The incentive of profit opportunity is absolutely necessary before the ordinary individual, outside of a government institution, can enter upon plant breeding. So often the inventor will not have the capital to support himself during the long process of plant breeding. The day of the wealthy patron of science is past. Capital, which is often the property of little people, requires profit. If the inventor wishes to best deliver his skills to the the community in the form of new products he needs to be able to offer the possibility of that profit to capital before it will assist him. Capital and inventiveness have combined over the centuries to create the products and processes that have lifted the world above the subsistence economy. Nothing that I know of has done more in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The living plant is the basis of our food cycle. In Australia capital and invention have produced major improvements in production; so too has the Government. Capital and private invention have been for years directed their efforts to the field in which profit was available, namely that of fertilizers and insecticides. Government plant breeders have found that part of their time has been taken up inventing plants that are capable of handling new fertilizers and insecticides. The extent to which fertiliser and insecticide can contribute to the increasing of food production or the improvement of plant variety is now limited. Moreover, some side effects of the use of fertiliser and insecticide are not considered desirable. Therefore, improved and resistant plant varieties would appear to be the better alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> Capital and the inventor found that, due to the lack of protection, there was no gain in inventing open pollenating varieties. Therefore, they turned to hybrids where the very process, while kept secret, provided protection in itself . Hybrids will not regenerate from the seed that they produce. The hybrid industry grew rapidly without the protection of plant variety rights. That, by the way, is the simple answer to one of the more stupid criticisms that is offered: Once plant variety legislation was in place hybrids would corner the market. Hybrid development, due to its very nature, has never needed PVR protection and, as I have said, has managed to develop without it. Plant variety rights legislation is needed to protect the invention of open pollenating varieties. The invention of such varieties of greater productivity and disease resistance is essential for Australia. Every move that can encourage inventive people to undertake this task must be applauded. The purpose of the Bill is to make one such move. It is a move to provide patent rights. It is not a move to address many of the other issues that also may contribute to greater productivity. The taking of certain action that may further contribute in this regard is the responsibility of other levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member of Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has referred to the Bill as a dog's breakfast. If this Bill attempted to address all of the problems that are associated with the general issue of plant breeding it would certainly become a dog's breakfast, and possibly subject to constitutional challenge also. We have to get this point clear: The Bill is to give patent rights in the hope that this will encourage additional resources to be directed to the plant breeding industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is a good clean measure which is designed, as it should be, to achieve a single, prime purpose-to enable the granting of patents for future new plant varieties. Consequently, I commend it to the House and implore honourable members both here and in another place to address themselves to its provisions, rather than to supposition or to other matters. I ask them also not to predict its effect past the point of the granting of patents. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to address some of the comments that have been made by the Opposition today. I have already implied that the Opposition, by suggesting that there be a select committee, is apparently endeavouring to address in one Bill all of the problems that may exist in regard to plant breeding, rather than the particular proposal that is before us, which is designed to provide an incentive for further plant breeding. I take issue with the honourable member for Werriwa in regard to his statement that the Country Party Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia was opposed to the concept. The honourable member was quite right in that regard but did not tell the House why the Minister was opposed. I have had to deal with the matter in my electorate, which represents by far the greater area of rural production in Western Australia that is affected by this question. The reason for the Minister's opposition was that he acted on the advice of his Department which, plainly, was terrified that its empire was under attack. Let us get this straight: It is clear to me that one of the great worries of the Opposition is that something that has been the preserve of government might be under attack. I say 'might' because I do not see anything in this Bill that suggests that it is under attack. If we have to look under the mattress we had better go to some other place. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the honourable member said that many nurserymen were opposed. I do not know these nurserymen. I have not met any of them, but I must say that the industry body which represents nurserymen has probably been the strongest lobbyist in favour of plant variety rights. Surely its democratic structure is such that if the bulk of its members were against the Bill there would not have been a strong lobby in favour of it from that sector. The honourable member says that farmers are opposed to the Bill. I will deal with that in a moment, as it affects my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member says that plant breeders do not really care, that they will produce any sort of product and, having done so, will not worry about the purchaser. That could be the honourable member's opinion of these people. Honourable members are doubtless aware of the huge sums of capital involved. At a seminar the other day an expert told us that it would not be unreasonable to expend $100,000 a year on a plant breeder, but it would be delightful if he got through a breeding program in five years. In other words, it would cost $100,000 a year for a plant breeder and his associates. These programs involve half a million dollars, if we are lucky. At the end of such a program plant breeders would not dump on the market a product that was bad. That is purely and simply because the next time they tried to do that sort of thing their whole organisation would go down the drain. People remember the people who sell them crook things. I think honourable members will find on average that the plant breeder who gets on in the world is the one who does not do that sort of thing and the people who invest that sort of money in plant breeding are not the sorts of people who do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I was quite astounded to hear the honourable member for Werriwa express concern that the economic benefits might be shared beyond the producer. I would have thought that was a rather desirable situation. Although the honourable member got around to the consumer later in his speech, he listed first all the people who might profit from better varieties, including the retailers, the wholesalers and presumably the auctioneers. At that point he left out the consumer. Amongst the various occupations I have had have been those of grocer and greengrocer. I knew very well then what happened to prices when there was increased production. When there was greater production, the price fell in many of the retail areas. This did not always worry the grower because if his production was up and the unit value was down he was still doing well. On the other hand, of course, the consumer benefited. Is it not a fact that any legislation which is brought into this House which in any way contributes to higher levels of production and lower prices is to be applauded?</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa also seemed concerned about the risk to growers in taking on a new variety. Maybe he would not be in this place if his ancestors had not taken the risk which many pioneers did in coming to this country. Australian growers will take certain risks. The plant variety rights legislation will not necessarily increase or decrease the level of risk. The legislation will create the opportunity for breeders to profit from their activities. The honourable member for Werriwa also questioned the possible benefits from this legislation. He seems to want us to guarantee a quantum of benefit before this legislation passes the House. To me a small benefit would be a great benefit. Having studied this subject and discussed it with everybody I possibly could, the conclusion I have come to is that the benefits will be great , if only in allowing into Australia many of the already improved varieties that are available throughout the world but are not available to Australia because of the plant variety legislation in the country of origin. If only those varieties come to Australia, even if under the provisions of this legislation we do not invent anything in Australia, that will be sufficient quantum of benefit, but I expect a substantially greater benefit than that. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa referred to the British system and said that the federal government should introduce an identical system. He might discover that in a Federal system of Government that is not possible. He ignores the responsibilities of State governments in the area of agriculture. The State governments have been looking after this area for years, and I think they have been doing the job extremely well. Through this legislation we are not asking anybody to change those circumstances. The honourable member seems to be completely happy with our institutional breeding mechanisms which exist today, although many of the wheat varieties that are still being grown in Australia were invented probably 20 years ago. He mentioned some new varieties, but they are still in the minority. Nobody is suggesting for a minute that the public sector should not continue to go ahead with breeding programs which will be of benefit to the nation. That will be matter for the State governments to determine by funding. I again add that I feel there is more concern in the Labor Party Opposition ranks about what might happen to some Government employees than there is for the total benefits that this legislation could bring for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear the suggestion of the honourable member for Werriwa that someone might steal some secrets. He does not have to worry about that at present. There are no secrets because nobody is bothering to create these secrets. He expressed concern that people might litigate with the Shell oil company. There is no worry about that at the moment either because there is no protection. Nothing is happening; it will not happen, so do not worry too much about the Shell oil company. </PARA>

I see this Bill giving government institutions the opportunity to benefit also from their inventiveness. They too need not necessarily continue to demand levies. It is possible that they may get some royalties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some other issues were raised by the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham). He is very worried about the time that has been allowed for debate on this subject. Seldom has there been a Bill which members of the public have been given a better chance to examine. If by now they have not been able to come up with arguments against its passage they never will. That honourable member too got himself bogged down in the amendment, which carries us miles past the provisions of this Bill. Principally the Bill seeks to provide for the granting of a patent, not to get into the matter of growing seed or anything else which is probably the responsibility of other sections of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just touch on a few of the other matters that were raised so that I can prove conclusively to the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) that I support the Bill wholeheartedly. Firstly, all sorts of suggestions have been made about what the PVR scheme might cost in terms of royalties. The United States Burpee Seed Co., of all names, listed 11 lettuce varieties, including two protected varieties. The price per lb of the nine openly available varieties ranged from $6.50 to $13.50 and the price for the two protected varieties ranged from $11.50 to $14.65. In other words, it appeared that the royalty was about $1 per lb. Currently the average royalty payment on seed of protected United States wheat varieties is only 50c a bushel, whereas for oats it is 30c a bushel. So much for the rapacious situation that might exist when all these nasty multinationals get into the business. Yesterday I went to some trouble to question one of the members of the Opposition. I asked why the Opposition was so concerned about multinational or big company involvement. I do not think there is any doubt that if there is a sufficiently profitable invention a big company will want to buy it. But I do not say that a company can buy the inventor, unless the inventor chooses to stay. The inventor is a guy who will move on and invent other things. I cited the example of the man called Lear, the American who invented the Lear jet but who also invented the car radio. He lived by invention and by selling out a profitable company and moving on. He did so until his death. There is no suggestion that in our society, government can, until laws are passed, contain inventiveness, be it with money or anything else. If the money is not good enough of if a company takes restrictive trade practices action which does not suit the inventor he will move on; someone else will want his services. </PARA>
<PARA> There seems to be some concern-this was mentioned by the honourable member for McMillan-about potatoes and about a big company saying: 'We have the spuds. You will grow them and you will sell them back to us at our price'. Apparently the honourable member has not read clause 33 of the Bill, which provides the Registrar with certain powers. A court case is not needed. The Registrar has the power to issue another licence if he is of the opinion that that sort of practice is going on. The public is protected from that type of activity, which we know might otherwise occur. This Government has recognised that problem and dealt with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Great concern has been expressed that we have introduced amendments to the Bill . The principal amendment, of course, converts what was once a piece of exclusive legislation to a piece of inclusive legislation. It was exclusive only because of the original doubts of the wheat industry and the cereal grain industry. Those industries did not want to be included. The Government took notice of what they asked and excluded them. They very smartly came around cap in hand and said: 'Please change your mind; please include us because we see benefits in having this'. That is quite contrary to all the negative arguments that there might not be benefit for wheat growers and barley growers. They said: 'There is a benefit and we want it'. Consequently we have changed the legislation to be all-inclusive. It covers all forms of plants but allows for their introduction by regulation. The regulation will be introduced only after approval of the Australian Agricultural Council, which comprises the various State agriculture Ministers. What is wrong with that? By changing the legislation from exclusive to inclusive we have made it much more satisfactory to the international community. Quite obviously, legislation that will not stand up internationally is of little use in the area with which we are dealing. </PARA>
<PARA> There are so many comments that I could make but I sum up with this comment: For goodness sake let us realise that there is benefit in this legislation. Let us realise what it is. It is a patent rights Bill and it has nothing to do with all the other detail and red herrings which the Opposition is introducing. I ask the Opposition to give it a chance. It can do very little harm. It will certainly do some good, as I have said, if it allows only for the introduction of plants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In joining this debate on the Plant Variety Rights Bill 1981 I want to make it quite clear from the outset that whilst I am philosophically opposed to the patenting of any life forms my opposition to this Bill is based on important practical grounds. My abhorrence of the idea that to gain profit from the creation of life, whether animal or plant life, is an inviolable right of a capitalist-free enterprise or private enterprise system is grounded in a morality a defence of which could divert attention from the very real practical dangers of this Bill. Firstly, I wish to deal with two main objectives of the Bill and then turn to the other retrograde effects which will result from the application of this Bill. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has stated that a primary reason for introducing a plant variety rights scheme was to facilitate access to overseas varieties required by Australia by establishing protection for the rights of owners. In support of this statement it is submitted that a number of instances have been reported where Australian breeders have been unable to obtain desired varieties from overseas because of the refusal of the owners to release the varieties without patent protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst not denying that certain Australian breeders have been unable to obtain plant varieties from overseas because of the absence of restrictive legislation, it is not true to say that the introduction of the legislation will facilitate access to overseas varieties. Officials of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation-the FAO-are on record as stating quite unequivocally that their experience of nearly 20 years of existing plant variety rights legislation is that there are increasing restrictions on the amount of germ plasm which is not only in circulation but also available to those who wish to use it. It is worth noting that an important restrictive factor will be the need to satisfy the legislative interpretation of a new plant variety in relation to distinctness, uniformity and stability. This interpretation is set out in clause 3 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement that a new plant variety be distinct, uniform and stable has, in the experience of FAO officials, often meant a breeding reliance on genetic characteristics which are secondary in terms of performance but very important for identification purposes. In other words, the need to conform to the requirements of the legislation in relation to identification for the purpose of making a profit becomes far more important than the possibility of improvements in quality and quantity which may not be patentable and, therefore, not become a money spinner for the breeder. In this respect the United States Department of Agriculture has indicated its concern that breeders are paying a great deal of attention to marketable uniqueness but far less attention to performance uniqueness. I reiterate that there is no denying that the legislation facilitates the provision of genetic resources on a person to person basis but the overall effect overseas has been a reduction in the amount of material available. There is no reason to believe that this experience will not be repeated in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another stated reason by the Minister for introducing plant variety rights legislation was the stimulative effect it would provide for Australian plant breeding. There is no doubt that plant breeding can be a long and costly process , but I cannot accept the argument that because it is long and costly benefits should be available to private breeders rather than the general public through the efforts of public plant breeding programs at present being undertaken by State government departments, the universities and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Again, officials of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation have stated that many excellent varieties of field and plantation crops, vegetables and fruits which are available to the public have resulted, in the most part, from large inputs of government funding. It is only in recent years, and frequently at the last stage of the development of a new variety, that private industry has joined in to reap the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the purpose of plant breeding should be to improve the quality of life and it should not exist for the foremost purpose of expanding the profits of private industry, particularly when, as I will indicate later in this speech, the profits become monopoly profits for a small number of huge multinational corporations and, even more importantly, when those corporations are linking the control of food with agricultural inputs in a way which could have grave consequences for the human race. There is no doubt that if plant variety rights legislation is introduced the institutions at present engaged in public plant breeding would come under pressure from State governments and business interests to pay their way through the medium of royalties. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The public plant breeders would then be forced to meet the legislative requirements of distinctiveness, uniformity and stability, thus causing a consequential neglect of yield and quality. The Minister says that is nonsense. That has happened overseas. That has been the experience overseas. The basis for the collaboration among public breeding institutions and breeding programs which has grown in recent years in order to provide the most efficient use of limited resources would be undermined and probably destroyed if the institutions were forced to compete with each other for royalties. The result would be a strengthening of private breeding interests which would consider public plant breeding as unfair competition and, in the same way as they are now strongly lobbying for the introduction of plant variety rights legislation, they would lobby for the elimination of public plant breeding. There is no doubt that the lobby would find ardent and enthusiastic supporters from local businessmen and nurserymen who could make profits by holding agencies for overseas private breeders. I emphasise that the consequential result of introducing plant variety rights legislation into Australia will be to reduce and eventually eliminate support for public plant breeding programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As usual, the Federal Government is taking an approach which favours overseas multinational corporations, as I will indicate later in my speech. Surely Australia should be improving and strengthening our present public plant breeding programs. The creation of a public plant breeding corporation which could co-ordinate and support the present programs of State governments, universities and the CSIRO, would provide a valuable catalyst for the expansion of public plant breeding in Australia. The board of the corporation could include representatives of the farming community, private and public plant breeders, the consuming public and Federal and State governments. Of course, it is too much to expect that those Government members described as the 'dries' would support such a proposal. They are the atavists of our Parliament, the throw-backs who hold the quaint view that our economy can be controlled by market forces, unhindered by governments. What they fail to appreciate is that the market economy they are talking and writing about died at the end of the nineteenth century and the market-place is now controlled by multinational corporations. The corollary of small government, which is one of their catch- cries, is big business. For big business the new field for unscrupulous exploitation is the production and marketing of food. In this respect plant variety rights legislation represents one of the greatest vehicles for exploitation and power, a fact which multinational corporations have not failed to recognise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Plant variety rights legislation is a form of government intervention in the market which provides for monopoly control and which actively impedes free enterprise activities. The Minister asked who wrote that. If he had listened to previous speeches I have made in this House he would be aware that I have made this point on a number of occasions. As soon as the legislation comes into effect the major multinational corporations will move into the profitable sectors of plant breeding, specifically those sectors which deal with crops whose seeds bring in large sales and large profits, with a consequential large royalty potential. Government plant breeding stations will receive even less funding and will be called upon to undertake the non-productive work in fundamental research. Any potentially large royalty-producing variety-produced often after years of painstaking research by the public breeders-will be snapped up by the private sector for quick profits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A typical example of the kind of pirating I have described occurred in France and was cited by Pat Mooney, a well-known food and agriculture consultant. The French Government patents a variety of hybrid corn and a private corporate breeder, having paid a marginal royalty, works on that hybrid and produces a marginally new hybrid variety. The quality and characteristics of the new variety have not changed from the original goverment-produced hybrid corn but, because the private breeder has created a new cross, he is able to patent it. The private corporate breeder markets both the government's and his own variety in an advertising campaign which highlights his own variety and thus he reaps the whole of the enhanced profits. That is how plant variety rights legislation has affected plant breeding in Europe and that is obviously how it will work in Australia. A number of analyses have been carried out which show conclusively that the introduction of plant variety rights legislation leads to an oligopolistic market structure. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a continuing takeover of independent seed companies by transnational petrochemical, agrichemical and agribusiness companies. In the United States of America recent corporate takeovers involving 45 seed companies have been undertaken by 24 multinational corporations, including three petrochemical companies, nine agrichemical or pharmaceutical companies and 12 agribusiness companies. Two hundred and forty nine United States patents for soya beans, wheat, cotton, garden beans and peas and lettuce are held by eight corporations involved with seed production, distribution or research in Australia. With some slight variations in any major crop area, the oligopoly situation in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany is the same. Essentially, four companies have oligopoly control. For example, in the United States, in the case of hybrid corn, close to 90 per cent of the market is controlled by four companies. To ensure monopoly control of the corn the four companies have divided the United States into geographic regions so that only one company supplies the corn to the farmers in one region. </PARA>
<PARA> Analysis of the patents issued under the United States plant variety rights legislation indicates that about half the patents are issued to the 24 multinational corporations that I mentioned previously. The domination of the seed industry by multinational corporations is beyond doubt, as the statistics show. In the United Kingdom in 1964 within one week of plant variety rights legislation having been passed, Ranks Hovis McDougall Ltd took over 84 country seed supply companies. In the United States, after the introduction of a plant variety protection Act in 1970, the demand for quick capital profits by small seed proprietors was so high that the American seed trade association organised a one-day seminar entitled 'how to sell out your seed company'. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia there are a number of grave implications for farmers, market gardeners, nurserymen and food consumers in the overwhelming evidence of the control of the overseas seed market by multinational corporations. In the first place, these huge corporations work only for the biggest markets. The smaller Australian marketplace will in consequence be obliged to accept the varieties produced by overseas research programs. Secondly, the large corporations which are acquiring the majority of the smaller seed companies are those corporations whose bulk profits come from the manufacture of pharmaceuticals or petroleum- based chemicals. Plant breeding has a number of commercial attractions for such corporations, involving vertical as well as horizontal integration, but the one great commercial advantage is being able to sell a package deal to the farmer. Seed can be sold chemically pre-coated or pelleted thus increasing the company's chemical sales. There would not be a great deal of commercial incentive for such corporations to be interested in genetic forms of pest or disease resistance or nitrogen use efficiency. With seed certification requiring certain minimum levels of disease resistance, companies concentrate on major gene resistance which is more easily defined and handled. Varieties with more broadly based, longer lasting resistance, or varieties with resistance to plant parasites, would be more expensive to produce and harder to sell. This is one of the more dangerous commercial effects of plant variety rights for the Australian consumer . </PARA>
<PARA> I return now to the creation of a public plant breeding corporation which, in my opinion, would be a satisfactory alternative to the provisions of the present Bill. I have already suggested that the composition of a governing board of such a corporation should include representatives of Government, plant breeders and food consumers. The corporation could provide a much needed co-ordination role between the various public plant breeding bodies throughout Australia. Probably the most valuable function of a public plant breeding corporation would be the formation within its organisation of a national seeds marketing authority. Such an authority would deal exclusively with seeds recommended by State departments of agriculture as being of real benefit to Australian farmers. It would be the sole wholesale distributor of recommended seeds. Farmers would be expected to favour buying the recommended and certified seeds distributed by the marketing authority. Private companies which bred seeds good enough to be recommended by various departments of agriculture could be paid royalties based on across the counter sales. It would be impossible for other companies or institutions to pirate the recommended seed. In order to gain access to the seeds market in recommended varieties, seeds growers would have to sell through the marketing authority since it alone would act as a wholesale agent for recommended seeds. The marketing authority would direct all royalties to the company which developed the recommended seed. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the publicly bred varieties are poorly distributed and information about new varieties is communicated through department of agriculture extension officers, local newspapers and by word of mouth. The national seeds marketing authority would provide a co-ordinated sales and promotion network and act on behalf of public breeding institutions. The authority would be of great benefit to the small breeders who lack the sales and promotional network to distribute beneficial seeds because they lack capital, time and other resources needed to set up the operation. A national seeds marketing authority could provide access for the small breeder to the national market once the variety developed by the breeder was recommended by the appropriate State department of agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of advantages in a national seeds marketing authority for plant variety rights. In the first place, with a seeds marketing authority, only plant breeding of real benefit to Australian growers and consumers would be encouraged. Plant variety rights encourage cosmetic plant breeding. As I pointed out previously, the legislative requirements of distinctness, uniformity and stability have a detrimental effect on good plant breeding. Secondly, a seeds marketing authority would not lead to the vertical integration of the seed industry as would happen with plant variety rights; nor would private plant breeders be given a right to say where seeds would be sold and which seed growers would obtain contracts to grow them. All seed growers approved by State departments of agriculture would have the right to grow recommended seed for sale as long as they sold their seed through the agency of the seeds marketing authority. </PARA>

Nor would private plant breeders be given the right to say where seeds would be sold, and which seed growers would obtain contracts to grow them. All seed growers approved by State departments of agriculture would have the right to grow recommended seed for sale as long as they sold their seed through the agency of the seeds marketing authority. Similarly, seeds handled by the seeds marketing authority would be available to all seed merchants in the regions where the departments of agriculture recommend the seeds for use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, a seeds marketing authority would be able to negotiate with overseas breeders controlling United States and European patents on seeds of worth to Australian agriculture and would promote the export of Australian developed seeds overseas, ensuring that whenever seeds are marketed they represent appropriate forms of technology. A fourth advantage would be that a seeds marketing authority could ensure the security of the public breeding sector in the face of commercial approaches by the private sector to seeds promotion and marketing; that is provided, of course, adequate government funding is maintained. Fifthly, a seeds marketing authority would ensure the survivability and right to commercial reward for those with little capital backing such as small nurseries, seed growers and plant breeders. </PARA>
<PARA> The final advantage of a marketing authority over the Plant Variety Rights Bill would be to ensure free access to genetic materials by paying royalties to only those companies which allowed open access to their genetic stocks. Plant variety rights have encouraged scientific secretiveness and the hoarding of genetic materials. Sources of funding available for a public plant breeding corporation could be commissions on sales-overseas and within Australia-crop levies, and the Consolidated Revenue. I would like to go on and describe further benefits of the National Seed Authority but time is against me. I support the proposal that this Bill be withdrawn and that the whole matter of plant variety rights be referred to a select committee of this House. I hope in particular that such a committee would look at the possible creation of a national seeds marketing authority as being a positive approach by me to this most important matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support very strongly this long overdue legislation to implement plant variety rights in Australia. I do so because of my personal knowledge as a farmer in this country and my experience on farms in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and New Zealand. I have seen the tremendous advantage that the farmers of those countries have over farmers in Australia in terms of variety and yield potential of plant material because of the greater plant breeding that takes place in those countries. I have talked to farmers and plant breeders both public and private in those countries. More and more I am convinced that if Australian agriculture is to compete internationally , if Australian farmers are to be allowed to compete effectively with their competitors in these other countries, plant variety rights are essential unless there is a massive increase in public breeding allocations in this country. The variety and yield gap between countries which have plant variety rights and those countries which do not have plant variety rights is accelerating and Australian farmers are being left further behind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most important general point in respect of plant breeding in Australia is that much more money is needed. If we are to have improved varieties there has to be either a massive increase in public money, meaning money from governments at both the Federal and State levels, or a mixture of public and private money for plant breeding research. Plant variety rights are essential because without patent protection there is no incentive to invest other than in the breeding of hybrids-that is those varieties of plants which cannot reproduce themselves. It is not just a matter of farmers and the Government contributing on a dollar for dollar basis. There must be a massive increase in general government funds. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what amazes me about the ignorant, ideologically blinkered opponent group of plant variety rights of which the previous speaker, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), was a wonderful example. Never before in this place have I heard any supporters of this view give any priority to or place any emphasis on the allocation of public money for plant breeding in this country. These people probably do not even know that plant breeding takes place. Yet simply because of their ideological opposition to allowing the farmers of this country the ability to compete internationally, public breeding funds suddenly are trotted out. But what will be their attitude when it comes to a choice of where public funds should go? It will be interesting to see in their speeches on the coming Budget and in other debates that take place in this House whether they believe funds for public breeding have any priority at all or whether this matter is conveniently forgotten when they get back to their trendy priorities again. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me be more specific with regard to plant variety rights and the needs of Australian agriculture. We need more varieties that are compatible with the variations in soil, climate, dry conditions, irrigation conditions and so on that exist in Australia. We can take the example of soya beans. I understand that to a certain extent soya beens grown in Australia are still based on varieties introduced here from overseas many years ago. These varieties have never been very successful and have been confined to certain areas. The same situation applied many years ago in the United States. However, now soya beans are grown from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian border and the represent the second biggest grain export earner for that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to coarse grains and oil seeds generally. A terrible lack of breeding is taking place in this country because funds are not being made available for this purpose. Let me refer to irrigated wheat. I come from an irrigated area where wheat is being grown under irrigation. In 1962 I spent some time on irrigation farms in the United States. At that time the first of the semi-dwarf wheats bred for irrigation conditions had just been introduced. A variety called Gains yielded 100 bushels to the acre in the United States in 1962. In 1982 in Australia there is still not one variety of wheat that will produce 100 bushels to the acre. I can assure honourable members that the United States has not just stopped with the Gains variety which was first introduced in 1962. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the lack of varieties in respect of lucernes and rye grass. On my farm at the moment I am sowing down some irrigation country. The three rye grass varieties we are using are all imported from New Zealand because no breeding takes place in this country. In the United Kingdom, supposedly because of a national list, restrictions are placed on a number of varieties. However, farmers in that country have a choice of nine varieties of perennial rye grass. One can go through the list and see how much worse off we are in this country. In terms of yield we are falling further and further behind our competitors. For example, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) and I had discussions with Mr Murphy, the Controller of Plant Variety Rights in Great Britain, who is a public servant and neutral in these matters. Murphy told us two months ago that there is no variety of wheat now grown in the United Kingdom older than 10 years because of the tremendous breeding improvement that has taken place. Yet in northern Victoria the most popular variety of wheat is still Olympic which was introduced in 1956 at the time of the Olympic Games. There has been no yield increase over that period. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who think that wheat breeding in this country is keeping up with wheat breeding in the rest of the world are ignorant. They do not know what is going on with wheat breeding in the rest of the world. The comments of Murphy and Valarie Sylvie of the National Institute of Agricultural Botany at Cambridge are contrary to the selective quotes that have been made by the Opposition. Valarie Sylvie in a paper on the influence of improved crop varieties and husbandry methods on increasing cereal yield said that over half of the dramatic increase in yield that has taken place has been due to breeding. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA> More than half that improvement--</PARA>
<PARA>She is referring here to wheat yields--</PARA>
<PARA>has resulted from varieties commercialised in the last 15 years. Consideration of the varieties currently recommended--</PARA>
<PARA>And she then names them-</PARA>
<PARA>shows that Plant Breeders are producing varieties with even higher yield potential. </PARA>
<PARA>She then goes on to say how this yield potential is increasing. So the longer we stay out of plant variety rights in this country the further our farmers will be disadvantaged in the international contest for markets. People on the Opposition side of the House have no idea of agriculture at all. They are denying the Australian farmers the opportunity to keep pace with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer here also to the problems of overseas varieties not being allowed into this country until we have plant variety rights. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), who is at the table, gave a long list of such varieties. The fruit growers of my area are denied the opportunity to use new peach varieties and apple varieties because there are no plant variety rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am saying that they would have a far better opportunity to compete and more will be achieved than by this negative ignorant ideological attitude of the people on the honourable member's side of the House. An adequate breeding program, whether public or private, will never be developed for a whole range of smaller horticultural industries in this country because the industries in Australia are too small. The only way the horticultural industry can keep up with the rest of the world is to import those varieties, and this will only happen if plant variety rights are introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One can look also at the limitations on public breeding finance in this country . Money is provided by the Government on a dollar for dollar basis for breeding whether for wheat, barley or other grains. One need only look at the very narrow limitations that are put on by farmer controlled committees in respect of research for those plant varieties to see that we have another argument here in favour of plant variety rights. Because of the narrow limitations of the breeding programs provided, which are concentrated on wheat, the wheat farmers of this country are denied access to a range of other coarse grains available to their overseas competitors. Very little money is available on a dollar for dollar basis for breeding programs for other grains.</PARA>
<PARA> The farmers of this country already are very generous in the amount of money they put up for public breeding programs. I have not heard of the doctors of this country putting up money on a dollar for dollar basis for medical research. Nor have I heard of small business in secondary industry putting up money on a dollar for dollar basis in the same way that the farmers of this country have put up money for research. If more money is to be available for breeding in this country it has to come either from money gained from the introduction of plant variety rights or from general government public breeding programs. I cannot see any honourable member on the other side of the House giving this matter any priority whatsoever other than while this debate lasts tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were to put more money into public breeding-I would like to see that happening-we would still be denied many of the advantages that come with plant variety rights. It is incorrect for people to say that public breeding is reduced when plant variety rights are introduced. It is clear from evidence presented by a Bureau of Agricultural Economics study and from conversations I have had with plant breeders in a number of countries that the opposite is the case. If public breeding is reduced, it is reduced when Labor governments get into power. A Labor government is in power in New South Wales and it has reduced the availability of funds for public breeding. It will be interesting to see what happens in Victoria now that it has a Labor government. It will be interesting to see what happens if a Federal Labor government is elected. It will be very interesting to see whether these trendy supporters opposite of the anti-plant variety rights movement still talk about priority for public breeding once this debate concludes in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence that more money will be made available for public breeding by this country other than through plant variety rights. What is also of interest is that if plant variety rights are brought in, Australia will have a new industry. It will have more employment. Because Australia is in the southern hemisphere there will be opportunities for breeding programs in the northern hemisphere off-season. This is happening in New Zealand now. It will not happen here without the introduction of plant variety rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the arguments that are used by this ideological group which opposes plant variety rights. Somehow or other people belonging to this group think that plants are unique. Why are plants unique and not animals? We have proprietory rights in relation to animals in the sense that we can obtain semen from bulls and can register stud breeds. I do not see any difference between patent rights for computers and proprietory rights for plants. What is unique about a plant? What makes it any different from something that either grows on this earth or is produced on this earth? Talking about ideological opposition to plant variety rights, how many honourable members on the other side of the House know that East Germany, Hungary and Russia have plant variety rights? Honourable members opposite see nothing wrong with a socialist country adopting plant variety rights. It is not contrary to the social philosophy of honourable members opposite to have plant variety rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Our previous speaker felt strongly about the point I am about to raise. He felt that the plant variety rights requirement that before a new variety can be registered it has to be uniform, stable and reliable, was something new and different. That is the basic requirement for every new variety that is developed , be it publicly bred or privately bred. No public breeder will have any variety released, approved or registered until it is uniform, stable and reliable. That applies irrespective of whether there is public breeding or private breeding. If honourable members opposite did their homework they would find that out. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite also said that this legislation will reduce the number of varieties that are available to people. The opposite will occur because of the increased breeding that will take place as a result of the increased money that is put into plant breeding. The Opposition based its argument on the fact that in the United Kingdom, after plant variety rights were introduced, there was a reduction in the number of vegetable varieties that were classified as different. The truth of the matter is that when the United Kingdom decided to test all of the varieties-it made that decision when plant variety rights were introduced-it found that a lot of the so-called varieties that were thought to be separate were actually identical. Hence, it saw a reduction in the number of vegetable varieties available. Some honourable members have talked about restrictions. We will not have a national list in this country. There will be no restriction on the number of varieties that is possible for a particular variety. Honourable members opposite are not aware of this because they do not know the subject: There are tremendous restrictions on the number of varieties that can be grown commercially in this country now even though plant variety rights do not apply. A farmer can produce only certain varieties of wheat which will be accepted by the grain elevator boards or by the Australian Wheat Board. This applies to barley and to sugar also. Only certain varieties of sugar are accepted at the sugar mill. The fruit canneries will take only certain varieties of peaches or pears. Wineries will take only certain varieties of grapes. Good heavens, we have restrictions now. Restrictions have nothing to do with plant variety rights. They do have something to do with commercial requirements when producing commodities. That is a completely different subject. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite also talked about the loss of genetic material. Once again, the opposite is the case. That is because of increased research. Honourable members opposite talked about gene banks. We are talking about a completely separate issue. It has to do with national and international agreements on gene banks. I am pleased that the Minister in his second reading speech made reference to the fact that international co-operation is increasing. What might be of interest to honourable members opposite is that the evidence available from countries that have introduced plant variety rights shows that in fact there is an increasing exchange of germ plasm material. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry but it is true. I can substantiate my comments with the results of studies by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and by Agricultural Canada which I have in front of me. The honourable member for La Trobe cannot do that. The results of the studies that have been made are in front of me in black and white. When the Opposition talks about officials of the Food and Agriculture Organisation it is talking about people who have been disowned by the Food and Agriculture Organisation. There is no authority in the comments made by the Opposition. The Opposition also talked about lower disease resistance, the greater need for fertilisers and the fact that some cosmetic varieties will be introduced to dupe the farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, the Opposition is internally inconsistent in its arguments because on the one hand it is saying that there will be fewer varieties because of restrictions and on the other hand it is saying that there will be more varieties but that notice should not be taken of them because they are cosmetic, they are just out to fool the farmers. Honourable members opposite are saying that somehow or other when varieties are introdued by public breeders they are perfect, that they need less fertiliser and that they never succumb to different diseases. I can assure honourable members opposite that in the public breeding that takes place a very high percentage of varieties released are subsequently withdrawn. Farmers will not use them because they are susceptible to disease. Because they are cosmetic they do not increase yield. Farmers are not fools. They are very hard-headed business people. Why say to a farmer: 'You need protection in selecting your variety of plants but you do not need protection in selecting a car, an animal or agricultural machinery'?</PARA>
<PARA> Once again I ask: What is unique about plants that is not unique about anything else in which people are involved? As other honourable members on this side of the House have said in relation to disease resistance, the basic thrust these days is to reduce the need for chemical control because of the cost et cetera. Therefore, farmers look for disease resistant varieties before they look for anything else when buying new varieties. I turn now to fertilisers. Good heavens , if one is to get a high yield one has to feed the plant well. It will need more fertiliser, just as a dairy cow needs to be fed well. There is a relationship between the amount of fertiliser that is used and the yield of the plant if the yield potential is genetically present in the variety. Honourable members opposite should not run away with the fond thought that a plant can be bred which will produce 100 bushels to the acre but will not need fertiliser. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has been made of multinational concerns. Are you aware that we have some multinational organisations breeding here already, before the introduction of plant variety rights? They are breeding here--</PARA>

Without them money would not have been put into the breeding of hybrid grains, which are essential if we are to develop a range of export commodities, coarse grains et cetera. But there is no evidence of domination by multinationals when plant variety rights legislation comes in. For example, in the United States, in the 10 years of PVR, only 17 per cent of the registrations of new plant varieties have come from the big six companies. I have been on some of these plant breeding places and spoken to people who, because of the added flexibility of PVR, have been able to start small companies. PVR gives greater flexibility for small breeders, not just large breeders, to get involved in the plant breeding industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole debate on plant variety rights has been laden with emotion, as we have seen from the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). People seem to get very emotive about this issue. Numerous groups and individuals have notified their opinions and their stand on the issue. The debate has taken place over a long time and many questions still remain to be answered. I believe that there could be merit in introducing some form of legislation in this area, but I believe that this Bill is so badly worded, with so many omissions, that it should be withdrawn and redrafted after being the subject of research by a select committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Among other things, the proposed legislation provides that applications will be received and considered for patenting whether the applicant is resident in Australia or not. I believe that there could be a danger in this provision. We have recently begun to review our industrial patent system. Top level inquiries in Australia have found that local innovation research and development programs have not been greatly stimulated by the patent system and that in some cases its influence may be negative. A Senate standing committee inquiry into industrial research and development noted in 1979:</PARA>
<PARA> The system is a supposed stimulant to capital investment. However, CSIRO considers that its (the patent schemes) influence has been minor and that the influence of tariffs and quotas, tax provisions, investment allowances, industrial export incentives and development grants are much more powerful and particular in their effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's patent system may well be acting against the country's best interests. </PARA>
<PARA>We should note that. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Once again, the absence of any clear policy . . . makes it difficult to know where our best interests lie . . . although there are many examples of patent monoply providing encouragement, the overall effect of the patent system on indigenous research and development could well be negative in a situation where most patents are issued to large foreign corporations and in addition many are bad. </PARA>
<PARA>The scource of that is a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and Environment entitled 'Industrial Research and Development in Australia 1979', page 135. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia in 1978, 90 per cent of industrial patents issued were to overseas corporations. As a result of the Senate inquiry, the Minister for Productivity- then the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee)-announced in November 1979 the beginning of a departmental investigation into the Australian industrial patent system. At the same time, the Department of Primary Industry was drawing up plans for a plant patenting system. Throughout its published information the Department of Primary Industry repeats the same arguments used centuries ago for the initiation of an industrial patent system. Is the Department of Primary Industry aware of the general disenchantment with the patent system held by those people who have had most experience with it in industry? If PVR follows the pattern set by industrial patents, it will be nothing more than a piece of government regulation of the market place that will favour large corporations and lead to a massive exodus of Australian funds overseas in the form of royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> The Uniting Church in Australia Board for Social Responsibility notes in its opposition to the Plant Variety Rights Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> This provision opens the way for multinational petrochemical companies which have already taken over the seed industry under similar legislation in Europe and the United States of America to do the same in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that reports from the United States of America, albeit a few years out of date, say that a few large companies dominate each of the major seed crops: For example, Pioneer and De Kalb, now owned by the chemical corporation Ciba-Geigy, and Pioneer in alfalfa, lucerne, seed; Asgrow, now owned by the chemical corporation Upjohn, and Burpee, now owned by ITT, in vegetable seed; Cargell, Funk-Ciba-Geigy again-Asgrow, now Upjohn, and Pioneer in sorghum seed; and as well Burpee-ITT-dominates the mail order business, and Ferry Morse- Union Carbide-is the major retail packet seed seller. In the United States of America, three corporations hold 80 per cent of the patents on beans; four corporations hold 45 per cent of the patents on cotton; four corporations hold 60 per cent of the patents on lettuce; four corporations hold 62 per cent of the patents on peas; four corporations hold 48 per cent of the patents on soya beans ; and four corporations hold 69 per cent of the patents on barley. That is a fairly strong monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, in Europe, the European Court's recent investigation into the European seed market has singled out three multinational companies in this connection- Shell Oil, Ciba-Geigy, and Sancoz. The trend is fairly distinct and, without getting hysterical about it, we should take note of it. </PARA>
<PARA> In a paper presented on Monday to a plant variety seminar held here and organised by the Liberal-National Country Party rural committee, Mr Hugh Roberts , a farmer, commented:</PARA>
<PARA> The reason that many multinational companies of all shapes and sizes are starting to move into the plant breeding field is simple-they believe and acknowledge that plant breeding will be for the twenty-first century what chemical engineering was to the twentieth century-no more, no less. </PARA>
<PARA>That may well be true. However, we should note that the statement is only an opinion expressed, no more and no less, and is not supported by any proof. It behoves us to be wary. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot accept the statements that unless and until Australia gets a Plant Variety Rights Act, Australian breeders and growers will be denied access to newly developed material from overseas. It could be that because the proposed Act includes a provision that varieties existing prior to the introduction of the Act cannot be registered the new material is being withheld until we determine whether or not we shall have a Plant Variety Rights Act. Once that is determined, either for or against, the material will become available to breeders and owners. People will always seek markets to sell their goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III, Division 4, clauses 29 and 33 of the Bill are unacceptable to the Opposition. The statement that the Minister can attach special conditions to the granting of PVR if he or she considers it necessary in the public interest gives little confidence in the preciseness of the legislation. The wording of clause 33, 'reasonable prices in sufficient quantities', and 'ensure that reasonable requirements of the public . . . are satisfied', is vague and very imprecise. One wonders what criteria the Minister and his Department would use to determine what is reasonable in each case. </PARA>
<PARA> In Part III, Division 2, clause 20, tests of plant variety are discussed, and again the Bill is vague and imprecise. The Secretary to Primary Industry is to determine whether testing will be undertaken-but again according to what criteria? Will there be testing only if powerful industry groups lobby for it? Who will do the testing? What will the testing include? Will it include merit or just difference? How will merit be judged? Who will pay for the testing?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are questions which must be answered. There are too many loose ends, and too many questions and not enough answers-and what anwers the Minister is giving us are too imprecise. The Bill is badly drafted, is far too general, and it leaves too many loopholes open to interpretation. It contains no real commitment to the public funding of plant breeding through existing institutions . There is community concern about PVR. In mentioning community concern, I suggest to the honourable member for Murray that PVR is not just for the wheat farmers. The vagueness of the Bill heightens fears about the consequences of PVR . For example, the basic criteria for registration under PVR legislation in all countries are that the cultivar should be new-distinctive-uniform and stable. The criteria for a new plant to be distinct, uniform and stable are not spelt out, so that there is no process fr certification and a new plant does not necessarily have to be better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We would do much better to redraft the Bill so that breeders know exactly where they stand and so that less is left to chance. As I have said, we are not totally opposed to a PVR Bill. We are opposed to the terms of this Bill, and we believe that, in the interests of breeders, farmers, conservationists and those concerned about monopolies, we should have a select committee report on the whole issue and draft a Bill that does not need 68 amendments. Let us find out what the deficiencies are in our country and how best to meet them, in the interests of the farmers as well as the rest of us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-It is quite clear from what the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) said that she certainly has not read my second reading speech because many of the questions that she raised in her contribution were answered in that speech. I do not propose to deal with all of those points now. I do not wish to be unkind to her but it might have been helpful had she been in the House earlier this afternoon when I made a speech on the Plant Variety Rights Bill. A number of the points that she took up were answered then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pick up two of the points she made in her address. The Bill makes it quite clear that there will be no merit testing. That is not part of the PVR Bill. In regard to public plant breeding, I have made it quite plain that the Bill has no effect on public breeding. That will be a matter for the individual Budgets of the State governments which are involved in public breeding. The PVR Bill will not in any way affect such a decision. It can be a decision only of the government concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of contributions to the Bill, I make the point that this seems to have been lost by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) and others who spoke for the Opposition. The fact of the matter is that the Agricultural Council will be the final master of this Bill. I remind honourable members that the Agricultural Council is made up of six State Ministers, of all political colours , plus the Commonwealth Minister, so every careful consideration will be given to any plants or seeds covered by plant variety rights. Another point seems to have been lost by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton) and also by the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham). No present plants and stocks, whether they be native or bred, can be part of PVR. It is only when somebody breeds a new plant after the Bill is promulgated that he can apply for registration. There is no guarantee that he will get it; he will have to meet certain tests. Therefore the wild and extraordinary claims of the honourable member for La Trobe that the whole of the present plant and seed system will disappear into the hands of multinationals are just too ludicrous to contemplate . </PARA>
<PARA> I want to congratulate particularly the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) and the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). I thought their contributions were excellent. They laid at rest many of the ideological fears that have been expressed by the Uniting Church in Australia and repeated in this Parliament tonight by certain members of the Opposition. They did the Bill a great service. For the honourable member for Henty to say that because of the great number of amendments to the Bill the Government does not know where it is with it is to lose the point. I laid the Bill on the table 11 months ago for the simple purpose of garnering these amendments. I have given every opportunity for public debate on the issue. Some State governments have done better than others in terms of fostering public debate and some have done better in fostering seminars and the like. Every opportunity was given to State governments, to organisations and to industries to come to the Government, to come to me, with proposed amendments. All the amendments that I have for this Bill contain the collective wisdom of all the people who have put this Bill to study. I laid the Bill on the table 11 months ago with that deliberate purpose in mind. To thrust confusion on the matter by saying that because I have these amendments the Government does not know where it is going with this legislation is to mislead the House and to misunderstand completely the purpose of the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a great number of amendments to move and I think we ought to proceed to the Committee stage straight away. Before we do so I wish to deal with the amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, which was moved by the honourable member for Werriwa. He wants firstly to set up a select committee . We on this side of the House do not believe that there is any need to set up a select committee. All the work that could possibly be done by a select committee has been done by the various Ministers for Agriculture and me in drawing this Bill together. The House ought to recognise that this legislation is being introduced on behalf of the States; it is not for any Commonwealth purpose. The Government is introducing these measures only because they can be more sensibly carried out by Commonwealth legislation. However, it is the States which benefit from the legislation. I do not believe that we need to go into this great charade of setting up a select committee, which simply would create a further delay. This further delay is proposed by the honourable member for Werriwa because he could not convince the Caucus to allow Parliament to proceed with the Bill as it was. He failed in his advocacy and this is the means by which he scrambled out from underneath while still perhaps being able to claim that he is doing his best to get plant variety rights legislation. The truth of the situation is shown by his amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member argues that the Bill will not meet plant breeding needs but the fact is that PVR will encourage breeding because rewards will go to the breeders who put in the effort. Breeders will be rewarded only for improved plants which meet the needs of the people. The market-place will determine whether a new breed of plant or seed, whether it be under PVR or not, is better than plants or seeds already available. Again I remind honourable members that registering for PVR is an entirely voluntary thing; people can breed a new plant without having it registered under PVR. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment goes on to refer to the diminution of public plant breeding. I have made the point before that there is no evidence to suggest that there will be any reduction in public plant breeding. In fact, in New Zealand the evidence is to the contrary. Again I make the point that the main responsibility for public plant breeding will lie with the States and State Budgets. The amendment says there will be dangers to Australia's producing and marketing institutions. I cannot see any possible danger in this Bill. It is a nonsense to say that there are dangers to Australia's producing and marketing institutions. The honourable member for Werriwa did not explain what he meant by dangers or where the threat would come from. His argument on that point was inadequate. The amendment refers to inadequately tested new varieties. As I think the honourable member for Wakefield and the honourable member for Murray pointed out, it will be the farmers and the buyers of the seed who will be the judges of the new varieties. Despite the attempts of the Opposition to paint them as being silly, they are not. They are not silly enough to buy varieties that are not as good as those varieties already on the market. So we cannot agree on that either. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment of the honourable member for Werriwa then refers to the preservation of plant resources. This is quite irrelevant to the PVR legislation . There has been and will continue to be considerable effort in Australia to keep such material together. The PVR legislation will have no effect on that whatsoever. To sum up, the Government cannot accept the amendment to the motion as moved by the honourable member for Werriwa. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Clause 3, page 1, before the definition of 'applicant' insert the following definition:</PARA>
<PARA> ' ''Advisory Committee'' means the group of persons established in pursuance of section 5A;'. </PARA>
<PARA>I will speak briefly to the amendment. Honourable members will be aware that in the original Bill there was provision for an advisory committee. This amendment simply sets out to establish such a committee, which we have defined, in terms of its membership and composition, in proposed new section 5A, the insertion of which I will move at a later stage. The establishment of an official advisory committee is desirable to assist in the formulation of regulations under the Act and generally to assist the Registrar of Plant Variety Rights on policy matters, particularly the selection of the types of crops which warrant recommendation to the Australian Agricultural Council for inclusion in the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The original draft Plant Variety Rights Bill of 1979, the presentation of which was under the direction of the former Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair , provided for the establishment of a 13 member committee for this purpose. It was prescribed that the committee would not be entitled to any remuneration or allowances. It is my understanding that certain primary industry organisations objected to that provision and lobbied the Government saying that they were not really going to go along with it. Since that time they have had a second look at it. I know of many primary industry organisations which believe that it is essential that there be such an advisory committee. I refer to nurserymen, orchardists and certain seed producers.

<PARA> (2) Clause 3, page 2, after the definition of ''Department'' insert the following definition:</PARA>
<PARA> '' 'description' means a comprehensive botanical cataloguing of attributes as well as a quantative and qualitative assessment of the variety's characteristics from a commercial, environmental and nutritional point of view, where appropriate;''. </PARA>
<PARA>What the Opposition is saying, consistent with our second reading amendment and the general thrust of our position in the debate on this whole question, is that the word 'description' needs to be properly defined. We have been suggesting all through the debate that there should be some scheme of merit or performance testing, and, in terms of the actual description of the varieties being put to the Registrar for assessment, we say that the legislation should set out just what has to be described, that is, the qualities and characteristics of the allegedly new variety. Implicit in the amendment and consistent with the list of amendments that I am putting forward on behalf of the Opposition is the view that the applicant who is putting up the new variety should provide all the information. In other words, it is at cost to the applicant. What we are saying is that the word 'description' should be defined in the legislation as meaning a comprehensive botanical cataloguing of attributes as well as a quantatitive and qualitative assessment of the variety's characteristics from a commercial, environmental and nutritional point of view, where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> In my comments in the second reading debate I said that of course in respect of many varieties of ornamentals and flora culture there is simply no need for there to be commercial, environmental and nutritional description criteria or performance test at all. In these areas people are dealing with diversity and differences, and there is simply no need for that sort of description. That is why I am saying that there should be a description only where appropriate. If there were any problem the advisory committee, which the Opposition sought to establish by amendment but which amendment was voted against by the Parliament, could have provided advice to the Secretary, the Registrar or the Minister, again where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot see why the Government cannot not possibly accept this amendment. It is very important with respect to new varieties of cereals and food crops which farmers will buy to make money, that the commercial characteristics should be known along with their reaction to disease and the various climatic stresses. These things should be known. The applicant himself should incorporate the information in his description of the variety. As I also pointed out in my speech in the second reading debate, at present wheat breeders have to supply enormous documentation. They have to engage in many trials. They have to engage in comparisons with other wheat varieties before the variety is accepted by a State government and before it becomes a variety for varietal control purposes and then sells through the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I was not able to hear everything that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) said in relation to the amendment. I understand that this clause is the instigating clause, if I can put it that way, for a form of merit testing and on that basis I suppose it is reasonable for me to debate his remarks. The Government parties rural committee that I chair takes the view that the job of the Federal Government is to legislate as broadly and as loosely as possible within our constitutional framework. It takes the view that if any unevenness of opinion exists from State to State they should pick up such unevenness and act accordingly. Insofar as that is true it would seem to me quite an inane proposition to include new floral species, beautiful shrubs and trees as subjects of merit testing. If the Committee were to accept that proposition-I think that it holds a certain amount of merit-one would then argue that, considering the experience of other countries, one would question the whole matter of forms of testing. For instance , it is true to say that the form of merit testing which exists in the United Kingdom today-it includes advisory boards and other bodies which come to decisions under the system of royalty payments-is becoming bogged down. As you know, Mr Deputy Chairman, there is nothing worse than a system which becomes bogged down. If I might say so, nothing comes out at the other end. This is one of the problems with the royalty payments system which currently applies in the United Kingdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I described during the afternoon, quite an issue has been made of royalties. As I understand the Bill which is before the Committee, no such question of royalties arises. That would rarely apply to the process here. All that will happen under this legislation is that an inventor will request a patent right on the production of a new species, seed or plant. If the request is acceptable to the Australian Agricultural Council-bearing in mind that under the terms of the Bill at this stage no old species are to be accepted-the patent right on that species will allow the breeder, having gone through the process that I have so described, to breed up the plant, species or seed that he has invented. When he has bred that up and has produced sufficient numbers to market it he will have the problem of pricing his community on the market. At this early stage no old species or seeds are included in the PVR legislation. In the early stages a breeder can put only his new species on the market according to the dictates of the market place. If the breeder puts too much kudos on his invention people will not buy it. If he emphasises its competitiveness-presumably with the idea that it is more beautiful, more productive or softer to walk on, depending on the species-perhaps people will buy it. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Committee of an example produced at a seminar held on Monday. The example was a new species of Brussels sprouts which was planted in the vegetable growing areas of England and selling at around 40 times the cost of the usual variety of Brussels sprouts. The fact is that in that instance the cost of the seed as a proportion of the cost of the production of the Brussels sprouts was relatively small. Those who took the gamble and paid more for that seed finished up a tonne to the acre-or whatever the blazes the final result was-better off in terms of cost. This is really what the Bill is about. I do not see much point in merit testing unless the State governments want to adopt unevenness of opinion. Having listened to Mr Amos from Tasmania and to others, I think that the State governments will decide that some form of testing should apply to certain varieties. I suggest to the Committee that one should not allow that line of thinking to intrude on the fact that the Federal legislation must be broad and general, and it is. I suggest, along those lines, there is not a great deal of merit in the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin). The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) has just put forward an argument that the United Kingdom, after 15 years' experience of its plant variety rights legislation, has reached the stage when its merit testing procedure is becoming bogged down. In view of overseas experience and the fact that the United Kingdom is running into problems, and because the Plant Variety Rights Bill lacks a clause covering description-that was outlined by the honourable member for Werriwa-it would seem to me that we should support the principle of withdrawing this Bill and having another look at it. It cannot be said that the way to avoid problems which have developed in another part of the world-it has occurred in the United Kingdom with merit testing-is to take away relevant parts of the legislation and hope that the system, through market forces, can overcome the problem of its own accord. I would like to see some evidence of that before voting for such a Bill. We are adopting legislation which just omits reference to areas in which problems exist overseas, rather than logically coming up with an answer to the problems. I think that is a poor way of bringing forward legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The definition as described by the Opposition should be taken into consideration. This is another reason that our argument should be seriously considered. We should not go ahead with legislation when solid arguments against it are coming forward both from the Opposition and the public. I have no doubt that when the farming community has a good look at this legislation and takes into consideration the problems that are involved it too will want us to take the line that we are taking. More time is needed to develop a proper Bill. I strongly support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa. I reject the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Wakefield. I do not think that by deleting a clause such as this, which basically deals with a type of merit testing, we will answer the problem of merit testing and the clogging up of the system overseas. I think that we need to have a further look at this legislation before we can possibly guarantee that it will work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am terribly sorry about that. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) once told me that some people have difficulty in that area; it is to do with their intelligence. With due respect, if the honourable member would listen it might do him some good. As I pointed out previously, Australia has a Federal system of government and responsibility lies with various governments. The responsibility of this Government is to produce a system whereby patents can be granted. If merit testing is considered necessary, the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) will have the very simple task of convincing the Premier of Victoria-to whom he no doubt has quite easy access, as a party colleague-that merit testing should be carried out. Similarly, any of the New South Wales members here can do the same in their State. It is a job for State departments of agriculture if it is needed, and it is a decision for State governments. It has nothing to do with the granting of a patent. I beg the Opposition to get back on to the subject of this Bill. Basically, it is contained in the first four lines of the Minister's second reading speech. We are now bringing in furphies and red herrings by getting into this area. If the honourable member believes in merit testing, he can convince John Cain or his State Minister for Agriculture and no doubt with his connections he should be able to fix it with no trouble at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the question of merit testing is an essential component of legislation concerning plant variety rights. I have very serious reservations about the concept of plant variety rights anyway. I am not satisfied, and I am surprised that members on the Government benches would suggest that they are concerned about the interests of rural producers, in particular that they would oppose the suggestion that when plant developers, plant inventors or variety inventors are seeking plant variety rights benefits, they should at the same time be given some responsibility to finance the merit testing of those particular new varieties. It is not sufficient, and it will not be sufficient, to have the distinct, uniform, stable requirements satisfied. In fact at present in the United States of America there are apparently 170 different patented varieties of soya bean. I am not sure whether they are all on the market but there are 170 varieties. It was suggested by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) that the question of testing should be the responsibility of State government departments of agriculture. At present it is estimated that it would cost $15,000 to carry out merit testing on just one new variety. If there are 170 varieties of soya bean and on average it cost $15,000 to merit test a new variety, it means that for soya bean alone, for those varieties that are already registered in the US, it will cost the various State departments of agriculture $2.5m. The suggestion that State government departments of agriculture should be responsible for that sort of expenditure, when massive benefits will be involved for those people who take out plant variety rights, is absurd in the extreme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At present State departments of agriculture meet the expectations of many of our rural producers and provide them with advice about the relative merits of various crops. If anyone is to be responsible for undertaking the type of testing that should be undertaken, it should be those people who are to benefit most from acquiring plant variety rights. I speak not only in connection with those particular products. Some honourable members from the Government side suggested earlier that we leave it to the wise, sound and good judgment of rural producers. I am not questioning their judgment. I am satisfied that in their own game they are qualified and competent people. But there is no one in this House who can convince me that in the first place any farmer in Australia will find it possible to assess from his own experience 170 different varieties of soya bean. The suggestion is just damned ridiculous. I do not speak only in connection with those products where results are looked for in the first year of planting. What about plants that take some years to reach the point where they start to yield? It will be some years before we can judge the success of the very expensive advertising to which fruit trees, for instance, have been subjected to convince people that the particular qualities of one plant exceed all the others. Let the plant developers and plant inventors use some of their advertising funds for merit testing in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) were genuinely concerned about rural producers in Australia he would be building into this legislation a guarantee that there will be merit testing, so that adequate advice can be given and that that merit testing will be contributed to by those people who will reap the benefits. Do not try to tell me that the people that the National Country Party members purport to represent will find themselves in a beneficial position as a result of this legislation. They will not. For example, there is no guarantee that any of the varieties on the list of overseas plants that have been refused to Australia because we do not have plant variety rights legislation will be suitable to the great range of environmental conditions that exist in Australia at the moment. In fact, there are very serious doubts that those people who have been seeking those varieties overseas are satisfied at this stage. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the people who have been saying that they have not been able to obtain plant varieties overseas in fact are not completely satisfied that those varieties will do the job that it is hoped that they will do. We will find out. It will be very interesting. When this plant variety rights legislation goes through we will keep a check on that list provided by the Department of Primary Industry and we will see just how many of the varieties listed measure up to expectations. That is the justification for it at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Rural producers, horticulturists and ornamental plant growers in Australia are being sold down the drain. We are not providing them with any guarantee that, with the confusing array and multitude of plants that will be thrust before them accompanied by expensive advertising promotion, there will be someone in a position to give sound and wise advice about the relative merits. I congratulate the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) for the time, effort and competence that he has applied to this matter. Compared with the comments that we have had from the Government side, his contribution would put him so far ahead that honourable members on the Government side would not even be able to see him. This amendment is of fundamental importance. If the Government is fair dinkum about rural producers, horticulturists and ornamental plant growers in Australia , it will accept the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to misquote the honourable member. If he is hurt by my suggestion that he called farmers mugs, I will withdraw it. To me, every implication was that that was what he was saying. The honourable member for Hunter and others on the Opposition side seem to be concerned that farmers are not able to make commercial judgments about the value of seed provided to them. Let me give an experience in my own district where we grow a lot of sweet corn. Three or four years ago 30 varieties of sweet corn were grown by a few farmers to test their merits. As a result of those tests we went into seed production and have been selling seed and providing a great deal of Australia's seed requirements. There are no plant variety rights that give us any particular rights to do that. It so happens that it is being done. Farmers will have that capacity to test for themselves any claims made about new seeds or plant varieties that come on the market-place. The fact is that to put merit testing into this scheme would choke it up in the way the honourable member for Hunter described. It would become an impossibility. The best test of merit is in the market-place. Let it go to the market-place. The Government does not accept the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown), for whom I have a deal of regard, made the statement that he will not listen to anybody in this House if that person is trying to convince him about the Plant Variety Rights Bill. Let me describe the difficulty that the Government is in in relation to the Bill. Soya beans have nothing to do with the clause, Mr Deputy Chairman, but allow me to follow the honourable member for a minute. He referred to the fact that there are 170 species of soya beans in America. I think he is a little under; that there are more. The fact that we have none of the newer varieties of soya bean in Australia is probably the single most important example. We do not have these soya beans in this country, and we should, because we do not have PVR legislation. However, let us leave that aside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty the Government is in, having some understanding of the ramifications of the Bill, is that so many of the opposing forces have no understanding of it. The honourable member for Hunter-I know him; he is a decent bloke, an honourable fellow-argued that State departments may have to test 170 varieties of soya bean. This demonstrates the complete lack of knowledge of so many people about this Bill, about the factors that are involved in strain variety selection of soya bean-or anything else for that matter. Does it grow in a neutral pH? Honourable members opposite would not know what a pH of seven is from a bar of Burfords. Does it grow at a high or low level of activity? Does it grow in high, medium or low rainfall? Does it grow in alkaline or acid soil reactions? Does it grow when moisture is a limitation because the subsoil is six feet below the surface or will this particular variety grow when the subsoil is only 18 inches below the surface?</PARA>
<PARA> State departments that want to test soya bean-I take up the honourable member's example-will not test 170 varieties. If they are agriculturalists they will know the areas and limitations. They know the limitations of the ones they can ignore . In Tasmania one would be lucky if perhaps 10 varieties of American soya beans were tested. In South Australia, where the rainfall and soil conditions are quite different, one might not have to test more than five. In a very kindly fashion I say that the problem of this debate is that so many people do not know what they are talking about and until they do I cannot see much chance of achieving cogent argument in this place. I do not set myself up as being a doyen in this matter but we have to know and trust the people who know what they are talking about. To do anything else is patently absurd and not to the credit of this chamber or the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> '(5A) The Secretary may grant a right to a variety originated overseas, where such overseas legislation allows the registration of discoveries, on the advice of the Advisory Committee.'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition feels very strongly about these amendments. The first amendment relates to clause 33 which is headed 'Protection of public interest in new plant varieties'. Throughout clause 33 appear the words 'reasonable requirements'. For example, the clause contains the words: 'For the purposes of this section, the reasonable requirements of the public', 'where there is no demand or significant demand', 'reasonable prices' and 'reasonable quality'. This wording appears throughout the clause. Value judgments have to be made about reasonable requirements. I am not quite sure who will assess what is reasonable or what is significant or what is sufficient. It seems to me that unless we have some definition or unless somebody advises the Minister, Secretary or Registrar, it will be very difficult to determine what is reasonable at law. That is why we are proposing that these words, as they are used in clause 33, should be assessed by the advisory committee. That is why we have moved an amendment to clause 3 which is the clause dealing with definitions. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 4 relates very closely to lobbying by orchardists and a broad range of agricultural producers. I accept that there is some problem in respect of constitutionality. Perhaps the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) can advise me in this regard. Many people are saying that discoveries should be able to be registered and given patent rights. I do not agree with that. I think that would be quite against the whole idea of patent rights. I cannot quite understand people putting a case on behalf of Australian native plants. An Australian native plant is a native plant. It is not new. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it cannot be registered-it is not a discovery. I just cannot see any reason why an Australian native plant should be regarded any more differently than some basic genetic material such as a wild wheat strain or a wild maize strain or whatever. However, I am informed that there are some plant variety systems which register discoveries. If that is so and a horticulturist wishes to get in a variety that is virtually a discovery that is registered under a plant variety right overseas, I do not see why that Australian producer or orchardist should be denied such a variety. We believe that both of these matters should be incorporated in the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government cannot accept the amendments and I will give the reasons why. The word 'reasonable' is to be used by the Registrar and it was chosen on advice from the Attorney- General's Department. We believe it is applicable in this case. It is very difficult to find words better than those advised to us. In respect of amendment No. 4, the situation is that if any overseas variety is a discovery it probably would be unconstitutional to register it. I think that is the point worrying the honourable member for Werriwa. If it were not a discovery the amendment would be unnecessary anyway. So the Government does not accept either of the Opposition's amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has very quickly moved over the protection of public interest section of the Bill and the definition of 'reasonable'. I think the reasonable requirement of the public is something that needs a little more consideration than the Minister has given. The Bill as it is worded is open to interpretation. The words 'reasonable ', 'significant' and 'sufficient' are very much open to the political and directional interpretation of government. Many cases can be brought forward in which there is no demand or no significant demand for plants of a certain variety. What is meant by the words 'there is no demand or no significant demand '? One would think that the words 'no demand' would be sufficient. Why do the words 'or no significant demand' have to be included? What is meant by that? For instance, as I said in my speech to the second reading of the Bill, companies which bring in vegetable varieties from overseas are allowed, because of the structure of farming today, to set up a tier structure whereby they can control everything from the production of the seed right down to the final product. How are we going to judge what is meant by 'significant demand' for plants of that variety? Are we saying here that provided the company makes seed available to certified growers and that those certified growers then satisfy the demand of that company for that product nobody else has a right to that product? Are we saying that that is a significant demand or is there a public reasonable requirement? There does not seem to be any logic in the wording. The wording, as it is at present, virtually involves a political decision as to what is considered to be reasonable. If the government of the day believes in the free enterprise private system a large company, with a tier system from top to bottom , might restrict certain seed to certified growers. It could direct the contract growers to buy from those certified seed growers. Would that be a reasonable requirement in the public interest? Is that considered to be a significant demand?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to refer now to the words 'in sufficient quantities to meet demand' to meet the market. But what market? The market of the public interest or the market of that company? A situation has developed in agriculture today to which I would like to draw attention. Once upon a time a product such as potatoes was grown, boiled and offered to the public. The farmer was paid a dollar plus a bit of profit and that was all it cost the public. Under today's mechanism for potato production a company puts a product out to a certified seed producer, the certified seed producer than provides it to a contract grower, and that contract grower then puts that product into a store in Victoria. Three or four months later those potatoes are hauled all the way to Sydney where they are put through a machine. They are put into paper bags and taken all the way back again to the little shop right beside the factory. The public is paying $8,000 a tonne for those potatoes and the grower gets $140 a tonne. The total system we are setting up, which this legislation is going to protect, means that $8,000 of the consumers money has to be spent for $140 to get into the farmer's pocket. Are we going to protect that type of system right down the line and make it such that there is no competition whatever?</PARA>
<PARA> The amendment which has been moved indicates that for the purpose of the Act the meaning of 'reasonable', 'significant', and 'sufficient' needs to be clear. Does this legislation mean that under this Government the private enterprise system, as it is set up in this structure, will allow a company to put a case forward that the reasonable requirements of the public are being looked after simply because those products are going through the system and all the way back to the kids in the form of chips? Do we mean that if somebody else wants that product an advisory committee, the establishment of which is not provided in the Bill, will make a direction that the product must be made available to the public? I do not think that the legislation is clear enough. I do not think that the words 'reasonable requirement', 'significant demand' or 'sufficient quantities' are good enough. We are allowing individual people to make decisions sometimes outside this country about what is sufficient demand and what the requirement should be. I fully support the amendment. As I said in the debate on the second reading of this Bill, I think that the Bill at this stage, because of the way it is structured, needs to be looked at again in the public interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) repeated some of the logic that he put to the House in the debate on the second reading of this Bill. He understands what he is trying to say from the point of view of his own electorate. I acknowledge that fact. But what he is really saying to the House at this point is that problems exist in his electorate now which have absolutely nothing to do with plant variety rights. On balance, he has to make up his mind whether plant variety rights would accentuate the difficulty faced by his electorate now. I am of the opinion, whether it be right or wrong, that plant variety rights legislation will make available to growers in his electorate a huge number of increased varieties. He may take the opposite view. I leave that comment with him because I do not think that he did his case much good when he described his problem today. His problem has nothing to do with the Bill before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason I rise to speak in this debate is to ask the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) whether he said that interested groups should have access to international varieties. I think that is what I heard him say. I congratulate him if that is what he said. It is more than I expected to hear at this stage. Perhaps there is some hope for the Bill if the honourable member for Werriwa was sincere when he made that statement. I refer to clause 33 which is before the Committee. It does not have anything to do with clause 29 although when the honourable member for Werriwa was speaking earlier I thought it did. Clause 29 deals with certain conditions that may be imposed on the granting of rights where the public interest is involved. The clause before the Committee does not deal with that. Under clause 29 problems arising with plant varieties like prickly pear and lantana which grows in Queensland and a whole wide variety of beautiful garden species can be dealt with. These matters are covered by State legislation concerning weeds. Clause 29 gives the Minister overriding powers. He may seek to stop the seeded variety of kikuya entering the wet areas of Australia. For that sort of reason the Minister has carte blanche powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 33 with which we are dealing now simply gives the assurance that sufficient quantities of plants, plant material or seeds of registered varieties are made available to meet the reasonable demands of the public for that variety . The Minister has touched on this point. I do not know how else the word ' reasonable' can be defined. As the Minister said, the word 'reasonable' has been used on the advice of the legal boys in the Government as the best word to cover the intention of the Government. I hope that no honourable member in the chamber questions the integrity of the Government in relation to the use of the word ' reasonable'. This is the best word that can be used. Honourable members opposite have my assurance as far as I can give it, that that provision will be abided by . I do not see any substance in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa to this particular clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), of course, does not have the same degree of substance as the earlier amendment. It concerns me that a rational and sensible suggestion of this kind should not be accepted by the Government. The terms 'reasonable', ' significant' and 'sufficient' which are used are subjective terms. Someone finally will have to determine just what those terms mean. The alternatives are that we have it assessed by the proposed advisory committee or perhaps, depending upon the response of the Government, by some other authority involved with plant variety rights; or it can be finally determined by the courts. If it is the wish of the Government to have an Act which will encourage litigation by people who may have cause to be offended by the way in which the provisions of the Act are applied then so be it. But here is an opportunity for the Government to avoid litigation, to remove the doubtful subjectivity that is involved in those terms and to ensure that a responsible authority will have the legal power to determine the meaning of 'reasonable', 'significant' and 'sufficient'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The comments made by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) sound fine except for the fact that the committee proposed in the Opposition's amendment will be given the grand power to decide what 'reasonable', 'significant' and 'sufficient' mean in terms of each and every application. It will be a semi-judicial body. All the Opposition is suggesting is that on every occasion we will have in place a committee, whose members will have legal training or legal advice to make decisions of this nature. If the committee comprised a group of nurserymen I doubt that they would have legal qualifications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand the Bill, the Secretary will have that right. I believe the Secretary will be the right person to make that decision. I cannot see how we can use any other words. The words that have been referred to are commonly used in Acts of Parliament. Words such as 'reasonable' and 'significant' are used when a number cannot be put on things. They are the type of words which I think fit this Bill because of its diversity. I do not think for a minute that we could have a group of plant-oriented experts sitting in judgment on the question of what is 'reasonable'. There is certainly no one better than the Secretary to decide that question. If the Secretary were not able to make that decision it would be left to a court of the land, and basically what the Opposition is suggesting is the creation of a new court. </PARA>

This amendment has the effect of saying that 13 heads may be better than one head in many cases. I mainly wanted to speak on some of the points made by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) but he has now left the chamber. It is obvious that he did not hear my comments earlier this afternoon when I spoke during the debate on the second reading of the Plant Variety Rights Bill. I referred to the various measures that the Opposition sees as essential before it can agree to this Bill. We still believe a need exists for a select committee to gather a lot more evidence on the public record. Even if a committee were not formed the Opposition would still insist on amending the Bill to put it in the form of decent plant variety rights legislation for Australia's agricultural producers. Of course, we would like to see Australian producers and horticulturalists gain access to new varieties. I said that in my speech on the second reading of the Bill.

I point out to the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) in particular that the Bill provides for an appeal system. If one examines clause 44 one will see that anybody who is not satisfied with the judgment taken by the Secretary can have that judgment tested openly.

Rights could not be granted for simple discoveries; for example, when there is no element of invention. I might add that most overseas PVR schemes are wider than this and, as far as I am aware, all allow the granting of a right for discovered varieties .

<PARA>This amendment seeks to insert a new clause, clause 5A.

What I am seeking to establish now is a sort of advisory committee of 13 people, which the Opposition thinks should be set up. I have set out the powers of that committee. As this proposition has already been rejected by the Government, there is no sense in putting it to a vote again. However, despite what the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) said in answer to us previously, I stress that the original Bill drafted in 1979 under the direction of the then Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair, included the requirement that there be an advisory committee. I stress that nearly every industry organisation to which I have spoken sees the need for an advisory committee and the main proponents of the PVR scheme in Australia also see this need. Frankly, farmers, horticulturists and other such people want to be represented in some way on a committee giving advice to the Government on the continued running and administration of any plant variety rights system. Many of the plant breeding systems for the various industries already have advisory committees, whereby farmers-they pay levies in some cases, and in other cases they do not pay levies -and plant breeders have access to the Government, to universities or to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, or whoever is concerned with plant breeding. That is why we say that there should be an advisory committee. </PARA>

<PARA>It looks to the Opposition as though the intention of that provision is to preclude any person from using his position to apply for a plant right. Yet he or she could get one by gift. It seems to me that this is an open invitation for favours to be bestowed. I do not understand why those three words, 'except by gift', appear in the Bill. The Opposition suggests that they should be deleted. </PARA>

<PARA>There has been quite some discussion on the definition of fodder. I think there is some reference to that in other clauses of the Bill. The amendment relates to sub-clause 9 (1). As the Bill stands, there is the danger that someone could be denied the right to sell reproductive material which is not intended for reproduction. In other words, hay has seeds in it and, if sold, it could come under the ambit of this clause. We feel that this needs to be clarified. Reproductive material can be sold without it being intended for reproduction. Bean shoots are covered further on in the Bill. That points to the same principle I am trying to identify. </PARA>

<PARA> (10) Clause 10, page 5, at the end of sub-clause (3) add 'by a two-thirds majority'. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the contentions of many people both opposed to and in favour of this Bill is that changes to the eventual Act should be by way of amendment to the Act rather than simply by way of regulation. The Opposition believes, as do the people who have lobbied us on this matter, that such an important Act of Parliament needs to have some review and that there need to be amendments to the Act to give Parliament a chance to review the continued working and administration of the Act and to make assessments on, for example, the recommendations of the Australian Agricultural Council particularly for the inclusion of the species. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment to clause 10 refers to the Australian Agricultural Council . The Opposition wishes simply to insert the requirement that any decision by the Agricultural Council with respect to the declaration of a genus or a species to which this legislation applies should be by a two-thirds majority of the Council. It has been put to us by many people that any agreement by the Australian Agricultural Council should be unanimous. There has been quite a deal of debate about the word 'unanimous' with respect to the Australian Agricultural Council. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) says that he has never used the word 'unanimous' with respect to the workings of the Agricultural Council and plant variety rights. Whether that is so or not, it is the clear recollection of many people that the whole question of plant variety rights would not have proceeded unless the Australian Agricultural Council had come to a unanimous decision. In particular, Mr Hallam, the New South Wales State Minister, has taken great exception to the fact that the Bill was held up, mainly because of objections by Western Australia's Country Party Minister, until the 8 February meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council. At that time, the Western Australian Minister agreed I understand with some reservations , that the Plant Variety Rights Bill should go ahead. There was reference also to the inclusion of species by regulation. Again that is what I understand; I am not privy to the deliberations of the Australian Agricultural Council. Even so, putting these things to the side, the Opposition does not believe that to insert the word 'unanimous' is very constructive. Looking at the composition of the Agricultural Council, I do not think we will ever get a unanimous decision on some of these questions. We feel that a two-thirds majority covers that point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendments moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin). As I mentioned in my speech at the second reading stage, the Plant Variety Rights Bill is very important for plant breeding and for the provision of foods for the Australian people. As the House of Representatives is a people's House it seems important that any amendments to the legislation should come before this place and not be subject just to regulation. With regard to the majority vote of the Australian Agricultural Council, one can see that with a simple majority quite a small minority of the Australian people, as represented by the majority of Ministers, could approve inclusion in the Act of certain plant variety rights. That seems to be quite improper. It is vital that the majority of Australian people be represented and agree to the inclusion of plant variety rights.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to support both the Opposition amendments . I am concerned that the Parliament was advised by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) that this legislation was introduced largely as a result of a recommendation from the Australian Agricultural Council. The Australian Agricultural Council is purely a ministerial consultative body. It established a working party which investigated plant variety rights. After the Bill was first introduced in May of last year I wrote to the Minister asking for details concerning, for example, the types of plant varieties which had been excluded from Australia, which had been denied to Australia, as a result of our not having PVR legislation. I am not suggesting for a moment that the paucity of detail in the response from the Minister reflected the information which was available to him or to his advisers, but it could well have suggested that that was the amount of information available to the Minister and to the Government in connection with legislation which they were introducing. However, the people in the Minister's Department have now provided a lot of useful information in the kit made available. The Bill was introduced originally, I think, on 7 May last year. It was not until Thursday or Friday of last week that this information kit containing that fairly comprehensive list of things that had been excluded, was made available to me. In the first place the legislation resulted from recommendations from the Australian Agricultural Council. But that is not all of the picture. I contacted the Australian Agricultural Council and asked whether I could have a copy of the report of the working party. That was the body set up to investigate the proposal and make recommendations to the Minister. On the basis of those recommendations the Minister had legislation prepared, which subsequently was brought to the Parliament. As a parliamentary representative I was expected then, as I still am, to make my position clear by the way in which I vote-on the basis of a report, from a working party of a ministerial consultative committee, which has been denied me. That is not good enough by far . Our suggestion is that changes be made not by regulation but by amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second amendment proposes that the response of the Australian Agricultural Council should be expressed by way of a two-thirds majority. Under the Bill no requirement is imposed, by either the Government or the Parliament, on the Australian Agricultural Council concerning the way in which it shall arrive at the decision or recommendation that it is to bring forward. Apparently the Council is to have authority to determine the way in which its decision will be made. The Council could well decide that a unanimous vote would be necessary. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has already indicated how impractical that would be. Alternatively, the Council could decide that a two- thirds majority, or even a simple majority, would be required. However, when a ministerial consultative body is given powers and responsibilities in connection with legislation that members of this Parliament are expected to support, the Parliament itself should have greater input. Parliament should indicate to the Council, by way of the second of the amendments, that a two-thirds majority shall be required-not leave it to the council to decide. Certainly, any changes made should be by way of amendment to this legislation, so that we may consider them. There has already been too much of the kind of situation in which honourable members are expected to make decisions, as I have already indicated, on the basis of a report of a working party which is denied them on the ground that it is confidential. That should not be accepted by any member of this Parliament. It represents an inexcusable and intolerable situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the point made by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown), I am sorry that I am not able to make available to him the working papers of the Australian Agricultural Council, which consists of but one Commonwealth Minister and all of the State Ministers responsible for agriculture. They are masters of all they survey, just as I am master of all I survey, and they do not take the view that the working papers they use in coming to a conclusion should be distributed- rather, that they should be held by the Council itself. There is nothing that I can do about that. I can only ask the honourable member for Hunter to have regard for the Bill itself and the position that the Council has reached in respect of its clauses. I ask the honourable member to try to accept the Bill on its merits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government cannot accept the two amendments that have been proposed. If it did it would be necessary to return to the Parliament whenever a change was accepted by the Agricultural Council. This legislation is really a creature of the States. We are but the vehicle for its passage. It will be used by the State governments and their departments of agriculture. I do not believe that the State Ministers would take lightly, having made a decision on a matter in accordance with what they believe to be their sovereign right, this Parliament's sitting over them with a shotgun. They would view that approach with concern. Therefore, on behalf of my State colleagues, I cannot accept the first amendment . </PARA>
<PARA> As to the second, which suggests that a two-thirds majority of the Council should be necessary in deciding these matters, with great respect I do not believe that it is appropriate for this Parliament to tell the Council how to run its business. Our imposing here, centrally, a requirement that there be a two-thirds majority would be received with great alarm by State Ministers of Agriculture. Therefore, I would have to reject that proposition also. If the Council decides to accept it, it is open to the Council to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of unanimity that has been raised by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin). I have never used the word 'unanimous', and in that proposition I believe I am supported by all of the State Ministers except the New South Wales Minister, who continues to claim that I used it. It is true that I delayed the Bill on one occasion, but I did so not because I was seeking unanimous acceptance of it, rather as part of the process of discussion and consideration. At a number of Agricultural Council meetings I have delayed progress on the Bill to accede to the requirements of several State Ministers, expressed in their own way. I tried to meet their requests and requirements before presenting the Bill to the Parliament. I regret that the Government cannot accept the two proposed amendments. </PARA>

<PARA> (11) Clause 11, paragraph (b), omit 'the regulations', substitute 'an amendment of this Act'. </PARA>
<PARA> (12) Clause 11, sub-paragraph (b) (i), omit '6', substitute '10'. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendment No. 11 seeks to omit the words 'the regulations'. As the Committee has already voted on that matter, I will not say any more. There is no sense in going through the same argument. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of Opposition amendment No. 12, orchardists have been very vocal in their opposition to the six-year requirement and the Opposition is proposing a 10-year period. We think it is unrealistic to exclude from registration certain types of fruit trees, forest trees and ornamental trees which have been available commercially in another country for a period greater than six years. Many types of fruit trees require from seven to 10 years to reach the stage of commercial cropping so as to assess their potential value. A similar situation exists with most forest species and certain ornamentals. Accordingly, it is considered that the period of six years specified in the Bill for prior growth in another country should be extended to 10 years. The period of four years which is specified for other crops is probably adequate for commercial evaluation. I think I have made my point clear. It takes at least six years for the value of a fruit tree to be assessed. If this substitute clause is left as it is Australian growers will have to arrange for every variety that is covered by plant protection overseas to be imported into Australia so that they do not miss the one-in-50 chance of an outstanding variety. I think this will place an intolerable strain on our method of handling this influx, given our quarantine arrangements. If a plant variety from another country is not subject to a plant protection Act overseas then that variety should not be allowed to be protected in Australia. I have already covered this point as well. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6A7">Mr FALCONER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Casey)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.29)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) who, in support of his proposal to extend the six-year period to 10 years , talked about the possible need for Australian orchardists to have to import stock even before it has been evaluated, I would just make the comment that I think Australian orchardists, agricultural departments and research institutes would want to import material as quickly as they can in any event to ensure that they have the genetic material available to work on in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I want to say some things more generally about the view that many small orchardists and growers in Australia have about the need to obtain material from overseas. One of the arguments that has frequently been put against plant variety rights legislation is that it supposedly plays into the hands of the large multinationals and will lead to a concentration of power in the agricultural industry. The point I want to make is that many of the small growers and small associations strongly urge the introduction of plant variety rights legislation so that they can have access to material from overseas. I want to quote some remarks of a few growers from around my area-the outer eastern region of Melbourne-who have put views on this subject. Mr Bill Aumann presented a paper at the Orchardists and Fruit Cool Stores Association of Victoria symposium in November 1979. Mr Aumann is an orchardist in my area. He made the point that overseas research stations and private plant breeders are nearly all patenting their new releases and will not supply these to Australia until legislation protecting their propagation rights is introduced. It is interesting that he said:</PARA>
<PARA> New Zealand growers placed nectarines on the Melbourne and Sydney markets this year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, 1979-</PARA>
<PARA> These were superior patented varieties that are not available in Australia at the moment and if the Australian growers wish to retain and expand their markets , then the sooner they can grow these improved varieties the better. </PARA>
<PARA> He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian grower is denied the opportunity to grow improved fruit varieties, the temptation to smuggle these varieties into the country (it has happened before) becomes very great and then we have the problem of no quarantine and the associated risk of bringing into this country diseases we definitely don't want, such as fire blight, Western-X, Plum pox, etc. </PARA>
<PARA>The point he made relates to something that was debated on an earlier clause- that is, the desirability or otherwise of merit testing. Mr Aumann made the point very clearly that the market is giving very accurate and very rapid information on which varieties are desirable in Australia and the extent to which Australian growers are slipping behind. I wish to quote the comments of two other gentlemen from the Victorian Cherry Association and the Silvan and District Growers Association, Mr D. M. Moon and Mr W. S. Barker. Those two associations operate basically in my electorate and the electorate of La Trobe. They represent a wide variety of small growers. In a joint letter Mr Moon and Mr Barker stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There have of course been improved varieties developed with public funds in Australia but naturally enough these tend to be high-value crops such as cereals . </PARA>
<PARA> Our initial concern is basically with deciduous fruit trees which are vegetatively propagated species and protected by PVR just as seed crops are. </PARA>
<PARA>In a letter to some local newspapers they made some comments about the work of the Victorian Department of Agriculture. They went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>However, on the whole, the only overseas varieties available are those not protected by PVR or where the patent has run out. This, coupled with rigorous quarantine procedures and local field evaluation of varieties, although essential, results in long delays between release overseas and availability here . </PARA>
<PARA> For example, dessert peach varieties recently released here have been available for at least 10 years in the USA and in that country have largely been superseded by improved varieties. For the past two years, we have been competing in the market with top quality American varieties of nectarines grown in New Zealand under that country's PVR scheme but still unavailable to us. </PARA>
<PARA>The further body I want to quote is the Eastern Metropolitan Fruitgrowers Association. This body has also expressed a view on this subject in a letter to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). A copy was sent to me. In July 1980 the Association said:</PARA>
<PARA> As stated in the enclosed submission, we are of the opinion that the necessary legislation to introduce PVR to the Australian agricultural scene is long overdue and that it is now time to align ourselves with most of the other countries of the world who have this type of legislation and can take advantage of it by an interchange of varieties between countries subject to the necessary quarantine restrictions. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that in this country, we are going to be left behind as far as an upgrading of fruit varieties is concerned, unless we have the PVR legislation introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that indicates that growers are very keen to gain access to genetic material from overseas as quickly as possible. They and their growers association will waste no time in ensuring that they import any material from overseas that looks even vaguely interesting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess the matter raised by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) amounts to a matter of judgment. The first thing to remember is that two years have to elapse before the six-year term applies. That would be a total of eight years as against the period which he was suggesting of ten years. It is really a matter of judgment as to which is the better. The advice we have-it seems to be accepted generally- is that the length of time which I am proposing is satisfactory. Therefore, I would have to reject the Opposition's amendment to my amendment. The other Opposition amendment which relates to the matter coming back to the Parliament to be altered by Act of Parliament instead of by regulation was dealt with earlier. I would not wish to press on the Australian Agricultural Council the necessity for the legislation to come back to the Federal Parliament when in its wisdom it believed that any species ought to be accepted.

<PARA>(13A) Characteristics of plant varieties originated outside Australia</PARA>
<PARA> '19A. For the purposes of this Act, where a plant variety in respect of which an application has been made was originated outside Australia, the variety shall not be taken to have a particular characteristic unless-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a test growing of the variety carried out in Australia has demonstrated that the variety has that characteristic;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Secretary is satisfied that-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a test growing of the variety carried out at a place outside Australia has demonstrated that the variety has that characteristic; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the test growing of the variety carried out at that place is equivalent to a test growing of the variety carried out in Australia; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Secretary is satisfied that-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a test growing of the variety carried out outside Australia has demonstrated that the variety has that characteristic;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) any test growing of that variety carried out in Australia would probably demonstrate that the variety has that characteristic; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) if there were to be carried out in Australia a test growing of the variety that would be sufficient to demonstrate whether the variety has that characteristic, that test growing would take longer than 2 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Before granting a right to a variety, the registrar must be satisfied that it is distinct, uniform and stable. It is possible that varieties developed overseas may display new or different characteristics when grown in Australia where soil and climate may vary significantly from the country of origin. Thus the overseas description of that variety may not necessarily be accurate when the variety is grown in Australia. Essentially, this amendment requires overseas varieties to be test grown in Australia. Two exceptions are proposed. The first is where the description is prepared at a place which has conditions similar to Australia. For example, a New Zealand variety of rye grass which is likely to be grown in south-eastern Australia might well be covered by this exemption. A further exemption to the requirement to test grow in Australia will apply when testing would take longer than two years. This would allow registration of valuable fruit trees or grape varieties which might otherwise be delayed by long periods of test growing. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendmends relate to the requirement by the Opposition to have particular characteristics. The word 'characteristics' appears often. Again, it relates back to merit testing, so there is no sense in going through those arguments. We would like some guidance from the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) with respect to his proposed new clause 19A. Are these tests or further tests to be conducted at the cost of the applicant? It is our belief that 'at cost to the applicant' should appear in the Bill to put this matter beyond any contention. The Opposition would welcome the view of the Minister on this point. I do not know whether I should go through the arguments again with respect to the definition of characteristics which we see as being necessary in this clause. However, the Opposition seeks some assurance from the Minister, particularly with respect to the cost to the applicant for these further tests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, it is at the cost of the applicant. That is taken up in clause 45 (c), which we will reach shortly. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has moved amendments Nos. 21, 22, 23 and 24. To add confusion to the matter, the Government is prepared to accept one of the amendments but not the other three. Therefore we need to be very careful in our treatment of those amendments that are accepted and those that are not. The Government has to reject amendment No. 21 as proposed by the honourable member for Werriwa, because it is part of the inclusion of merit as part of the description of the new plant variety. The criteria for new plant variety are distinctiveness, uniformity and stability. The merit will be determined in the market-place. We have heard the arguments before and the Government rejects that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can either accept Opposition amendment No. 22 or amend clause 45 (c) as was proposed in the list distributed earlier. In the interests of uniformity for passing the legislation I had better reject the honourable member's amendment and accept my later one. We can say no to the four amendments rather than confuse the Committee. Amendment No. 23 is again consequent on amendment No. 21. It relates to merit and therefore I must reject it. We have to reject amendment No. 24 for the following reason. Omitting the Secretary's discretion to waive test growing of overseas varieties places considerable strain on bringing in fruit trees because testing would take too long and could create unnecessary work for known varieties such as one from New Zealand. Therefore, we reject the amendment. As I have said, to make it easier we will reject amendment No. 22 moved by the honourable member for Werriwa and hope that he will accept my clause 45 (c). </PARA>

<PARA>This matter was raised earlier by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin). It relates to seed and reproductive material of plants which is frequently sold for purposes other than growing plants. The purpose of clause 31 was to provide for sales for these purposes to be excluded from plant variety rights provisions . The use of the word 'fuel' or 'food' was too restrictive and also gave rise to problems of definition. This proposed amendment is designed to remove any ambiguity and to allow plants or plant material to be sold for any purpose which does not involve the growing of plants. I think that meets the wishes of the honourable member for Werriwa when we were discussing an earlier amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> '(1A) The Advisory Committee will make recommendations to the Secretary, Registrar and Minister on the practical working of this section at yearly intervals.'. </PARA>
<PARA>Again this amendment refers to the advisory committee on which the Committee has already passed judgment. The Opposition still believes that an advisory committee should be set up. We believe that an advisory committee should make recommendations to the Secretary, the registrar and the Minister on the practical working of this proposed section at yearly intervals. Stangely enough some organisations-I think it was the Gippsland Fruit Growers Association and other orchardists associations-believe that some sort of anomaly exists. They really do not wish to press the matter but they believe that if a person buys one tree and pays one royalty there is a right on the tree. That is the reason the royalty is paid. Then that person can propagate as many trees as he likes for his own orchard. Implicit in this clause is the notion that one can propagate protective varieties for one's own use and sell produce of such varieties for consumption purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people feel that that is unfair to the breeder or licence holder of protected varieties. Given the speed with which fruit tree material can be propagated, the Opposition is not prepared to stop that as it is clearly not the intention of the Bill or any subsequent Act to do that. It would have been appropriate for an advisory committee to make recommendations on the practical working of this proposed section at yearly intervals. The Opposition believes that there needs to be a reviewing mechanism whereby the very nuts and bolts of the plant variety rights system, if it is to be established, could be conveyed to the Minister, the Secretary or the Registrar. </PARA>

<PARA> (28) Clause 45, page 22, line 34, omit ''section 20'', substitute ''sections 19A and 20''. </PARA>
<PARA>In order to meet the wishes expressed earlier by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) in relation to costs I have moved amendment No. 28-it has not been circulated-which deals with clause 45 (c). Referring to amendment No. 20, clause 32 states that a grantee is able to licence another person to sell or produce a protected variety. Clause 32, however, would allow the grantee to set whatever terms and conditions he saw fit on the licence. This could result in a conflict with the Trade Practices Act. I am proposing that this clause be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards amendment No. 21, if a grantee takes legal action against a person for an infringement of his plant variety right, that person, the defendant, may make a counter-claim and seek revocation of the right. Clause 35 (2) gives authority for such a counter-claim to be made. The amendment clarifies the grounds on which the claim can be made and gives the court authority to revoke the rights. Amendment No. 22 proposes that the new clause be inserted to make it quite clear that agents, be they solicitors, patent attorneys or private citizens, are free to act on behalf of others in regard to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 23 is another procedural amendment which outlines the mailing procedures to be followed whenever the Secretary or the Registrar is required to forward a document to an applicant or grantee. Documents are to be sent by pre- paid post to the address supplied by the person concerned. As regards amendment No. (24), the aim with regard to funding is that eventually income from fees will meet the cost of the scheme. In the interim, costs are not expected to be great. The Government has agreed to accept total responsibility for funding until such time as the scheme becomes self-supporting. Accordingly, I am proposing that clause 42 be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to amendment No. 25. To bring this legislation into line with other similar Commonwealth legislation it is proposed to increase the penalty for false representation from $500, as currently specified in clause 43, to $1,000 or six months imprisonment. As regards amendments Nos. 26 and 27, clause 44 provides for applications to be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of decisions on a number of matters, such as the granting, rejection or revocation of rights. Amendment No. 26 adds to the list of appealable matters decisions by the Secretary under subsection 20 (1) concerning test growing. Amendment No. 27 adds to the list of appealable matters decisions by the Minister under subsection 20 (1) concerning conditions on the granting of rights made in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> The final amendment relates to the question of costs, as raised by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), which was also a matter of concern to my honourable friend the member for Hunter. It is an amendment to clause 45. This amendment has not been circulated. It meets the requests of the honourable member and the concern expressed earlier. </PARA>

Consequently, the Opposition welcomes the proposal. With respect to amendment No.24, we agree to the Government accepting the funding. As the Minister has explained, the Commonwealth is acting as the vehicle for the States with respect to this legislation. In its initial stages, if the scheme is to work and if it is to be paid for in the way in which the Government has proposed, it is logical for the Government to accept funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to amendment No. 25, on an earlier occasion I said that the penalties in the Bill were laughable. I guess that we can now say that they are half laughable. It depends how badly one feels about six months in gaol. The Government will be aware that with respect to the meat substitution scandal the penalties were seen to be inadequate, with hindsight. Acts of parliament incorporate fines or penalties which, at the time, are reasonably appropriate. As the years go by, it is subsequently seen that they are not appropriate. The Opposition agrees to a fine of $1,000 or imprisonment for six months, because potentially, if this legislation really works in the way that the Government thinks it will work-the Opposition has great doubts-there will be big money to be made. We have already said that we are apprehensive about what may happen with respect to litigation with small plant breeders taking on multinational plant breeders. We believe that clause 25 should be kept under consideration by the Australian Agricultural Council, or whoever it may be, because it may quickly prove to be quite inadequate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. In the calendar year 1981, 192,942 telegrams were sent from Australia to the U.S.A.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. International telegrams are passed through the Overseas Telecommunications Commission's Message Relay Centre, located in Paddington, Sydney, which has connections to OTC receiving offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, Telecom telegraph offices and Post Offices throughout Australia. Telegrams for the U.S.A . are directed through the OTC Message Relay Centre to four corresponding Message Relay Centres in the U.S.A.-three in New York City and one in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. OTC operates services to the United States via both satellite and submaring cable systems. In the case of telegrams, about half of the traffic is directed through each of these two media.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The following four competing international telegram carriers in that country , with each of whom OTC(A) has operating arrangements:</PARA>
<PARA> RCA Globcom;</PARA>
<PARA> ITT Worldcommunications Inc.;</PARA>
<PARA> Western Union International Inc.*; and</PARA>
<PARA> TRT Telecommunications;</PARA>
<PARA> They have different delivery arrangements with a number of competing domestic carriers. Most traffic is delivered by the Western Union Telegraph Company (WUTC ) and Graphnet Inc.</PARA>
<PARA> Responsibility for delivery is accepted by the relevant U.S. international carrier when a message is delivered to its Message Relay Centre.</PARA>
<PARA> (*No connection corporately with Western Union Telegraph Company)</PARA>
<PARA> 5. A revenue share of $US864,366 was paid in 1981 to the US international carriers for Australian originated telegram traffic. A share of this revenue would be paid, in turn, to the U.S. domestic carriers for delivery of these telegrams.</PARA>
<PARA> 6 and 7. The Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) received 493 complaints of non-delivery of telegrams to the U.S.A. in 1981. On investigation it was found that 145 of these telegrams had been delivered without error. Non- delivery or late delivery occurred, in the U.S.A., in respect of 348 cases or 0. 18 per cent of all telegrams from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> OTC has formally expressed its concern at this standard of service to each of its corresponding U.S. carriers during recent months, and undertakings have been given by each of these companies to endeavour to improve delivery standards.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Arrangements between OTC(A) and U.S. international carriers for the handling of telegram traffic are as prescribed in the recommendations of the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT) of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).</PARA>
<PARA> Where error of service is determined, the charges are refunded in full to the Australian originator. Where appropriate, the cost of these charges is recovered from the relevant U.S. carrier in accordance with the above CCITT recommendations.</PARA>

<PARA>per cent clearance within 2 days  70 59 per cent clearance within 3 days  85 72</PARA>
<PARA> The deterioration in fault clearance performance in Newtown District Telecomunications Branch was due to higher than average fault incidence coupled with staff shortages experienced at that time. However, action has since been taken to augment staff engaged on clearance of faults on customers' services.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The average delay recorded for December 1981 in the connection of telephone services is 24 days for Burwood District Telecomunications Branch and 23 days for Newtown District Telecomunications Branch. These figures include the period elapsed whilst awaiting payment of relevant fees.</PARA>
<PARA> Individual statistics are not maintained by Telecom for delays in the provisions of residential and business services. In practice, business services would experience less delays than residential services due to their higher priority classification.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) I was made aware of the essence of the submission by Hose Makers Australia Pty Ltd and approved the subsequent response to the Sub-Committee by my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The specification for hose used in operational applications was revised in Oct 80 to reflect the hose performance required by the Services and the tests by which conformance of their products can be demonstrated by any potential supplier.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. During revision of the specification all major Australian suppliers, including Hose Makers Australia Pty Ltd, were invited to participate. Their comments were taken into consideration in revising the specification. The importance of ensuring that the selected hose will not fail in operational use dictates that samples submitted by tenderers be thoroughly tested. The tests are time consuming, and were delayed for some three months by one tenderer submitting samples of the wrong hose.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Such a statement is not contained in the Request for Tender document distributed to potential suppliers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. As a result of the above-average rainfalls in the area, the Perth- Darwin National Highway between Fitzroy Crossing and Halls Creek was closed to traffic from 26 January to 4 February. It was again closed from 9 February, although the road has now been conditionally opened to traffic with a mass gross weight up to 3 tonnes. The Western Australian Government has been airfreighting perishable foodstuffs and emergency supplies to communities isolated by the flooding.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) This section of road is currently below the National Highway standards. Construction of these standards which have been set taking into account the needs of all traffic will satisfy the needs of defence.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The 1981-82 National Roads program which I approved for Western Australia last year included $6.4m expenditure for projects to make a major start on the road. The projects involve the construction and sealing of 91.7 kilometres of road and bridges over the Mary and Laura Rivers.</PARA>
<PARA> These works and future works are expected to reduce road closures due to flooding to a minimum and also improve the serviceability of the road for defence purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> The intention is to complete the sealing of both the Fitzroy Crossing-Halls Creek and Newman-Port Hedland sections of the National Highway by mid-1988. However, the achievement of this target will depend on the future level of National Road grants and the priority of works required on other National Highways.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently, there was a problem at RAAF Base Fairbairn brought about by birds perching in the aircraft hangars. The bird droppings on the concrete floors constituted a safety hazard to the personnel working in the hangars. To overcome the problem, a contractor used a chemical called Endrin, which was mixed with grease and applied with rollers to the rafters and other fixtures in the hangars . No toxic spray was used.</PARA>
<PARA> Endrin has a chloroform type effect on birds if ingested in sufficient quantity through their feet. Normally, however, the mixture irritates birds causing them to fly away before this stage is reached. Notwithstanding, some birds were found dead shortly after the treatment program commenced. This is thought to have occurred when small birds came into contact with a stronger mixture intended for larger birds.</PARA>
<PARA> All Service personnel working in the hangars were aware of the treatment program to discourage the birds' presence in the hangars. Moreover, no persons have reported to the Base Medical Flight with any apparent illness or symptoms which could be associated with the Endrin bird treatment program.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes. Until a special mining lease is issued so that mining may commence, the question of the need for a radiation testing laboratory on site does not arise.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It was agreed in July 1978 between the Commonwealth and Northern Territory Governments that uranium mining operations should be regulated to the maximum extent possible through the laws of the Northern Territory. It is therefore the Northern Territory Supervising Authorities' responsibility to establish such site laboratories as they may deem necessary. However, in carrying out their regulatory program the Northern Territory Authorities are able to consult the Supervising Scientist, who has established a temporary field laboratory in the Region as part of the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute, the Commonwealth's Australian Radiation Laboratory and Atomic Energy Commission for advice on standards, practices and procedures in relation to radiation protection.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As far as can be ascertained from the files, the circumstances leading to the preparation of the paper referred to, which, as will become evident, is not really 'the Fleming Report', were as follows.</PARA>
<PARA> In March 1980, after assertions had been made that material supporting claims by Vietnam veterans was not being taken into account, the then Secretary of the Department of Veteran's Affairs contacted the National President of the Vietnam Veterans Action Association inviting him to submit any scientific references or other material relating to Vietnam veterans and certain chemicals. The National President suggested that the information could be obtained from the scientific adviser to the Association, Mr John Evans.</PARA>
<PARA> As the information was not in a form which could be simply handed over, the Secretary arranged for Dr Fleming to visit Mr Evans to obtain the material.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Fleming, with his administrative assistant, visited Mr Evans three times in 1980. during these visits Mr Evans indicated to Dr Fleming the sections of specific published articles which he considered to be relevant, occasionally offering personal observations.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Fleming obtained copies of the nominated references. He collated verbatim extracts from these references including the personal observations of Mr Evans. Some of the references given by Mr Evans were not included, following discussions between them.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Fleming's efforts were directed to assembling the material as a coherent paper. So far as is known, he made no contribution to the substance or content of the paper except in so far as the discussions between them helped to develop the presentation of Mr Evans' views. Dr Fleming's first collation was submitted to Mr Evans and discussed with him to see whether it correctly reflected the argument presented by Mr Evans. Mr Evans' suggested amendments led to the preparation of a second draft (of 82 pages double-spaced typing). Further discussion led to amendments and inclusions resulting in a third draft (of 56 pages single-spaced) which was not referred to Mr Evans. Work on the drafts ceased in August 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, Mr Evans provided information for assembling collation of references into connected argument and Dr Fleming provided the resources to put this argument on paper.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr G. E. Rousseaux wrote to the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs on 24 June 1980 drawing attention to published articles by Joseph T. Morgan and Theron G. Randolph. These were referred to the Department. Dr Fleming brought them to Mr Evans' notice, as they appeared to cover a specific matter better than the references Mr Evans had. They were discussed and included in the paper.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr Thomson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) My attention has been drawn to these reports. As is indicated in the answer to Question No. 4188, the document in question is not a Fleming Report but is a compilation, made with Dr Fleming's assistance, of extracts from articles and references mainly emanating from Mr John Evans.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Dr Fleming states that he cannot remember whether or not he gave Mr Letts a copy of the 56 page third draft. Mr Letts confirms that Dr Fleming did not give him a copy.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No. At the time there was no circulation of the 56 pages of material outside the Department, except to the Department of Health as mentioned below. The previous Minister for Veterans' Affairs gave details of the background to the preparation of the material in a News Release, dated 30 September 1980. Certain senior officers of the Department's Central Office staff received copies and the Department of Health was asked to comment on the document.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Department of Health provided the following comments on the second draft:</PARA>
<PARA> This document consists of a long series of abstracts selectively cited from a variety of sources. They are assembled in such a way as to imply that veterans of the Vietnamese War were heavily exposed to a range of pesticidal agents which have serious acute and chronic toxic effects. Interspersed are comments which cleverly link the arguments. The uninformed reader could be led to believe that the interpretations drawn and implied are correct but this is not always so.</PARA>
<PARA> The title of the document is misleading since it in no way presents an unbiased assessment of potential toxicity of chemicals used in Vietnam, nor does it accurately demonstrate the potential for exposure of personnel who served during the hostilities in that country.</PARA>
<PARA> The references are in many cases out of date and have been superseded by more recent work which is largely ignored. Some are drawn from lay publications which have questionable scientific merit. For example, the author attributes the many known toxic effects of inorganic arsenic compounds to cacodylic acid-an organic arsenical-used in ''Agent Blue''. The key ''links'' between these two types of compound are in paragraphs 51 and 54 but neither is supported by review of the recent literature. Indeed the Merck Index reference, in paragraph 51 refers to work published in 1760 and 1927. Yet, recent work which shows that cacodylic acid has significantly different toxicological properties from inorganic arsenic compounds has been ignored.</PARA>
<PARA> Critical arguments often rest upon poorly supported documentation, anonymous references and the frequently used personal observation. Where an argument is not sustained by scientific work, it is filled by speculation which tends to lead the argument in a direction which has been predetermined by the writer. For example, in paragraph 56, suggestions based upon unsubstantiated observations of lay forest workers in Oregon are used to imply that toxic arsine gas was formed after Agent Blue was used in Vietnam. The document then discusses some of the known toxic effects of arsine gas implying, but not stating, that Vietnam veterans would have been exposed to arsine.</PARA>
<PARA> Facts are often misrepresented. This is illustrated by paragraph 72 which cites a 1960 publication. Its sensational title ''Cacodylates infrequently used today' ' belies the content of preceding paragraphs 62-71 which are extracts expounding the dangers of exposure to cacodylic acid. Similar examples abound and suggest that attempts are being made to confuse or misrepresent the literature.</PARA>
<PARA> Selective citation of references is used to suit some of the arguments. When discussing 2,4-D (paragraph 167) p. 127 of the I.A.R.C. publication ''Evaluation of the Carcinogenic Risk of Chemicals to Man'' vol. 15 is cited. Subsequently this same document is ignored when discussing ''2,4-D and peripheral neuritis'' (paragraph 174). On the same page in discussion of this very topic the I.A.R.C. document states that by 1977 only three cases of peripheral neuropathy following spraying of 2,4-D had been reported.</PARA>
<PARA> The toxicological and medical content of the document is poor. Many of the interpretations reached are neither supported nor justified. Unwarranted accent is placed throughout on single cases which have been reported in the literature. This tends to give undue prominence to rare occurrences and consequently places in an unduly bad light certain chemicals which would normally be accepted as being of low toxicity when used according to recommendations. Undue susceptibility of individuals is stressed and tends to nullify the stringent precautions which are taken in respect of those chemicals with the aim of protecting even the most susceptible in our community. Signs and symptoms which could result from overexposure are described at length. Common and rare complications tend to be given equal prominence.</PARA>
<PARA> Although time has not permitted a detailed analysis and consideration of all of the arguments presented in this document, it is clear that it is a biased compilation of material which exaggerates the potential toxicity of those agricultural chemicals mentioned. If it were to be circulated as a Government document, it could be used to assail the credibility of those who work to design and enforce the necessary precautions for the responsible usage of such chemicals in agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, this document is a clever presentation of facts, arguments and opinions which might be used to support complaints of a group of individuals who allege that they were suffering from a wide diversity of adverse effects as a result of exposure to such chemicals. Although I have been critical of the document in its style I must add that much effort has been devoted to its production and there is valuable information contained in it. It should be retained to alert those who may be required to produce defence material against such arguments which could be presented on behalf of a plaintiff. On no account should it be used as an information item since it is essential that a document used for widespread distribution should be totally unbiased.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Health also provided comments on the Agent Blue section of the third draft. These are quoted in full at the end of this answer.</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the Department of Health's comments it was considered essential to seek further authoritative balanced advice and the Department of Health prepared a series of information papers on pesticides used in Vietnam. Those produced so far deal with cacodylic acid, the bipyridyliums (diquat and paraquat), malathion and dieldrin. The first two, on herbicides, have been given to the Senate Standing Commitee on Science and the Environment. The other two, on insecticides , are available if and when the Committee requires them. The 56 page draft was not provided to any Department, other than the Department of Health, for comment .</PARA>
<PARA> (6) There are about 10,000 local medical officers who could provide treatment to Vietnam veterans. Such circulation has been considered unnecessary. Local medical officers have been advised by a newsletter of the medical officers who are the contact points in each State Branch of the Department of Veterans' Affairs for information on matter concerned with herbicides and Vietnam veterans .</PARA>
<PARA> To enable the contact medical officers to deal with claims based on alleged exposure to herbicides, a vast amount of information has been supplied. They have the Departmental bibliography which lists some 781 papers on chemicals used in Vietnam. The 56 page third draft referred to in the question cites 76 separate articles, works, etc., in some 134 footnotes; all but two were included in the bibliography. The omission of one apparently was an oversight, since remedied, and one was unable to be found. With the exception of the article just referred to, all but 4 of the 76 articles were sent to the contact medical officers in January 1981. The reason for the omission to send the 4 articles at the time is not known, but all 4 have been sent since. In addition, the contact medical officers have received copies of the Department of Health papers mentioned above and the report entitled 'Pesticides Used in Vietnam Hostilities and their use in Australian Agriculture: A Comparative Study.'</PARA>
<PARA> The 56 pages of material have been sent to the contact departmental medical officers following their tabling in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Health comments referred to in the answer to part (5) are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>COMMENTS ON ''AGENT BLUE''</PARA>
<PARA>Usage in VietnamPara. 50 The rate of application of cacodylic acid as Agent Blue in Vietnam would have been higher than the rate used in the U.S.A. Recommended agriculture application rates vary but range from 3-10 lb/acre (Anonymous (1974) ).</PARA>
<PARA>Commercial Cacodylic AcidPara. 52 House quotes Brown (1972) who indicated that, in 1962, ''Agent Blue'' contained less than 0.1% trivalent arsenic (i.e. 1,000 ppm). The actual chemical constitution of this component and whether it is organic or inorganic is not stated but presumably it refers to arsenic trioxide in which arsenic is trivalent.</PARA>
<PARA> The military herbicide, designated ''Herbicide Blue'', contained the equivalent of 3.10 lb of cacodylic acid per U.S. gallon, present as the free acid and its sodium salt (Young et al. (1978)). The formulation had the following composition :</PARA>
<PARA>% cacodylic acid  4.7 sodium cacodylate  26.4 surfactant  3.4 sodium chloride 5. 5 water  59.5 antifoam agent  0.5</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, it apparently contained ''only trace quantities'' of inorganic arsenic (Young et al. (1978)). An earlier formulation, used in the period 1961- 1964, contained sixty-five per cent cacodylic acid and thirty per cent sodium chloride (Young et al. (1978)).</PARA>
<PARA> The presence of small amounts of inorganic arsenic in commercial cacodylic acid probably represents a residue of arsenic trioxide from which it is manufactured. (Midwest Research Institute (1975)).</PARA>
<PARA> Any assessment of the risk to humans posed by toxic agents depends on an accurate determination of the dose to which humans might be exposed. Hence it is of some importance that full details of the range of composition of 'Agent Blue' formulations be ascertained if at all possible.</PARA>
<PARA>''Manufacturer's Warning''Para. 53 The manufacturer's warning may well be a registration requirement for the product. It makes the significant point that cacodylic acid is absorbed by the body and can produce toxic effects in high doses, like many pesticides.</PARA>
<PARA>Cacodylate is converted to the toxic, inorganic, trivalent arsenic in the bodyPara. 54 The reference to sodium cacodylate (ref. 47: Merck Index 9th Ed. 1110) refers, in turn, to work published in 1760 and 1927. Apart from historical interest, such work has little current toxicological merit.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 55 Apparently attempts to equate cacodylic acid with pentavalent inorganic compounds of arsenic. However, the underscored words, claiming in vivo reduction to trivalent arsenic compounds, refer to pentavalent inorganic compounds in the original context, not to organic compounds of arsenic. In addition, the work cited is outdated.</PARA>
<PARA> Current knowledge of the form of arsenic in various tissues is imprecise because of technical difficulties in differentiating between pentavalent and trivalent arsenic. The main problem is to prevent oxidation of trivalent arsenic after sampling. In vivo reduction of pentavalent inorganic arsenic has been shown to occur in dogs (Ginsberg (1965)) but not in cows (Peoples (1964)). The situation is further confused by the in vivo oxidation of trivalent to pentavalent arsenic which has been demonstrated in dogs (Ginsberg (1965)), rats (Winkler (1962)) and mice (Bencko et al. (1976)). Consequently, the statement of para. 54, published years before such work was carried out, must be considered with reservation.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 56 Also quotes Neubauer (1947). On inspection it seems that Case 135 refers to an earlier case cited by earlier authors of a ''72 year old male with pigmentation and multiple ben. (?benign) superficial epitheliomas of the trunk, probably basal cell carcinoma, who had been exposed to arsenic drops and injection 10 years previously.'' Neither the form of arsenic nor the dosage is given. It is not possible to reach any valid conclusion on the basis of such a poorly documented, anecdotal case report.</PARA>
<PARA> Para. 56 seems to suggest that Neubauer himself did not regard pentavalent organic arsenic compounds as carcinogenic. As pointed out by Pelfrene (1976), Neubauer appears unconvinced by his work and his paper seems to argue against, rather than for, the carcinogenicity of arsenic.</PARA>
<PARA> Further consideration of this article is instructive as it is an indication of the controversy that surrounds this topic.</PARA>
<PARA> Neubauer reviewed 143 reports of cutaneous and a few visceral cancers that were attributed to arsenic. About 70% of these cases had received medicinal arsenic ( often as Fowler's Solution, 1% potassium arsenite) for the treatment of dermatological disorders such as psoriasis. This disproportionate number was not adequately persued. About half of the skin cancers were squamous arising in keratotic lesions whilst the rest were basal cell. The average time between the initial administration of arsenic and the onset of skin cancer was 18 years.</PARA>
<PARA> This review has been criticised on a number of grounds (Wildenberg (1978), Pelfrene (1976)). For example, some patients were not definitely known to have taken arsenic. The duration of exposure varied from 6 weeks to 36 years and periods of exposure were sometimes unstated. The total dose of arsenic was known is only 16 out of the 143 cases and doses varied from as little as 0.19 g to 70 and 121 g.</PARA>
<PARA> Thus, this compilation of cases by Neubauer cannot be regarded as a definitive work but it does have considerable historical merit.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 57 The suggestions that cacodylic acid is slowly reduced to inorganic arsenic in the body predates and is inconsistent with later work which shows that cacodylic acid is rapidly excreted by man (Crecelius (1977)).</PARA>
<PARA> These studies show forest workers using cacodylic acid and related compounds for tree thinning operations in Oregon and Washington absorbed arsenic, particularly if safety precautions were relaxed. Much of the chemical appeared to be excreted in the urine in a relatively short time. In a study period of over two months there appeared to be no continuing arsenic accumulation but balance studies were not conducted. No evidence of arsenic toxicity was obtained (Wagner and Weswig (1974), (Tarrant and Allard (1972)). No human data are available on the tissue distribution of absorbed cacodylic acid from these or other studies.</PARA>
<PARA> Animal studies generally lend support to the view that organic arsenic herbicides are rapidly excreted by mammals (Dickinson (1972)). In the rat, cacodylic acid has a unniquely high affinity for rat erythrocytes which significantly prolongs its excretion. Even so, cacodylic acid is fairly stable in vivo and is not converted to inorganic arsenic since only 0.008-0.13% of administered 14C-cacodylic acid was converted by the rats to 14CO2 (Stevens et al. (1977)). Since the formation of inorganic arsenic would require two sequential demethylations of cacodylic acid, it can be inferred that little, if any, inorganic arsenic is formed in the rat in vivo. The bio-transformation of cacodylic acid in other species is unknown.</PARA>
<PARA> Comparison with the metabolic fate of other organic compounds of arsenic is relevant. Seafood organic arsenic compounds are known to be rapidly eliminated ( Schrenk and Schreibeis, (1958)) without biotransformation in the body (Crecelius (1977)). About 70% is eliminated in the first 24 hours after human ingestion ( West"o"o and Ryd"alv (1972)). Humans fed radiolabelled arsanilic acid excreted 84-94% in six days (Calesnick et al. (1966)).</PARA>
<PARA> Animal studies give similiar results. A substantial fraction of seafood arsenic is rapidly eliminated by rats (Coulson et al. (1935)), pigs (Munro (1976)) and monkeys (Charbonneau et al (1978)).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 58 Selectively quotes House (1967) (ref. 49). The very next sentence reads 'S.S. Pinto and B.M. Bennet (1963) believe that it is a mistake to make a blanket condemnation of the use of arsenic without first looking at the data' ( House et al. 1967)).</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, it should be stressed that chronic toxicity data for cacodylic acid are lacking.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 59 Introduces the possibility of ''arsine'' production by reduction of cacodylic acid. The quote is based upon the subjective observations of untrained forest workers which Wagner and Weswig (1974 suggest may indicate the production of ''arsine'' gas. Trimethyl arsine does have a characteristic garlic-like odour (Vallee et al. (1960)).</PARA>
<PARA> Wagner and Weswih 1974 did not demonstrate arsine production and could not detect evidence for exposure to arsine by haematological investigation (full blood count) of two out of five exposed workers in Oregon. Again the results are inconclusive and do not confirm any hypothesis that ''arsine'' was produced in significant amounts after application of cacodylic acid in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 60-64 Describes the acute human toxicity of the parent arsine, AsH3. The major toxicity of arsine is due to haemolysis, unlike inorganic arsenic compounds (Gosseling et al. (1976)). The outstanding features are haemolysis, chills, fevers and haemaglobenuria (Wintrobe et al. (1974)). In humans atmospheric arsine concentration of 3-10 ppm may cause symptoms in several hours , 10-60 ppm may be dangerous in 30 to 60 minutes and 250 ppm may be lethal in 30 minutes (Steel and Feltham (1950)).</PARA>
<PARA> There are very few accounts in the literature of chronic arsine poisoning. Bulmer et al. (1940) described a case involving smelter workers exposed to an undetermined concentration of arsine. ''The initial symptoms were persistent headache, followed by nausea, vomiting and shortness of breath on exertion. Puffiness of the face and eyelids, tingling sensations in feet, a garlic-like odour of the breath and an icteric tinge of the conjunctiva were noted in some cases.'' (Browning (1961) ).</PARA>
<PARA>Arsenic SafetyPara. 65 Introduces the concept of delayed effects of exposure to arsenic. The BMJ Leading Article from 1968 refers in particular to the carcinogenic potential of inorganic medications in former use.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the incidence of such skin cancers is still to be determined, it is thought to be relatively low (Wildenberg (1978) ). Studies of people from arsenic contaminated areas suggest a minimum exposure time of at least 5 years for the development of hyperpigmentation, 15 years for keratoses and about 20 years for the appearance of skin cancers. Furthermore, the latter do have a lengthy latent period, occasionally up to 30-40 years after cessation of exposure (Wildenberg (1978) ).</PARA>
<PARA>Cacodylic Acid-a toxic preparationPara. 66 Unsupported use of the term ''quite toxic preparations'' when referring to these compounds does not seem justified since it fails to take into account the known toxicological differences between organic and inorganic forms of arsenic.</PARA>
<PARA> The forest workers mentioned, of course, have already been referred to in para. 59. The cited study (Wagner and Weswig (1974) ) indeed does show that occupationally exposed forest workers do absorb arsenic compounds from the '' silvicides'' used and furthermore that this is largely and rapidly excreted in the urine in an undetermined form. The BMJ raises the important possibility that all of the absorbed arsenic may not have been excreted. Since the degree of their exposure is unquantified in the Oregon study, the degree of excretion of absorbed arsenic also is unknown. The important possibility of some bodily storage of arsenic can neither be proven nor disproven, although no evidence for arsenic accumulation or intoxication was obtained over the 2 month period of the Oregon study.</PARA>
<PARA> Once again, a significant omission has occurred from the quoted paragraph. In the quoted text, para. 66, line 10, reads after the word ''excretion'' ''The normal controls gave positive tests for small amounts of arsenic in both blood and urine, reflecting the fact that arsenic is a trace element in the ordinary human environment''. Although these words are not critical to the argument, their omission does conceal significant information. In fact, normal persons have been found to excrete between 0.01 and 0.06 mg arsenic per litre of urine and a few individuals as much as 0.2 mg per litre (Wintrobe et al. (1976) ).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 67 The suggestion that cacodylic ''may be transformed into arsine by microfungal action'' is that of Wagner and Weswig (1974). The BMJ suggests that it is ''fortunate'' that none of the Oregon foresters experienced arsenic poisoning yet there is no evidence offered that arsine production did in fact occur after application of cacodylic acid in Oregon. As far as can be ascertained, the literature contains no reference to the generation of any arsine after the use of arsenic containing herbicides.</PARA>
<PARA> Here we see an argument developed by reference to another author's interpretations of a study which does not stand up to close inspection of the original work.</PARA>
<PARA> The final sentence, beginning line 8, ''So despite . . .'' is quoted out of context. The BMJ author, in fact, goes on to acknowledge that some arsenic compounds may have beneficial effects when used in small amounts as feed additives or for control of ''piglet scour''.</PARA>
<PARA>Cacodylic Acid leads to excess arsenic exposurePara. 68 The quotation from the earlier study of Tarrant and Allard (1972) again indicates that forest workers occupationally exposed to cacodylic acid and monosodium methanearsenate absorb arsenic which is excreted in the urine in a short time in an undetermined form.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 69 The control group were studied for a significantly shorter period than exposed workers and Tarrant and Allard (1972) stated that ''no firm conclusions' ' can be drawn, although the large number of reports of headaches may have some significance. Design of the study was acknowledged to be deficient since the authors go on to state that-''The crew members were aware that they were part of a health study of an arsenic compound and, as a result, may have overreported symptoms''.</PARA>
<PARA> Once again, no conclusions can be drawn but the point is well made that forest workers using cacodylic acid do absorb significant quantities of arsenic.</PARA>
<PARA>Protection needed to use Cacodylic AcidPara. 70 Protective clothing is often required for the safe handling of pesticides. It is noteworthy that significant quantities of organic arsenic appear to have been absorbed by the forest workers despite the use of protective clothing, gloves and goggles.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 71 The penultimate sentence, commencing line 12, ''Studies . . .'' again raises the important unresolved question of chronic human exposure to low levels of organic arsenicals.</PARA>
<PARA> Another important omission occurs in which the quoted authors attempted to place this very matter in perspective. The omitted final sentence reads ''In fact, in reference to the relationship to carcinogenesis of low dosage and chronic exposure to arsenic, one can find diametrically opposite opinions in the current medical literature'' (Wagner and Weswig (1974) ).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 72 Merely confirms that the occupationally exposed forest workers absorbed and excreted organoarsenical herbicides.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 73, 74 Importantly indicates that, with proper safety precautions, cacodylic acid was judged by Wagner and Weswig (1974) as safe for use by the forest workers.</PARA>
<PARA>Cacodylates infrequently used todayPara. 75 The subheading 'Cacodylates infrequently used today' is incongruous when the content of paragraphs 66-74 is considered.</PARA>
<PARA> The quotation from Dinman (1960) suggests that medicinal use of sodium cacodylate led to 'serious reactions'. The review of Neubauer (1947) indicates only one case (Case 135 discussed in para. 56) where 'cacodylates' were ' possibly' used. Vallee et al. (1960) mention sodium cacodylate as a common medicinal preparation but make no specific mention of toxic effects. In 1975, cacodylic acid was still in use as a popular tonic in some parts of Europe ( Midwest Research Institute (1975)).</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that Dinman's review of chronic arsenic toxicity to humans is balanced and authoritative, but it is not referred to again even when this very topic is subsequently discussed.</PARA>
<PARA>A call to stop use of arsenic in pesticidesParas 76, 77 There is no doubt that inorganic arsenic compounds are quite hazardous and toxic to man and that such compounds found widespread agricultural usage, particularly before the introduction of modern synthetic organic pesticides. Although it is not stated which form of arsenic is under consideration, the abstracted Editorial presumably refers to inorganic arsenic compounds.</PARA>
<PARA> The citation of this abstract again emphasises the importance of stating the chemical nature of the arsenic compounds when considering arsenic toxicity.</PARA>
<PARA>Arsenic is ignored in the United StatesParas 78, 79 These extracts are from Satterlee (1960) which gives an interesting historical account which emphasises the suspected role of arsenic as a co-carcinogen and its widespread occurrence in the human environment.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the carcinogenic potential of arsenic will be discussed in a later section, the reference to the arsenic content of cigarettes is pertinent in demonstrating the ubiquitous role of arsenic contamination of the human environment. Arsenic has been recovered from tobacco in concentrations of 42 ug per cigarette (Satterlee (1956)).</PARA>
<PARA>Continued absorption of small amounts of arsenic leads to chronic poisoningPara. 80 Chronic arsenic poisoning can arise from chronic absorption of arsenic from any source and all routes of exposure are important from a toxicological viewpoint. Nevertheless, all exposure to arsenic does not invariably result in chronic arsenic poisoning.</PARA>
<PARA> In general, characterisation of human exposure (duration, degree) has been poor , thus impeding discussions of dose-response relationships. Furthermore, data are generally not available on the valence or form of the arsenic compound responsible for the poisoning episode.</PARA>
<PARA>Recent Cases of Arsenic Poisoning in SingaporePara. 81 The abstract is taken from a paper which describes acute and chronic arsenic poisoning arising amongst inhabitants of Singapore who consumed traditional Chinese herbal preparations. These were found to contain inorganic arsenic as arsenic sulphide (up to 12,000 ppm) or arsenic trioxide (107,000 ppm). The duration of consumption ranged from less than six months to more than 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 82 Cutaneous manifestations of arsenic toxicity appear in those who recover from acute poisoning and those with chronic intoxication, usually within 1-4 weeks. Diffuse scaly desquamation occurs over the trunk and extremities with occasional hyperpigmentation. Hyperkaratosis of palms and soles can occur ( Wintrobe et al (1976)). As previously noted (para 80), little is known of dose- response relationships and the valence state of the arsenic poison is often not known. Thus, it is not possible to state whether trivalent or pentavalent arsenic, or both, produce such effects.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 83 Nerve involvement from chronic arsenic poisoning is relatively infrequent and the symptoms develop slowly over a period of weeks. The peripheral neuropathy has the same sensory and motor distribution as beriberi. ( Wintrobe et al. (1976)). Numbness, burning and tingling are present and are followed by motor disturbances charaterised by fasciculations and occasionally gross tremors. As the disease progresses with prolonged exposure, ataxia and inco-ordination can develop. Neurological examination demonstrates impairment of vibration sense, touch, pain and temperature with 'stocking glove' distribution. Tendon reflexes are diminished and foot and wrist drop can occur in late stages. Cranial nerves are frequently involved (Dinman (1960) and references cited therein). Patients with peripheral neuropathy continue to have sensory disturbances and weakness for many months (Wintrobe et al. (1976)). Exposure levels required to produce such effects are generally unknown but are usually high enough to produce other symptoms. In fatal cases, the peripheral nerves often show fragmentation and resorption of myelin, with disintegration of axis cylinders (Wintrobe et al. (1976)).</PARA>
<PARA> Disturbance of central nervous system function include severe hearing loss and EEG abnormalities. Arsenic encephalopathy, manifested as drowsiness, confusion and convulsion can occur in both acute and chronic arsenic intoxication ( Wintrobe et al. (1976)).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 84 The gastrointestinal effects of chronic arsenic poisoning usually are unremarkable and often subjective in nature. Persistent diarrhoea and cachexia develop in cases of chronic poisoning with criminal intent (Dinman (1960)). Hyperaemia and haemorrhages of the intestine occur in fatal cases (Wintrobe et al (1976)). Arsenical hepatitis with impaired liver function and cirrhosis has been observed in man. Dose-response relationships are difficult to estimate due to lack of controls, and the possible influence of heavy alcohol consumption.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 85 Inorganic trivalent arsenic affects the haemopoeitic system causing anaemia and disturbed leucopoeisis. Aplastic anaemia can occur in severe cases ( Dinman (1960)).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 86 Localised peri-orbital and ankle oedema are occasional consequences of arsenic poisoning (Dinman 1960). Renal tubular necrosis occurs in fatal cases ( Wintrobe et al (1976)).</PARA>
<PARA> Known cardiovascular effects of arsenic are peripheral vascular disease and electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Peripheral vascular disorders include 'Blackfoot' disease (gangrene) and Raynaud's syndrome.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 87 Although the association of chronic iatrogenic arsenic ingestion with keratoses and dermal neoplasms (mainly squamous in nature) is well documented, the relationship to other forms of cancer is less well established.</PARA>
<PARA>Liver disease and chronic arsenic ingestion in AustraliaPara. 88 Once again, the cases cited relate to chronic arsenic toxicity subsequent to long term ingestion of arsenic-containing medications.</PARA>
<PARA> As previously mentioned and as acknowledged by the articles' authors, chronic arsenic poisoning is an uncommon but well documented cause of hepatic disease. Pathological investigation reveals centri-lobular fatty deposition in mild cases . Necrotising hepatitis occurs occasionally and may lead to cirrhosis (Dinman ( 1960)).</PARA>
<PARA> As recognised by Cowlishaw (1979), arsenic induced primary liver cancer is exceedingly rare. Rare cases of liver hemangioendothelioma have been associated with inorganic arsenic (Roth 1957), Rennke et al (1971), Regelson et al (1968), Lander et al (1975).</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the large numbers of people that have been exposed to arsenic via drinking water, occupational exposure or medical use, these associations may be by chance (IARC (1973)).</PARA>
<PARA> The relevance of these case reports and of the particular subtitle reference to Australia is obscure.</PARA>
<PARA>Primary Liver Cancer in VietnamPara. 90 This quotation would appear to be an attempt to implicate arsenic in the alleged increased incidence of primary liver cancer in Vietnam in the period 1962-1968.</PARA>
<PARA> The quotation is misleading. The very next sentence of the IARC monograph discounts the validity of the claim, viz ''However, limitations in the reporting of the study make impossible an adequate assessment of the possible relationship between the incidence of liver cancer and herbicide spraying in South Vietnam''. (IARC (1977)).</PARA>
<PARA>Arsenic Poisoning in Moselle VintersPara. 91 The form of inorganic arsenic used as a vineyard insecticide here is not clear. It may have been lead arsenate (as claimed in para. 95) but a recent report indicates that the ''Bordeaux Mixture'' in use at that time was fortified with calcium arsenate. (Ivankovic et al. (1979 )). Arsenic trioxide has also found use as an insecticide on grapes (IARC (1973) ).</PARA>
<PARA> The exposure of the vineyard workers was particularly heavy because of dermal absorption, inhalation of insecticide dust and ingestion of contaminated wine. The duration of exposure was not documented but it was prolonged, occurring in the period 1925-1938.</PARA>
<PARA> Although this study gives a fascinating account of inorganic arsenic poisoning amongst these occupationally exposed workers, its deficiencies severely limit the interpretations that are possible. The study was uncontrolled and the workers were exposed to other toxic substances such as tobacco smoke and alcohol in an unquantified manner. Selection bias cannot be excluded.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 92 would seem to suggest that arsenic trioxide, As2O3, was the inorganic arsenic insecticide used. Of course, more than one of these may have found use.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 93 The controversy over the role of arsenic as a carcinogen remains unresolved. Warburg's hypothesis has been criticised on the grounds that the concentrations of arsenic which occur in vivo are much less than is required to inhibit cell metabolism in vitro (Frost (1967)).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 94 As previously discussed the debate on the role of arsenic in the aetiology of cancer has been prolonged and often confused.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 95 The use of inorganic arsenic insecticides was formerly widespread in the U.S.A. (Metcalf et al. (1962)). The German vinters would seem to have suffered particularly heavy exposure not only in their workplace but also through drinking contaminated wine. Subsequent analysis have shown that, in 1938 , 43% of 336 samples of wine from the area contained more than 5 mg/l of arsenic (Koelsch (1958)). Although the degree of their exposure from this unique route is uncertain it could be presumed to have been heavy, at least in some cases.</PARA>
<PARA> In comparison, consumption of drinking water containing arsenic (mostly 0.4-0.6 mg/l) has been shown to cause chronic arsenicism in Taiwan. The incidence of peripheral vascular disease ('Blackfoot disease') and skin lesions ( hyperpigmentation, keratoses and skin cancers) were linked to the total intake of arsenic (Tseng (1977)).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 96 Suggests that exposure was sufficiently heavy to produce manifestations of toxicity long after the use of inorganic arsenic was banned.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 97 The majority of workers who subsequently developed carcinomata had been symptomatic of arsenic poisoning for years after 1935 i.e. for up to 7 years before the use of inorganic arsenic was discontinued. Latent periods for the development of such skin carcinomata of the order of 20-30 years are reported ( Neuman &amp; Schwank (1960)).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 98 The high incidence of lung cancer (12 out of 27 cases autopsied) is striking and possibly suggestive of a causal relationship between the workers and their inorganic arsenic exposure. Nevertheless, this study was uncontrolled and remains inconclusive.</PARA>
<PARA> The incidence of ''hyperkeratoses'' (5/27; 4 SCC, 1 BCC) is even less than that of a later similar study (9/16) (Braun (1958)).</PARA>
<PARA>Liver, Respiratory TractPara. 99-105 There is no firm evidence that heavy exposure to arsenic increases the incidence of other forms of cancer in man ( IARC (1973)).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 106 The stigmata of chronic arsenic poisoning in all of the cancer cases autopsied emphasises the severity of exposure. It could be suggested that heavy exposure, sufficient to produce the features of chronic arsenic toxicity, led to the development of cancer but, since the study lacks controls, such an interpretation is unjustified.</PARA>
<PARA>Peripheral Vascular DamagePara. 107 Peripheral vascular disease is a recognised feature of chronic arsenic toxicity. Peripheral ischaemia due to chronic arsenic toxicity in Taiwan (''Blackfoot disease'') has been particularly well described (Tseng (1977)).</PARA>
<PARA>Skin ChangesPara. 108 Available studies consistently point to a causal relationship between skin cancer and heavy exposure to inorganic arsenic (IARC ( 1973)).</PARA>
<PARA>In Vivo Arsenic Concentrations and the Autopsy FindingsPara. 109 Available human studies have suggested that inorganic arsenic is excreted, mainly in the kidneys , and is not stored in the body. Inorganic trivalent arsenic is eliminated (60- 75% in urine, few per cent in faeces) within one week. (Mappes (1977); Tam et al . (1979)). Consequently, the absence of arsenic from the tissues of these workers whose exposure had ceased some 8-14 years previously is not surprising. Hence, the absence of detectable levels of arsenic in tissues does not rule out exposure at some previous time. It is known that substances can exert delayed effects (e.g. beryllium) and need not be present in tissues in high levels at the time that pathological changes subsequently develop (Bencko (1977)).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 110 As previously mentioned, there is no evidence which positively relates gastrointestinal malignancy with heavy arsenic exposure (IARC (1973)).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 111 Pesticides by their very nature are toxic and all care should be exercised in their use.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 112 Arsenic rarely is a cause of hepatic cirrhosis in man (see para. 84). No data is given in support of the claim.</PARA>
<PARA>Arsenic and Australian Troops in VietnamPara. 113 This paragraph is critical to the argument under development. Yet it relies upon unsupported personal observations.</PARA>
<PARA> The implication is that Agent Blue is synonymous with inorganic arsenic as used in Moselle. This is unsubstantiated.</PARA>
<PARA> The ''accidental defoliation'' incident warrents clarification. It presumably offers direct evidence of exposure of Australian personnel to Agent Blue. The degree of this exposure is not indicated.</PARA>
<PARA> The opinion that the amount of ''trivalent arsenic'' exposure in Vietnam exceeded that of the Moselle vinters is unsupported. Since cacodylic acid and its sodium salt are pentavalent, ''trivalent arsenic'' may refer to the ''trace quantities'' of inorganic arsenic that Agent Blue contained. The argument that this contaminant gave rise to chronic heavy arsenic exposure as in the German Vinters would seem subjective and difficult to sustain.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it may be possible to estimate the duration of possible exposure to Agent Blue in Vietnam, the actual degree of this exposure would seem indeterminable.</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, if as is suggested, such heavy exposure to trivalent arsenic did occur in Vietnam, there should be medical records of cases of arsenic poisoning amongst Australian and American personnel who served in Vietnam. Signs of chronic and subacute arsenic poisoning such as the characteristic cutaneous manifestations begin to appear after only a few weeks of exposure (Wintrobe et al. (1974)).</PARA>
<PARA>Delayed Occupational LesionsPara. 114 The toxicity of inorganic arsenic compounds is well recognised.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 115 Note that use of inorganic arsenic insecticides led to both acute and chronic arsenic poisoning.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 116 Merely reiterates points already made (see paras. 82, 108).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 117 As previously stated, the role of arsenic in the aetiology of internal malignancy remains unclarified. (Reymann et al. (1978)).</PARA>
<PARA>Paras. 118-120 As with the earlier study (Roth (1958)), this study also lacks controls and so should be interpreted cautiously. The suggestion that the high incidence of various carcinomata was attributable to inorganic arsenic remains unproven.</PARA>
<PARA> Note that most (i.e. 13/16) workers who developed carcinomata also suffered the cutaneous manifestations of chronic arsenic poisoning.</PARA>
<PARA>Skin and Visceral Changes Follow Long IngestionParas. 121-122 Primary liver cancer associated with intake of inorganic arsenic medications would seem to be particularly rare in view of the large number of people having been so exposed.</PARA>
<PARA> The 2 cases reported here involved the chronic consumption of arsenic trioxide for more than 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Haematological Aspects of Arsenic IntoxicationPara. 123 Both inorganic and organic arsenic compounds are capable of inducing blood dyscrasias and marrow suppression in humans. The effects are usually reversed within 2-3 weeks of cessation of exposure (Kyle and Pease (1965), Westhoff et al. (1975)).</PARA>
<PARA>Leukemia Following Arsenic PoisoningPara. 124 Another unique case report. The development of aplastic anaemia and then AML may have been unrelated to arsenic. Although inorganic trivalent arsenic was formerly used in leukemia therapy, an oncognic effect on the haemopoetic system cannot be ruled out. Confirmatory data are lacking.</PARA>
<PARA>Ocular Effects from ArsenicalsPara. 125 There is no supporting data for this complication of effects and the chemical form(s) of arsenic is not distinguished .</PARA>
<PARA> Various uncontrolled case reports suggest that both inorganic and organic arsenicals may produce a variety of toxic effects to the eye. (Klevay (1976) and references cited therein). Some of these cases involved the treatment of syphilitic patients with organic arsenic compounds and it is unclear to what extent neuro-ophthalmological effects of syphilis were a compounding factor. Optic atrophy is a side effect of the use of the anti-parasitic organoarsenical drug tryparsamide (Neujean et al. (1948) ).</PARA>
<PARA> According to Klevay (1976), high doses of some derivatives of phenyarsenic acid produced blindness in rhesus monkeys (Longley et al. (1942) ).</PARA>
<PARA> Studies with commercial cacodylic acid herbicide formulations showed that it was 'essentially non irritant' when topically applied to the rabbit's eye ( Midwest Research Institute (1975) ). Chronic eye studies are lacking in animals and man.</PARA>
<PARA>Differential DiagnosesPara. 126 The chemical and laboratory findings in arsenic poisoning are not specific and the diagnosis relies upon chemical detection of arsenic in the hair or urine (Wintrobe et al. (1974) ).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 127 Along with other toxic metals, arsenic is a recognised cause of peripheral neuropathy. Additional causes are other poisons (drugs, organic chemicals), deficiency states and metabolic disorders, specific inflammatory states and metabolic disorders, specific inflammatory states and infections, vascular diseases, genetically determined disorders and the idiopathic polyneuropathies (Wintrobe et al. (1974) ).</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 128 Inorganic arsenic is a known cause of aplastic and hypoplastic anaemia . Organic arsenicals occasionally produce marrow hypoplasia as an idiosyncratic effect (Wintrobe et. al. (1974) ).</PARA>
<PARA>Dow Chemical Company Paper on Close Relationship to Cancer Emphasis of the author's affiliation with the Dow Company has no inherent merit and is inconsistent with the citation of other references. The long involvement of this company in pesticide production is well known.</PARA>
<PARA>Paras. 129, 130 This retrospective epidemiological study aimed to correlate the chronic occupational exposure of workers engaged in production of arsenic containing pesticides with observed mortalities. In the process, various forms of inorganic arsenic were used, including trivalent compounds. The estimated total inhalation exposure to arsenic ranged from 42 mg to 29.7 g over periods ranging from one day to years.</PARA>
<PARA> Analysis of deaths of those workers identified revealed that respiratory cancer was the cause of death in 28 of 173 exposed workers (16.2%) and 104 of 1,809 unexposed workers (5.7%). The increased mortality from respiratory cancer showed a positive dose-response relationship with the degree of exposure. Futhermore, mortality from malignant neoplasms of lymphatic and haemopoetic tissues, except leukaemia, were also higher in exposed (3.5%) than the non-exposed groups (1.4%) , but no clear interpretation was drawn.</PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, it was revealed that 16 out of the 28 lung cancer deaths occurred in workers of lesser exposure over less than one year. (Blejer &amp; Wagner (1976) ) . These later authors suggested that a no-effect level with regard to increased mortality from respiratory cancer ''might lie in the very low microgram range of arsenic per m3''. (Blejer &amp; Wagner (1976) ). However, if the workers with less than one year's exposure are excluded from the study, no deaths from respiratory cancer occurred amongst those workers with daily time weighted average doses of over 40 years up to 90 ug/m3. Futhermore, no consistent dose response relationship existed below this level.</PARA>
<PARA> This significant study has been criticised independently on a number of other grounds. Only men who died during employment or following retirement from the company were included and, consequently, both groups could be biased samples ( Samuels &amp; Howarth (1975) ). The presence of trivalent arsenic confounds interpretation of the effects of pentavalent compounds (Samuels &amp; Howarth (1975) , Pelfrene (1976) ). Workers were exposed to other toxic agents in an unquantified manner e.g. lime sulphur (Pelfrene (1976) ) and lead (Wildenberg ( 1978) ). The full influence of cigarette smoking was not determined (Pelfrene) ( 1976) ). On statistical grounds the calculation of expected respiratory cancer deaths, based on proportionate mortalities, was unreliable (Samuels &amp; Howarth ( 1975) ).</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, in keeping with other substantial epidemiological evidence, the authors further implicated arsenic exposure from the production of inorganic arsenic insecticides in the aetiology of respiratory cancer. No conclusion can be drawn with regard to the potential carcinogenicity of trivalent versus pentavalent arsenic compounds since exposure to both forms occurred. The data are inconclusive, like the previous data from the use of inorganic arsenic pesticides (paras. 91-111). The significance of such a study for any exposure to arsenic that may have occurred in Vietnam is obscure since the form of arsenic and the duration and method of exposures were vastly different.</PARA>
<PARA>Cancer Induction is Concentration DependentPara. 131 The diagram relates to the production of skin carcinomata in mice topically treated with mixtures of tar and arsenic. The diagram is purported to demonstrate a critical synergistic concentration of arsenic in the tars. The chemical composition of the mixtures is not stated.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon present in tar are well known carcinogens, carcinogenicity of such mixtures is not surprising. The possible role of arsenic as a co-carcinogen is not classified by this study.</PARA>
<PARA> Any relevance to exposure to pesticides used in Vietnam is extremely marginal.</PARA>
<PARA>Biochemistry The title is inappropriate to the content.</PARA>
<PARA>Para. 132 The presumption that all forms of arsenic are converted to arsenite in vivo is contrary to later studies (see para. 55).</PARA>
<PARA>Cacodylate Effect in MicePara. 133</PARA>
<PARA> The presence of ''numerous mitoses'' in the early mouse studies hardly fulfills the histopathological criteria for ''cancer''. The inconclusive nature of Neubaer's compilation of reports has already been pointed out (see para. 56).</PARA>
<PARA> Chronic feeding of cacodylic acid to mice over 18 months at 121 ppm in the diet has been shown not to cause a significant increase in tumour incidence (Innes et al. (1969)).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) In February 1980, my predecessor authorised experiments in data broadcasting transmissions while stating that the position would be reviewed in three years. No Australian standard for data broadcasting can be established until the review is completed. In the meantime, however, in order to give the hearing impaired the opportunity to benefit from existing technology, I announced on 12 March 1982, that a data broadcasting system known as UK Teletext was the most practicable system available for prompt implementation of a closed caption service. This does not prevent stations from using different data broadcasting systems for closed captioning during the current experimental period.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Australian Caption Centre (ACC) in Sydney is in the process of establishing itself with the assistance of a substantial grant of funds from the Government. Its function is to produce captions for programs supplied to it by television stations. The ACC is expected to be operational towards the end of 1982 and will begin captioning using the UK Teletext system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The nature of the miscellaneous revenue item is such that major fluctuations in the level of receipts occur from year to year due to the varying levels of income that arise from sale of obsolete and surplus equipment and saleable publications (including collection of sales tax), from the hire of Departmental equipment and facilities at the Vehicle Emissions Laboratory, and from receipts in respect of appropriations of former years.</PARA>
<PARA> The estimates for this revenue item are therefore basically formulated upon the level of receipts of the previous year after taking into account any known variations. The reduced level of receipts in 1980-81 is reflected in the 1981-82 estimate of $600,000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) A small number of people, mainly scientists, at Materials Research Laboratories, Melbourne are employed on investigations into chemical defence. Australia has not, is not, and has no plans to become, engaged in research into the handling of disease producing biological agents.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP) and the Basic Standardisation Agreement are arrangements allowing an interchange of information over a wide range of subjects of Defence interest. TTCP has, for example, between 60 and 70 technical meetings each year. Many of them are attended by defence scientists from Australia or our overseas defence scientific representatives and almost all require some participation of Departmental officers in briefing, attendance or reporting. Thus the overall participation of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the Services is diffused throughout these organisations and is not easily quantified. It is inherent in TTCP that no participant is dedicated to TTCP alone but brings to the cooperative activity his expertise and results from Australian Defence programmes. As at September 1981 at least 135 officers at several levels in the Second and Third Divisions of the Public Service are directly involved in TTCP activities in part time capacities. None participate full time. Forty-five Service officers are directly involved in the Basic Standardisation Agreement of whom nine are employed full time on their work.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) This information is not obtainable within the limits of available resources .</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Ten civilians and one Service officer are directly involved on a part time basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Meetings in each specific field of interest are held at a frequency of about 12-18 months. Correspondence and data exchange between meetings is on an as required basis.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) Research on defence against chemical agents is not conducted in response to a specific perceived threat, but rather in relation to the potential threat. The threat to Australia of chemical or biological warfare is considered by many to be low, yet the damage caused by these agents is almost universally acknowledged to be horrifying. We would clearly be remiss if we could not protect ourselves effectively should the need arise.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has acknowledged its responsibility to ensure that Australia is properly defended and that the Australian Defence Force is properly protected against chemical and biological weapons.</PARA>
<PARA> For many years it has been the policy of successive Defence Ministers to maintain the skills necessary to advise on the means for protecting Australians, both military and civilian, from chemical warfare attack.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. On 2 March in a talk to the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-servicemen and women, Mr Volker said, in respect of reasons for decision, 'We are seeking to reduce the complexity of reasons for decisions prepared by determining authorities and to reduce their length, especially in those cases where claims are being accepted or appeals allowed.'</PARA>
<PARA> He referred to other action taken to speed up the processing of claims and appeals and went on to say, with reference to the complexity of Repatriation legislation 'We have some concern that administrative law changes in recent years may be running counter to a fundamental of the whole Repatriation system that claims should be resolved expeditiously and with the least amount of red tape or inconvenience to the ex-serviceman or woman.'</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) On 25 January 1982, in an address reported by the media, I made it clear that the Government would not be proposing any amendment to legislation in the light of the High Court decision Law v Repatriation Commission.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr Thomson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Australia exercises sovereignty over all of the islands and territories situated south of 60*S latitude between 45*E and 160*E longitudes, except for those islands and territories between 136*E and 142*E longitudes. Under the definition of 'Australia' given in the Acts Interpretation Act the Australian Antarctic Territory, being an External Territory, is not considered to be an integral part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There are a number of objects, sites and structures in the AAT classified as Historic Monuments under the Antarctic Treaty. One of these, the main base hut of the 1911-1914 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, now known as Mawson's Hut, was placed on the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission in November 1978.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Sir Douglas Mawson laid the foundations of Australia's activities in Antarctica. His many contributions began in 1907 as a member of Sir Ernest Shackleton's British Antarctic Expedition when he was a member of the first party to climb Mount Erebus and of the three man party which was the first to the South Magnetic Pole. He subsequently organised and led the Australasian Antarctic Expedition of 1911-14, using funds from private and government sources . The expedition established bases on Macquarie Island, the Shackleton Ice Shelf and at Commonwealth Bay, where it constructed headquarters, later known as ' Mawson's Hut'. The expedition also mapped over 1,000 km of new coastline, collected valuable scientific data, was the first to transmit radio messages from Antarctica and was the first to attempt use of aircraft in Antarctica. Mawson himself achieved an extraordinary feat of endurance and courage when he walked nearly 200 km alone in appalling conditions to return to Commonwealth Bay after the death of his two companions and the loss of most of their equipment. He was knighted for his efforts on this expedition.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1929-31 he led the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) which explored and mapped much new territory south of Australia and claimed British sovereignty for the area. This territory was later ceded to Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> Sir Douglas Mawson became a leading member of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition's (ANARE) Planning Committee after it was established in 1947.</PARA>
<PARA> The first permanent station on the Antarctic continent other than in the Antarctic peninsular region was established by Australia in 1954 and named after Sir Douglas Mawson. The fifth of May this year marks the hundredth anniversary of the birth of this great Australian. My Department, with the co-operation of other bodies, is undertaking several projects to mark the occasion.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) I refer the honourable member to the answer to an earlier question on notice (No. 1746) on page 2946 of Hansard 17 November 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) It would take approximately 12 personnel two summer seasons to restore Mawson's Hut. The cost for equipment, clothing, food and salaries would be approximately $300,000 per annum, in 1982 dollar terms. However, the shipping necessary to support such a restoration program cannot be provided from existing resources as all available ships are fully utilised in supporting the higher priority science and rebuilding programs. If restoration work was to begin immediately it would be necessary to charter an additional ice strengthened ship from a northern hemisphere source. This would cost about $3 million for the two seasons. While the matter is under review, the current planning is to defer restoration until the rebuilding program is past its peak later in the decade and excess shipping capacity becomes available.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Government has no plans to provide facilities for tourists to visit the Australian Antarctic Territory. The very high cost and hazardous conditions associated with life in the Antarctic, together with the extreme fragility of the environment, render the area unsuited for normal tourist activities.</PARA>
