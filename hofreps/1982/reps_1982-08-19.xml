<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have noticed the call by the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia for the inquiry to which the honourable member referred. The honourable member will be aware that this Government introduced as one of its initiatives to assist small business the Small Business Advisory Council. Recently the Minister for Industry and Commerce asked me to chair that Council. I will be chairing it at its next meeting. It comprises representatives of both employers and trade unions and departmental officers, and, of course, a member of the Opposition traditionally is invited to attend meetings. I expect that this is one of the first matters which will be considered at the next meeting of the Small Business Advisory Council. As soon as that meeting is concluded I will report to Sir Phillip Lynch and the Government as to the appropriate course of action.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to see that the Treasurer has now come into the House. My question is addressed to him. Is it a fact that sales tax on such basic household goods as furniture, bedding, cutlery, refrigerators, washing machines, heaters, kitchenware, lighting, floor coverings and electrical goods is being increased by another 50 per cent in this year's Budget? Does this bring the total increase in sales tax on these goods in the past two years to a massive 200 per cent? Is it also a fact that sales tax on such luxury items as jewellery and furs is being increased by only eight per cent, making a total increase over the past two years of just on 18 per cent? Can the Treasurer explain this anomaly?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to the House for my not being here earlier. I do not accept that the assertion of the honourable member for Henty that this is an anomaly is an accurate description. The fact is that the rate of sales tax on luxury items, as a result of the increases I announced the other night, is to be 32 1/2 per cent. Obviously, if one makes the same increase to each of the three steps in a sales tax scale the percentage increase for items at the top end of the scale will be less than for those at other points in the scale. The honourable member will be aware that, as part of the overall tax package contained in the Budget, there have been some modest increases in sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is advantage in broadening our sales tax base and in reducing the over reliance that our taxation system still has on personal tax as a source of revenue. The honourable member is correct in identifying the items that she has identified as being subject to the sales tax increase. Of course, I draw her attention to the fact that average Australian households will be better off to the tune of $16, $17 or $18 a week net after allowing for those increases after 1 November. Average Australian households overall will be significantly better off in disposable income terms as a result of all of the tax changes I announced in the Budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Berowra for his question. I know of his great interest in science and technology. I saw a headline in a newspaper which called this a good news Budget. It is certainly a good news Budget with regard to astronomy and Australia's space projects. I have approved the funding of a feasibility study on the Starlab project costing $3.337m over the next two years. It will be funded under the public interest provisions of the Industrial Research Development Incentives Act. I say in passing that the criticism of this Act by the Opposition yesterday was completely ill-informed and that its figures were wrong. The public interest provisions of the Act have been amended to include an advisory committee to advise me in the selection of projects instead of the Department of Science and Technology doing so as it did previously. The first committee meeting was held two weeks ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee, which consists of businessmen and scientists, considered the Starlab project. It made a very strong recommendation that we should fund the feasibility study of this project. I inform honourable members that this is a joint Australian-Canadian-American proposal to place a one metre telescope in earth orbit in 1989 using a National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space shuttle. I see it as a very important project. It is of importance not only to scientists but also to Australian industry. Eighty per cent of the Starlab work will go to Australian firms. Fifteen Australian firms have expressed interest. It will help to get Australia into the space age. If the feasibility study is successful and the Government eventually decides to go ahead with the project it will take us into the next century and beyond. Together with the Australia Telescope it will put us in the forefront of that branch of science. Honourable members may be interested to know that the telescope, which will be in space above the earth's atmosphere--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. No doubt he will recall making an allowance in the 1981-82 Budget of $300m for revenue losses due to tax avoidance. I refer the Treasurer to the Government's failure to make any allowance for revenue losses due to tax avoidance in this year's Budget. Is the Treasurer aware of the statment on page 62 of Budget Paper No. 1 which refers to the Government's measures to stamp on some of the more notorious examples of tax evasion and avoidance? Does this mean that the remaining notorious examples of tax evasion and avoidance are still operating and likely to cause substantial revenue losses this year? Is the Treasurer also aware of a report in the Press earlier this month that the Australian Taxation Office had identified 100 tax avoidance schemes used by high income earners in recent years, that only about half of those schemes had been legislated against and that it was too early, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Taxation, to identify new schemes used last year? In view of this apparent continued proliferation of tax avoidance schemes, how can the Treasurer possibly justify making no allowances for tax avoidance losses this year in the Budget?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that there is no allowance this year results from advice I received from the Commissioner of Taxation to the effect that no such allowance was necessary. That decision results entirely and exclusively from that information and that advice being tendered to me and to the Government by the Commissioner of Taxation. So far as the reports to which the honourable gentleman referred are concerned, if the honourable gentleman's real knowledge and understanding of this issue were evident he would know that in May of last year this Parliament, with the support of the Opposition, passed a new general anti-avoidance section which will have the effect, from that date, of prohibiting blatant artifical tax avoidance arrangements. It is the growing opinion, not only of the Taxation Office and the Government's official advisers but also of many private sector people who have knowledge of these matters, that the Government's anti-tax avoidance legislation has been remarkably effective.

I refer to the Minister's recent announcement that he has approved the registration of AMWSU Health Care Ltd as a health fund under the National Health Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union did put forward a proposal to set up a private health fund under the Government's private health insurance scheme. It was an interesting commentary, indeed, on the support of a union organisation for private health funds, in marked contrast to the treatment it would get under the Labor Party, whose policy would cause that fund to be closed down. If there is an extension of the closed health funds and if the numbers in those funds build up too much and take healthy insured people out of the general funds, the Government has an obvious concern that the community rating principle of the general open funds might in some way be damaged. This matter was considered very carefully by the Department of Health and by me. The maximum number of people that are likely to come into the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union fund is about 180,000, against the total in the open funds of about 10 million people. My advice is that this will not have a substantial effect on the community rating principle. There may be other applications. I understand one was mentioned in the Press this morning and it will be considered in the same way on its merits. It is quite important to see a union which has certain influences within the Opposition party coming out so clearly against the Labor Party's health proposals. In my discussions with the union officials I pointed out to them the dangers that they were entering into should there be a Labor government because their fund would be closed down by such a government coming into office.</PARA></TALK.START>

It reflects the views of many other firms of chartered accountants and many other legal firms throughout Australia, the views of the Government's own Taxation Advisory Committee, the views of the Australian Taxation Office and the views of many people who have, in fact, followed this particular issue and this particular debate over the years. From the time that the Government and not the Opposition made fighting tax avoidance an issue in this Parliament from April 1978 the cumulative view of all of those people is that the action the Government has taken and the legislation this Parliament has passed have been remarkably effective and demonstrate what we have repeatedly claimed, namely, that this Government has done more than any other to stamp out and to keep stamped out tax avoidance practices in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is some flasher. The honourable member for Fadden brought this matter to my attention recently. I discussed the concept with the Department. I should like to give the honourable member an assurance that I will have the device thoroughly tested and evaluated to see whether it is better than the equipment currently being used. But it is true that costs for marine searches are very high indeed in Australia. We anticipate each year an estimated expenditure of about $1m. For instance, as I understand it, the search for the windsurfer cost $185,000. It was unfortunate that, although he was sighted on one occasion, due to bad weather the searchers were unable to sight him again. There is no doubt that a device that was satisfactory-a device perhaps of this nature-may have helped locate that unfortunate victim of the sea.

Is the Prime Minister aware that the same merchant banks now appear to have been involved in tax avoidance and tax minimisation, bearing in mind a report to the Victorian Corporate Affairs Commission which states that a large number of companies not referred to in the McCabe-Lafranchi report appear to have been so involved and have a connection with those merchant banks, and in fact operate from an address in Collins Street, Melbourne? Is it a fact that those merchant banks and those companies have some association with the painters and dockers inquiry? Is the Prime Minister aware of any fraud on the Commonwealth revenue as a result of those operations? Is it not a fact that the commissioner inquiring into the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union furnished an interim report to the Government as far back as 27 July which has still not been tabled in this Parliament and which contains a chapter relating to the amount of fraud on the Commonwealth revenue?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I thank the honourable member very much for those three days. The last interim report of the royal commissioner has three parts to it. He recommends that two of those volumes should not be published because he believes that that would impede investigations which he wishes to pursue further . There is one chapter in the report that did not go to the Victorian Government officially, which I think is the chapter to which the honourable member referred in his question. The Commonwealth wanted to be in a position, and will be in a position next Tuesday, to table its response to the report at the same time as tabling the report in this Parliament. I earlier saw a newspaper report that the Victorian Premier was intending to publish the report even though his Parliament was not sitting. I wrote to him suggesting that it would be more appropriate for the report to be tabled in the Parliament. Indeed, I think that earlier newspaper report was probably referring to something that was said before the report had been read. I suspect that there would be very substantial problems and difficulties for anyone who published this report not under the privilege of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that there was a letter from the Victorian Premier to the Attorney -General-this is subject to confirmation, and if it is not correct I will advise the House later-suggesting that there should be simultaneous tabling in the Victorian Parliament and the Commonwealth Parliament when the Victorian Parliament resumes its sittings, I think early in September. For our part we believe the report ought to be tabled as soon as possible. It is the Attorney- General's intention to do that on Tuesday. The Government has been examining the matter very closely over more than one meeting in the course of this week and initially also last week because it wanted to make up its mind about some recommendations. We wanted to be able to indicate to the Parliament the very substantial actions that the Government would be taking as a consequence of the report. That will be done next Tuesday and the honourable gentleman's anxiety can then be assuaged.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="688" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BENNELONG" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a suggestion this morning in at least one newspaper to the effect that the example that I used in the Budget Speech of the impact of taxation and other changes on a single income family comprising two children and a dependent spouse with a weekly income of $300 was not very representative. According to what I understand to be the most recent statistics of families in Australia with dependent children approximately 50 per cent of them involve two incomes and about 50 per cent involve a single income. I understand that the statistics are perhaps a year or two old but they are nonetheless the most recent. Thus to that extent I reject the claim that the example I used was unrepresentative, but that is not really the point of the matter. The point is that the benefits contained in the Budget for double income families in roughly equivalent circumstances are very real indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we take the case of a double income family receiving a total weekly income of $400 a week-many double income families in Australia would be receiving much more than $400 a week-and if we assume that there was a split of 60-40 between the partners in contributing to that income the family would still have gross benefits under the Budget of $18.69 a week less some adjustment in respect of indirect taxation of some $3 or $4 a week. So the benefits would be very real. If we take a double income family with a total weekly income of $500-there would be many thousands of Australian families in modest circumstances where, as a result of two incomes, the total household income would be about $500 a week-the gain from the taxation and other changes in the Budget will be $20.69 a week before allowance is made for the effect of the indirect tax increases. Certainly I do not pretend for a moment that every family in Australia is represented by an example of a husband, dependent wife and two children, although when children are young that is still representative of a very significant number of Australian families. The Budget's provisions quite designedly had the position of those families in mind when it spelt out the taxation changes that it did. Likewise the benefits that flow to double income families are also very real. They are equivalent and on all fours with the concessions that have been made to single income families.</PARA>
<PARA> The other point I make is that the dollar increase which has been made in the sole parent rebate represents a more generous treatment of that category of taxpayers than has been the case in the past when rebates have been adjusted. On other occasions when the dependent spouse rebate has been adjusted the increase to the sole parent rebate has been proportionate to the increase in the dependent spouse rebate. On this occasion we have increased the sole parent rebate by precisely the same dollar amount as the spouse rebate has been increased. To that extent we have marginally improved the position of sole parents in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Government imposing extra costs on drought stricken primary producers by changing the diesel fuel excise exemption to a rebate? Does the Government know that fuel costs represent a high proportion of farm cash costs, for example, 13 per cent for wheat growers ? Will farmers have to fill in a form to get the rebate?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The changes that I announced on Tuesday night do not represent by any stretch of the imagination discrimination against primary producers. Indeed, to the extent that the Government has decided to retain a situation where primary producers do not bear the excise on off-road distillate, the Budget has in fact deliberately discriminated in favour of primary producers. Any suggestion that the Budget is some kind of visitation of difficulty on drought affected farmers plainly means that the honourable gentleman has not read the Budget documentation. What the Government has done is to introduce a rebate system for enjoyment of the exemption and has abolished the old system because it was subject to fraud. It was subject to abuse and there was evidence that people were using distillate purchased excise-free for on-road and not off-road purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only thing the Government could reasonably do in the circumstances, whilst protecting those areas of the economy which it believed were deserving of continued protection including, particularly in the light of the present drought , primary producers, was to introduce the system that we in fact introduced. The rebates will be processed rapidly. People entitled to them will not have to wait for the end of the year. Rebates will not be handled by the Taxation Office. They will be handled by the Australian Bureau of Customs. Additional staff will be recruited to handle the new system. It will work better and more fairly to the benefit of all concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The growing of sugar cane in the Ord has been a matter of serious conversation between the Queensland Government and the Western Australian Government. The position that the Commonwealth has adopted in respect of this matter is simply to state that it has no jurisdiction to make decisions in respect of land use at either the Ord River or any other part of Australia. Therefore, a decision as to the growing of sugar cane in Western Australia has to be of necessity a decision taken by the Western Australian Government. The Commonwealth can have no say in that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Prime Minister aware of the Victorian Premier's allegation that Victoria is unfairly treated in respect of drought relief under the natural disaster relief arrangement because of the requirement that the State must meet in full the first $7m of expenditure? Is this allegation true?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="690" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The support arrangements in respect of natural disasters have been long standing and have worked very smoothly between the States. Until the intervention of Mr Cain, they seem to have worked in a fairly co-operative fashion. For example, in relation to previous droughts, a number of States have proposed specific additional measures because of the circumstances of those droughts and, I think, overwhelmingly the Commonwealth has accepted additional measures that might be relevant to the circumstances of those States. There is a core list of measures which receive the automatic approval and support of the Commonwealth. That is well known to all State governments. If there are other specific measures which any State would like the Commonwealth to consider, it will do so expeditiously and quickly. I understand that in Victoria at the moment a drought has been declared in one shire, the Shire of Kerang.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is worth noting that there is a base level of funds which each State is meant to provide before the Commonwealth is involved. Thereafter the Commonwealth provides $3 for every dollar provided by the States. So if it is a significant and major disaster, obviously the Commonwealth would be providing the bulk of the funds. The base levels for the different States are: New South Wales, $10m; Victoria, $7m; Queensland, $4m; South Australia, $3m; Western Australia, $3m; Tasmania, $1.2m; and the Northern Territory, $0.25m. Those base levels were last set in 1978-79. So the real value of those base levels has obviously been reduced over time through inflation. They have not been adjusted as State revenues have significantly increased during that period. Therefore, the base levels would represent a considerably lesser proportion of and a lesser burden on State funds than would have been the case in 1978-79 when those base sums were first set.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope very much that the Victorian Goverment will continue the close co- operation with the Commonwealth in the management of natural disasters because the omens for the period ahead of us are very bad indeed. The weather patterns seem to be set in a way which is offering no relief over large parts of eastern Australia. In Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria a large part of the cropping areas is already facing total disaster. That applies to New South Wales in particular. The pastoral areas could still be saved but the likelihood of that happening in a major way is, I believe, remote. I hope earnestly that that view will be demonstrated to be totally false, but once this weather pattern sets in it is unlikely to alter. We could be facing the worst drought we have had for many decades, beyond the living memory of most members of this House.</PARA>
<PARA> Against that backgound we will need the circumstances in which governments are prepared to co-operate and to work together. It is quite the wrong time to be arguing about the long-accepted arrangements which have existed between the Commonwealth and the States in relation to the support of individuals who might be hurt in these matters. The Commonwealth-I have advised the Premier of this- stands ready to meet its obligations, as it has in past years. The total obligations in support of drought relief have been $100m over the last two years -very substantial indeed. Probably only a relatively small part of that amount was spent in Victoria because the drought has been much worse in other States. Under the present weather patterns, Victoria could be engulfed by drought just as much as New South Wales, Queensland or parts of Western Australia. But it will take a little while to see whether that fear is confirmed or whether the weather pattern breaks and a reasonable season unfolds in a significant part of Victoria and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> Potentially, rural parts of Australia are facing an extremely serious and damaging situation and they are doing so at a time when stock prices are low because of depressed world markets. Farmers and farming organisations will need the co-operation of governments. I only wish that Mr Cain would get on with the business of accepting his obligations as they have been accepted by previous governments in all States on previous occasions. Whenever Queensland, Western Australia or New South Wales have suggested special measures because of particular circumstances in their States those special measures have almost overwhelmingly been accepted by the Commonwealth as part of the pattern of arrangements that ought to be supported. There are core measures which the Premier knows full well we will apply forthwith and without consultation to any area which his State designates as a drought area in Victoria. I hope this sniping and passing of the buck in relation--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6I4">Mr MACPHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I repeat what I said yesterday: My Department is not responsible for estimating unemployment benefit recipients. Those estimates are for average unemployment benefit recipients. Those estimates are made by the Department of the Treasury and administered by the Department of Social Security. I have no reason to disbelieve those figures. What I said and what I am pleased to say in terms of my Department's estimates is that I think the unemployment rate next year, certainly around February-March, will be in the order of 8 per cent. That is based on the forecast of no economic growth and on the fact that a number of people will be entering the work force. We base it on surveys of the employment shedding which is now occurring. I think it is a reasonable estimate-I know the Treasurer expressed the same view yesterday-that we will be looking at an unemployment rate, probably around February or March, of about or slightly above 8 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I do not know how many of those people will be eligible for unemployment benefit, nor do I know what the average number will be throughout the year. Many of the people who, in fact, might be retrenched might move on to other social security arrangements, such as those associated with early retirement, and many others will not necessarily satisfy the criteria for unemployment benefit, especially if they were second income earners in their families.</PARA>

The aspect of this Budget that is most important is that if there is a sensible approach to hours of work and wages over the next 12 months the unemployment figure need not get any worse than the 8 per cent I have mentioned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Generally speaking, those categories which will no longer be exempt will include construction industry, sections of manufacturing that were enjoying the exemption, electricity generation and transport-particularly public transport. In fact, I think the area which will probably contribute the largest amount in terms of gain to revenue from the withdrawal of the concession will be government railways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman asked me what impact the withdrawal of the concession will have on private road transport. In all probability it will improve the competitive position of private road contractors because they will be in a much stronger competitive position with government railways. Hitherto government railways have enjoyed what some would see as the unfair competitive advantage of not paying the excise in respect of the diesel fuel that they consume whereas their competitors, as private road transport contractors, have had to pay the excise. I would say that with the removal of that benefit the position of those private road contractors-the position of truckies, for example-will be significantly improved.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assertions by the Premier of Victoria seem to rely on a very inadequate understanding of the Budget Papers, by his failure to read those Papers and to understand what they mean to the State. Some payments of a specific purpose character are included in the total payments for all States but they have not yet been allocated among the States. These include, for example, the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program and some water programs which have not been allocated among the States in the Budget Papers. As a consequence, whereas total payments to the States increased by 13.4 per cent the increase to Victoria in presently allocated payments in the Budget Papers is 12 per cent. I am advised that that is the position for all States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In many ways Victoria does much better than a number of other States. Its general revenue grants will rise by 11.6 per cent against the six States average of 10.8 per cent, which is greater than the increase for Queensland and Western Australia which are not and never will become Labor States. Its basic tax sharing grant, leaving aside the special $60m that was made over 15 months ago to benefit the beneficiary States under the changes to the tax allocations formula, was up 17 per cent compared with 13.8 per cent for South Australia, and 13 per cent for Western Australia and Tasmania. Again, this shows Victoria doing very much better than those other three States. Its specific purpose recurrent grants will rise by 16.3 per cent against the six States average of 15.3 per cent-a greater increase than for South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania . Its general purpose capital grants will rise by 5 per cent-the same percentage as the other States. Half of that amount was allocated for welfare housing. At this point I remind the House that we also indicated that if the States wished to increase further their funds for welfare housing from their general purpose capital grants we would do so under the terms and conditions of the Commonwealth -State Housing Agreement which, of course, is more favourable to the States than the terms of the general purpose capital grants. There is potential for additional sums to be made available for welfare housing as a result of that decision by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting also that Victoria benefits very specifically from other areas of Commonwealth policy. I add that those areas at times give trouble to members in other States. Because of the nature of industry in Victoria-the preponderance of manufacturing industry-it has benefited and is benefiting very greatly from the general decisions that we made in relation to the textile, clothing and footwear industries and the motor industries. Victoria also stands to benefit very greatly indeed from the general provisions that we introduced for improved depreciation provisions for all Australian industry. These advantages to Victoria will be very substantial indeed. Mr Cain cannot sustain the charge of bias against Victoria. The figures show quite plainly that Victoria has been very fairly treated and the proper position of Victoria has been very well recognised in the decisions of the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this time of the year-Budget time-we hear a great deal about tax avoidance and tax evasion and companies structured for that purpose. Today I wish to comment on a private company in Melbourne which imports aircraft, both new and second hand. This company is chaired by a former Minister in the Fraser Government, Mr Tony Staley. The company today is known as Jet Corporation of Australia. Let me outline to the House the type of company for which this former Minister now acts as chairman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the Australian advertising supplement of Wednesday 28 April, which I have with me, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The company looks at aircraft sales and servicing from an investment angle. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an entirely investment project, not a love affair with aeroplanes or a way of making a living. </PARA>
<PARA> They can even formulate a five-year plan for development with firm estimates of turnover and profitability. </PARA>
<PARA>The supplement contains a large photograph of the men at the helm of Jet Corporation: Mr Trevor Huttley, the deputy chairman; Mr Tony Staley, chairman; and Mr Jon Wilson, managing director. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Jon Wilson and Mr Trevor Huttley were two of the main personalities concerned when the veteran Schutt Aviation organisation was taken over in 1978. At that time the two men had a colleague in the business by the name of Edward Sent. Mr Sent sold his shares in the business in 1981 for a reported $4m to the company now headed by the former Minister, Mr Staley. Mr Sent, of Summit Drive, Eaglemont, Victoria appeared in a Sydney court on 3 October 1980 charged with obtaining credit of $110,000 by false pretences. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall now deal with a particular case of fraud and deception in which I believe these men have engaged. On 25 June 1981-at the end of the financial year -a Spanish aircraft was flown into this country. The aircraft was destined to be purchased by a syndicate of South Australians organised by a South Australian solicitor, Mr Alex Payer. On the surface this looks like the normal type of business investment which flourished under the Fraser Government's 40 per cent investment allowance policies-investments basically indulged in by many wealthy people in order to take advantage of this Government's policies. However, these contemporaries of Mr Staley defrauded those investors in a big way. The aircraft involved was declared for taxation purposes as a new aircraft as only new aircraft were eligible for the investment allowance. The aircraft itself was a Casa 200 series 212. It was four years of age, with close to one thousand flying hours up, and had first flown in 1978. The value of the aircraft was close to $ 1m. It would be interesting to be able to have access to the Customs declarations which would clearly show the import price of the aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked the Bureau of Customs to make further inquiries. I have the reply to my letter of 2 August from Mr Kilkenny, who is the Collector of Customs in Victoria . He says that the matter has been referred to the appropriate section of the Bureau for further inquiries. I suggest that the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) should get involved to see what is going on in some of these companies. This company sold the $1m used aircraft to an aviation syndicate of South Australia as a new aircraft for more than $2m. This syndicate never inspected the aircraft. They relied upon the good name and integrity established by the Arthur Schutt organisation, whose integrity was unchallenged in the industry for 36 years. These men took over that organisation in 1978. They could not start up a business such as that overnight as the Department of Aviation would have to license them and the whole matter would involve a lot of time, money and trouble. It was much easier for them to buy out an existing licensed organisation with a good reputation if they could afford it, and this was done. With that actual organisation they also bought the fabulous goodwill which was built up all over the nation by one man, Arthur Schutt, M.B.E. Mr Schutt started operations before the war, survived Royal Australian Air Force service and, as soon as he could get organised after it, started his own operation at Essendon in 1947. This organisation is in business for one reason- investment. When Mr Schutt sold out, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I got to the point where I had to have big money to continue. Aeroplanes cost a lot of money . . . </PARA>
<PARA> That takes big capital-you get no interest on that . . . </PARA>
<PARA> At that time Mr Schutt was still a major personality in the organisation and a father figure. He was very valuable to the company because of his image. Let us look at what these men were able to do and the sort of money they have been able to put together to put these operations into practice. To illustrate this point, I quote from a supplement of the Australian. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be no exaggeration to say that when news got out of JetCorp's formation a year ago, the industry was staggered. No other general aviation venture had ever brought in big investors on the scale and standing that JetCorp attracted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board is impressed for what its members represent. There is the former Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, Mr Tony Staley, who is taking an increasing part in the day-to-day running of the firm though he is not a fulltime chairman. He finds it fascinating. His deputy is Mr T. B. Huttley, well known Melbourne accountant who built up his own firm. Mr Peter Russell represents Simon, Lidgett Collingwood, the stock exchange firm which was the key to the new organisation. Mr Marc Besen represents Sussan Lingerie and the big plastics firm of M. E. Hogg and Co. has three members on the Board. Messrs B. Collier, M. Hogg and L. Hogg with Mr S. Higgs representing T &amp; G. Mr Jon Wilson is of course the Managing Director. From the standpoint of big finance the great name is that of Sir Andrew Grimwade, a legend in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> Investors also include three banks, the State Electricity Commission's Retirement Benefit Fund, ACI and other prestige organisations whose very name is a guarantee of solidity. They have never invested in this sort of project before . </PARA>
<PARA> The first step was to provide $15,000,000 capital. </PARA>
<PARA> As Mr Wilson says-</PARA>
<PARA>This was quoted at the start of my speech-</PARA>
<PARA> This is the first time a general aviation organisation has been formed on such a scale that it can and does look at aircraft sales and servicing from the investment angle. </PARA>
<PARA>At a time when the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is telling the House that tax evasion and tax avoidance has ceased in this country-the Budget figures clearly show this-this company has clearly entered into a situation in the last 12 months with one purpose in mind; that is, of bringing aircraft into this country for investment for taxation purposes. The point that I believe should be brought to the attention of the Australian people and to this Parliament is that these men are not beyond doctoring the books and they are not beyond bringing in secondhand aircraft. I am raising this matter because I want the Treasurer to have an investigation conducted. There is no way an ordinary person can get the Customs documents needed to prove the case completely. But my information is that the aircraft is clearly four years old and that it was brought into the country on 25 June. In fact the date was specified. It had to be in on that date for the very purpose of being sold to this company in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If an aircraft comes into Australia and is genuinely passed through Customs at $1m there is no fraud. Of course, the Customs documents genuinely declare a secondhand aircraft. But if that aircraft is then sold to another company of unsuspecting investors at a price in excess of $2m and declared as a new aircraft, the Government is defrauded of massive amounts of taxation. At that time a 40 per cent investment allowance-some $800,000-was defrauded from the Taxation Office. Here we have an instance in which clearly over $1m profit was made on the sale of one aircraft and the Government dipped out on some $800,000 in genuine revenue from taxation. I do not believe that the people in my electorate who are paying their taxes should have to bear the cost of public expenditure in this country while organisations and people in this country are prepared to do those types of things. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last couple of weeks that very company sacked Arthur Schutt, a man whom it promised could have his job for life, and also sacked 20 employees because it is in great difficulty. The aircraft it brought into Australia and sold to investors is sitting on the tarmac and the company is doing very little. Company representatives declared that they intended to make that company public in 1983. I hope that the Treasurer will see fit to investigate quickly the allegations I make here today. If that aircraft has been brought in and is clearly proven to be that secondhand aircraft which I claim it is, those people ought to be made to pay the penalty for defrauding this country and going ahead with taxation concession schemes which clearly should be outlawed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union commenced on 1 October 1981. The terms of reference of that Royal Commission required the Commissioner to inquire into whether the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union or any officer or member of the Union had been engaged in illegal activities in relation to shipping. The direction to the Commission went on in some detail to express the particulars of the terms of reference. A great deal of evidence has been given before that Commission, including evidence on 23 April 1981 in relation to criminal records of members of the executive. The Commission has already brought in an interim report which we have not yet seen and it is due to finish its investigations by 31 December of this year. A report of the Sydney Morning Herald of 25 April 1981 amongst other things states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Douglas Meagher, assisting the commissioner, said the 11-man executive had a total of 251 convictions, an average of 23 a man. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Meagher said the number of convictions for each ranged from three to 61. </PARA>
<PARA>The same article later states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Meagher said nine members of the union executive had served prison sentences -a total of 41 years and seven months. </PARA>
<PARA> He said the total fines paid by the 11 men totalled $6,687. </PARA>
<PARA> He said they had committed offences in every State and all but two had used aliases. </PARA>
<PARA> Ten had been convicted within the past 10 years and six within the past three. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Meagher said the offences included street offences (offensive behaviour and minor offences), firearm offences, harbouring, arson, theft, assault, and, in one case, robbery with violence. </PARA>
<PARA>The question I think all honourable members would ask themselves is this: How is it that a union in this country could have an executive with a record that that executive has? The very great majority of unions in this country are very well served by their executive. One must ask these questions: Is it in the members' interests that they should have that sort of executive? Is it in the interests of the public that they have that sort of executive? I would have thought the answer was very simply no and that there was much to be said for the introduction of legislation along the lines of legislation which will be found in the Companies Act which, in certain circumstances, disqualifies people from holding office in companies and imposes a variety of duties upon office holders. In particular, sections 227 and 229 of the Companies Act 1981 deal with those matters. Amongst other things section 227 provides that a person who has been convicted on indictment of any offence in connection with the promotion, formation or management of a corporation or of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty punishable on conviction by imprisonment for a period of not less than three months shall not, within five years after his conviction, be in any way, whether directly or indirectly, concerned or take part in the management of a corporation. Provision is there for an offence which is punishable by a fine and a gaol sentence. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 229 deals with somewhat different matters, namely, the duties and liabilities of officers. Section 229 sub-section (1) states that an officer of a corporation is required at all times to act honestly in the exercise of his powers and the discharge of the duties of his office. Section 229 sub-section (2 ) states:</PARA>
<PARA> An officer . . . shall at all times exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence in the exercise of his powers and the discharge of his duties. </PARA>
<PARA>Sub-section (3) of section 229 states:</PARA>
<PARA> An officer . . . shall not make improper use of information acquired by virtue of his position . . . to gain, directly or indirectly, an advantage for himself or for any other person or cause detriment to the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA>Sub-section (4) states that an officer is prevented from making improper use of his position. Breaches of all those provisions attract criminal sanctions. These provisions apply to all corporations, to all companies, no matter how small or how large, from the small family company to the largest of corporations. There is no good reason why legislation to a similar effect, with modifications appropriate to reflect the different functions and the different nature of registered organisations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act-I refer to employer and employee organisations; particularly trade unions in this context- should not be placed upon such organisations. Obviously there is a very sound and fundamental reason for this and that is to prevent people who are utterly unfit by past conduct from holding office. In the case of a person convicted under the Companies Act, after his discharge from gaol-or where there has not been a gaol sentence, after the conviction-in the subsequent period of five years he can apply to the court for permission to hold office. The same kind of provision could apply to registered organisations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunities for abuse or misuse of the positions held on the executive of a registered organisation-I am thinking in particular of an organisation such as the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia, or indeed any major union-are too obvious to need stating. After all, these days registered organisations, depending, of course, on their size, have access to large funds. The officers of the organisations have an obligation one would think to act solely in the interests of their members, not perhaps disregarding entirely the interests of the general public. Surely office holders should enjoy the trust and confidence of the rank and file and the respect of the general public. In the kind of example that I have put to this House it could never be said that they should enjoy the trust and confidence of the rank and file and, certainly, it could never be said that they could enjoy the respect of the general public. </PARA>
<PARA> In answer to a question earlier today the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said that next Tuesday, if my recollection is correct, the Commonwealth's response to the interim report of the Royal Commission into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union would be made known. I hope this Government will consider immediately and carefully the introduction of legislation imposing disqualifications and obligations similar to those provided for under the Companies Act. I hope that if the Government takes that course all honourable members of this House will support legislation to that effect as being in the interests not only of union members but also of the general public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several months ago two old friends, a husband and wife, came to my electorate office. I knew they had just retired. Unfortunately they were very distressed. They had gone to ITP-the Income Tax Professionals-in Burwood to have their final income tax return prepared. The manager knew they were receiving a lump sum for long service leave. Mr Jeff Watt J.P. attended them. He suggested that a good tax avoidance scheme was to place their money in the Alpex Commodity Traders Ltd and therefore they would not lose their fringe benefits. Their big concern was to keep their fringe benefits. After a lifetime of working the husband put $12,000 long service leave money, on the advice of ITP, into Alpex Commodity Traders and that chain of companies. Unfortunately this money is now substantially lost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am afraid this incident opened a Pandora's box for me not just at the action of ITP in taking a secret commission, for selling and promoting this Alpex Commodity Traders, but for the whole number and range of schemes in the community in which elderly folk, retired people, or people about to retire are encouraged to place their funds and thereby obtain the fringe benefits. There are many schemes floating in the community and these give me great concern. The Alpex scheme is well known and has had considerable publicity. The original chartered accountants involved with the scheme, Walker, Meares and Co., miraculously are still acting for the receivers. Apparently there appears to be no conflict of interest for Walker, Meares and Co. My constituents had one aim and that was to keep the medical card. I told them that only the Australian Labor Party offers a decent, fair and honest health scheme. For a small payment we will again have Medibank, which will be fair to the patients, fair to the doctors and fair to the hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> I have noted and I have been approached by various pensioner groups about an organisation called the Australian Retired Persons Association friendly society. I am sure this organisation is an honest organisation, but it is doing what Alpex was doing. It is seeking money from retired people. It is advertising even in many of the papers circulated to pensioners. Another organisation, Brick Securities Ltd, is doing the same thing. They are taking advantage of certain tax provisions available to them under the Friendly Societies Act. They are registering in Victoria and soliciting money in the other States, particularly New South Wales, without any legal basis. In fact, I am told that, under the New South Wales Friendly Societies Act, it is illegal to solicit money in that State . Yet in the May-June 1982 issue of Reveille there appears an advertisement directed to retired members. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> You can now invest . . . 13 1/2% Per Annum Tax Free and without affecting your entitlement to the Service Pension or Fringe Benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Budget we are told that there is no tax avoidance. Yet these retired people and ex-servicemen are putting money into these schemes of the Australian Retired Persons Association and into Brick Securities. The Government is pledged to stop any tax avoidance through these schemes. These people are putting their funds at risk in these schemes. There must be a clampdown on these schemes and a plugging of the loophole which enables them to get around the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is of great concern to me that the Australian Retired Persons Association is actively promoting throughout Australia a week it is calling Senior Australia Week. It is claiming that this week has the support of organisations of high standing such as the Council of the Aging in New South Wales and that is untrue. I have been told by members of the executive of that organisation that they are most concerned that Senior Australia Week is being promoted by the Australian Retired Persons Association, which puts out a newsletter called Silver Power. It is being promoted not to advance the interests of our senior citizens but merely to promote the interests of the Australian Retired Persons Association friendly society. This organisation quite clearly is after the funds of the retired. This is a genuine business undertaking. I have no quibble about that. What I am complaining about is that it is a scheme aimed at getting the savings of the pensioners and it is offering tax free advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget we have a statement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) which is endorsed by the Government that all these tax free loopholes will be plugged and that there will be no tax advantages. The senior citizens, pensioners and retired people are being deceived by these organisations. They are being deceived by the Australian Retired Persons Association, by Brick Securities and by similar schemes operating under the Victorian Friendly Societies Act. This matter is of great concern to me because it involves a group of people who are not endowed with financial expertise and are not used to dealing with securities and investments. My friends who brought this matter to my attention had previously never entered an investment of this nature in their lives. Yet, they signed over $12,000 to Alpex Commodity Traders Ltd and lost most of this money. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that the Federal Government, as the Government with responsibility for pensioners and senior citizens, must act together with the States to ensure that the pensioners do not lose their savings. This area of senior citizens' investment is an enormous part of the investment market. So many people retire after a lifetime of work with a lump sum superannuation payment or a large amount of money paid for long service leave. Yet the Government has left this vulnerable group in society completely unprotected. It is a group which is completely open to exploitation. All that these people want to do is keep their fringe benefits. I advise the old people in Australia and people about to retire not to put their money into funds and schemes that are not guaranteed by a State government or by the Federal Government. The Victorian friendly societies scheme does not protect funds outside Victoria. People from New South Wales, other States and the Northern Territory who are putting money into these funds have no guarantee of the security of their investment. If the fund is in difficulty they cannot necessarily get their money back. I call on the Treasurer, who is allegedly plugging the loopholes in the tax Act, to let us know what is happening with this scheme of Brick Securities. That company is advertising throughout Australia about tax free investments and the Australian retired persons scheme. It is getting around this loophole in the Friendly Societies Act . </PARA>
<PARA> This matter is giving me great concern. Many people-friends and constituents who are approaching retirement age-are ringing me about it. Often the husband and wife are both earning income and both work in the Public Service or in other jobs where they will receive superannuation and they want to get the fringe benefits. I say to these people: 'Your guarantee is the Labor Party's health scheme. It will give you a health scheme about which you will not have to worry. You will not have to worry if you are sick; you will have a simple, straightforward health scheme. You will have security for your investments if you put them in a bank or a building society. You should have nothing to do with these schemes which aim at avoiding the paying of tax so that you can keep the fringe benefits'. </PARA>
<PARA> I served in other places for a long time and I never named an organisation under parliamentary privilege because I regard that as a last resort, but I was so appalled that an elderly couple should go to a firm such as ITP to have their final taxation returns assessed, only to find that the man in whom they were placing their trust was leading them to invest their money in a firm for which investment he got a commission, that I did so. That is an appalling situation. I am told that the Tax Agents Registration Board in Sydney has taken no action against this firm as yet. I am told that it is short of staff in Sydney and the Government cutbacks have stopped any action against this firm. I have told these people to take legal action. They are just too frightened to do so. They have never been in court in their lives. They do not want to take legal action. They have lost their money. I think the Government stands condemned for cutting staff in the Public Service and stopping the Tax Agents Registration Board from supervising these tax agents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tomorrow, we are led to believe, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Labor Party leaders are to sit down and work out the approach that they are going to recommend to the unions of this country regarding the future level of wage demands. The subject of wage levels is of paramount importance to our future economic well-being. We have kidded ourselves up until now that somehow we would survive, regardless of the enormous wage increases and the reduction in working hours. Unfortunately, the chickens are now coming home to roost and they are finding that their perches have disappeared. We have been pricing ourselves out of world markets and out of jobs .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Wage increases have borne almost no relationship to the ability of businesses or the economy to pay. For example, I saw a report recently that since 1969-70 our production per head of population has risen by 18 per cent while money wages have risen by 255 per cent. In 1980-81 average weekly earnings for males increased by 13 1/2 per cent. Inflation in that year was 9.4 per cent. Last year wages went up by around 15 per cent and inflation was 10.4 per cent. Wage rises have consistently been more than the inflation rate. Let us compare that with the situation overseas. This year's Budget Paper No. 1, speaking of the situation in 1981, states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in the United States total compensation per employee rose by around 9 1/2 per cent; in Japan by 7 per cent; and in West Germany by less than 6 per cent. There have been signs of further slowing in wages growth in these countries in 1982. In the United States, compensation per civilian non- farm worker increased at an annual rate of around 7 per cent in early 1982, while in West Germany the 1982 wages round has been completed and most settlements were for increases of less than 4 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>Compare that with our wage increase of somewhere between 15 per cent and 17 per cent. The result has been that growth in our economy has been killed off. Profits have fallen. Our inflation rate has risen. Exports have fallen and now unemployment is rising. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has been acutely aware of the problem and has consistently been calling for wage restraint. A good example of the Government's resolve in this matter is our own salary increases. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) submitted to the Remuneration Tribunal this year that maximum restraint ought to be exercised in relation to the salaries of members of parliament. Subsequently, the Tribunal recommended with-I use its term-'considerable hesitation' an increase in salaries of 7 per cent from 1 October this year. That increase in the salaries of members of parliament, I remind the House, is an effective increase for this financial year of 5.25 per cent. The Tribunal, in handing down its determination, also stated that it would keep salaries under review. </PARA>
<PARA> Such is my deep concern for wage restraint that I, and other members of Parliament, intend to send a letter to Mr Justice Mahoney, Chairman of the Remuneration Tribunal, advising the Tribunal that we wholeheartedly support the Government's request for wage restraint in respect of parliamentarians' salaries and the views put to the Tribunal by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. We consider that wage and salary restraint in the present economic climate is of paramount importance to Australia and we wish to provide leadership in this area . Accordingly, we wish to advise the Tribunal that it is our firm view that there should be no further increases in parliamentary salaries during the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Some companies have followed a similar course. Western Mining Corporation Ltd, Myers and others have publicly stated that some salaries have been frozen and some employees have been asked to increase their working hours. Some unions have also adopted an extremely responsible attitude. By way of example, I refer to the members of the Australian Workers Union in Western Australia, who are reported to have dropped their claim for a 38-hour working week in an effort to save jobs. This is just the lead which I believe more of the unions ought to follow. In the face of large increases in the cost of labour, some industries have sought further assistance from the Government or increased protection in an effort to meet competition from the now cheaper imports. This action, of course, does not remedy the basic problem. It may temporarily forestall further unemployment in the industry seeking assistance. However, it could well lead to more unemployment in other domestic industries affected by the increased cost of goods and it will certainly adversely affect our export industries. As Maximilian Walsh recently stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is now more than a decade since the Tariff Board demonstrated what was theoretically obvious, that when it comes to feeding wage push inflation, the highly protected sectors of the economy are the main culprits. </PARA>
<PARA>Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd is currently seeking increased assistance which will cost steel users, primary producers and other exporters dearly. When I learnt of BHP's request, I asked it what hours its employees were working and I discovered that its steel works administrators and supervisory staff are working 38 hours a week and its waterside workers 35 hours a week. If other unions are prepared to drop their claims for shorter working hours in an effort to save jobs, I believe that BHP ought to approach its own workers to do likewise. When BHP opened its case for assistance in Melbourne last week, at the same time members of the Federated Ironworkers Association employed by BHP in Newcastle went out on a 48-hour strike. The situation is absolutely intolerable. To suggest that the rest of the community should be expected to bear the cost of such union folly, I believe, is irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA> When I made similar comments last week I received a letter from the proprietor of a small country newspaper. I believe it is a good example of the community attitude in this matter. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear James,</PARA>
<PARA> I support your comments. I am amazed that a recent agreement between printing employers and unions that provided for 37 1/2 hours immediately with 35 hours coming into effect in December, accompanied by big wage increases, has gone virtually un-reported and un-noticed. The bargain was struck with the aid of a 24 hour general strike of print unions. Employers caved in weakly. The big shops obviously bought industrial peace. I personally regard it as a sell out to industrial muscle and a stab in the back to industries trying to fight the 'less work for more pay' syndrome. </PARA>
<PARA>The sentiments expressed by the author of that letter emphasis that not only must the unions moderate their wage claims but also employers must do all possible to contain their cost structures. The proprietor of that small country newspaper has subsequently made the point to me that many printers receive a book bounty. He suggested, against his own financial interest, that if printers are to agree to unreasonable wage demands he could understand if the Government were to review its position regarding the bounty. However, I make it clear that I am not saying that the bounty is currently under review. Let me conclude by saying that wage restraint is now more crucial than ever before. If it is not practised in the forthcoming year I fear for our future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a correspondent in the Melbourne Age pointed out yesterday, the 1982-83 Budget is a repeat of the 1977 situation. In that year there was also speculation about an early election which was fuelled by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and Liberal Party strategists. Then, as now, the Budget was weighted down with goodies which trigger the hip-pocket nerve of the floating voter. Mr Fraser went on to win the election and then reneged on all his promises. Will he get away with it again? It is even possible, as I speak, that the decision has already been made that in order to end the uncertainty there must be a September election. More likely, however, in order that the Government can capitalise on the income tax reductions and the increase in welfare payments, the election will be called for November. What a cynical exercise. Does the Prime Minister really believe that the electors will be fooled once again?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One group of people who will not be fooled are the many thousands of young unemployed people. With 60 young people competing for every job vacancy they are looking into a hopeless future because there is no promise in the Budget of an improvement in the worst unemployment position since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The grim situation facing young people was brought home to me quite starkly when I was visited yesterday by a delegation representing young unemployed workers from my electorate of La Trobe. For them, the increase of $4 from $36 to $40 per week for unemployment benefit for the under-18 year olds is an insult. It is appalling that after seven years with no increase, with inflation eating away the real value of the benefit until it had become a pittance the Government has offered only a 10 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is clear why the Government has adopted this callous atitude to unemployed people. Government members have the quaint, paternalistic view that 16 and 17 year olds should be enfolded in the bosom of their families. Since it is obvious that nobody can live independently on $40 a week it is obviously the intention of the Government that it is the parents who are expected to provide the additional support. Any idea that such a policy promotes family cohesion and strengthens family ties can be dispelled by any social worker involved with young people. With the parents strugling to survive themselves, an unemployed teenager is seen only as an encumbrance. Tensions and stresses arise in the family, particularly when the parents who in their youth experienced periods of full employment fail to understand why their son or daughter cannot get a job and attack them for being lazy or lacking initiative. The youngsters try to explain that for every job they apply for some 40 to 60 other young people are seeking the same job. They point to the unanswered job applications, the impossibility of seeking work without independent transport, the dead end and temporary nature of many of the jobs on offer. Forcing unemployed teenagers to seek the financial help of their families, far from promoting cohesion and stability is, in fact, causing tension and stress and creating social upheaval in all our major cities. </PARA>
<PARA> It must also not be forgotten that some teenagers, either because they have been reared in institutions or because their parents are separated and are leading different lives, do not have a family to whom they can turn for help. The attitude of the Government towards the very people who constitute the future of Australia is appalling. To make matters worse, when teenagers in desperation pool their resources and live together in groups, they are accused of immoral living and bludging off the community. We on this side of the House have constantly been urging the Government to mount a manpower planning program which would include job creation schemes. Any municipal council in any State in Australia will tell us of the potential in its municipality for job creation if only public funds were provided. Government members constantly criticise the job creation intiatives of the Australian Labor Party Whitlam Government. But the evidence of the valuable community projects which those initiatives created abound in every shire and city which took part in those schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the need to increase the unemployment benefit for those under 18 years to the adult level, there are two allied problems which require government attention. In my electorate the lack of public transport, particularly in the hills area, is a disgrace. Years of neglect by Federal and State Liberal governments cannot be remedied overnight, although the Victorian State Labor Government has begun an upgrading of the public transport system throughout the State. For some young people in my electorate even the weekly visit to the employment office by public transport is a costly financial outlay, quite apart from the difficulty of obtaining transport to aid their job seeking efforts. By far the greatest problem of all, however, is the lack of cheap rental accommodation in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent opportunity by the Government to assist local municipalities in the provision of funds to increase the rental housing stock was lost despite a request which I made to the appropriate Minister. Over 43 hectares of land owned by the Defence Service Homes Corporation in Kilsyth, Wantirna and Croydon was recently sold for $1,618,000. Another 137 hectares of land in Lilydale, Mooroolbark and Craigieburn still remains on offer. The sale proceeds of this land could well realise $3m. The opportunity was deliberately lost by the Federal Government to use this land for public housing purposes or to use the total potential proceeds of sale, over $4.5m, to assist municipalities in my electorate with their housing accommodation problems. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of community-conscious people who are concerned about the problems of homeless youth have set up an organisation called the Outer East Youth Emergency Accommodation Service. Over the past two years this service has received 1,277 calls from young people requiring emergency accommodation. Of this number, the service was able only to accommodate only 364 in the area. The remainder had to either stay in an intolerable situation of overcrowing or sleep in abandoned cars or other unsuitable public places. Many had to leave their families and friends and move to another area. Community workers, with the assistance of the Sherbrooke Community Youth Support Scheme, have also perfomed a magnificent job in helping homeless youth who have participated in projects organised by the CYSS committee, with the help of the Maroondah bond scheme. This scheme received 321 calls for assistance in the period 1 June 1981 to 31 May 1982. Unfortunately , of that number the scheme was able to allocate only 72 bonds to the value of $ 20,559. The community workers involved in this scheme have reported that the rental market in the outer east has contracted dramatically during the period under review. Each phone call the worker gets tells the same story-the continual round of estate agents and the frantic scanning of rental columns in the newspapers. Estate agents advise that there is no rental accommodation on their books and they are receiving dozens of inquiries each week. There are 50 inquiries for each advertised vacancy. This figure relates to the average vacancy rate of 1.2 per cent calculated for the Melbourne metropolitan area in September 1981 by the Real Estate Institute of Australia. This figure becomes significant when it is appreciated that in past years the average vacancy rate was in the vicinity of 3 per cent to 4 per cent. Accommodation becomes available only as a tenant moves out and the fortunate person on the spot gets the prize. Few properties remain vacant for more than four hours. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the lack of accommodation rents have risen dramatically. When a house becomes vacant and the rent is $95 a week, unemployed young people are automatically eliminated. The Outer East Youth Emergency Accommodation Service and its allied projects such as the bond scheme are doing a magnificent job, but they are starved of funds. A number of the clients who have contacted the Maroondah bond scheme have advised that after having paid their rent and current debts they did not have sufficient money to purchase food. There are also two women's refuges serving my electorate. They have informed me that, as a result of the lack of rental accommodation, the only hope they have of housing many of the women and children who pass through their refuges is to place them in high- rise housing commission flats.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Tables 2, 3 and 4 detail the dwelling prices and table 1 details the accommodation requests received from homeless youth. Tables 5, 6 and 7 give details of rental housing in the region. Even a cursory appraisal of these figures indicates the urgent need for funding from the Commonwealth Government to prevent the continuation of extreme social dislocation which the appalling lack of rental accommodation is causing. The situation is worse than serious; it has become desperate, particularly for single mothers and young unemployed people. All three levels of government-local , State and Federal-must join to find an immediate solution to this most pressing problem. I call on the Federal Government to take the initiative and convene an urgent conference of representatives of all three levels of government to draw up an emergency plan to deal with this tragic problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity in the grievance debate this morning to make some comment on a number of Budget matters that I think are of particular concern to country people and also to people in my electorate of Calare. The first point I raise is that relating to the proposed scheme for rebating diesel fuel excise. Under the old scheme an exempt user, by production of a certificate, could claim the exemption of the excise at the point of purchase. This scheme was apparently abused, which was the main reason why the new rebate scheme was introduced. Indeed, it would seem to me to be the only reason why it was introduced. I acknowledge that there are many opportunities for abuse of such an exemption scheme, but I have doubts as to whether the remedy that has been proposed in the Budget will be effective in stopping the abuse and, indeed, whether it will not bring an additional burden on some diesel fuel users.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Firstly, I turn to the very good news in this proposed measure of rebating diesel fuel excise for private truck operators, private truck owners and private contractors. For many years they have been at a very significant disadvantage in competing with State instrumentalities concerned with transport, such as railways, which have been exempt from diesel excise. They will now have to pay it and that will put the private contractors on a much more equitable footing with the public transport services. That is something that I hope the industry will welcome, particularly in New South Wales, where the Wran Government has placed an additional 5c per litre tax on diesel fuel to help bail out its budgetary problems. What concerns me is that people who are exempt under the new legislation will have some delay in being able to get their rebates. Many people may say at first that it is not a very important matter. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us look at the situation of the agricultural industry or-a case I will cite later-the fishing industry, whose excise has increased very dramatically, although it will be rebatable at a later time. The old excise rate of 5.155c per litre of distillate has now increased by a further cent to finance the roads program. I welcome that increase. I believe that there would have been no hope of getting an effective road system throughout Australia if we had not found additional sources of revenue. I welcome the increase from the point of view that it is to be collected and administered through a trust fund, which means that there is no doubt that the additional cent per litre will be used for roads . Nevertheless, that is a one cent increase that will have to be paid in the first instance by all diesel users. On top of that is the Wran Government's increase of 5c a litre, so total excise and State charges in New South Wales for diesel users amount to 11.155c per litre. On my information, that increases the price, in round figures, from about 28c per litre to nearly 40c per litre in one hit. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the time it may take for the rebate to come through. I think it is fair to say that it may take three months from the time when the claim is made for a rebate cheque to arrive. Additional staff will have to be put on in the Department of Industry and Commerce and there will no doubt be a shakedown period, so I feel that three months is a reasonable estimate. With current intrest rates there will be about a five per cent loss to the consumer. In the case of big consumers this amounts to a very significant sum of money. For example, my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) told me that the Ulladulla Fishing Co-operative consumes about one million litres of diesel a year. The Commonwealth excise alone is $61,500. If we apply that figure over four months, being the period that it might take for a fishing co-operative to get its rebate-at an interest rate of, let us say, 15 per cent for ease of calculation-we find that the co-operative is immediately disadvantaged by this system to the tune of $3,000. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the agricultural industry is concerned, those figures would be much lower for individual farmers because there would be perhaps none who consume that amount of fuel. Nevertheless, at this time, with, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) pointed out this morning, one of the most serious drought circumstances facing Australia, and with no end in sight to the drought conditions, this is an additional burden which I am sure rural industry will not be happy about. I understand that already there has been some fairly violent reaction to the system. I for one have yet to be convinced that the old system was necessarily so ineffective that it could not have been tightened up to prevent the abuse that was apparently occurring. I for one would like to see a restoration of the old certification system whereby those who were exempt were able to take that exemption at the point of purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I would like to raise relates to students and particularly to those at the Mitchell College of Advanced Education which is in my electorate of Calare. First of all, I welcome the Budget announcement that Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances are to be increased by 20 per cent as from January next year, that some additional 12,000 students will benefit, that the income test arrangements for the receipt of TEAS will be relaxed by about 11 per cent and that post-graduate awards are also to be increased by a very significant 48 per cent. There was much speculation and debate at the time of the announcement of a student loans scheme as to whether it would be a substitute for TEAS. That is not the case. It is a supplement to other support schemes for students. The loans scheme will involve initially some $50m that the private banks have agreed to lend. This apparently has placed some limitations on those who can be eligible for the scheme. It is proposed that those eligible will be students in receipt of TEAS and students who meet a means test on their individual income from all sources. The limit on that means test will be $5,000 per year. There are further means tests for students who have dependent children and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> However, my concern is that we are apparently denying external and part time students the opportunity of being eligible for the loans scheme. People may say that they should not be eligible because they normally have other means of support and are in many cases receiving salaries, but I do not think that is sufficient justification for saying that external or part time students should be totally excluded from the loans scheme. I do not see why they cannot be given the opportunity of receiving a loan on the basis of an income test, as are the full time students. Many people who are studying externally are in difficult financial circumstances. People who have been retrenched are having to upgrade their qualifications and skills and to change their career aspirations. In many cases single parents who are facing great economic difficulty see that the only way out of their dilemma is to be retrained or further trained in a particular area. In so many cases they are undertaking a second or higher degree course which, of course, attracts fees. I for one would urge the Government to reconsider the decision that external and part time students are not eligible for the loans scheme. Perhaps we could see whether the banks are able to find additional loan accommodation so that if external students were to be included in the scheme it would not be to the disadvantage of the full time students who it is presently proposed will be within the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome most other aspects of the Budget. Of particular interest to my area is the easing of the additional income limits that are applicable to pensioners. Indeed, pensioners and the aged should be very satisfied with the provisions that have been brought forward in this Budget. I look forward to producing a brochure for use in my electorate which will explain the changes and the additional pension levels, the additional tax exemption limits and the additional limits that have been introduced for the receipt of fringe benefits and the like. I look forward to distributing that information as soon as possible to pensioner groups and to other interested persons throughout my electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak on behalf of those in the community, the homeless youth, the unemployed and pensioners with little or no private income, the Australians who are unrepresented in this chamber and who have been trampled on by this Government in its rush to win swinging voters. They are not tainted with some infectious disease which has isolated them in this Budget as society's untouchables. Their only misfortune is that they have not been identified in Liberal Party opinion surveys as swinging voters. As such they have been denied the tax cuts and rebates, interest rebates and the dividend rebates doled out selectively by this Government. Who here believes for one minute that the Government did not allocate its handouts in anticipation of winning votes? Who here does not know for one second that assessment of real social needs is the last thing this Government would have referred to when preparing its Budget?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The irony, I believe, is that this Government has misjudged the swinging voter. Those people whom I know in my electorate are as concerned as anyone else about the 2.8 million Australians who are living on or below the poverty line. The desperately needy, homeless and even starving members of our society-I do not exaggerate-have been kicked in the teeth by a polished black shoe reflecting the used car salesman smile. The question many Australian families must now be asking is: Would the warranty be honoured should the used car salesman clinch the deal he is obviously seeking? The problems facing the unemployed in this country were outlined in this place yesterday by my colleague the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). It strikes me as the height of arrogance and shows a chilling lack of understanding of the economy for a government to bring down a no-growth Budget which does nothing to offer hope for more jobs at a time when statistics show that this country has record post-war unemployment. In fact, as yesterday's Australian Financial Review states, we will be lucky to see a rate of unemployment under 10 per cent by the end of the financial year. So much for the Liberals' economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> What has this Budget given the unemployed? With weekly rents rising by $10, with increases in power costs and a host of sales tax increases, the Government has magnanimously allowed an extra $4 per week to trickle down to unemployed kids not yet 18 years old. With no forecast growth in employment, particularly in 1982-83, it has increased its standing on job training schemes. What an irony ! Talk about a treadmill leading to nowhere! We have job training schemes with no jobs. The Special Youth Employment Training Program has been proven unsuccessful, yet we have to listen to members on the Government side calling on families, on middle and low incomes, who are striving to keep their heads above water, to practise wage restraint, presumably to cure the unemployment problem. This Government does nothing about this matter and does not talk about job creation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us focus more closely on the plight of the 15, 16 and 17-year-old people in our community and in particular on the large proportion of those kids who have left home for one reason or another. The Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare recently found that over 12,000 youngsters were roaming our streets homeless in the year to last September. Clearly the situation will be much worse in this coming year. Yet the Government's response to this trend is hardly discernable. Total outlays by way of subsidies to voluntary organisations for the construction, purchase or maintenance of night shelters, reception shelters and hostels for homeless persons will be increased by a grand total of $400,000 this year from $6.3m to $6.7m for the whole of Australia. The $1.7m allocated to the Youth Services Scheme which supplies emergency accommodation and emergency service for homeless young people is only a $500,000 increase on the previous year's allocation. This covers emergency accommodation throughout Australia. If it were to be allocated only to my home city of Brisbane wherein, according to the Senate report, nearly 2,000 homeless youngsters roam, it would not do much more than cover the increased running costs of the present shelters. In other words, there has been no effective response by this Government to the desperate plight of homeless youth. That plight is growing; let there be no mistake about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Brisbane Telegraph of 17 August reported that the number of homeless young people seeking help in Melbourne has jumped 30 per cent in the past few months. A spokesperson for the Melbourne City Mission was reported as saying that most were under 18 years old and unemployed, kids on the streets. He said it was almost impossible for young people to survive independently on the dole and that the Mission has been subsidising these people in private board at a rate of up to $20 a week. The Government, in its infinite wisdom, sees fit to dole them out an extra $4 a week. It is disgusting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Telegraph of 16 August also reports that many poverty stricken people were turned away each week from the Gold Coast's only hostel for the homeless. The manager is reported as saying that most of the hostel's residents are between the ages of 16 and 25 and are still missing out on the essentials of life, such as clothing. He said: 'I do not know how the young 18-year-old unemployed kids survive'. I presume, however, that Mr Fraser does, otherwise he would have done something to help them in this Budget. People under 18 do not vote. Furthermore, many who are homeless may not have parental support, parents who will respond in anger to a government which neglects them. This Government gives them a paltry $ 4 a week rise; a total of $40 a week in all. This still represents a figure of $ 37.25 a week below the single pension and less than half the poverty line. The Government refuses to pay supplementary or rent assistance to unemployed people paying rent. Do honourable members realise what this means to a human being?</PARA>
<PARA> Rent assistance is being paid only to the poorest pensioners, those with almost no income who are paying rent in the private market. The assistance will rise on 1 November from $8 a week to $10 a week. With weekly rents in Brisbane ranging from $50 to $80 for the most meagre accommodation and weekly rent for housing at $100 and over, the Government grants a $2 increase to $10 a week. This is while rentals at the bottom of the market are rising at an annual rate of more then $ 10 a week. This $2 increase will cost $24m in the full year-only $16.7m in 1982- 83-and that is an appallingly low amount compared with the allocations to home owners, needed as those allocations are. This is a gross injustice which could only be perpetrated by a privileged, comfortably housed, blinkered government. </PARA>
<PARA> A further glaring discrimination is the refusal to pay any supplementary allowance to unemployed people paying rent. They face the same costs as pensioners in private rental accommodation but are given no rent relief by the Department of Social Security or State housing authorities. They are given no access to fringe benefits. No wonder this sterile, unprincipled Government is forcing invalid pensioners into the dole queue, ruling them less than 85 per cent incapacitated and sending them, as I have seen in the Division of Lilley, at the age of 50 to the Commonwealth Employment Service to register for jobs which do not exist. This is to save money. </PARA>
<PARA> This does not mean that invalid pensioners are living a life of riotous dissipation on their modest allocation. To the contrary, they also have been let down in this Budget. We have been told that the limits of their pensions income test have been relaxed. We have been told that the tax threshhold has been raised. That is good as far as it goes, but sick and frail people and many people in today's job situation cannot get that extra income and so they are not being assisted in the least. Pensioners who are too frail to work have received nothing. They do not pay tax, so rebates and raised threshholds do not help. They do not receive private income, so relaxed income tests are no help either. However, they still must cash their cheques at banks and purchase goods. They are hit by the banks' transactions tax and the high rate of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by making a strong protest at the manner in which these Australians, without a power base and without political clout, have been abandoned by this Government. To trample on the weak is no basis for a decent Budget. This is no way for one set of human beings to treat another no matter how elite they mistakingly consider themselves. It is certainly no way to run a nation. It is not a dream to say that these poor are here and these poor are being neglected; it is a reality and what we have seen is a cynical, totally unacceptable way for an Australian government to run a country and base a Budget. If a nation's humanitarianism is to be judged by the way in which it collectively treats its weakest citizens our country is presently in a moral trough as well as in a financial trough. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The electorate of O'Connor encompasses a very large percentage of rural Western Australia. Flying a light aircraft I regularly traverse this area. Such flights give me a clear indication of the large quantities of previously productive rural land that have been lost to salt encroachment. The Western Australian Department of Agriculture has recently completed a salt land survey based on returns submitted in 1979 by farm owners. The survey showed salt encroachment increased by 35 per cent per annum. A total of 263,752 hectares of previously arable land is now salt affected, which is 1. 75 per cent of the cleared farmland in Western Australia. A further 378,000 hectares of land is classified naturally as saline.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to discuss the causes and remedies to this threat to the future of dry land farming in Western Australia. There is no argument that the original cause was the clearing of trees and shrubs from the land. Honourable members should note that I am not saying over clearing. This creates other problems, such as wind erosion. From this point opinions and theories as to cause commence to differ considerably. However, they split broadly into two main areas. Firstly , there is the view of the Western Australian Department of Agriculture. It states that the lack of trees and/or excessive clearing no longer provides for the dissipation of ground water. Consequently it says that watertables rise to the surface at low lying areas bringing underground salt layers to the surface. The salt then kills the growth, whether it be crop or natural bush. The Department consequently argues that the remedy lies in substantially reduced clearing and replanting of trees and salt tolerant bushes. This remedy has had limited success in displacing the salt. At the best, if growth is established, the areas offer minimum productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe our reclamation efforts should be aimed at returning the land to full food production. I am further not convinced by the core of the departmental argument that watertables rise and bring up salt. The districts concerned generally have annual rainfalls of below 10 inches. No underground water supplies are to be discovered even at substantial depths and even in the low- lying salt affected areas. How then can a non-existent watertable rise? My constituents, the men who have been committed to this land, have evolved quite different theories of cause and remedy. Over 30 years ago Harry Whittington of Brookton was confronted with the need to find solutions or ship out. His property was so badly salt affected that even his homestead was at risk. Mr Whittington took the view that the lack of trees allowed excessive water run-off to the low lying areas. He reasoned that this land became waterlogged with resulting soil compaction which further aggravated the problem. Much of this water was prevented from escaping by previous interference to the natural drainage system caused by urban and road development. According to Whittington, the appearance of salt was the result of evaporation of the water which had lain on the surface. He queried whether the salt or the compacted soil was the greatest inhibitor to germination and growth of plant life. </PARA>
<PARA> To replace the function of the trees and retain the productivity of his land, Whittington constructed low-contoured interceptor banks which intercept the runoff and retain it on the higher ground or direct it into storage dams where, being fresh, it is excellent and needed stock water. This eventually allows the salt land to dry out and to be ripped up, thus allowing natural rainfall to leach out the salt and eventually return the land to a level of productivity. The Whittington system has enjoyed considerable success. This can be measured both by the many miles of Whittington interceptor banks now in existence and the 1,000-plus members of the society known as WISALTS, the Whittington Interceptor Salt Affected Land Treatment Society, which was formed by interested supporters of the system. The Society has an active executive and trains surveyors and advisors to assist new members to protect their properties from salt enroachment . Considerable knowledge and construction skill are required to ensure the banks function as expected. </PARA>
<PARA> Another group of farmers living in the Watheroo area to the north of my electorate have applied a different approach suitable to their area, but which still involves the removal of excess water. The innovators concerned are the Scott brothers and the Sutherland family. They used large excavators to deepen the existing watercourses on their properties. When water commenced flowing into and along these new drains the impurity levels were up to 2,000 grains of salt. In a relatively short period these levels dropped to 800 grains of salt. In some watercourses freshwater crustacea and trout were introduced, and these are thriving. Pasture now spreads over what was hundreds of metres of salt scald right to the edge of the drains, thus proving that both land and water can be reclaimed just by allowing the water to flow away. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the WISALTS group and the Watheroo farmers have invested large sums of money developing their theories. This has included overseas travel to countries such as Canada where substantial advances in salt enroachment technology have occurred. The Canadians have developed a special technology in the area of subsoil drainage which is a natural extension of the work of the Watheroo group. The advances relate to the use of a plastic drainage pipe that can be installed by a ploughing tool so as to direct subsoil water to the major drainage system. The advantage of this pipe is that it is manufactured and packed in a flat form. It is created into pipe shape by the ploughing tool, and the edges are so made as to zip together. This is a major advance when compared with the previous use of heavy and fragile clay agricultural pipe in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The new pipe is presently manufactured in Japan and New Zealand and, because of its compact design, freight charges would be minimal. Notwithstanding that, the pipe is sold in Australia at four to five times the price charged in the United Kingdom and Canada-that is, a 100 millilitre pipe is $2.63 per metre in Australia, whereas it is 51c per metre in the United Kingdom and 66c per metre in Canada. One reason for the increase in the price is that our Government imposes a 15 per cent Customs duty on the pipe of Japanese manufacture. Whilst salinity continues its rapid increase in Australia it appears plainly silly that a government should tax an item which could contribute to relieving the problem. However, this does not explain the huge discrepancy between the cost of this product in Australia and overseas. I hope the Government will inquire into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981-82 the Federal Government provided $1.3m to the Western Australian Government to assist in salinity research. Unfortunately, in my view, most of this money is used by the Department of Agriculture in Western Australia in experiments relating to its unsuccessful and unproductive theories. The farmers have demonstrated more practical solutions, yet except for generous taxation deductions provided by this Government they receive little support. I am convinced, from my observations, that if grants were made to the WISALTS and Watheroo groups for research purposes considerable advances would occur in the area of salinity control at a cost to the Government well below present expenditure. Both groups need funds to purchase items of experimental capital equipment which could greatly reduce the cost of installing the protective measures I have described today. Australia would profit greatly from such an investment, coupled with the innovation and energy of the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, all governments and all development authorities must also look to the comments I make. Urban developers and road construction authorities must take a national view of development, as it has affected and will affect the natural drainage systems of the Australian continent, particularly as our topography seldom shows these drainage patterns clearly. Anybody who has made an observation of salt encroachment will be surprised at how often they see salt encroachment alongside our national highways. This is clearly because our national highway construction people have been far more concerned with protecting their roads than protecting the surrounding land and the environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the Australian manufacturing industry, like the rest of Australian business, wants more than anything else at present is customers. What those in manufacturing want-workers, management and shareholders -is government leadership to stimulate our economy, to create the necessary demands so that they have customers and to engender that confidence in new investment that is so vitally needed if jobs are to be maintained, leave alone the new jobs that need to be created. But wherever we turn to examine the Fraser Government's activities today we find a tragic lack of the vital leadership needed even to maintain the existing stock of jobs, leave alone add to them. Sadly, to make my case that there is this serious decline-in case anybody was in doubt-I must detail the litany of woes and the terrible record of retrenchments which we as Australians are suffering around this country today. Unless we face these facts and acknowledge the collapse that is taking place around us we shall not adopt the correct policies that we need to overcome these grave problems. Let me emphasise: The policies we need mean a real change of direction-a U-turn- on the part of the present conservative national government. We do not want just a cosmetic change which alleviates some of the hardship caused to the many who are suffering from the low level of economic activity. I repeat: We need a real change of direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am prevented by the Standing Orders-I suppose it is more important that you should know that I know this-from anticipating the Budget debate. But what I am referring to when I refer to the Government's failed economic policies is the 6 1/2 years of monetarism which has been suffered by this country. We have suffered 6 1/2 years of this so-called fight inflation first policy, and yet we now have an anticipated inflation rate for 1982-83 of nearly 11 per cent. We have suffered 6 1/2 years of tight money, the rationing of credit and the high interest rates that go along with that, and yet no hope is given to us by any Liberal or National Country Party Minister of any alleviation of these problems of high interest rates. We have had 6 1/2 years of a wages policy which can best be summed up like this: 'Keep economic activity low and create more unemployment because that is the only way we Liberals-we conservatives-know of dampening down wage claims'. We have had 6 1/2 years with no prices and incomes policy and no real attempt to sit down with trade union officials and employers to work out an equitable policy, which we should have in place at present. Instead we have had such a confrontationist approach. We have had decisions such as abolishing the prices justification machinery that we used to have in place. </PARA>
<PARA> In case I need to make a case that there is a decline in Australian manufacturing activity, let me come back to that sad litany of woes, that list of redundancies, which I mentioned earlier and outline just from a few daily newspapers over a few of the last days the retrenchments that have been taking place around this country. I start with the little provincial city of Bundaberg. Bundaberg is in a state of shock. The sackings of workers at Versatile Toft Ltd are only part of the story. They are the world market leaders in sugar cane harvesters. However this is just one example of valued men of many years employment in that one firm being out of work at the present time. If we just focus on Bundaberg we see that Massey-Ferguson (Aust) Ltd, in the same relatively small city, is another example of a firm which has retrenched workers . The transport giant Thomas Nationwide Transport which roams this country is slashing its overnight express division. As a result of manufacturing activity being at an insufficient level for that express activity to continue 150 jobs have gone. ICI Australia Ltd has also announced plans to reduce markedly its work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Valued workers live in fear of their income security, wondering whether they will shortly be forced to live on the miserable unemployment benefits provided by this miserable Fraser Government. That problem was well expressed in the grievance debate, which this debate is following, by the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling). The polls paid for by the Liberal Party-I hope they are paid for by the Liberal Party; I would not be at all surprised if the money is not coming out of some back door Government fund-do not as yet show much sympathy for the unemployed. So for the most part they have been neglected in the recent welfare announcements. </PARA>
<PARA> The next newspaper headline which I draw to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the attention of the House, states, 'Work force in metal industry down 2. 8 per cent', and that is just in recent months, leave alone over a reasonable period. Another headline states: '40 jobs go in Tasmania'. Another headline reads: 'BHP says it may cut its work force another 1,000'. Heaven knows, it has cut its work force by thousands already in Whyalla, Port Kembla, Newcastle and in Kwinana 600 jobs alone have been wiped out. Yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald stated: '146 sacked at State's last tyre factory'. Wherever we turn we see another announcement of that sort and it gives me no joy to draw attention to it . However I repeat that unless we face these facts squarely we will not persuade this miserable Government to adopt the policies that are needed. </PARA>
<PARA> So often the cry goes up from these conservatives, from all Government members- not just Ministers but also the parrots on the back bench as well-that all this is due to high wage rates. We have heard the cry again today in the grievance debate from the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter). I believe-so too do my colleagues-that there must be wage restraint, that competitiveness is the key to the game. However we will not get that sort of approach from the confrontationist rantings of the Liberal-Country Party members whom we hear in this place and indeed from a lot of their supporters outside this place. To rest on wage rates alone as an adequate excuse is utter rubbish. It is misleading the Australian people. Let me say why. Men and women are retrenched by companies because those companies cannot go on bearing losses. </PARA>
<PARA> The collapse of the profits share in national income cannot and should not be attributable solely to the growth in wages as is so often claimed by the parrots . That excuse is a very small figleaf which barely hides the fact that the collapse in profits is more directly attributable to the collapse in company turnover, to those customers whom I mentioned earlier. It is also attributable to rising unit costs because there is not that demand, therefore there is less production and so overheads have to be covered by fewer items. The collapse in profits is also attributable to distress borrowing and painfully high interest rates which are the results of the monetarist policies being pursued by this Government. These are some of the causes; yet Government members parrot out that wages are the only excuse. </PARA>
<PARA> To go on like that shows that they do not recognise the proper causes of the lack of competitiveness. In addition we also get the cry from the same people that the problem emanates from the fact that there is a low level of international activity. The conservatives, of course, also use that as an excuse and I have no doubt that we will hear the same reason from the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) who is at the table. I am not suggesting for one moment that there is not a downturn in international economic activity. But the conservatives must not be allowed to escape a lot of the blame for what is going on internationally. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, let me make the point that in 1975 the same Liberal and National Country Party cohorts did not acknowledge then the effect of the world economy. As they misled the Australian public from one length of this land to the other to them the fault was all at the feet of the Whitlam Government. The same conservatives, seven years ago, in worse economic circumstances than prevail today, promised to turn on the lights, promised to restore economic confidence, promised to put sport back on the front pages, promised to restore full employment and even promised to reduce interest rates. Never in the history of any country has so much been promised by any government and so little been fulfilled in such a long period than applies to the Fraser Government in the seven years that it has failed this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we are talking about international excuses-who is to blame for this low level of world economic activity? It is the monetarists of this world who are to blame. These same people are members of the discredited club of which the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his colleagues are foundation members. The Prime Minister struts around the world telling others what they should do. Sadly, even tragically for this country, some have followed his advice. So the evil monetarist policies were first tried here and we are still trying them with singular lack of success. Those policies were persuaded on to Mrs Thatcher by our Prime Minister and just look at what Thatcherism has done for the United Kingdom. Some 3,000,000 are unemployed and 13 per cent of the work force are out of work, with disastrous levels of economic activity in that country. Even one of Mrs Thatcher's senior ministers, Mr Prior, is now on record as saying that he is rebelling against those Thatcherism monetarist policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Prime Minister persuaded her to accept monetarism and now she has persuaded Mr Reagan. Disastrously for the world President Reagan makes President Nixon look good by comparison. Reaganomics has brought the great United States of America economy which is the engine of the world economy to its knees. Prime Minister Fraser and his conservative colleagues cannot escape blame for what is happening on the world scene. So let us not allow excuses from them to the effect that it is international economic activity that is the reason for what we are suffering here. We have to discard these excuses and apply our minds again to what is the truth about the local scene and what should be done about it. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need so desperately is a growth strategy for Australia. We have not got it even in the announcements that were made this week. We need a growth strategy in order to be able to get our people back to work. To get that growth we need specific industry policies in the non-farm product area. Gross non-farm product over the last year has experienced such a lack of growth rates that it has fallen from the national average to only about half the national average. It is no wonder that we are in such a terrible position. We have a number of factors and interest rates is one that I have mentioned and also the woeful deficit on external account. I could spend some time on that. Also we have the exchange rates which I could focus on. Despite the recent marginal depreciation of our rate of exchange it is vital to note that it is still almost 10 per cent above the 1980 exchange rate level. In other words because of the over-valuation of our currency and because there has not been a satisfactory formidable depreciation imports are correspondingly cheaper than they would otherwise be, thus causing retrenchments in local industry. Exports are dearer than they would be thus causing a relative downturn in exports. That results in less export income and all the lessening of employment opportunities which flows from that. </PARA>
<PARA> I will summarise that point. With the poor economic circumstances into which Australia has been led by the Fraser Government we find that we have unprecedentedly high interest rates. This is partly due to the Government's fetish for deregulating and partly due to the Government's monetarist ideology whereby it believes in imposing stringent limits to money supply growth rates. Of course, those high interest rates are also designed to attract capital inflows to this country. Because of the woeful trading performance too many imports are coming in and not enough exports are going out. Outflows are also due to the invisibles because we are not doing enough in this country about our own freight, insurance and so on. Superimposed on this are the problems for our whole economy, including our manufacturing sector. I draw attention to the deterioration which, as I indicated earlier, has stemmed from six and a half years of contractionary monetary policies which have seriously impeded improvements in Australia's industrial competitiveness. As I have shown, this deterioration principally is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government- this Fraser Government. Domestic policies could and should have done so much more. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government I express from the outset amazement at the absolute hide of this socialist matter of public importance which I submit is exceeded only by its utter baselessness and total lack of substance. To have socialists preaching to the Government, to private enterprise and to Australia at this time is a recipe for disaster. It is the same old gang with the same old act. They are the very same prophets of doom with policies of disaster. They are the successors of the economic vandals who nearly brought this country to the brink of bankruptcy in the dark Whitlam years of 1972 to 1975. Before any of them squirm out of the definition of 'socialist' I will remind them of the words of their own leader. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) said on 7 June:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let's not be coy about this: We are democratic Socialists. </PARA>
<PARA>The socialist recipe for disaster in the three Whitlam years brought about a trebling of inflation, a doubling of unemployment and a two and a half times increase in interest rates. Let the private enterprise sector of Australia in particular never forget that it was Whitlam Government policies-in particular one of the most outrageous government decisions ever taken, which created a 25 per cent across the board tariff cut-which put 100,000 Australians out of their jobs. If ever a government stood indicted by policies which are the death knell of private enterprise it is the Australian Labor Party. But the matter does not stop there. The question of how the Australian Labor Party would fund its policies has to be asked. In all fairness to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) we did not hear any policies today. We did not hear any suggestion for a Labor Party remedy. We did not hear any Labor Party policy proposals at all, but others have been put from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the time of the House for a moment to remind the people of Australia that in the ultimate government policies have to be paid for. Effectively they have to be paid for out of taxation and taxation has to be raised from the people of Australia. Of course, the Labor Party knows all about taxation because in the three dark Whitlam years, 1972 to 1975, income tax receipts increased by a massive 48 per cent. I suggest that with the policies the Labor Party has in mind we would be looking at a 60 per cent or 70 per cent increase if it got control of the Treasury benches. Certainly its economic spokesman has made this very clear. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) in June 1978 said:</PARA>
<PARA> If Labor does not gain office next election-</PARA>
<PARA>That was prior to the 1980 election-</PARA>
<PARA>then by 1983, when we could next hope to gain office, we would face a mammoth task in rebuilding the public sector-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words 'rebuilding the public sector'-</PARA>
<PARA>and maybe an equally mammoth task in convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>There it is in black and white. The Australian Labor Party is the high tax party . Labor is the party which does not understand, has never understood and will never understand private enterprise. It is Labor's philosophy that if there is not a public servant involved in the act it will not succeed; if the public sector does not get its finger in the pie of private enterprise then private enterprise has no future at all. In a moment I will detail some recent Labor Party initiatives in respect of what it would do to private enterprise. Accepting the problems that we have in Australia today, I simply say to private enterprise that when this wolf in sheep's clothing, the honourable member for Adelaide-I concede that he is a pleasant and amiable man-comes amongst your ranks, never forget that he is the emissary of the socialists and of the party which if it got into power would put more fingers in the pie of private enterprise than any party in the history of Australia. Indeed, this acknowledged socialist party has made it abundantly clear that one of the things it will do will be to amend the Constitution to give itself the power effectively to nationalise Australian industry. I will quote from the Australian Labor Party platform. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Labor will seek to amend the Constitution 'to provide the Commonwealth Parliament with such powers as are necessary for national planning and the achievement of the Party's economic and social objectives'. </PARA>
<PARA>This clearly means that Labor will try to change the Constitution to allow a Labor government to pursue its democratic socialist objectives. The Labor Party has not forgotten that the Constitution was the only barrier to the Chifley Labor Government's legislation to nationalise the banks. Labor's commitment to nationalisation depends upon the removal of these constituational barriers. </PARA>
<PARA> Before outlining the proof positive of this Government's commitment to private enterprise and recent Government decisions I again extend a warning to every employer in Australia to consider what happened to private enterprise in the three dark Whitlam years and to pass the message around the ranks that the Labor Party in its time of opposition has learnt nothing; if given the opportunity it will do it all again, only more so. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the coin, the Government's response to the difficulties being faced by manufacturing industry has been both positive and timely. All credit is due to the Government and the best Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) that this country has ever seen. On 19 July we announced a major package of measures unreservedly welcomed by industry and acknowledged to be a significant step in helping industry to be ready to capitalise on the economic recovery as well as improving the long term competitiveness of Australian industry. I will say more about this a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not anticipate the debate on last Tuesday's Budget, but with its continuing anti-inflationary thrust the Budget is further evidence of the Government's conviction that a strong manufacturing base is absolutely essential as a pre-requisite for a balanced, viable and independent national Australian economy. Direct budgetary assistance to industry has been increased by $49m to a magnificent $472m-the fifth year in succession that we have increased outlays of relevance to industry development. Specifically, export development programs will receive $225m; industrial research and development schemes and related technology programs, $51m; and bounties and other assistance programs, $160m. Rather than dismantling the system, as the honourable member for Adelaide suggested, we have dramatically increased the Government's tangible support for the manufacturing sector. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BV4">Mr HODGMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Macarthur has interjected, in a very good and effective way. Private enterprise knows that. Industry will also continue to derive considerable benefit from the taxation system as well as from certain new initiatives, in particular taxation of company groups, retention allowances for private companies and the rebate on dividend income. The Government believes that an essential characteristic of industry policy is that it be flexible and responsive to the changing needs of Australian industry which result from a dynamic domestic and international economic environment. This responsiveness has been a feature of the Government's industry policy since it returned to office in 1975. That industry policy has sought to create a predictable basis upon which business, large and small, can grow and become strong and self-reliant. The Government's approach has been to reduce regulation , government intrusion into the economy, and to reduce government expenditure to leave scope for the expansion of private sector investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have achieved-I say this with pride-a large measure of success, unlike the thousands of bankruptcies, the thousands of liquidations and the tens of thousands of people out of work which came about under the Whitlam Government's policies. Over the last two years Australia has stood out amongst the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as an example of growth and stability. Together with its responsible economic policy the Government has employed a judicious mix of industry assistance measures to enable industry to respond more effectively to changing economic circumstances. It must be said today and over and over again that the situation we have now reached in this country is such that one man's pay rise is another man's dismissal notice. We cannot ignore the fact that average weekly earnings for male employees rose by a massive 17.1 per cent in the 12 months to March 1982. That is one and two-third times the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the recently announced industry assistance package. As positive evidence that the Government is attuned to the needs of industry and is indeed responsive to the difficulties being faced by industry the package of measures is designed to restore the competitive edge of Australian industry, encourage new investment and improve employment prospects. The package has several dimensions. The depreciation provisions vastly improve the environment for investment and offer positive encouragement for firms to renew and, indeed, increase their productive base. Five-thirds depreciation of plant means a more rapid write-off and a reduction in tax bills for those firms which modernise and extend their facilities. The greatest benefit will be to longer-lived assets where the more difficult decisions often need to be made. The 2 1/2 per cent building depreciation applauded widely in the private enterprise sector offers an incentive to firms to ensure that their buildings are more up to date and better meet the needs of improved employee conditions and productivity. The decision not to proceed at this time with a further program of reduction in protection recognises the difficulty of proceeding with a unilateral program during depressed economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know the Government has also decided to maintain the industrial research and development scheme which offers incentives to firms entering into IR and D and for those firms which are prepared to increase their IR and D activities. It is very important that encouragement be given to innovation if Australian industry is to improve its international competitiveness and provide opportunities for the work force to utilise fully its skills. This brings me to a key aspect of the Government's policy. The Government sees a continuing role for the encouragement of export and the need to foster a more internationally-oriented industry sector. Only through such means can we achieve the better integration of Australian industry with that of the rest of the world and therefore maximise our productive potential. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the Industries Assistance Commission findings it has been decided to strengthen significantly the export market development grants scheme which provides an impetus for firms-especially newer exporters-to seek out and develop new markets for their products. With this package we have greatly improved the environment in which Australian manufacturing industry operates. We believe it will have an early impact in retarding the present downturn. For the medium and longer terms, the package creates an improved platform on which industry can plan with confidence and it will mean more investment, more jobs and higher income levels. There is no doubt that this Government firmly believes that a strong manufacturing base is an absolutely essential prerequisite for a balanced , viable and independent national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's trade unions for their part must now be willing to adopt a more responsive and realistic approach to their demands on industry for improved wages and conditions. I applaud the recent statement by Mr Nolan on behalf of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. We believe that the taxation assistance and other family assistance contained in the Budget announcements made on Tuesday night provide a good basis for the exercise of wage restraint on the part of the union movement. This is the key which will either open the door to opportunity and growth or lock us into a lower growth path with its adverse impact on living standards and employment creation. The Australian Labor Party has never understood and will never understand private enterprise. The whole basic thrust of its philosophy is pubic sector activity, bigger government, more regulation and higher taxation to pay the bills. </PARA>

Let me tell him that we are not worried about his policy or lack of policy in respect of the manufacturing sector because all we have to do is to remind the hundreds of thousands of employers around Australia of what the Labor Party did to private enterprise from 1972 to 1973. Its policies for industry demonstrate beyond any doubt that it is bereft of any cohesive approach to the problems besetting Australian manufacturing industry. Labor Party policies read like an unremitting litany to bureaucratic intervention. They are based on unexplained and highly improbable prices and incomes policies made in consultation with trade unions which would further squeeze company profits. The Labor Party would bring in the dreaded capital gains tax. It would bring in a resource rental tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> 1. The opening hours of our main library have been reduced from 93 1/2 hours a week in 1975 to 72 hours a week in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The number of new books purchased per year has fallen from over 50,000 in 1976 to under 23,000 in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The number of books in storage and inaccessible to students and staff has risen from none in 1977 to over 40,000 in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The number of books discarded in 1976 was over 6,000-by the end of 1981 over 70,000 had been discarded.</PARA>

<TITLE>Proposed Student Loans Scheme</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the introduction of a comprehensive student loans scheme will:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Restrict Access to Education People from poorer backgrounds will be deterred from studying by the prospect of incurring large debts. These people, if they enrol, will be forced to amass loan debts. Richer students do not face this handicap.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Undermine the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme TEAS should cover the basic living costs of students. Currently the scheme only assists 38% of full- time students and the maximum level of TEAS is a mere $49.67. Government statements indicate TEAS will be further downgraded if loans are introduced.</PARA>
<PARA>3. Disadvantage Women Women students would be disadvantaged by a loans scheme as they have a lesser ability to repay loan debts, because on average women earn less and have a higher unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA>4. Disadvantage Mature-Age Students Usually mature age students forego income to study and already have large financial commitments. They could not return to study if it meant incurring substantial debts.</PARA>
<PARA>5. Distort Educational Choices Mounting loan debts would force students into studying shorter courses or not continuing with post-graduate study.</PARA>
<PARA>6. Result in Massive Attrition Rates Students will attempt to undertake extensive part-time work or overload courses to minimise their loans. Increased failure rates will result forcing students to ''drop-out'' rather than continuing study and increase their debts.</PARA>
<PARA>7. Cause Administrative and Financial Difficulties Overseas experience shows high default rates will occur on student loans. Government money will be channelled away from TEAS to paying off banks. The government will also bear the administrative burden of pursuing defaulters.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the proposed student loans scheme will have disastrous effects on tertiary education, which we believe benefits the whole community, not just the individual student.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964 to increase the maximum rates of levy which may be prescribed to finance the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation, meat and livestock research and cattle disease eradication. Concurrently, I will be introducing a Bill for parallel amendments to the Live-stock Export Charge Act 1977. The two Acts to be amended raise funds from the meat and livestock industry for the same purposes and are similar in structure and rates, but one applies to livestock slaughtered and the other to stock exported live. The proposed increases covered by this Bill have been recommended to me by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation after consultation with industry groups. The Government accepts that the Corporation will need an increase in levy income in order to avoid operating at a deficit or cutting back on its activities and service to the industry and that this will first necessitate an increase in the maximum rates currently provided in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy is imposed on slaughterings of cattle, calves, bobby calves, sheep, lambs, buffaloes and goats. It has separate components for the financing of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation, meat and livestock research, meat processing research and cattle disease eradiction. There are comparable rates for each component in respect of each class of livestock. The Act specifies maximum rates only with operative rates being prescribed by regulation. Separate maximum rates already exist in the legislation for the research and disease eradication components. In addition, the operative rates set for the research and AMLC components must not exceed a specified maximum. Hence, the highest level of AMLC component is limited by the level of the prevailing research components. Currently, this difference is insufficient to enable the AMLC component to be increased to the level considered necessary. It is therefore proposed to double the aggregate maximum rates which govern the size of the AMLC component. The existing and proposed levy rates are:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Maximum Rates (c/head)</PARA>
<PARA>Current Proposed</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Cattle and buffaloes  150.0 300.0 Bobby calves (40kg and less)  15.0 30.0 Calves (40kg and up to 90kg)  52.5 105.0 Sheep, lambs and goats  15.0 30.0</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The effect of the proposed changes is to enlarge the scope available for increasing the AMLC component while preserving the existing relativity with the research components. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the changes proposed for the cattle disease eradication component which were announced in the Budget. This levy apply only to bovine animals. The current rates are at the maximum level permitted by the Act. Finance for the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign has been falling behind costs. Whilst the Government has announced in the Budget that it will write off the outstanding industry debt of $23.5m it is anxious to ensure that the continuing program does not result in the industry building up a further debt. This Bill is therefore providing for an increase in the current maximum rates by two-thirds- from $3 to $5 for cattle and buffaloes, $1 to $1.67 for calves and 30c to 50c for bobby calves. It is not, however, intended that the disease eradication component be immediately set at these new levels. As stated in the Budget the operative rate, with effect from 1 October 1982, will be raised from $3 to $4 a head for cattle with corresponding increases for other classes of livestock. This increase follows a thorough review of the eradication campaign and its financing and must be seen in the context of the package of assistance offered in the Budget to the cattle and meat industry. In addition to these amendments, opportunity is being taken to bring references in the Act to the Meat Exporter and Abattoir Consultative Group into conformity with the change title of that group. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to establish a new ceiling on the export charge leviable on currants, sultanas and raisins now that the operative rate of the charge has been increased by regulation to the maximum allowed under the existing Act. Opportunity is also taken in this Bill to redefine procedures applicable to increasing the operative rate in the future and to remove from the Act certain unnecessary words. </PARA>
<PARA> Moneys collected under the dried fruits export charge are used to finance the operations of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation which controls the export marketing and overseas promotion of Australian dried vine fruit. The Corporation has been under financial pressure due in part to a poor 1981 harvest, with a consequent sharp fall in receipts in the 1981-82 financial ear, but more importantly to steadily rising costs. Action to improve its current financial position has already been taken, with industry agreement, by Statutory Rules 1982 No. 100 proclaimed on 29 April 1982. The Rule provided for an increase in the operative rate of the charge from the $4.50 a tonne which has applied since 1976 to $7 a tonne of dried fruit exported, the new rate being equal to the maximum allowed under the current Act. The Bill before the House seeks to raise the maximum permissible charge from $7 ro $15 a tonne in order to enable the operative rate to be increased beyond $7 a tonne when this becomes necessary. It is expected that the new ceiling will obviate the need for further amendment to the Act for a reasonable number of years. The main industry organisation, the Australian Dried Fruits Association, has been consulted in the past on matters affecting the funding of the Corporation, the operations of which play an important role in contributing to the viability of the industry. It is proposed that these consultations will now be formalised under the provision in the Bill for discussion between my Department and the producers' organisation on any suggested change to the operative rate of charge on the export of dried fruits. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also seeks to remove a provision of the originals Act which, I am advised, is unnecessary. The clause in question refers to sub-section 3 (3) which states:</PARA>
<PARA> All moneys payable under this section in respect of any dried fruits shall be paid on or before the entry of those dried fruits for export to such officers in the respective States as are prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA>I am advised the the words 'to such officers in the respective States as are prescribed' are superfluous as the identification of the officers to whom the charge is to be paid can be dealt with administratively. Accordingly it is proposed that a new provision be substituted for the existing one. It is proposed that the amendment Act will come into effect as soon as it receives royal assent. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Senate Select Committee on Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories presented its report on the future of the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, to the Parliament on 9 March 1982. This statement responds on behalf of the Government to that report. On 7 July 1982 I announced that the Government had decided that the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, would continue as a government factory. The Government made that decision after considering a single expression of interest for the lease of the factory following public advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the sale or lease of the factory with a closing date of 11 June 1982. Honourable members will recall the history of this matter which, however, I will shortly recapitulate. One of the decisions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions announced on 30 April 1981 was that the Government proposed to endeavour to sell the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, as a going concern to private enterprise. In consequence of that decision expressions of interest for the acquisition of the factory were invited with a closing date of 12 June 1981, which was later extended to 8 July 1981. Before that process could be completed, the Senate resolved to refer the Government's decision to sell the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg and the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo to the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. Subsequently, on 23 September 1981, the Senate resolved that a select committee be established to report on the future of the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg and the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo . As I earlier mentioned, the Senate Select Committee presented its report on the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, on 9 March 1982. It is still to present its report on the future of the Government Clothing Factory, Coburg.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The members of the Committee were divided in their views on the future of the Ordnance Factory. Senator Martyr, the Chairman, and Senator Crichton-Browne recommended the sale of the factory as a going concern; that if efforts to sell failed the possibility of sale of various sections of the factory as going concerns be investigated; and that if all efforts failed the operation of the factory be wound down and closed with appropriate assistance being given to apprentices and employees thereby displaced. The other two members of the Committee, Senator Button and Senator Siddons, dissented. </PARA>
<PARA> On 17 March, 1982 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in answer to a question in the House from the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), expressed the Government's position in the light of the Senate Committee's report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have seen the report on the future of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. The Government will be looking at the report quite closely. I note that the main part of the report recommends that the Ordnance Factory still be sold. That is consistent with the Review of Commonwealth Functions recommendation of a year ago and the Government's efforts since then which in a sense had been suspended during the Senate Committee inquiry. The Government will evaluate the various proposals, or offers of tenders and, when that process is finished, it will come to a final decision as to whether or not the factory will be sold. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government would much prefer that the factory could be sold to private enterprise so that new investment could be attracted to Bendigo and to the Ordnance Factory. This would provide opportunities for expanded activity. More money would flow through the factory and into the city. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of the Committee's recommendation that if the factory could not be sold it should be closed down the Prime Minister advised the honourable member that the Government did not accept that part of the Committee's recommendations. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believed that its reaction to that part of the recommendations ought to be made known quickly so that the concern that would be felt as a result of that recommendation could be put completely and absolutely at rest. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister assured the House of the future of the factory by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Having examined all the options and in particular the impact on Bendigo, the Government, if it is not successful in its efforts to sell the Ordnance Factory to a vigorous and vital private enterprise concern, will continue to operate the factory as a government operation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister visited Bendigo on 22 March 1982 and, in the company of the honourable member for Bendigo, addressed the factory employees and repeated that assurance. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, in order to bring the matter to a conclusion, the Government decided to explore the interest of private enterprise in taking on the operation of the factory, in the light of the Senate Committee report, by readvertising for expressions of interest for the purchase or lease of the factory. As I advised the House at the beginning of this statement, the Government had decided that the factory will continue as a government factory. An expression of interest was received from one company, Vickers Australia Ltd., to lease the factory. The Government did not consider that the company's proposal met the Government's requirements for the future operation of the factory or the commitments which had been made by the Government to the people of Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> In my public announcement of the Government's decision on 7 July 1982 I emphasised the responsibilities that lay ahead of the Government, the management of the factory and the whole work force in assuring the future of the factory. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> It remains for factory management and staff to work together with the Government to demonstrate that the Ordnance Factory Bendigo has an important part to play in the field of defence support and that cost and performance achievements in the future will justify the Government's decision to continue its operation as a government factory. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of this background I have, since undertaking the responsibilities of the new Department of Defence Support, been concerned to remove the uncertainties about the future of the factory and put in train action which will allow the employees to look ahead with growing confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Government had agreed that implementation of recommendations contained in a joint management review of the munitions factories should proceed. With the exception of Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, and the Australian Government Clothing Factory, the recommended changes in upper structure positions in the factories have been implemented and staffing of the positions is proceeding. Consequential changes for junior management are in hand. Now that the Government has made its decision to retain Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, action is in hand to implement the necessary management changes in that factory. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to indicate the investment being made by the Government in the factory and actions being taken to establish a better workload for it. In the 1982-83 Budget, expenditure of $947,000 is provided for. This includes $80,000 for computing facilities, $190,000 for rationalisation of production facility for 500lb bombs, plant acquisitions of $200,000 and repairs and maintenance of $477,000. Such expenditure of nearly $1m in this financial year is an emphatic demonstration of the Government's readiness to meet the commitment made to the factory's employees, to the civic authorities and to the people of Bendigo by the Prime Minister, myself and the honourable member for Bendigo. But more than that, there is included in the works design list of the Department of Transport and Construction for this year provision for a new electroplating facility at an estimated cost of $550,000 and it is planned to call tenders for extensions to the metrology laboratory-a key facility in meeting the precision requirements of ordnance manufacture-in March 1983 at an estimated cost of $415,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The factory has budgeted for 310,000 man hours of work in the current financial year, being an increase of 50,000 hours in defence work and an overall increase of 18,000 hours over the 1981-82 work load. The future of the factory is really dependent upon the volume of defence and commercial work which can be directed or attracted to it under the nation's defence program or the guidelines for engaging in commercial activity. Thus the work load of the factory will respond to the overall national defence effort in time of peace or the competitiveness of the factory to obtain commercial work. Nevertheless one of the most significant prospects for increased work load, as well as opportunity to acquire and apply new and advanced technology, lies with Project Hamel. This project is designed to equip the Army with the British 105mm light gun as a key weapon over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> It is anticipated that the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, will manufacture a significant proportion of components and the gun will be assembled at Bendigo. An executive engineer from the factory will play a significant role in the furtherance of this project. Dr J. Barclay has been selected to fill a new post in the United Kingdom as the liaison engineer for the project. Dr Barclay will leave Australia on 16 September 1982, to take up a three-year posting. </PARA>
<PARA> In another effort to open up new opportunities for Bendigo a factory respresentative has recently visited the United States to discuss the possibility of sub-contract work with United States firms. Discussions have taken place at officer level with the Victorian Government. It is to be hoped that the Victorian Government will be true to its public statements that it wishes to direct more of the major engineering work of its own instrumentalities to Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Government would have been happy to have been able to sell or lease the factory to a private enterprise purchaser, able to put new investment into the factory, to expand the commercial opportunities for the factory within Australia and overseas, and to secure and expand employment at Bendigo, it was not, in the events which have happened since the announcement of the decisions of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions in April 1981, possible to achieve such a sale or lease within a reasonable time and with appropriate guarantees. Nevertheless, I am sure honourable members, the factory work force and the people of Bendigo will understand that by the actions which I have related, the Government will now do all that it reasonably can to improve the efficiency of the factory and expand the work load of it and thereby improve the prospects of its future operations. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate firstly that the Opposition is concerned that the Government has again decided to set aside the two-hour rule. This statement was delivered to us at half past twelve, a time when most of the people whom we would want to contact would not be available. The Minister for Defence Support (Mr Viner) has chosen not to wait the two hours, which is the general courtesy of the House, but to make a statement in the House at two o' clock-half an hour before that time has expired. That action is in line with the statement itself. It is a 'Save Bendigo for Bourchier' statement. It says very little about the future of Bendigo Ordnance Factory. It does not in any way apologise for the problems that have been created in the Bendigo area and, if I may say so, in many other areas of Australia by the incompetent, inefficient and impractical decisions which were hastily thrown together under what was called the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the razor gang or the Lynch gang, which made numerous recommendations which cannot stand up even to cursory examination and most of which have not been able to be carried out because they were stupid recommendations in the first place based on ideological nonsense rather than practical considerations. In Canberra, for instance, which is the responsibility of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), who congratulated the Minister for Defence Support on this statement, the Australian Capital Territory Motor Vehicle Testing Centre, which was making $2m a year, was listed to be sold because someone might make a bob out of it. That decision has been reversed. The Government will now pay someone about $1m to sell the Belconnen Mall. Other such decisions have been made around the country. It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) chose to support those decisions in this House and chose to indicate in advance, as the Minister has now, a conviction that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory should be sold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bendigo, like most provincial cities, has a limited range of employment opportunities which form the basis of its economy. If one of the major units of that economy is placed under threat, as was the Bendigo Ordnance Factory by the razor gang considerations, the town itself is concerned, investment is slow and there is a period of no activity or regressive activity. The threat over Bendigo has now been around for a couple of years. If we take note of the speculation about an early election we can better understand this statement. It is in stark contrast to a statement made within two months of the last Federal election when it was announced that $9m-worth of investment would take place at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. The Minister has generously indicated that the Government has now decided to go ahead with certain projects in respect of the Ordnance Factory . I remind the Minister that if he reads the last Budget Papers he will find the same projects were announced 12 months ago. When asked why those projects were to proceed at a time when the factory was for sale, the Government said they were necessary irrespective of whether the factory was sold, to be operated by a private operator, or continued as a government operation. This statement reannounces last year's statements. </PARA>
<PARA> It is welcome that the Government has decided to go ahead with the 105mm light gun project. Like most of the Government's projects, it has been an annual announcement since 1976. It was announced in this House in the 1976 program for defence. It was stated in that program that the commencement date for the placement of orders would be 1978. It has started, but this is 1982. That work could have been going on at Bendigo for the last three years, had the Government met its undertakings to this House, as it very rarely does. In this year's Defence estimates-the Minister knows this as well as I do-the amount of increase for capital equipment for the defence forces over last year's appropriations for that purpose is less than 5 per cent. That is less than one-third of the inflation rate in defence equipment costs, so there has been a cutback in the amount appropriated this year for defence equipment. On past records we can guarantee that that amount will not be met. There has not been one year since this Government has been in office in which the full amount appropriated for defence equipment was actually spent. Last year less than 80 per cent was spent. When the Government talks about an advanced defence program, that is exactly what it does-talks, talks and talks some more. But it does not do anything. It does as little as it can, defers as much as it can and ultimately pays far more for much less that it ought. The consequences of this statement should be borne by any government and any member who supported it and who represents the area involved. Had the razor gang properly examined what it was recommending, no such recommendation would have been made. A recommendation to sell a major item of the economic base of a city such as Bendigo should not be made unless there is substantive evidence that that sale is practical and possible. No such evidence existed. Such a recommendation should not be made unless it is certain that the sale will benefit that community and benefit the taxpayers of Australia. That also was not true of the Minister's statement. There was no potential buyer, no potential usage, only an ideological conviction of a committee that the sale should take place because the factory happened to belong to the Government, and probably because the facility was losing money. That situation is not changed as a result of this statement, and it has not been changed by the two years of uncertainty which has been created in the Bendigo area. Life has its facts, and some operations are run by governments for the sole reason that they are not profitable and therefore not attractive to private enterprise. No private enterprise company is interested in running operations, no matter how necessary, if it does not make a profit. Why should it? It is in the business of making profits, not providing a public service. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement comes to this House because of incompetence and lack of consideration. What did the razor gang consider when it made this decision? What were the bases of its consideration? Who was the buyer? Who was the operator? What were the bases of the assurances that the sale would increase the activities of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory? There were no assurances; statements were picked out of the air, just as the decision was picked out of the air by people who had not done their homework but were pressed for decisions. They made decisions without proper and adequate consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation existed, and still exists, in which educational institutions, for instance, were recommended for amalgamation on figures that were six years old. In the case of the Preston Institute of Technology, the razor gang report proudly and grandly announced-I know the honourable member for Bendigo knows about engineering as well as I do-that the Government would direct that no new students be taken in for 1981. The institution had made that announcement two years earlier and the razor gang did not even know about it. Talk about incompentence. The course had been cancelled two years earlier yet we had a Minister of the Crown tell us in this Parliament: 'We have directed them not to do what they told us they would not do two years ago'. That was nonsense, and this report is nonsense. It is the 'save Bourchier' report. It almost indicates that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has decided that he will have an election. Where is the $9m the Government promised in 1980? One million dollars is promised in the Minister's statement. It is the same $1m which the Government promised a year ago and, if the Government is returned, the same $1m will be promised next year. The Government is good at promising; it just does not do anything. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government should be censured for its incompetent management, its insincerity and for the fact that it has brought Australia to its knees because of decision making such as is reflected in this document and the razor gang document. Ideology of any type will not solve problems while we have a government that thinks the word 'practical' means an examination in a school. This Government is incompetent, it is inefficient and it lacks integrity, and this document shows it. </PARA>

We believed-I supported the belief-in the initial stages that the Bendigo factory, which was running at about half strength and relying on outside sources for about 60 per cent of its contracts, would be well served if a viable operation could be achieved in the private enterprise sector. In the initial stages three or four top firms, large firms, expressed an interest in negotiating with the Government. That was prior to the appointment of the Senate Committee which held up proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> History now records that because of the long delays caused by the Senate inquiry, when ultimately the Government could proceed the expressions of interest dropped to interest from one firm. The Government, very wisely and properly, because of the emotive issue that it was and because of the concern at the effect it was having on the factory employees and the rest of the people in Bendigo-I requested that this be done-reached a decision very promptly. The situation now is that the Government has carried out the promise that it had already made-that if the factory could not be sold it would remain as it was. The Minister for Defence Support, within whose portfolio the factory is now listed, announced in Bendigo that the sale would not go ahead and that the factory would stay as it was. He also pledged that this Government would be doing its utmost to help the factory to expand. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) in his remarks mentioned that $9m was promised for the factory some years ago. The point that he well knows-I am sure that he made his remarks with tongue in cheek-is that the contracts associated with ordnance factories do not automatically arrive on the table the day that projects are listed. They just do not turn up quite that quickly. The F111 aircraft, for example, did not arrive on the day it was suggested we should buy it. The Leopard tanks did not arrive in the first year. I will come back to that subject in a moment because an interesting story relating to the factory is connected with it. The Hamel gun project was one of the projects to be financed under that proposal. The Government properly took steps to find out which was the best howitzer for the Army to have. The Army required that proper testing be carried out. There were two contenders for the proposed supply of this gun. One weapon was an American model and the other was English. It was after lengthy testing that the decision was made to use the United Kingdom model. Having made that decision the Government has proceeded with the contract for the Hamel gun and we have now had the announcement that the project is well under way. In fact , I understand that it will be a matter of only a short time before the gun is actually being produced in Australia at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with that and in line with the promise of the Minister, Dr Barclay, one of the top senior engineers at the Ordnance Factory, is being sent to England so that he can learn at first hand all the necessary technology related to the gun. Yet we have the honourable member for Corio deriding him through his suggestions that this Government has delayed the process. Dr Barclay and his staff know full well that the proper processes are being followed. I refer to the remarks made earlier by members of the Opposition. I remind members of the Opposition that in 1974 when the Labor Government proposed to purchase Leopard tanks-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="037">Mr BOURCHIER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should listen to this. I made the proposition to the then Minister for Defence, Lance Barnard, that parts of those tanks could adequately have been made in Bendigo. I refer to the turrets and guns which were not made by the Germans but were made in England. We could have made those turrets and guns here. What did Lance Barnard and the Australian Labor Party say? They said: 'No way; we can't do it. We couldn't set up for it. It is an impossibility'. They scrubbed it flat. It was in reference to that time that Mr Kennedy, the former member for Bendigo, commented recently that I said in 1974 that we should sell the factory. I did say that; I do not deny it. I said it out of sheer anger at the Labor Party refusing to do something for the factory at Bendigo. I said: 'All you are going to do is see this factory go down hill and close up. If that is the way you want to treat the people of Bendigo why don't you sell it?'. From that remark members of the Labor Party have elected to suggest that I wanted to sell the factory. I am just telling them the facts. The Bendigo people have not forgotten-honourable members opposite might think that they have-that the Labor Party would not give them one chance to make the gun turrets for the Leopard tanks; not one chance. The Labor Party gained no credit for itself in regard to what it did for the Ordnance Factory. While it was in Government it did nothing for the Ordnance Factory except let it run down . That is a fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to mention a matter that occurred due to my efforts. I read in the paper where the State Government of the day had let a contract to a firm called Demac Products Pty Ltd to supply huge dredges to the Loy Yang dam project for the State Electricity Commission. I was told that this firm called Demac had not allowed the Ordnance Factory to tender for the supply of the crawler tractor parts. I found out at the time that this was not true and that the firm had not received an approach from the Ordnance Factory. I approached the Minister on the matter. He very quickly organised a meeting with Demac. Despite all the controversy going on as to whether the Ordnance Factory was to be sold, the Minister promised and the Government gave an undertaking that irrespective of the results the Ordnance Factory would continue-hounourable members seem to have forgotten this-to supply defence contracts and it would be available to complete any contract entered into, including the one for Demac. </PARA>
<PARA> Under those conditions Demac was quite prepared to accept negotiations with the Ordnance Factory. What do we find? The Ordnance Factory made an approach and put in its very best price which was just slightly higher than the German quote which Demac had. The Minister for Minerals and Energy in the State Labor Government, Mr White, said: 'We will buy these crawler tractors overseas. We are not going to give them to Bendigo'. He had forgotten altogether what he, Mr Landeryou and Mr Kennedy said in Bendigo. They said: 'We will make sure that in Victoria any contract goods for State Government must be manufactured and supplied by Victorian companies.' Having said that, as soon as the first opportunity arose of deriding the Federal Government on the matter they turned around and were prepared to forget about it. Now that we have brought it out in the open Mr Landeryou has run hot-tail and is ready to negotiate and try to save face. I wish him luck because we are doing all we can. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister at the table has organised a meeting between the State Electricity Commission in Victoria, Demac, the supplying contractor and the Ordnance Factory . The initial meeting was held yesterday. That meeting allowed further negotiations with the Minister giving full range to the Ordnance Factory and flexibility to allow it to negotiate a price. If anything can be done by this Government to help that Ordnance Factory get this contract it is being done. I suggest to honourable members that if that contract does not come to Bendigo it will be quite obvious that Mr White prefers to have the products made overseas. We will just wait and see what happens. I hope that he has enough sense to back off, because Bendigo needs that contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation that occurred in Bendigo was, in many senses, a very emotive issue; quite understandably so. One of the things the honourable member for Corio said which one cannot deny-in fact I totally agree with him-is that the Ordnance Factory is one of the largest wage payers or employers in Bendigo. If it were to close down it would be tragic. Unfortunately prominent people in Bendigo who are not associated with the factory took the stance that that was what the Government was going to do. This was never a fact. The Government always said that if it could not sell or lease the factory it would remain as it was. There was never any risk that that factory would close down. This was the tragedy which caused all the emotion, upset and unnecessary problems to the people who worked at the factory. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that the matter has been resolved. I am delighted that the factory is staying as it is. I am more delighted that the Minister who is now in charge of the matter is taking such positive actions to try to provide more work for the factory. I only hope that the Opposition will lean on its State colleagues to ensure that that particular contract comes to Bendigo. I hope that the other proposition which I have put to the Minister in regard to project Hamel is acted on. The management of that project at some time should come back to Bendigo where I believe it belongs. I have put this matter to the Minister. He obviously has to consider that fact, but the project management of operation Hamel in my opinion should be back in Bendigo. I am pressing for that to happen. I hope it will happen and I believe that we will ultimately achieve that end. Now that this is behind us the important thing is that we must all work for the benefit of the factory in Bendigo. In doing so I suggest the Labor Party could do something positive instead of being negative as usual. It should encourage the unions to do all they can to help productivity at the factory. The factory relies a lot on its ability to turn out the huge type of manufactured products that it does for various industries. It must attempt to keep its prices competitive and keep the work up to schedule. The factory can do so provided it is given a fair go. I have no doubt that the workers of the factory have the expertise. The factory has some of the best engineers and tradesmen. I believe the future of that factory is totally ensured only with the support it is now getting from this Government. It is hoped that the factory does not stay as it is. It is my ambition and my aim, now that he decision has been reached, that that factory will expand. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I thank the Minister at the table for being so prompt in having the decision reached when it was obvious that there was a lack of interest in the purchase of the factory. The matter was not delayed unnecessarily. The people of Bendigo had suffered immensely as a result of the emotive campaign whipped up by others in regard to this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is one of those occasions when the Minister for Defence Support (Mr Viner) comes into the House with a statement which reverses completely the whole trend of what was a thoroughly incompetent and dishonest decision made for and on behalf of the Government in the first place. By reversing that decision he expects to receive the plaudits of the House as he has received the plaudits of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier). I say to the honourable member that this is the first occasion on which the question of the future of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory has been mentioned where the honourable member has been prepared to stand up in this Parliament and say one word on behalf of the future of the factory and on behalf of the work force. It is extraordinary that the Minister for Defence Support, who is at the table, is relying so heavily in terms of the future of this factory upon the fact that a Labor Government has been appointed in Victoria. It will be given the responsibility of finding the work to solve the problems of that factory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was pointed out by Senator Button in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories that one of the problems which has bedevilled not merely the Ordnance Factory but indeed the railways workshop at Bendigo is that they have been continually deprived of contracts and large capital works have been very significantly underutilised. If we look at the history of this factory one is entitled to ask the Minister, as one is entitled to ask the honourable member for Bendigo: Were the decision and the recommendations of the so-called Review of Commonwealth Functions which were supported by the Minister and supported loyally by the honourable member for Bendigo properly based? I believe that on any objective assessment of those decisions one will find that what occurred was that a number of senior Ministers virtually made a grab bag of proposals about where they could cut funds without any regard at all for the social and economic consequences of those decisions. It is no small decision to propose the sale or the closing down of a factory in a major regional centre which is such a large employer. The people of Bendigo believe, as members of the Opposition believe, that the decision to sell-as Senator Button pointed out-had been adopted simply to avoid the political odium that was associated with a Government decision to close it down. That is the political reality. What was the result of that in Bendigo? The result was a climate of economic uncertainty in Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot threaten the livelihood of so many people without casting an economic cloud upon the whole community. Economic uncertainty and a great deal of anguish were produced. That very difficult situation affected the whole community and led to very significant protests from every important economic and social unit within the community, including the Mayor, the councillors, the trade union movement, the employer groups and the commercial sector. Everybody's livelihood was touched by this decision. The people of Bendigo were entitled to turn at least to a voice in this Parliament which would express their sentiments and their hopes for the continuation of this operation. Did they have that voice from the honourable member for Bendigo? He talked today about his five-minute exercise in the corner with the Minister saying: 'What can we do to put pressure on the Cain Labor Government?' Where was the honourable member for Bendigo, the voice of the people of Bendigo, their one voice in this Parliament when this decision was made? Did he stand up, as I have heard other honourable members who support the Government from time to time do, and say: 'Look, although I am a part of this Government and although I believe that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is a man of proven vision and capacity, I am bound to say on behalf of my electorate that on this occasion the Government is wrong'. The honourable member for Bendigo is commonly referred affectionately to as 'Boots' within the parliamentary party because every time the Prime Minister bends over he can see his boots. </PARA>

After exhaustive research we could not find much reference to the honourable member for Bendigo in relation to this issue.

<PARA> I return to the subject of the meeting of 22 May. A large meeting was attended by 2,000 people. The leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) was there but there was a telegram from the honourable member for Bendigo stating that he could not be there because he was at an important meeting in Sydney concerning commercial television stations. Mr Deputy Speaker, in deference to your injunction, I will not delay the House on this point. I simply say this: The Press cuttings and the parliamentary records show that on every occasion when this matter was brought before the Parliament the honourable member for Bendigo's voice was singularly absent. At every point he was a supporter of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the 1980 election, this Government and the honourable member for Bendigo as its spokesman were happy to announce an $8m to $9m program of expansion. It has never taken place. The people of Bendigo were entitled to accept that as a truthful statement by the honourable gentleman. He was speaking on behalf of the Government. That promise was never fulfilled and he knew it would never be fulfilled. In its place they were given a promise of closure, the promise of sale and the promise of economic uncertainty. There was no more care for the truth on that occasion by the honourable member for Bendigo, who was speaking on behalf of the Government, than there is care for the truth in the statement made by the Minister and the honourable member for Bendigo in his speech today. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Bendigo have been subjected to a period of anguish and economic insecurity as a result of this Government's inability to apply an effective policy over many years for the development of these factories. It compounded the situation by a stupid and irresponsible decision. It was a decision for which the honourable member for Bendigo became the mealy-mouthed spokesman in this place and everywhere else. On this occasion the record of the honourable gentleman, both in Bendigo and in this Parliament, means that the people of Bendigo can give no more credibility to the promises of this ailing and desperate Minister and this ailing and desperate Government as they desperately try to preserve one more seat and the neck of the honourable member for Bendigo, who, on his own record of credibility, will be rejected by the people of Bendigo at the next election. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will by now be aware that the Government has accepted the Remuneration Tribunal's recommendations and determinations. In making its review , the Tribunal took into account the state of the national economy and, within proper limits, the effects which its decision may have on it. It gave careful consideration to the matters raised by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) concerning the necessity to achieve a moderation of the rate of wage and salary increases in the community in order to avoid an immediate rise in unemployment, to reduce inflationary pressures and to avoid further damage to our international competitiveness. The Tribunal was persuaded that exceptional circumstances exist and consequently made determinations and recommendations based on a general level of increase in salaries of 7 per cent. Remuneration directed at the reimbursement of outgoings and expenditure-for example, electorate allowance and travelling allowance-has been adjusted according to the Tribunal's assessment of what is necessary to achieve a proper reimbursement. It would be inequitable for persons within the Tribunal's jurisdiction to suffer a penalty in respect of expenditure made by them in carrying out their duties and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Remuneration Tribunal's willingness to consider the national interest gives a clear lead to other wage fixing bodies. The Government hopes that wage fixing bodies throughout Australia will also be prepared to consider the wider ramifications of their decisions. At a time when wage rises are pricing people out of a tight labour market, wage fixing authorities have a responsibility to take into account the economic climate in which they operate. In accepting the Remuneration Tribunal's determinations, the Government has also sought to give a lead. Honourable members will be aware that there is considerable public support for the proposition that parliamentarians should practise what they preach with regard to wage restraint. The Government is greatly encouraged by decisions already taken by a number of large Australian companies to restrain increases in salaries. If the example set by the Government is followed by other employers and accepted by wage and salary earners generally, it will play an important part in achieving the levels of wage restraint that Australia needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill 1982. Part II of the Bill implements the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to the salaries and allowances of the judiciary. I draw particular attention to clause 6 of the Bill, which changes the eligibility for the Canberra allowance payable to justices of the High Court of Australia. The Act as it stands provides for an annual allowance to be payable to a justice of the High Court who held office on 1 July 1980 and who has continued to have his sole or principal place of residence outside Canberra. The allowance is not payable to a justice who has his sole or principal place of residence in Canberra or to a justice appointed after 1 July 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> In its 1981 and 1982 reviews, the Remuneration Tribunal recommended that the limitation to justices appointed before 1 July 1980 should be removed. The Government has looked at the matter again in the light of the Tribunal's views and representations which it has received on this subject. The State governments , especially those of the less populous States, have been strongly of the view that the justices should not all be compelled to live in Canberra. The argument runs that justices who continue to live in their home States will keep in touch with the shades of thought and attitude around the nation which will help to keep the High Court in tune with the federal nature of Australia. The representations have come not only from the States but also from the Law Council of Australia, from bodies representing the legal profession and from individual members of the legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of these expressions of opinion, the Government now believes that it would be appropriate to adopt the recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal and to remove the bar to the payment of the Canberra allowance to High Court justices appointed after 1 July 1980 who choose to retain their sole or princpal place of residence outside Canberra. It is not intended that the allowance be payable to justices who take up residence in Canberra, or to a justice who, having taken up residence in Canberra, then decides to return to live elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA> Part III of the Bill proposes to amend the Ministers of State Act 1952 by increasing the annual sum appropriated for ministerial salaries to enable the increases recommended by the Tribunal to be payable. It is proposed to increase this sum from $452,000 to $575,000. The opportunity has also been taken to propose certain amendments to the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973 which are unrelated to the Tribunal's review. The first of these amendments is designed to remove Northern Territory and Norfolk Island public offices and members of the National Aboriginal Conference from the scope of the appropriation provisions of the Act. It is not appropriate, nor was it ever intended, that payments to the holders of these public offices be made from the Commonwealth Consolidated Revenue Fund, but rather that the responsible governments and the Conference respectively should provide the funds required.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes to empower the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly to disallow determinations by the Tribunal in respect of its members. This power currently lies with the Commonwealth Parliament, but it is considerd to be more appropriately a matter for the Assembly. The disallowance power would not extend to variation of the Tribunal's determinations. It is also proposed to bring within the provisions of sub-section 7 (11) of the Act the office of member of the National Aboriginal Conference. The effect of this amendment would be to treat members of the Conference in the same way as full time Commonwealth employees. Sub-section 7 (11) provides that full time Commonwealth employees are not entitled to receive remuneration in respect of a part time public office unless a specific exemption is made by regulation. A further minor amendment proposed in respect of the National Aboriginal Conference is that it will now be included within the Act as a body the offices of which are within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. This has previously been achieved by regulation and the proposed amendment is of a machinery nature only. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill seeks to extend the Tribunal's jurisdiction with respect to certain Commonwealth owned or controlled companies. The employees of Commonwealth companies limited by guarantee have been outside the Tribunal's jurisdicition but there is no reason why this should be so and it is now proposed that they be included. Few such offices are involved and existing arrangements would not be upset by the amendment as it would only make it possible for such offices to be referred to the Tribunal in terms of a specific request. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Bounty (Ships) Act 1980 to enable fishing vessels which are over 150 gross construction tons but which do not exceed 21 metres in length to be eligible for bounty. The Bounty (Ships) Act 1980 replaced the Ship Construction Bounty Act 1975 and gave effect to the Government's decision, announced on 29 November 1979, to continue the assistance arrangements for certain ships, boats and other vessels. The 1980 Bounty Act was introduced to simplify the administrative arrangements and it was the Government 's intention that the same size vessels should be covered by the new Act as were covered by the 1975 Act. The definition of 'bountiable vessel' in the new Act however, has the effect of excluding fishing vessels that are 21 metres or less in length but over 150 gross contruction tons from the bounty. This was not the Government's intention. </PARA>
<PARA> It is expected that the inclusion of these fishing vessels for bounty will not have a significant effect on government expenditure. The Government has no knowledge of any locally built ships in this category which have been completed. The operation of the Bill will be retrospective to 1 July 1980 which is the date upon which the Bounty (Ships) Act became operative. In a few moments I will be tabling related Customs Tariff Proposals which propose to amend the Customs Tariff Act to provide for fishing vessels falling within the description of vessels which are now subject to bounty to be free of duties on importation into Australia.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to provide bounty assistance to the production in Australia of certain fresh berry fruits used for processing. The decision to adopt this form of assistance follows the Government's acceptance of a recommendation by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report No. 276 of 24 August 1981 entitled 'Fruit and Fruit Products'. The report covered a wide range of miscellaneous processed fruit products and fresh and processed passionfruit and berry fruits. The Government's decision on the report was announced on 21 April 1982. The Government accepted the IAC's views that assistance in the form of a bounty rather than a tariff would be more appropriate in this case. A tariff on imports would have the effect of increasing the cost of locally produced jam and juice products using imported berry fruit and reduce the competitiveness of those jams and juices against imports. Furthermore a tariff was considered not to be an efficient means of assisting producers of berry fruits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the bounty to be payable at the rate of $100 per tonne of commercially cultivated fresh fruit provided to processors of the fruit. The bounty is to be paid directly to the growers of the fruit and bounty payments will be based on information provided in regular returns to be furnished by the processors. The scheme is to operate for a period of five years from 1 July 1982 and bounty payments in the first year are estimated to be $300,000. The bounty will provide a level of assistance to the berry fruit industry estimated to be equivalent to a tariff of about 10 per cent. This level of assistance is in keeping with that recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission, and accepted by the Government, for most other fruit and fruit products covered by the Commission's report. The Government expects that the bounty scheme proposed by this Bill will assist growers to adjust to newer technology and greater mechanisation so that they can withstand increasing competition from imports. The Government also expects that this assistance measure will ensure a greater uptake of locally produced berry fruits for processing. On behalf of all Tasmanian members of this House and indeed our Tasmanian senatorial colleagues I say this measure is very good news indeed for Tasmania. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill applies to the whole of Australia and amends the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Act 1980 to extend the present arrangement under which a subsidy of $80 a tonne is paid on LPG use by certain consumers for a further twelve months until 28 March 1984. Provisions have also been included in the Bill to impose limit- ations on the amounts of subsidised gas available to industrial consumers after the first of October this year. The LPG subsidy was introduced for three years in March 1980 with the objective of providing sufficient time for household users to adjust to rapidly rising LPG prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the subsidy is largely to help the many thousands of householders, small businessmen and other consumers who depend on LPG, to cope through a period of uncertainty in the world LPG prices, expected to occur in the next year or two. On the other hand the Government does not intend that the subsidy encourage new large scale industrial use of LPG. This policy was clearly stated in 1980 when the subsidy was made available to industrial and commercial users in areas where natural gas was not readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last two years the competitiveness of LPG as an industrial fuel has created a situation where large industrial consumers with heavy reliance on fuel oil could be encouraged to convert to LPG. The Government does not wish to encourage such conversion for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the resulting large increase in subsidy payments could not be justified. Secondly, LPG is a valuable transport fuel and petrochemical feedstock. Unconstrained large scale industrial use of the fuel could establish a demand imbalance leading eventually to a reduction in the amount available for traditional and premium applications such as small commercial and household consumers who, by reason of their location, do not have access to suitable alternative forms of energy. Thirdly, it would be in conflict with the Government's basic policy aim of minimising Australia's dependence on imported liquid fuels. </PARA>
<PARA> The considerations that I have just mentioned led the Government to announce on 25 September 1981 its intention to impose limitations on the amount of subsidised gas to which industrial and commercial enterprise would be entitled. At that time the Government also announced that a review of the subsidy scheme would be made prior to the expiry of the scheme in March 1983. Following that review, which culminated in the decision to extend the subsidy for a further 12 months, the administrative arrangements relating to the imposition of the limitations were finalised. The limits to be imposed on the usage of subsidised gas as proposed by this Bill, will apply from 1 October 1982. From that date most industrial enterprises will be restricted to the equivalent of 1,000 tonnes per annum of subsidised gas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does recognise, however, that on 25 September 1981 some users were already using or were committed to use LPG in excess of the equivalent of 1 ,000 tonnes per annum. The Government will not deprive such users of the benefit of the subsidy. For this reason the Bill provides a mechanism to permit the Minister to increase the limit if he is satisfied that certain contracts relating to the purchase of gas or equipment, or conversion of existing plant and equipment to gas, prior to 25 September 1981, would require the equivalent of an annual usage in excess of 1,000 tonnes per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for notifications to be given by industrial and commercial users to the distributors from whom they purchase the gas, and to the Minister, when they have exceeded their limit or they are about to reach their limit. </PARA>
<PARA> Penalties have been introduced into the legislation ranging from $2,000 to $50, 000 for offences associated with failing to produce documents or failing to notify or knowingly obtaining or attempting to obtain the benefit of a subsidy payment to which the user is not entitled. The Government will continue to monitor the impact of this subsidy on its energy policy and will conduct a further review prior to the new expiry date of 27 March 1984. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Northern Territory (Self- Government) Act 1978 to confirm that minerals in land acquired under section 70 of the Act are vested in the Commonwealth. As far as this provision is concerned I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), who administers this section of the Act. Since land was acquired by the Commonwealth under section 70 of the Act there has been doubt expressed as to whether the terms of the Act actually provided for minerals in that land to be vested in the Commonwealth. It is therefore considered essential that any doubts on this issue should be removed to ensure the protection of Commonwealth land where mining and exploration would not be desirable from the Commonwealth's point of view-for example, defence facilities, airports or areas where there are essential navigational aids. It is for this reason that amending clause 11 is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn to the other minor amendments proposed in the Bill and to preface my remarks by drawing attention to the fact that self-government in the Northern Territory is now four years old and can be described as a success. I commend all Territorians on the enthusiasm and energy which they have applied to the conduct of their own affairs. The atmosphere of confidence created in the Territory indicates that the majority of Territorians consider the granting of self-government to have been the most significant milestone in the Territory's history. The Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act has served the Territory well but as with all legislation now requires some fine tuning. This opportunity has been taken to make some machinery amendments to the Act that will improve its administration. Each of these minor amendments has the blessing of both the Commonwealth and Nothern Territory governments and I will refer briefly to some of the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The assent procedures have been modified to give the Territory Legislative Assembly a degree of flexibility, similar to that enjoyed by the Commonwealth Parliament in dealing with proposed laws returned by the Governor-General or the Administrator. In respect of the proposal of money votes in the Legislative Assembly it is proposed that the Administrator's message need only recommend the purpose of an appropriation rather than the proposed law itself. It is proposed that a casual vacancy in the Legislative Assembly should be filled only if it occurs more than six months before the last date for the next general election. The same clause confirms that a general election is not required as a result of a casual vacancy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends some of the terminology in the Act to conform with the practice of the Assembly and its Standing Orders. The Bill also provides for the simltaneous existence of more than one dormant commission as Acting Administrator to provide for the situation where both the Administrator and the holder of the first dormant commission are unavailable to act as Administrator. By these amendments the Government intends to improve the operation of the Act and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Air Navigation (Charges) Act 1952 which prescribes charges payable in respect of the use by aircraft of aviation facilities and services provided, operated or maintained by the Commonwealth. The Bill gives effect to the Government's decision to vary the rates of air navigation charges for all domestic sectors of the aviation industry. It was announced in the Budget Speech that air navigation charges were to increase by 20 per cent for both domestic trunk and regional airlines and by 12 per cent for general aviation aircraft. The Bill provides for the increased charges to apply from 1 October 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Total revenue from air navigation charges in 1982-83 is estimated to amount to $119.3m, compared with $101.8m from this source in 1981-82. Of the $17.5m increase, $7.1m is attributable to the payment early in 1982-83 of amounts payable in respect of 1981-82; the balance of $10.4m relates to the full effect of the 1981-82 variations to the charges, industry growth and increased revenue resulting from the increases in charges now proposed. By themselves, the increased rates of charges for which this Bill provides are expected to yield additional revenue of $8.4m in 1982-83 and $12.5m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that since 1961 successive governments have pursued a policy of eventual full recovery of costs properly attributable to the aviation industry for the provision and maintenance of the aviation infrastructure. The decision taken by the Government to increase air navigation charges is in line with that policy. Overall, cost recovery in 1982-83 is estimated after adjustment from 1981-82 arrears at about 53 per cent. The 1981 Airlines Agreement formally recognises the Commonwealth's entitlement to recover 100 per cent of its costs. The 20 per cent increase in air navigation charges for domestic trunk airlines is expected to achieve a recovery rate approaching 90 per cent for this sector in 1982-83. The increases in charges for regional airlines and general aviation are expected to lead to 1982-83 recovery rates from these sectors of some 25 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been considerable public comment about the possible effect on air fares of the proposed increases in air navigation charges. I should make it clear that the 20 per cent increase in charges for domestic trunk and regional airlines is estimated to increase total airline costs by around only one per cent on the basis of information already published. I would therefore expect that any overall impact on air fares would be marginal. However, the determination of air fares for specific routes is, of course, a matter for the Independent Air Fares Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that there has been a high level of cost recovery from the international sector in recent years. It is, however, expected that the recovery rate will be reduced to around 100 per cent in 1982-83. Accordingly, there will be no variations in charges for international airlines this year. For the information of honourable senators, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a paper setting out the annual cost recovery rates for each sector of the aviation industry for the ten years to 1980-81. </PARA>

<PARA>The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills presented the tenth report on 18 August relating to the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Bill 1982. The Committee noted that the legislation provided for amendments in the future to the liability limits by regulation and that as expressed the regulations could vary the amounts downwards. The Committee considered that the legislation might more appropriately be permitted only to increase the liability of the airlines. The Committee noted that the potential for removing a pre- existing right by regulation might be regarded as trespassing unduly upon personal rights and liberties. The Government has noted the comments made by the Committee and considers that the amendments to vary the Bill to this extent would be appropriate. Amendments to this effect have been recommended by the Senate in returning the Bill to the House of Representatives along with consequential amendments to the Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability ) Amendment Bill with which this Bill was debated cognately.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just register my objection to the manner in which these amendments have been presented. I had my staff try to get a copy of the amendments from the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) earlier in the day. It and his comments on the Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill were not available. From my understanding of the amendments and the fact that they have been considered by a committee of the Senate I feel that they improve the quality of the legislation that left this place. I make this point: This legislation is very serious legislation. It is very important to anybody who is unfortunate enough to be a victim of an aircraft accident. The current limit of liability is $45,000; it ought to be $130,000. The Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Amendment Bill and the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill raised the amount to only $100,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liability) Amendment Bill was introduced into this chamber on 24 March. It left here on 6 May. Today it is 19 August and now there are late amendments. We accept the amendments made by the Senate. They improve the quality of the legislation. But this is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. This Government is good at promises, promises, promises but it is leading this country into economic disaster and it is leading the airline industry into disaster. Here is another example of the cavalier way in which air travellers and their protection are being treated. This matter goes to the very heart of the worst event that can occur to anybody involved in air travel; that is, to be unfortunate enough to be injured. Now, in come the amendments. They are thrown on the table. The Opposition is expected to consider them and take on trust the Senate's recommendation that they improve the quality of the Bill. We are most dissatisfied with the manner of presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe the legislation is most deficient. The limit of liability under the provisions of this Bill and its companion Bill should be at least $130,000. We believe that, as the Government has rejected this proposal during a division on 6 May, that adjustment to the limit of compensation for people unfortunate enough to be injured in air accidents should be by regular and automatic review- not at the whim of a Minister. Exactly the same thing happened to this legislation when it was introduced in 1976-the last time that similar Bills were debated. They went across to the Senate, sat there for part of the winter recess , came back and then had to be amended-not for this reason but for another that arose during the period the Senate was sitting. We support the amendments proposed. We deplore the fact that the limit is totally inadequate. We deplore the fact that the review of the limit is not automatic and regular as we have proposed. </PARA>

It is a matter of regret to me that the legislation was not passed in the last session of parliament. It did, of course, go through this House, as the honourable member has acknowledged , but unfortunately the pressure of business in the Senate was such that it could not be passed in the Senate prior to the Senate's rising for the winter recess.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess I might repeat some of the sentiments expressed by my colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) in talking about this Bill. I will not include the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), who is at the table. He has been more than kind to me in the last hour in providing me with some information for which I am appreciative. However, I think the whole record of the history of this Bill points out something of the inefficiency and mismanagement of the nation's affairs by this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill was introduced in May. It relates to Customs and excise and the inefficient administration of various parts of the Bureau of Customs by this Government. I guess the reason why we are now debating it, having hibernated over the winter months, is that it has something to do with the television incident of unhappy memory in that period. As I recall, the Minister now departed introduced this Bill a week or so before that scandal arose. He spoke in deprecating terms in his second reading speech about the lack of proper penalties for evasion of duties which had a rather ironic ring when the matter was postponed. However, here we are in late August debating this Bill at last. I mentioned the courtesy of the Minister at the table in providing me with some information in the last hour or so. That does not minimise the fact that 10 pages of amendments-inconsequential, simplified, simple or otherwise-have been lobbed on the Opposition today after that break. That does not do much to increase our opinion of the efficiency of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Opposition has been calling for a royal commission into the affairs of the Bureau of Customs since the unhappy days of the MacKellar-Moore colour television incident. The amendments that have been pushed up today and the Bill in its present form, while they in some way redress some of the inefficiencies that are very obvious in that department, do not convince the Opposition that its claim for a royal commission was not justified. In fact, since the demise of the previous Minister, the Bureau of Customs has now been shoved into the already overburdened Department of Industry and Commerce. The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, of course, has been dismembered so that parts of it find their way into many different departments. The Opposition is not very happy with that. Upon its assumption of office-be it in September or November of 1982 or December of 1983-that Department will be reconstituted because the Opposition at least understands just how important to the affairs of this nation is the Bureau of Customs, what an important arm of government revenue collection it is and what an important arm of protection it is to the Australian community in so many ways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would probably echo the sentiments of the Minister at the table in saying that of course there are within this department very many fine servants of the public, not the least of whom are the Customs officers whose resentment and discontent with the administration of their department was very evident back in May and is still very evident now. In the course of my remarks I might refer to one of the problems to which they relate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I get back to the main thrust of the Bill. It amends the Customs Act primarily by substantially raising the level of penalties for breaches of the Act including narcotics-related offences which, in fact, were separately dealt with in 1979 following the report of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. It is a fact that the penalties prescribed under the Customs Act have for a long period been far too light. It took instances like the kangaroo and horsemeat scandal-also of unhappy memory-to highlight the inadequacy of the penalties that were provided under the Act. So, let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the Minister at the table, that the Opposition supports the provisions which increase these penalties to a reasonable level. </PARA>
<PARA> The inadequacy of the current penalties is highlighted by several facts. Firstly, the penalties for narcotics are now dramatically higher than for other prohibited imports and exports. We probably do not argue with that but at least other penalties should be brought up to a somewhat similar level. This Bill seeks to do that. Most narcotics penalties have not been varied since 1967 when a typical maximum fine was only $1,000 and, for some offences, only $50. That has been redressed. The horse and kangaroo meat scandal revealed that penalties were just not adequate to deal with offences of the magnitude of those offences. They involved not only the evasion of duties but also the destruction, to a great extent, of Australia's very important export meat industry. If proper penalties had been available under the Customs Act people would have been discouraged from taking the simple moves they took to circumvent the rules. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed penalties include the provision that where revenue is evaded the penalty will be at least two times and up to five times the amount evaded. We do not quibble about that. Where prohibited imports or exports are moved, the maximum penalty will be three times their value; that is also reasonable. Where the value of the goods that have been moved in some illegal fashion cannot be ascertained, the maximum fine will be $50,000; that is reasonable also. Offences which strike at the basis of Customs control-for example, interfering with a container before clearance by Customs-will also carry a penalty of $50,000. I commend the Government for making that move. Lesser offences will carry penalties of $1,000 to $10,000. Surely they will be a source of discouragement to people who try to circumvent proper Customs procedures. These penalties do not seem to us to be unreasonable and in the circumstances appear to be appropriate to the offences concerned. Gaol terms are not specified in the Bill, unlike the penalties for the narcotics trade which involve fines and imprisonment. Avoidance of Customs duty and like offences can involve large sums of money and, as I pointed out earlier, scandals which go beyond the evasion of duties. Some offences already carry a penalty of three times the value of the goods involved. I am quite happy to see that that is retained. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequent to the increased penalties, other amendments increase the jurisdictional value of lower and intermediate courts. Previously, most fines were under $1,000 and were dealt with by courts of summary jurisdiction and intermediate courts. But the amendments to the Act allow courts of summary jurisdiction to deal with offences where the fine is up to $5,000 and intermediate courts to deal with offences where the fine is $20,000. Provision will also be made to enable offences involving duty evasion of less than $500 to be dealt with administratively, as are small offences committed by arriving international travellers, crew and, may I say, politicians. Other changes in the Bill include a new Part which provides for the licensing of depots which hold goods prior to examination by Customs. These provisions are virtually identical to existing provisions relating to licensing warehouses. Of course, we support that provision. </PARA>
<PARA> A variety of other amendments update the procedures and other matters. Such amendments are made virtually every year as circumstances and practices change following continuous reviews of the Act. We have no quibble with all of those amendments. In fact, we are very happy to support them. But there are other matters that I would like to touch on in the course of my remarks. As I understand it, some amendments are to be introduced by the Minister at the conclusion of this debate. As I understand it, the Committee that will deal with those new amendments will not meet until next week. Am I correct in saying that?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr JOHN BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am informed that they will be dealt with later tonight. However , there is another area upon which I would like to touch and which may well be looked at by the administration of the Bureau of Customs in its present home in the Department of Industry and Commerce. It relates to shipping containers. At the inception of overseas container shipping in Australia in the 1960s it was recognised that freight containers could be continually imported and re-exported over any period and also that imported containers would normally be brought into Australia for re-export rather than for sale or disposal within the country. In other words, when a container came in from overseas with goods it would normally be re-exported. Accordingly, the Customs legislation was amended so that under section 162A provisions were implemented that ensured, firstly, that shipping companies would lodge a security in which they undertook to re-export any imported containers within 12 months of the import date or, secondly, import duty on foreign-built units would be waived until or unless they remained in Australia for a long period or were to be disposed of or sold under arrangements notified to Customs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Shipping carriers saw this provision as equitable because most or all of their equipment was acquired overseas due to either higher manufacturing costs in Australia or the granting of tax incentives in other countries for those to be built. It was expected that container movement history data would be maintained to prove whether or how containers were re-exported; that random inquiries from local port Customs on containers would be sampled if they were here for more than 12 months after the import date; and that these inquiries would be answered to demonstrate compliance with the law. These samples were expected to be small in volume, having regard to the effort that would be imposed on Customs in selecting units from old import manifests and mailing these to shipping companies; the effort, which would not be too hard, for shipping companies in retrieving history for the queried units and responding with lists of re-export details; and the effort for Customs in checking these responses and in some cases requesting further re-documentation on re-export. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it appears that random selection by Customs of those units to be verified was seen to be an effective check that shipping companies maintained adequate records for this purpose. Firstly, it demonstrated their control and also it had a deterrent effect against abusers of section 162A of the provisions . It is important to note, however, that this entire checking process can potentially detect any ommission or abuse only more than 12 months after a container is imported because until then it is futile for Customs to query containers which have remained in Australia for less than that time. Its detection and deterrent value is therefore extremely limited against any conscious breaches because of the great time lapse. It should also be noted that the provisions of section 162A were drafted on the assumption that all containers would be re-exported by the shipping companies which had imported them. The small number of shipping carriers which operated such container services into Australia in the 1960s did not contradict this, and probably that reflected their intentions at the time. However, since then there has been a great alteration in the pattern of shipping throughout the world. Subsequently the world-wide freight shipping industry has moved heavily towards the use of leased-in equipment from lessors, such that the lessors now own the majority of the world's containers. This trend reflects the seasonal and cyclical nature of many shipping routes, changing shipping business market shares and container traffic imbalances, leading to surpluses and deficits as opposed to stable, balanced trends in which an all-owned fleet might be economic. </PARA>
<PARA> While many leased containers used by shipping companies are maintained on long term leases, many are also used on a spot or trip basis. For Australia this results in many difficulties. Firstly, imported containers are unpacked and later off-hired to the lessor company's agent. This terminated the shipping company's ability to control such units or to maintain records of their subsequent movements. In particular, the companies cannot effect the re-export of those containers. Containers being newly-leased in Australia and re-exported also presented another problem, the new lessee having no record of the containers' previous time in the country since import, nor details of that importation or its intervening movemements. From 1982 the level of Customs inquiries directed to shipping lines has increased heavily in New South Wales, some companies receiving lists of 400 to 500 containers imported 15 months to 24 months previously. The effect imposed on the shipping companies is considerable. No doubt it is also considerable on the Bureau of Customs in New South Wales when it receives and processes the replies. The Bureau appears to me to be unnecessarily bureaucratic when it is considered that the Bureau has already been notified of an actual container export at the time of shipment, the notification being via a container list provided as part of export manifests submitted by shipping companies. The whole process becomes extraordinarily tenuous in tracing the position of the containers once they have been imported, how long they have stayed in Australia, what they have done when they have been here and what is eventually their destiny. It highlights to me the total inefficiency of the tracing of the containers within Australia. Unless something is done to streamline the procedures we will never be able to trace them. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OD4">Mr JOHN BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not disagree that they are very fine officers. The system under which they operate as maintained by the Government does nothing to help the fine efforts that these people put in to protect the Australian people. So the Customs Bureau already holds the information that would enable the matching of imports to re-exports and for which data processing could be readily used to eliminate the majority of containers which have already complied with section 162A. Instead of that, sampling is based on the total range of containers imported. The shipping industry, and the Customs officers themselves, become engulfed in wasteful clerical effort each year. New South Wales Customs are currently sampling about three per cent of all containers imported. For New South Wales alone this requires checking on something of the order of 2,000 to 3 ,000 units each year. This level of sampling is believed to be the statistical minimum needed to detect the predicted levels of containers which justify investigation, that is, through being regularly sold, lost or retained for over 12 months. The New South Wales Customs are understood to be proposing that his level of sampling be adopted for all Australian ports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has become recognised that the existing legislation and regulations make no allowance for the leased container problem which I have already described. Where containers are leased it is much more difficult to trace them. It is believed that various Customs officers differ in their reactions to this. Some believe, strictly correctly to the letter of the law, that off-hire of any container by an importing shipping company does not terminate the company's responsibility regardless of the container's subsequent movements. These officers pressure shipping companies to pursue such onward information about container movements after the containers have left the shipping companies' control. Some officers recognise the inadequacy of the existing law and ask only for reasonable proof that a container has passed to another reputable party such as a lessor's agent. Some officers, in fact, avoid the subject altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> The inconsistencies of Customs offices' practice on this matter causes doubt and concern in the shipping industry and it is another case of whether a bureaucratic sledge hammer is being used to crack a business nut. Perhaps more seriously, though, the varying practices applied by Customs offices may invite corruption in attempts to reduce pressures on some companies. That is not a sling at Customs offices and I would not like it to be interpreted in that way. I just point out that the inadequacy of the system enables those accusations to be made. Some Customs officers appear to be sensitive about discretionary application of inadequate regulations in the light of the colour television affair. I think that is a reasonable statement to make. </PARA>
<PARA> It cannot be denied that the import of containers provides great potential for the illegal movement of narcotics and that Customs officers are concerned to show that the most effective use of their resources in countering this would be to improve the system whereby containers can be traced. However, the real problem is not assisted by the undoubted efforts now expended by Customs officers and shipping companies in re-export history checking. I have tried to point out to the House-it is a rather involved story, I must admit-that the efforts to trace the history of the movements of imported containers from the time of import to their sale, disposal or re-export is a very tenuous affair. Tracing the movements of these containers involves Customs officers in an almost impossible task. I suggest to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Hodgman), who is at the table, that there needs to be a reorientation, a reassembling of the conditions under which these officers work in order that they can do this job properly. </PARA>
<PARA> This highlights to me one of the problems that the Opposition pointed out at the time of the debate in the House on the colour television affair. We said that the systems, the regulations and the administration of the Customs Bureau needed an in-depth look by government. That is the reason we suggest the setting up of a royal commission at the time. We said that we wanted a royal commission to look at all the activities of the Customs Bureau. As I said earlier, the Customs Bureau has now been shifted to another department, but that does not alter the fact that there is still enormous unrest among officers. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the Minister that these officers are a fine bunch of men-a courageous, sincere bunch of men-who are very anxious to see that their job is done properly. But they can only do the job properly within the confines of the regulations under which they work. I repeat that these regulations are not adequate. They are not efficient and they are not clearly defined. The quicker that the Government-or as we suggested, a royal commission-has an in-depth look at the Customs Bureau to steamline the operations of this most important arm of government regulation, the better. The response from the Government has merely been to appoint an inquiry under a man for whom everybody has great respect, Mr Mahony. Nobody would quibble with Mr Mahony's integrity, honesty or dedication to his task, but the guidelines which he was given by the Government-only that he look at how Customs operate at the airport at Mascot-to me seem totally inadequate. It was a very inadequate response-perhaps a convenient response-to the colour television affair, but from our point of view it was not a correct response to all the problems that exist in the Customs Bureau. I suggest very sincerely to the Minister at the table that he take this matter up with his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch), under whose jurisdiction the Customs Bureau now operates, to ensure that all of the problems of the Customs Bureau-particularly the problem that I have just outlined with regard to the importation of shipping containers-are looked at more adequately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs and Excise Amendment Bill is a very important measure. Its being before the House today has nothing to do with the alleged inefficiency of the Government as the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown) has just stated, but with the general priority of the Government' s business in the last session and the need for the provisions of this Bill to be very carefully considered. It relates, as the honourable member has suggested , to a crucial area of government responsibility-the detection of the import of prohibited goods, especially the evils of the drug trade and the collection of Customs and excise duty. It was important that this be looked at carefully. I suggest to the honourable member that if he had looked at it a little more carefully himself, many of his latter remarks would be seen to be irrelevant. Very important clauses of the Bill are precisely concerned with making provision for setting out in detail regulations for the standardising of procedures and the tightening up of procedures in relation to Customs matters. Further, some of the strictures of the honourable member concerning the Department were totally unwarranted and unworthy of him. In respect of the involved story-to use his own words-about the empty containers I say only that section 162A of the Act implements international conventions in respect of the free movement of containers into and out of Australia and is outside the ambit of the Bill presently before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat that it is an important measure. The honourable member has conceded that. Its principle purpose is to increase very substantially the penalties provided for various breaches of the Customs Act. The need for this certainly became apparent during the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs-the Williams Inquiry-which pointed out the inadequacies of penalties for breaches of the Customs Act. The matter of penalties in the context of drug offences has previously been dealt with, so I make it clear that those penalties are not before the House at the moment. I will make a further reference to them in a moment, as they are very important. </PARA>
<PARA> That Commission drew attention to the inadequate level of penalties for breaches of the Customs Act. Also the unlawful exportation of horse and kangaroo meat last year to the United States was referred to. As a result of these and other factors a general review of all the provisions for penalties in this Act was undertaken. It took into account the matters to which I have just referred, also the difficulties faced by Customs in supervising the growing flow of goods into and out of Australia, the need for Customs to rely to a significant degree on the integrity of importers and exporters, and the magnitude of the rewards-if I can use that word-that can be obtained from revenue evasion or unlawful import or export activities. It was concluded that these penalties should be increased and, indeed, substantially increased. I think the history of the matter is that penalties were originally written into the 1901 Customs Act. There was something of an indexing of those penalties in about the mid 1960s, but no cognisance was taken of the gravity of offences, particularly some of the offences of more recent note. The Bill now before us provides, as the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out, that the penalty for revenue related offences-that is, the evasion of duty-should be up to five times the amount sought to be evaded and not less that two times that amount. For the offences of importing prohibited imports or exporting prohibited exports a maximum penalty equivalent to three times the value of the goods is proposed. Where the amount evaded or the value of the goods cannot be ascertained, the proposed maximum penalty of $ 50,000 should apply. That should be a very significant deterrent. I think that the penalty for such offences, and some others, was until recently $1,000. This order of change underlines the significance of this measure. The penalty of $50, 000 is also prescribed for other offences which strike at the very basis of this important matter of Customs control. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in that category are offences such as failure by the master of a ship to permit the ship to be boarded, the failure of the pilot of an aircraft to land for boarding, the bringing of a ship or aircraft to an unauthorised place in order to effect a clandestine landing to escape Customs attention and the unlawful interference with containers or goods-note that, in the light of what the honourable member for Parramatta was saying-between the time of landing and their clearance by Customs. In respect of some offences, which while serious are not amongst the most important, a maximum penalty of $25,000 is proposed where previously the penalty was of the order of $500. Examples of such offences are the unloading without permission of imported cargo or cargo that has been loaded for export. A maximum penalty of $10,000 is proposed for offences such as failing to comply with conditions attached to permission for the importation, exportation or movement of goods. Significant penalties for breaches such as these are essential for the effective discharge of this heavy responsibility for the detection and prevention of unlawful imports and exports and the assessment and collection of appropriate duty. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that in this measure no action is proposed in respect of penalties for narcotic offences because those penalties were reviewed and substantially increased by amendments in 1977 and 1979. The penalties already provided in that context, in section 235 of the Act, range from $2,000 or two years imprisonment or both for simple possession of imported narcotics up to a penalty of $100,000 or 25 years imprisonment or both for trafficking in narcotics. There is further provision for imposing a penalty of life imprisonment in the most serious cases. I stress to the House that this underlines the uncompromising determination of this Government to combat the evils of the drug trade. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Parramatta has mentioned, with the increased penalties I have referred to there are consequential adjustments which have become necessary to ensure that Customs prosecutions may be brought in an appropriate court. At present the Act provides that only prosecutions involving a pecuniary penalty not exceeding $1,000 may be instituted in courts of summary jurisdiction and in intermediate courts but the application of this provision now becomes very limited, so these limits have been raised. For the intermediate court jurisdiction penalties of up to $20,000 can be contemplated and for the courts of summary jurisdiction the limit is $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Another and very major part of the amendment of the Customs Act proposed in this Bill are clauses which deal with the report, the unloading from ships and the placement and movement of imported cargo. This is a crucial area for Customs control. We are looking here in particular at times when cargo has been quite undocumented, is being unloaded from a ship and is being moved from a ship to a depot or some place of storage. As I said this is a very crucial area. It is an area where there is the need for the most stringent controls. I do not suggest that the Department has not had effective procedures in this area, but they have been of a discretionary character. Clause 12 relates to the movement of goods from one ship to another and clause 14 relates to the movement of goods off ships. Clause 24 sets up a new Part VA of the Act relating to depots where goods still in this undocumented state can be stored. Clause 7 deals with section 40AA of the principal Act and the movement of goods generally which are still subject to Customs control but have not yet received documentation. It is very important in these areas that the procedures involved be clearly thought out, fully specified, standardised and tightened up in a way which can make this crucial activity of the detection of illegal imports and the collection of duty most effective. </PARA>
<PARA> I think honourable members will see that these clauses are indeed providing for just the spelling out we were referring to earlier, in close detail and by regulations, of the procedures necessary in this crucial area of control. What was satisfactory in an Act which was originally passed in 1901 needs this further spelling out in the circumstances of 1982, in the circumstances in particular where much cargo is shipped in containers and by new procedures. That is a major part of this Bill. I make brief reference to clause 10. I draw attention to this clause as it has been considerably misunderstood. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. There is a provision in the Bill which provides that a person who is in a position to do so, the ship owner or the master, if requested is obliged to provide the ship's manifest or other information to the Customs authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister said, that is quite right, because it is very important, particularly in the area of drug trafficking, that the authorities can look at this manifest and make risk assessments so that they can more effectively discharge their obligation to try to detect unlawful importing. This clause imposes an obligation, where a party can do so, to provide information about a ship's cargo to the Customs officials for the more effective discharge of their duties. To the extent that a ship's manifest or other information is provided in this way in advance this is not put down as an imposition on the shippers or the importers; it is introduced as something designed to be of assistance to them and considerably to minimise the sort of delays which could otherwise occur if the manifest of a ship arriving in port has not been viewed by the Customs officials beforehand. I stress that it is a provision which is designed to assist the import agent and the ship owner to minimise their costs and to make more effective the work of the Customs officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a very important measure. Reference was made earlier to the fact that certain amendments to the Bill will subsequently be moved, and that underlines the hollowness of the claim of the honourable member for Parramatta that this measure has been delayed allegedly owing to the inefficiency of the Government. It has given the parties, Customs agents and other bodies affected, the opportunity to study the provisions of the Bill in detail. In particular, one of the amendments that will be considered later is designed to write into the Bill and to give legal backing to procedures currently adopted by duty free shops. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certain procedures whereby an intending overseas passenger can make purchases. It is his responsibility to board the aircraft and, in effect, export the goods. In fact this procedure has not hitherto had effective legal backing. The period during which this legislation lay before the House gave the parties concerned the opportunity to bring the matter to the attention of the Government and to include it in this measure, and there are other such significant amendments. Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill, as I said, is a very important albeit rather mundane measure. Subject to those further amendments to be moved at a later hour this day, I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill and particularly to the sections that refer specifically to the collection of duty. The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) explained that the Opposition's view on this legislation is to support the various clauses of this Bill. I endorse that proposition. Particularly, I endorse the increase in the disciplinary provisions outlined in this legislation. I only wish that all the disciplinary provisions of the Customs Act be consistently reviewed because I find that very often the time lag in getting legislation introduced into this Parliament makes a joke of the disciplinary provisions in relation to the collection of duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The section that I should like to deal with emerged from Part V of this legislation which provides for the introduction of a new system of licensing depots for holding imported goods and goods for export prior to their examination by Customs officers. Honourable members will be aware that this section will allow a licensing scheme to be modelled directly on that scheme now applying in respect of warehouses. Several matters were raised by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards). He spoke about the tightening up of collection matters. It is very important that I point out to this House some of the work that has already been done regarding the need to tighten up these provisions, as stated in the report of the Auditor-General. This matter and other related matters referring to the collection of excise are currently being examined by the Joint Public Accounts Committee. I should like to refer now to some of these sections in the report of the Auditor-General in order to indicate to honourable members some of the other areas in the collection of Customs that need to be examined by this House and which are currently being examined very seriously by a joint committee of this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to some aspects of the efficiency audit carried out by the Auditor- General into the collection of Customs duties and deferred Customs duties by the then Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. I shall refer to some aspects of that report to give a broader understanding of some of the weak links in the collection of both excise and Customs duties in this country. Basically, this efficiency audit was carried out to look specifically at excisable goods and imported goods upon which the payment of Customs duty is deferred because the goods are stored in bonded warehouses. This involves a considerable amount of revenue to the Government, and after last Tuesday's Budget even more revenue is to be collected from these sources. As the report points out, the amounts of money in the previous financial year were enormous. Excise duty on major excisable products-beer, spirits, tobacco products and petroleum products-in 1980-81 terms amounted to $2,731m. Customs duty on imported goods held in licensed warehouses amounted to approximately $430m for the year ended 30 April 1980. Diesel fuel tax, when purchased free of duty and subsequently used for a dutiable purpose, amounted to $190m in 1980-81. I point out those amounts of money so that honourable members can comprehend the need for very tight controls in this area. It is important that the Government-whichever party is the government of the day-receives the maximum amount of money set out in the legislation and the Customs provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> There was considerable criticism about the administration procedures relating to the collection of excise and Customs duty on imported goods held in licensed warehouses. This is not meant to be a criticism of the departmental officers. In fact what has emerged from the inquiry of the Public Accounts Committee is that the officers of the department responsible for this area-the Inland Services Division-have in fact had incredible work load pressures put on them by not only this area of their responsibility but also the narcotics side of their responsibility. So what the Auditor-General is looking at and what the Public Accounts Committee has subsequently been looking at is not any criticism at all of the officers but rather criticism of the techniques involved. The main criticism they have is the application of the commodity control where the onus for verification of the goods has been on the companies themselves. Currently the situation is that the companies have had to provide verification of the goods but the whole question is whether there have also been independent checks. There have been grave doubts about how effective those checking procedures have been. This really has been the basis of this detailed audit finding report on the excise of beer, duties on spirits, tobacco, petroleum products and diesel fuel. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Accounts Committee is well into that investigation. It has looked specifically at what the Auditor-General's findings have been. Probably the Committee will not always be in agreement with that but that will be the subject of a subsequent report to this House. </PARA>
<PARA> However I think it is important that that matter be raised in the context of looking at this whole Customs collection area because we will see legislation emerging from the findings of that inquiry. I think it is important that, as this area is such a vital one for the collection of revenue for any government, we do see consistent amendments being made to keep the fines up to realistic amounts and also keep the legislation under constant review. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I refer to the administration of bonded warehouses and the findings, again of the Auditor-General's efficiency audit, into bonded warehouses. As honourable members will be aware, bond stores are essentially the means whereby the duty payable on imported goods or excise on domestically produced goods may be deferred until they are released for home consumption. A calculation undertaken during audit field work showed that, for the year ended 30 April 1980, Customs duty on goods released from bond stores in Australia was, as I stated earlier, $435.8m and about 75 officers have taken responsibility for administrating this area as of 30 June 1981. This whole area of staffing the former Department is now being reviewed by the Public Service Board in light of the heavy demands within it. I refer to the criticism that has been made about the system of inventories within the administration of bonded warehouses. The report of the Auditor-General on an Efficiency Audit states:</PARA>
<PARA> The overall control structure-granting of licences to approved persons, requirement for payment of duty before goods are released for home consumption, right of access to company records-is adequate in principle. </PARA>
<PARA> The ADP systems currently in use have the potential to maintain a record of inventory on hand and consequently the contingent liability for duty but this facility has not been fully developed. The systems independently record goods entered into and cleared from bond. A logical extension of this transaction- based approach would be a merger of the systems to facilitate routine oversight of inventories, their age (or dwell time) and their duty potential. Such information would facilitate management and review. The Department has advised that some redevelopment of the ADP systems is taking place but that technical problems have yet to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> These findings suggest that control over revenue from bond stores could be improved by the following measures:</PARA>
<PARA> regular review of 'continuing permissions'-</PARA>
<PARA>That is a system that operates-</PARA>
<PARA> merging of the present ADP systems for entries and releases</PARA>
<PARA> a more discriminatory approach in documentary and physical checking towards stores attracting higher revenue, recognising risk factors, and</PARA>
<PARA> monitoring of cost effectiveness to assess continued need for the level of control resources. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that honourable members read that. I hope that an opportunity for further examination of this legislation will come before this House so that we can ensure that we do get exactly the sorts of revenues that any government of the day has forecast and that very tight controls are imposed and continue to be imposed on Customs collection in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the second reading of the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill. I have noted the second reading speech of the former Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs which felicitously, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . Customs rely to a significant degree on the integrity of importers and exporters . . . </PARA>
<PARA>During the winter recess I was in the Kimberleys with an Opposition committee and I was appalled to learn that in the Kimberleys there are 1,000 air strips left over from the war which are completely unmanned and unpoliced and, on any of these airstrips, drugs or illegal immigrants can be introduced into this country. This gave me a very bleak picture of the Australian situation and the possibilities of smuggling and other forms of unlawful importation into this country. As mentioned, the legislation before the House deals essentially with penalties under the Customs Act. I, too, am pleased that Mr Frank Mahony, a former senior Commonwealth public servant, is reviewing procedures at Sydney Airport under the Customs Act. It is my opinion that no government could have obtained the services of a more competent person to review the Customs Act. I served my articles of clerkship for two years to Mr Mahony when I worked in the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor's office. I know his ability and his breadth of vision. I wish him well in his inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> The penalties that mainly concern me are the penalties that, according to the speech of the former Minister, relate to the comings and goings of passengers at international airports. This is the area where most Australians and most tourists come into contact with our Customs officers. These officers have a great tradition of service to the community. They work long hours and get just as tired and cross as I am sure the passengers do. People are weary when they arrive in Australia after a long flight. My concern today is with one particular group of Australians of ethnic origin who go overseas, perhaps to Italy, Greece or Lebanon, and who stay for five or six months. They stay with relatives and during that visit speak any language other than English; perhaps they speak a dialect. On returning to Australia, they have forgotten their English. This is not uncommon. People tell me that they have been away for a while and have not spoken English. English is very difficult to pick up all of a sudden. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people came here after the war to build up this country and have done a marvellous job. Through no fault of their own, they have very little understanding of reading and writing English. Perhaps they read and write their own language but they have never mastered English. They may speak English well but these people read foreign newspapers here and they do not read English. I know that the Bureau of Customs makes some endeavour to cater for Australians who do not read English as a first language. I believe that much more effort is needed on the part of the Bureau of Customs to cater for the returning migrants. They comprise one of the biggest groups of people in our nation who are now travelling. These migrants are going home to visit, having made good in Australia or having saved up enough money to take themselves and their Australian born children to Italy, Lebanon, Yugoslavia and the many other countries from which people have come to enrich our nation.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately some of these people who return to Australia in the early hours of the morning become the court room fodder of the special Commonwealth courts of petty sessions in Sydney. They are often dragged before the courts for very petty offences. They are people who have led blameless lives, never having come under notice, and who because of some petty infringement or misdemeanour in relation to the Customs Act when they enter Australia are hauled before the courts. I feel that the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) and the Government of the day must take responsibility for this insensitive attitude towards Australians returning from overseas who inadvertently break one of the Customs regulations or transgress the Customs Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to two cases that I have been involved with. One concerned a man who really speaks no English. He was seriously injured at work and with his compensation he went back to Italy. On coming back to Australia he brought a number of silver and gold chains for his five daughters and his wife. Clearly from the statement of evidence he gave to the Customs officers he had to get the lady seated next to him on the plane to fill out the declaration form. He said: 'Just put a cross there against cigarettes'. He admitted he had cigarettes. He also had these chains and he did not try to hide them. he had them sewn into the lining of his clothes by his sister in Italy because he was frightened that they would be stolen. </PARA>
<PARA> This man was apprehended-this was the big catch-and dragged before the courts. He was a very sensitive fellow. He was appalled by what happened. The members of his family were all honest people. His daughters attended high school in my electorate. They were absolutely dismayed at his arrest and interrogation, which obviously went on for a long time basically because the man had no written English and perhaps also had no written Italian. I have a long four-page statement which was read over and over to him. Before I became the member for Lowe, fortunately Senator Mulvihill in another place made representations on this man's behalf and common sense prevailed. I do not believe he was eventually prosecuted but had representations of a political and parliamentary nature not been made this man would just have been another court statistic. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I will touch on concerns a sadder case, if that is at all possible. It concerns an Italian speaking constituent well known to me. Her husband was seriously injured at work in an accident and will never work again. In fact he cannot talk. The compensation proceedings took a long time and out of the compensation money this lady and her husband had the big return trip to Italy just to see their people. Coming back they knew there would be an eight- hour stopover in Rome to get the plane to Australia. This lady's old aunt of 75 years with whom she was staying packed some fruit, pears, artichokes and nuts. This lady did not even know they were in one of the bags. When she arrived in Sydney she was apprehended. I can only imagine the distress and shock she must have felt because she had in her care a husband who was totally incapable. The man can walk but he cannot talk or comprehend any situation. </PARA>
<PARA> This lady likewise was taken and interrogated. Whilst the Customs officers do their job there has to be some better system. I hope that Mr Frank Mahony, in his deliberations, can truly comprehend what is going on out there when people arrive early in the morning very tired, perhaps half asleep, and find that an elderly aunt in Italy has placed some fruits, nuts or other prohibited imports in the baggage. This lady was not as lucky as the constituent mentioned previously. She did not get to me quickly enough. She was proceeded against in the Court of Petty Sessions, in Sydney in a special court convened under the Customs Act and the Quarantine Act. She was a woman of blameless character who was well known in her area and who had never had a conviction. She was proceeded against, charged and convicted. This matter also gave me great concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Without delaying the House too much, I feel these matters should be brought to the attention of the Minister and of the Parliament because not all Australians who travel are in the jet set league. Many of them are ordinary people who have worked hard all their lives. Perhaps they have never been in an aeroplane because they came by ship many years ago and have totally forgotten the Customs and import regulations. Perhaps they are given certain information in Italy, Lebanon or some other country and believe this to be correct when in fact they have been misled. It is essential that the Customs Bureau also recognises that we have a multicultural society and that Australians who do not read English be catered for as well as Australians who read English. I trust that during the consideration of this legislation the House will bear these important matters in mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak to the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill I will make some particular comments about the information provided to passengers departing from Australia about Customs and quarantine matters. I will also comment on the form that incoming passengers, particularly aircraft passengers, are required to fill out. Firstly, I will make mention of the fact that the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) saw fit to make some comments on the so-called colour television affair in the course of his remarks on this Bill. I think that was unfortunate. I really do not believe that this Bill has anything to do with that affair. I think the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar ) did the decent and proper thing under the Westminister tradition of our parliamentary processes. I think they gained great standing in the community as a result of that. I do not think there is much mileage to gain by any honourable member in raising that issue again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendments we are dealing with relate largely to penalties for non- narcotics Customs offences. It has become necessary to increase those penalties largely as a result of the proceedings of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking where severe inadequacies in our system and in the Customs Act were highlighted, and the inadequacies that came to light in the meat substitution scandal when Australian horse and kangaroo meat was found in the United States of America. Perhaps it is just as well that those events occurred because they did prod the Government into taking a general review of the Customs Act into increasing penalties and otherwise tightening up controls over the loading and unloading of cargo, the licensing of depots for short term and interim holding of goods and other provisions which were obviously necessary . </PARA>
<PARA> The success of measures to counter illegal importation of Customs dutiable items and quarantinable items must always lie ultimately with the reliability of the person who is bringing in those goods. No amount of rigid and stringent regulations and, indeed, severe penalties can ever substitute for a willingness on behalf of individuals not to breach the regulations and the requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that by way of introduction to a discussion of some of the information provided to people coming into Australia. I believe that to some extent people are encouraged to hide items merely by the format of the declarations they are expected to fill out. The penalties for breaches are quite severe. They are up to five times the value of what was sought to be evaded. I think the term ' sought to be evaded' is important. It should be remembered that in many cases, as the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Maher) has just pointed out, there was no direct intention whatsoever to evade the law. I think a distinction needs to be made between a person who intentionally goes out to evade the law and a person who happens to commit a breach of the law through accidental incorporation of goods, ignorance, or, indeed, as the member for Lowe pointed out, because of a poor command of the English language. </PARA>
<PARA> I totally agree with the provision, as does the Opposition, that severe penalties should be introduced when offences strike at the very basis of Customs control. Such offences would include a ship's master failing to allow officers to board the ship. Likewise, they would include the pilot of an aircraft refusing officers permission to board or the entry of a ship or an aircraft into an unauthorised place where no Customs controls were applicable. Australia is a country with such a vast coastline and such large areas of relatively uninhabited country that it is very easy to evade Customs and quarantine requirements if a person wishes to do so. I must relay a story about what happened to me when I came through Customs in Brisbane not so long ago. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BJ7">Mr MacKENZIE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, this was in Brisbane, actually. Just for the point of the exercise I decided to look very carefully at what was required of incoming passengers when they filled out the pamphlet that was available. I took the pamphlet away with me so that I had the benefit of some weeks in which to be able to examine it. Firstly, if one wishes to follow the instructions for filling out the form to the absolute limit one should wind up ticking most boxes . For example, I looked at that section which dealt with prohibited imports of animal products or products made from, I think reptile skins. It could have been the section which refers to endangered species. I think it was that provision. I looked at it and said: 'No, that does not affect me at all. Of course, I do not have animals skins or items made from endangered species'. But when I looked and saw that snakes were included I realised that I had bought a snake skin belt. Being an honest and reputable citizen I declared the snake skin belt which, of course, I could have brought in Australia. It was not too much of a belt because it has since fallen to bits, but I declared that. I declared the fact that I had a packet of biscuits in my pocket that I had picked up on the aircraft. Also, I had bought a small packet of candies for one of the children and I declared that as well, as one would have to if one were following the requirements to the exact letter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out that on almost any overseas trip, unless a person spends 100 per cent of his time in cities, it is inevitable that he will come into contact with agricultural areas. Even if a person drives out of a city for a period and walks into a paddock he has, strictly speaking, been on a farm or in contact with farm animals. I believe that to some extent, if people read the requirements exactly to the letter, many of them are deterred from declaring exactly what they have and where they have been. It might be worth while for the Department of Industry and Commerce to consider including in the information handbook that is handed out, particularly on departure, instructions saying: 'We expect you to have those goods that you think may be doubtful and may be required to be declared available in your cabin baggage or in a particular suitcase so that there is no delay'. The Department could encourage people to declare the goods they have. That would not be so that they could be penalised for declaring the goods but simply so that the Customs and quarantine people could make an immediate assessment of whether the goods were dutiable or whether they came within the provisions of quarantine requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> I noticed with interest that one passenger on the flight I was coming in on said that he always handled the situation by writing an exhaustive list of everything he had purchased, handing it to the Customs person and saying: 'You sort it out'. That list could be two or three pages long and could include four or five tee-shirts, fancy biros, toys and all the other paraphernalia he had bought on the trip. I understand that he has been doing that for years. The Customs and quarantine officers have the onus placed on them of determining whether, in fact, the goods are quarantinable or dutiable. In most cases they take one look and send this person through. I think the Department has some opportunity to make the information available for departing passengers a little clearer in order to encourage them to say what they have rather than really providing an opportunity for them too easily just to cross the no box or whatever, as the case may be, which I think is what is generally done. There are many instances when people do have material that should be declared. In most cases that material will be passed on the spot by the officers concerned. The measures contained within this Bill are sensible. I understand that they have the support of the Opposition. I trust that they will have the support of the Senate. I see little room for contention on these measures. Perhaps they are somewhat overdue. I welcome this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been mentioned by honourable members in the course of the debate, the Customs and Excise Amendment Bill which is very important legislation was introduced into the Parliament by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). I feel, as this is my first comment on this Bill in the Parliament, that I would be quite remiss if I did not pay a tribute to the honourable member for Ryan for the manner in which he performed his ministerial duties from the day he was appointed until the day he resigned. I think it is very much to the credit of the honourable member for Ryan and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) that, as my colleague the honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie) said, they have gained in stature out of an incident which I think was genuinely regretted by many people all around Australia and from all sides of politics. The honourable member for Ryan earned for himself as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs an enviable reputation within the ranks of his Department. I witnessed him at meetings of the Standing Committee of Ministers for Consumer Affairs. His presentations were always excellent. I must say, as this is the first opportunity for me to speak virtually as his successor, for the reasons which I will indicate in a moment that I believe the Parliament of this country is very much in the debt of the honourable member for Ryan for the manner in which he conducted his ministerial duties from the day he started until the day he resigned.

<PARA> The legislation is, as the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) correctly said, very significant. On a bipartisan basis I congratulate the honourable member for Parramatta for the way in which he made his contribution in the debate. I disagree with some matters that he raised but I will endeavour to respond on exactly the same non-personal basis as the honourable member for Parramatta. I think it is wrong for the honourable member for Parramatta, speaking on behalf of the Opposition, to state that the necessity to introduce this Bill indicates inefficiency. I have to say that in the short weeks that I have been involved with the increased functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce and, in particular, the duties formerly undertaken by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs specifically relating to Customs, I have been hard pressed to find any of the inefficiency to which the honourable member referred. I will be the first to concede that the legislation is indeed very complex. Perhaps, next to the Income Tax Assessment Act, it is the most technical and difficult piece of legislation on the statute book of the Commonwealth of Australia. But as my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) in his excellent address this afternoon remarked, this legislation- -</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Would the honourable member stick to uranium and let me stick to Customs? The situation is that the legislation has been here since 1901. I put it to the honourable member for Parramatta that what we are doing at the moment is part of an ongoing review of the provisions of the Customs Act in the course of which a large proportion of the Act has been comprehensively reviewed and more sections are to be reviewed further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Parramatta again tried to create an impression that there is massive discontent within the ranks of the Customs officers. Whilst one would concede that a small section of Customs officers have demonstrated discontent, I have to say that I have been tremendously impressed by the lack of discontent amongst the Customs officers from senior levels right down through the ranks in the weeks that I have been involved with this ministry. Only last week, the honourable member will be interested to know, something unique, and something which has brought to fruition one of the amendments which we will be dealing with in the Committee stage, occurred involving the consideration of decisions under section 40AA of the Customs Act by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Discussions came about as the result of private enterprise, namely the duty free shop operators, meeting with the departmental officers in a discussion which ranged extensively over the whole area. I was privileged to chair the meeting. I am positively delighted, without pre-empting the amendment, that we have now what I would call a new regime in that certain areas where there may have been misunderstanding, where there may have been some unhappiness between the private sector and the Department, is very quickly being ironed out by the simple process of negotiation and consultation. I put to the honourable member also that it is not exactly helpful to anybody, including the Australian Labor Party, for him to refer to inefficiency and discontent at a time when he knows, or ought to know, that a totally new regime for the administration of Customs in Australia is now being put into place. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) confirms the United States Naval Communication Station Agreement 1963 as amended as an important element in the bilateral relationship between Australia and the United States contributing to the fulfilment of our obligations under the security treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America of 29 April 1952;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) confirms that this Agreement advances the security of Australia and of the Western alliance and that it contributes significantly to general Western defence efforts;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) asserts that no impediment should be placed on the use and operation of the base to meet the stated needs and requirements of the treaty partners; and recognises that free and uninhibited access to the facilities of the base by the treaty partners is essential to its effective use as a vital element in the Western deterrent especially in enabling the United States to maintain an adequate nuclear deterrent against the nuclear threat from the Soviet Union;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) agrees that the present consultative arrangements between Australia and the United States relating to the joint operations of North West Cape be preserved and recognises that those arrangements are fully adequate to meet the needs of the treaty partners;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) asserts that no impediment should be placed by either party on access to the facilities of the base in relation to the use of the base by the other party , and</PARA>
<PARA> (6) agrees that Article 6 of the United States Naval Communication Station Agreement 1963, which reads: 'The Australian Government will, jointly with the Government of the State of Western Australia, appoint a Civil Commissioner at Exmouth, who will have such functions as those Governments may vest in him and will represent them in such matters as they may determine.'</PARA>
<PARA> shall henceforth be excluded from the Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) for granting me leave to introduce this motion. On a successive number of occasions the House generally has had an opportunity to discuss the operation and continuity of what is one of the most critical of the defence arrangements between the United States and Australia, one that has had an effect way beyond that bilateral relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> Twenty years ago, on 17 May 1962, the then Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, told this House that the Government of the United States had formally requested permission to establish and operate a naval communications station at North West Cape in Western Australia. The Commomwealth approved this request. It had the agreement of the Government of Western Australia which had given considerable assistance and had expressed its desire to co-operate in the project to the fullest possible extent. Prime Minister Menzies told the House that the question of the establishment of the station would be embodied in a formal agreement between the governments of Australia and the United States. He pointed out very astutely that the establishment of this station in Australia would mark an important step in defence co-operation between our two countries. He observed that it would make a highly significant contribution to the general allied military capability in our area within the spirit of co-operation envisaged in the ANZUS Treaty, under which the parties agreed to co-ordinate their defence for the preservation of peace and security. </PARA>
<PARA> Twelve months later on 9 May 1963 the then Minister for External Affairs and Attorney-General, Sir Garfield Barwick, presented the United States Naval Communication Station Agreement Bill to this House. He announced that on that morning he and the American Ambassador, Mr William Battle, had signed an agreement for the station on behalf of their respective governments. The government of the day had decided to submit the agreement to the Parliament for approval before exchanging its instrument of approval with the Government of the United States. Under the Agreement, the Australian Government permitted the American Government to establish, maintain and operate a naval communication station at North West Cape for a minimum period of 25 years. The station was to be a United States communication station under the control of the United States Government. The station was to have no capability other than to transmit and receive messages but it was to provide a very important link in communications with naval vessels in the oceans and seas around and adjacent to Australia and to the south and South East Asia. As Sir Garfield told the House:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the deterrence of aggression in those parts of the world of greatest immediate significance to Australia, namely, the Western Pacific region and South East Asia-stretching from the Soviet Far East southwards through Korea and the islands of the east coast of Asia and westwards into South East Asia-depends to a great extent upon the capacity of the United States Navy to react against aggression. </PARA>
<PARA>The government of the day foresaw that changing technology demanded the capabilities which the station at North West Cape would provide. From the outset the communication station at North West Cape was seen as reflecting the spirit of the ANZUS Treaty. Under Article II of that Treaty the parties agree separately and jointly to develop their individual and collective capacity to resist attack. The North West Cape Agreement enabled two of the partners- Australia and the United States-to meet their joint responsibilities in this pact. With improved communication facilities the United States was able better to play its part in maintaining the peace and security of the world generally and in our region in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, by providing the site and agreeing to the establishment, maintenance , and operation in Australia of the communication station also made a significant contribution to the mutual purposes of the ANZUS pact and to peace and security generally. Further, Australian forces were to have the use of the facilities of the station for training and this enabled us to be better prepared to meet our obligations under ANZUS. In introducing the agreement in this House, Sir Garfield Barwick stressed seven broad principles which the two governments had recognised in the course of their negotiations. They were: Firstly, that the agreement and the obligations it creates should respect the sovereignty of each; secondly, that the control of the station should rest with the United States; thirdly, that when desired by either there should be consultation between the two governments as to matters connected with the station and its use; fourthly, that the Australian armed forces should have the use of the communication services of the station; fifthly, that the Australian Government should not seek to make a revenue profit out of the American establishment, maintenance, or operation of the station and that, where possible, it should assist to minimise the cost of the station to the American Government; sixthly, that in the establishment, operation and maintenance of the station, the maximum practicable use of Australian resources should be made; and seventhly, that, without submitting to the jurisdiction of Australian courts, or compromising its sovereignty, the United States would conform to Australian law and its personnel would observe it. The Agreement carried out these principles and, with some necessary modifications to meet changing circumstances over the ensuing two decades, the principles have persisted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Agreement entered into force on 28 June 1963. On 16 September 1967 the station was commissioned as United States Naval Communication Station North West Cape. It was later renamed the Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt. Up to 1974 Australia's participation was predominantly in the provision of the site. The station was an American facility available for use by our forces but over which at that stage we had no control. </PARA>
<PARA> On 10 January 1974 the then Minister for Defence, Mr Barnard, and the United States Secretary of Defense, Dr Schlesinger, issued a joint communique which announced their agreement that the station at North West Cape would be operated as a joint facility. The communique also announced that the United States had agreed to keep Australia informed of strategic and operational developments of relevance to the station. The Minister and the Secretary noted that strategic and political consultations between the two governments were already well established through bilateral contacts in the ANZUS forums. However, they agreed :</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to extend and strengthen their bilateral consultations to ensure that the Australian Government would have full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to the station and their significance for Australian national interests. </PARA>
<PARA>They agreed further that, with the use of the station as a joint facility and consistent with the agreement of May 1963 on the establishment of the station, Australia's servicemen would participate in the management and operation of the facility. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, on 21 March 1974, an exchange of notes was concluded between Australia and the United States to amend the agreement of 9 May 1963. The exchange of notes provided for amendments to Article 1, Article 2 and Article 14 of the Agreement. The amendment to Article 1 provided that the station would henceforth be operated jointly and the amendment to Article 2 limited the United States Navy exclusive occupation of the station to a national room. The amendment to Article 14 provided that the Australian Government would meet costs directly associated with the presence of the Royal Australian Navy at the station. Since 1974 there have been regular consultations between Australian and United States defence officials in fulfilment of the obligation then accepted by Dr Schlesinger. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic principles of the North West Cape Agreement still stand. However, as a result of recent consultations between the partners, Article 6 can now be deleted. Article 6 provides that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government will, jointly with the Government of the State of Western Australia, appoint a Civil Commissioner at Exmouth, who will have such functions as those Governments may vest in him and will represent them in such matters as they may determine. </PARA>
<PARA>The position of Civil Commissioner at Exmouth should be abolished as it is no longer required. The role of the Civil Commissioner provided under the Agreement was to assist the United States Navy in arranging the provision of Commonwealth and State government services to the naval communication station and the associated community when the station was being established. Since the election of a local council in Exmouth in 1978, however, the Civil Commissioner has not been involved in State or local government matters affecting Exmouth and he has not performed any duties there on behalf of any Commonwealth agencies or departments other then the Department of Defence. Both the Exmouth Shire Council and the Western Australian Government want the position abolished. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, following a recent review of security arrangements at North West Cape, the Civil Commissioner's residual responsibilities as officer-in-charge of the prohibited area were transferred to the Australian Deputy Commander at the station. The Government of Western Australia and the United States Government concur with the proposal to abolish the position and in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs agreement has been reached with the United States on the text of the necessary exchange of notes. It is therefore appropriate in advising the House of the deletion of Article 6 that this House re-states the relationship between Australia and the United States in the broader function and use of the North West Cape facility. It is for this reason that I introduced this motion into the House this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 May 1981, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) raised in this House two demands for renegotiation of the North West Cape Naval Communication Station Agreement required by his party. These were demands he first stated when he spoke to the National Press Club on 14 April 1981. The demands were, firstly, that Australia's consent be mandatory for all orders to initiate military action which flow from the station and, secondly, that firm and convincing assurances be given that the station will not be used to send orders for a first strike nuclear attack or to initiate a limited strike. As I have set out in the motion now before the House, the Government believes those conditions would be totally unacceptable to the Americans and that they would frustrate the continuation of the Agreement in the manner necessary to preserve Australia's situation and to advance Australia's security. We believe the existing consultative procedures should be maintained and not extended. We believe under the existing consultative procedures the facility can continue to be effectively used in support of Australia's interests and indeed the interests of security in this part of the world. To modify the Agreement to give Australia a veto of United States orders in the manner suggested by the Leader of the Opposition would without doubt frustrate the purpose of the base as now envisaged. Certainly such a veto given to the United States over Australian orders emanating from the station to Australian ships or aircraft would not be acceptable to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The base is a communications facility. Its use facilitates the United States' military presence in our region with all the deterrent capability that that represents. The continued importance of this deterrent is apparent when taking into account the increasing Soviet presence in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and in Vietnam. To the north of the Indian Ocean, Soviet aggression in Afghanistan can be seen only as a potential threat to other countries in our region. </PARA>
<PARA> In Vietnam the increasing Soviet military and economic presence is a matter of concern not just to Australia but to all the countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations and indeed was canvassed with me over the course of the last few weeks. There have been noticeable increases in the transit and stationing of Soviet ships and aircraft, both numerically and in capability, through Cam Ranh Bay and Da Nang. This comes without any new factor to provoke that Soviet military build-up. </PARA>
<PARA> In the free world only the United States has the capability and national resource necessary to provide an adequate deterrent to Soviet military expansionism. No impediment should be placed on the use and operation of the base to meet the stated needs and requirements of the Treaty partners. Free and uninhibited access to the facilities of the base by the Treaty partners is essential to its effective use as a vital element in the Western deterrent. Any impediment placed by either party to access to the facilities of the base in relation to its use by either party cannot be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> The North West Cape is of major importance in the United States' military presence in this region. It provides a communication capability important in the command function between elements of the United States forces. The Government rejects the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition for renegotiation of the North West Cape Naval Communication Agreement in the manner he then proposed. It believes the existing consultative procedures adequate and appropriate. They cannot be amended without prejudicing the purpose of the base itself and inhibiting the maintenance of an adequate Western deterrent in our region. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

I am amazed to think that the whole Parliament has been keyed up for some massive statement that is going to affect the alliance between America and Australia when really all that is happening is that, because the local council at Exmouth took over the area in 1978, four years ago, rushed into this Parliament is an extraordinary motion to say that we are going to delete Article 6 because there is no Civil Commissioner there any longer.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, just give us a chance to talk about it; it was a pretty rushed arrangement. Let us look at what has actually happened. The significant thing is that the Agreement was entered into in 1963. The relevant part of that Agreement is Article 3. We agree with the motion because it is subject to Article 3, which quite fairly says that, except with the express consent of the Australian Government, the station will not be used for purposes other than purposes of defence communication. It is as simple as that. So the proviso overrides the whole lot. My colleague the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) is in the House. I welcome his presence. Whilst the Minister today was anxious to tell us about the way in which Sir Garfield Barwick introduced the matter to the House in 1963, he did not say-it took my colleague the honourable member for St George to ascertain this in 1973-that at the same time as this Agreement was tabled in the House there was correspondence between him and Mr Battle, who was then the United States Ambassador, which he never disclosed to the House or to the nation. The correspondence virtually says: 'Never mind what Article 3 says when it says that we require your consent. We will read it on the basis that we need only consult'. As my colleague has said, that was the darkest day for Australia in its endeavour to retain sovereignty over its own land. Is it not despicable that even today the Minister could not advert to the fact that the correspondence has not yet been tabled and that it took my colleague, when Minister, to disclose that matter?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us also be mindful of the fact that in January 1974 when our Defence Minister Barnard discussed the matter with Schlesinger fair and proper arrangements for the base were made. If we look at what Barnard said when he looked at the base, we see that Australia had only one representative-a member of the Navy-at the North West Cape base. As a result of Barnard's proper and intelligent work and with the clear understanding and co-operation of the United States, because its people are intelligent, it became a joint facility. We should bear in mind that in those days-in the days of Sir Robert Menzies and others-members of the Opposition were excluded from even a chance to visit the base. I welcome the Leader of the House (Sir James Killen) here today. I applaud him because, when we asked him whether we could go to the base, he readily granted us permission to do so. We found the base to be working quite satisfactorily in a number of ways. The point that ought to be emphasised is that the base is a communications facility. Is it not important, in looking at Article 3, to understand what we are giving consent to? Our personnel have access to that base. We are able to co-operate very effectively because our submarines use the base. That is an intelligent position for us to adopt concerning our own communications. Our personnel there can readily say: ' Naturally, we don't understand each others' signals, nor should we'. That alerted my leader and me. I take the same responsibility as my leader for saying : 'That is a little unusual, is it not? We are given to understand that the base is to be used only for defence communications. Would you know whether a signal went through placing the base on alert'-apparently that happened on one occasion and nobody was told-'and if a signal went through that might initiate military action which would make the base automatically a target for a nuclear attack would you know what it was?' They said: 'No. We are not in a position'. My leader, quite properly, said something that does not in any way weaken our position when he said: 'We would like to see the position put on a sensible basis by way of renegotiation, saying that our consent is mandatory for all orders to initiate military action and that we will be given firm and convincing assurances that the station will not be used to send orders for a first strike or to initiate a limited strike'. What is wrong with that for Australia and an Australian Prime Minister? Would the Government not like to know that a country is going to war? Would it tell the Australian people that it did not want to know? The concept we believe in would be a great achievement in nuclear disarmament. Australia should adhere strictly to deterrents and deterrents only. That is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> The Vietnam war got a mention. We should bear in mind that this situation arose at the time of the Vietnam war. I am delighted to know that the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) can now go to China and shake the hands of its leaders, welcoming them as friends. But from 1960 to 1963, the period about which we are talking, it was the downward thrust of China that Australia was worried about. Conscription was introduced, leaving 496 dead in Vietnam, because of that downward thrust. The base is important, from the point of view of confrontation in South-East Asia. Mention is made in the statement of Asia and its problems. Were there not problems? How about the Indonesian confrontation? How about the fact that when Barwick was in the United States urging some support from Dean Rusk it was made very clear to him that we would be on our own in such matters and that the Indonesian confrontation was a matter for us? Dean Rusk was obviously acting in accordance with instructions. I think he thought at the time that he may have been able to help us, but President Kennedy said: 'No, that is not the issue. The United States is a super power. It is very concerned about the world. We are not going to get involved in these local issues'. Barwick was very disappointed with that position. He will refer to it in his memoirs when he writes them. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the Government carry on with this stupid nonsense of always trying to mortgage the American alliance for its own political advantage? Why does it want to dress up every American sailor with instructions around his neck on how to vote Liberal? Does it want to portray the Americans outside every polling booth? Let me make it clear that the recent visit by an American warship followed a special invitation to it by the Prime Minister to visit four ports-Brisbane, Tasmania, Melbourne and Sydney-in the hope that there would be confrontation. How stupid it is of this Government to think that it will ever lead the nation if it is always dividing it. All we are talking about is the fact that the Exmouth Council took over the North West Cape area in 1978. We welcome that move . We think that it is the best thing that ever happened. I hope it keeps the streets clean and the rates down. That is its important function. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be understood. We have no objection to the Government's position but we put on record the disgraceful manner in which this matter was handled in the 1960s under another government of the same Liberal philosophy. It is deplorable that the Prime Minister wants to use the alliance for his own political gain. We will not accept that to any degree. I wish to place on record the Australian Labor Party's policy. It has been our policy for a long while. Our policies are formulated by fellow Australians who have no personal ambitions always to be in this Parliament. They are anxious to preserve this nation as a free and independent sovereign nation at peace. They respect the alliance. They know very well that in the Second World War Australians were fighting for their lives because Australia was a very valid ally of the United States. I have before me a cable from President Roosevelt to Prime Minister Curtin in July 1942 stating that Roosevelt thought it would be helpful if Curtin agreed with Prime Minister Churchill and did not want the return of the Ninth Division from the Middle East . He said that it was important to keep the Ninth Division in the Middle East because the United States wanted to win the war in the Middle East first and come and get Australia later. That did not appeal to Curtin at the time and I do not think it appealed to anybody in Australia. The President of the United States had this to say: 'I would like to remind you, Mr Prime Minister, that I have given you one of our best generals to defend you'. Curtin said: 'Thank you very much, Mr President. You have given us a great general. But could I remind you that of the 10 divisions under his control eight are Australian?'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should have a good look at the number. Does he not know? Perhaps the honourable member is a little behind the times. I suggest that he have a look at the number of people who were mobilised at that time. He should consider the fact that Australia had the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Divisions. Let us be very clear about those in Australia-what we would call the militia-who were also involved. But let us not get too carried away. The point I was making related to the independence of our sovereignty, which is established by formulating policy from fellow Australians, such as the honourable members present. We should be proud of our country and its record and not subservient and servile to another country. The Americans do not respect that anyway. They welcome people who have some initiative and some courage. I spoke to Stoessel in the United States in 1981. I said to him: 'Would you have any objection to our having an appropriate officer in Washington who could be informed of your strategic policy so that there would be no doubt about the sorts of messages that went through the North West Cape base?'. He replied: 'I have no objection at all'. That is an intelligent thing to do, is it not? Naturally the United States wants to see us co-operating with it. It is important for Australians to learn to use the facilities at the North West Cape and to understand that in no way would they affect our sovereignty or involve us in a war without our consent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy is as follows: We want the base to be operated without any derogation of our sovereignty. We would like the Australian public to be informed of the general purposes and functions of the base. We want to ensure that the Australian Government is kept informed at the highest level of any changes in the strategic planning or policies of the United States which could in any way affect the nature of the base or the uses to which it would be put. We want also to ensure that the Australian Government has an opportunity to contribute to such strategic planning or policies as they evolve. Further, we wish to ensure that Australian personnel are fully involved in all aspects of the base's operations and have the relevant technical expertise to be so involved. I am delighted to note that that is made clear in the motion now before the House. Clause (5) of the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that no impediment should be placed by either party on access to the facilities of the base in relation to the use of the base by the other party, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That means that our personnel now have access to all the base, which is an improvement. That is fine. They have not had that access up to the present. There have been one or two rooms that they should not go into, but now they will have access to the lot. That is an impressive improvement. It accords with the principle of being fully involved and able to participate. I am certain that the Americans are delighted to know that that is the position. We welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the point: It would be rather futile for the Opposition to argue for the retention of the Civil Commissioner at Exmouth when his position was abolished four years ago. I cannot see how the Opposition would win any arguments about that. That is the whole extent of this motion and we warmly support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all welcome the fact that the Opposition has joined with us on this motion but thereafter there is a considerable difference of opinion as to where we should be going in this country. We have been listening to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). Some of the old questions have come up. He talks about sovereignty as though we were not sovereign in this country. We are sovereign. We can tell the Americans that we do not want the alliance. We can tell them to pack up and go home. We can tell them that we are not going to have them at the north west communications station in any circumstances at all, or we can impose circumstances and conditions on them that are such that they will never be accepted. This will mean the same thing and will amount to the same thing. It will mean that the Americans will go home. That is something which elements of the Australian Labor Party want. There is no doubt about that. Anybody who bothers to read the conference transcript of the ALP gets that message loud and clear. So that is the first thing that we can do. Let us make up our minds as to whether we are in or out of this alliance. If we are in this alliance let us make up our minds that we are going to stay in it . Alliances involve responsibilities and risks. So far as one can determine what does the ALP want? We must understand that it might never get around to understanding anything about foreign policy. If honourable members had listened to what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) had to say some few weeks ago they would have been perfectly staggered at the reversal which was seized upon by his loyal colleague the honourable member of Wills (Mr Hawke) as the basis for a little bit of a power struggle. He apparently completely misunderstood American policy which has been in place for years about the visit of nuclear- powered and nuclear-armed ships to friendly countries. Having been instructed on the subject he agreed that he was in error.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us return to the question of the base. Back in 1974 Mr Barnard made some inquiries. Let us remind ourselves of the answer that was given to Mr Barnard back in 1974. This appears in part of an interview with the Leader of the Opposition. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department's views of North West Cape were given in 1974 to Mr Lance Barnard, the Defence Minister in the Whitlam Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Department's view is this:</PARA>
<PARA> We have told the Ambassador in Washington that Australia might seek an undertaking from the United States not to use the North West Cape Station to transmit a nuclear firing order. It is unlikely that the United States would give such an undertaking given the importance to it of swift and secure communications with its nuclear ballistic submarines as part of its second strike capacity. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing has changed and the world is not a better place now than it was then. The report went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Second, it would be impractical to verify compliance with an undertaking; and third, to demand an undertaking is, in important respects, undesirable. It would manifest indifference to the United States requirements with its nuclear strategy and to the common defence interest expressed in the ANZUS treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the position then. No doubt it is the position now. All of us would have a sense of horror at any thought of the use of nuclear arms. It is something with which we must live as a possibility no matter how remote and no matter how potentially disastrous. We can make a decision here as to whether we want a special deal for this country which, no doubt, the Americans do not give to any of their other allies. We can make a decision as to whether we are going to have a foreign policy without risks and a defence policy without risks. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the risks that are taken by some of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation allies, we see that the only risk we would seem to take is the risk that one station may be targeted whereas their entire countries are targeted in the dreadful event that there may be a war. What a cowardly approach to life that is. For those members of the ALP who constantly say, as the Leader of the Opposition has said on various occasions, that the ANZUS alliance is a one-way road and only a few people get any benefit out of it, let me just remind them of what their leader said at his conference. This was an answer to the proposition that the ANZUS treaty should be wiped. Of course he had to spring to the defence of the ANZUS treaty since he realised the ALP had nothing to put in its place. Indeed, he said so himself. He stated-this is the argument we always get: 'The Americans are picking up all the benefits and we have been paying just about all the premiums, but that can be changed'. Let me quote what he had to say on the subject of premiums and our picking them all up. When he was arguing against the wiping of the treaty he said: 'You do that and you will find an increasingly terrified community which wants a vastly increased spending on armaments-perhaps not wise, perhaps not well informed but an inevitable consequence of that historical sense of insecurity and vulnerability which has always assailed this nation right from its foundation day.' That is no doubt the case. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members by their actions slowly erode the base of the treaty they will find one of these days that we are going to have to face up to spending very much more money on defence than we have in the past when we have managed our defence on the cheap, thanks to the ANZUS alliance. I welcome what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said on the subject of the motion. Had he confined himself to the motion it would have been unnecessary to say anything else. Since as usual he decided to traverse the countryside putting forward the old regurgitated views which the ALP has been peddling around for the last 15 or 20 years, and which have never been accepted by this country, it has been necessary to say something about those views. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the period that I have been in this House and listened to debates in this chamber I have heard a lot of phoney debates, a lot of phoney sentiments and some straight out phoneys. This is a phoney debate. It has nothing to do with the security and defence of Australia. It has nothing to do with any suggestion that the defence or the security of Australia is threatened. In fact, the resolution authorises the discontinuance of a civil commissioner to run a community which has had a town council for four years, and a very effective town council if I may say so. Many of our colleagues visited there recently and so did the Minister. This debate is one of those stage- setting debates in which this Government and its predecessors have regularly engaged. They have used the rhetoric of traitor, treason, lack of integrity, threat to Australia's security and threat to Australia's alliances. Those of us who contested the election in 1966 remember the visible lie on which the Government of that day was re-elected.

<PARA> What does this motion do other than bring about a debate in this House in which the Government feels it may be able to do some scene setting for a possible early election? The Government knows it will have to have an early election because of the incompetence of its management of the economy, its repeated policy failures and its self-admission of those failures in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) less than two days ago. That Speech acknowledged that one Australian in 30 who is now working will not be working next year. No wonder the Government wants to debate and to devote the next three hours of the sittings of this House to a motion which achieves the discontinuance of a requirement to appoint a civil commissioner to run the civil community at North West Cape. What sort of priorities does a government have that would engage in that sort of activity? They are phoney priorities, as the priorities of this Government always have been. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wants an issue with which he can frighten and divide the Australian nation. That has always been and always will be his type of politics.

If we are concerned and want to talk about the defence of Australia, honourable members opposite might ask the Government why real spending on actual defence has been significantly reduced in the Budget presented on Tuesday night. There is a 3 per cent drop, on the amount allocated one year ago, for the benefit of those members opposite, in the defence budget available for purposes other than to pay wages. No wonder the Government wants to divert attention. It is running out on its responsibilities in the defence area. In the equipment areas, the most critical and vital necessities of defence, it underspent by something like $200m last year. The Government appropriated moneys last year which it did not spend and actually reduced the rate of defence expenditure by deferring other items of expenditure which will have to be paid for at much higher rates at a later time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This motion is in the Parliament tonight not because there is any suggestion that the agreement with the United States is under threat, or because the Government wants to renegotiate that agreement or in any way alter that agreement other than to abolish the position of civil commissioner. It is in this Parliament for one reason and one reason only: The Government cannot find anything it can credibly talk about which has real substance and which should be before the national Parliament. The Government is devoid of ideas, lacks integrity and is incompetent in its administration of the financial affairs of this Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Why would the Government want to debate the real issues of the nation? It cannot credibly do so. The Prime Minister squirms every time unemployment is mentioned. What this phoney, meaningless motion does could have been done by Executive action, and it has been done by Executive action. We will have more of these phoney motions if this parliamentary session continues much longer. We will have more of them because we have a phoney government which is incapable of tackling the real problems of Australia, which is trying to tell the people of Australia that it has changed its policies, and which even tells the people of Australia that it is actually interested in the defence of Australia. Let me say this about defence: Throughout the 1930s statements like this were made by people on the other side of the Parliament. Throughout the 1930s they told us that we could depend on our allies. I do not in any way doubt the integrity of our allies, then or now. I say that absolutely. I know that statement will be misrepresented later because that is the way this Government works. In the 1930s the defence policy of the Australia Government was that the Royal Navy would protect Australia no matter what. The defence policy of this Government was mentioned quite intelligently by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). The present and past defence policies of this Government have been that we can afford to neglect real defence as long as we maintain the rhetoric!</PARA>

We have an obligation to plan on this basis. If that costs more, so be it. If we are not prepared to accept that, we must accept that we are prepared to neglect the defence of this country. Anyone who seeks to substitute defence by someone else for defence by ourselves is fooling themselves or is deliberately seeking to fool the Australian people. This Government has for some time been trying to fool the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are no commitments under the ANZUS treaty to the defence of Australia. There is a commitment which is qualified by a statement in respect of the constitutional processes. One would hope that the Australian Government has exactly the same qualifications. It is reasonable for any sovereign nation to reserve its right to make decisions on its own behalf. Australians would expect that any government of this country would have that entitlement; we are absolutely certain that the Government of the United States reserves that right. If it did not it would be thrown out of office because Americans believe in America. It is a pity more Australians do not believe in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> We have a motion before us which is a stage setter designed to try to find some issue which can be exploited by a desperate government led by a desperate Prime Minister in order to justify an election for which he does not have to answer for the stewardship of himself or his Government to the Australian nation. The Government has failed and it will continue to fail. Its credibility in Australia and its capacity to lead this nation cannot be taken seriously by any person who realises what it is trying to perpetrate in this phoney motion.

Let me refer to Mr Cain, the Victorian Premier, because it is now known that he consulted the Leader of the Opposition about his proposed ban on nuclear ships in Victorian ports before the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was told of the plan.

The socialist left wants to repudiate the ANZUS alliance. The Leader of the Opposition and Mr Cain got together before Mr Cain made his statements about United States ships visiting Australian ports. The North West Cape is a naval communications facility which is important to the defence of Australia, the Western alliance, the United States and the free world. It is a communications station that communicates messages to submarines of both the United States Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. It is important for Australia's communications with its submarines and for United States communications with its submarines.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This reference motion marks another stage in the Government's implementation of a co-ordinated set of public works procedures. These were announced by my predecessor, Mr McVeigh, in May 1981 when he responded to a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure concerning alternative delivery systems for Commonwealth public works. As part of these procedures the Public Works Committee Act was amended on 9 April 1981 to make the major public works of most Commonwealth statutory and other authorities subject to review by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and their commencement subject to the agreement of this House. This is the first such proposal by an authority to be referred to the Committee and comprises building works and associated engineering services to establish a new engineering training centre for Telecom Australia on a site in Cashel Street, Pasadena. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I was pointing out to the House that the Opposition, in saying that it would vote for this motion concerning the United States of America's Naval Communication Station at North West Cape, was in fact hiding its real attitude to the North West Cape facility, that in fact it is trying to put a smoke-screen over the Opposition's real position and that in fact there is substantial disagreement in the Australian Labor Party about the North West Cape facility. Today we heard in this House a statement from the Opposition which pulled the rug from under the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) made no reference whatsoever to the Labor Party's policy in relation to North West Cape. Labor Party speakers-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in particular-have failed to repeat what the Leader of the Opposition said at the National Press Club in, I think, April 1981 and what the Leader of the Opposition repeated in this chamber on 5 May 1981.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must confess that it is a tremendous challenge to follow the brilliance of argument and the eloquence of presentation of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton). This evening I want to allay some of his concerns and fears before he obviously has a heart attack. Tonight we are debating a proposition that has been put forward by the Government. To make the point very clear I will take point (1) of the motion put forward by the Government. That point is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) confirms the United States Naval Communications Station Agreement 1963-</PARA>
<PARA>I underline this-</PARA>
<PARA> as amended. . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the details that were given by the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) in his speech he pointed out that the 1963 Act was amended. It was amended by the Australian Labor Party in Government. What this Government is doing today is really asking the Parliament, including both the Government and the Opposition, to reaffirm an agreement that was renegotiated by the Labor Party in government. Then, through this absurdity the Government asks why the Opposition is supporting the proposition. Of course, we are supporting the proposition because the Parliament is being asked to reaffirm the agreement that was renegotiated by the Labour Government. Can I get that through the heads of the Government members this day?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6M7">Mr MORRISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rather doubt that, as the honourable member for Wills suggests. Is there anything very extraordinary about the fact that the Labor Party is accepting a proposition that is put up by the Government to reaffirm what the Labor Party stood for and renegotiated? That is the crux of the issue. Tonight I think this Government should be condemned. It is demeaning and making a mockery not only of this Parliament but also of the alliance with the United States. It is a shoddy, despicable tactic. It is a tawdry gimmick. I am sure that it is a matter of great embarrassment to the United States to be used as a gambit in the desperate efforts by the Fraser Government to manipulate an election before the Budget, which it brought down two days ago, falls apart. Tonight we are talking about this Government and the new Minister for Defence. I am sure that the former Minister for Defence would not have subjected this Parliament to this humiliation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are we discussing tonight? We have already said-why should we not say it- that we are reaffirming a negotiated treaty that the Labor Party put through. What is this big, momentous amendment that is being brought forward tonight?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6M7">Mr MORRISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an absolute phoney, as my colleague the honourable member for Corio points out. All we are really doing tonight is accepting a proposition so that the Article in the Agreement which concerns the appointment of the Civil Commissioner at Exmouth is deleted. Of course, it should be deleted. But it should have been deleted four years ago because, as any Western Australian member in the Government knows, there was an election of a local council for the district of Exmouth in which the North West Cape is located. So, the notion of a civil commissioner is no longer relevant. Here is this great momentous decision with which the Minister for Defence walks in tonight. I am sure that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is listening, hoping against hope, that he will develop a trigger for his election which he sorely needs. All we are saying is that a position which was incorporated in 1963, which was still relevant in 1974 when we re-negotiated the treaty, is no longer relevant because of the election in Western Australia in 1978. I think it is very important for members of the Parliament to recognise that this happened in 1978. Why was this not brought in in 1978, 1979, 1980 or 1981? I think we all have the answer. It is because it happens to be the case that the Prime Minister is trying to trigger an election. So he brings this up in 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We renegotiated the treaty. There were some very good reasons why we renegotiated the treaty in 1974. There was an exchange of letters that we brought in in 1975. I was very happy, as the Minister for Defence, to put the motion through the Parliament. The first reason we renegotiated the treaty was that we excised from the treaty. What I have said-I said it then as the former Minister for Defence knows-is that I regarded the treaty as an infamous text of the exchange of letters between Mr Battle who was then the United States Ambassador and Mr Barwick who was then the Minister for Foreign Affairs. That letter was a blatant and deliberate abdication of Australian sovereignty. That is why the Labor Party opposed the legislation in 1963. The Liberal Party in government then quite deliberately abdicated Australian sovereignty. So, in the renegotiations that were carried out in the period 1972-74 the major objective of the Labor Party was to excise that infamous exchange of letters. We were successful. I noticed that the Minister for Defence in putting forward his speech today did not even make one mention of that letter-as well he may-because that was a great humiliation for Australia. Article 3 of the Agreement provides for consultation. Effectively that letter stated that irrespective of what was in Article 3 it does not mean what it says it means. That is the record of the Government. </PARA>

I was very proud to be associated with the excision of that shameful letter from the treaty between Australia and our great ally the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the renegotiation was that the Liberal Party, back in 1963- if one goes through the Hansard records one will see it-proudly asserted that the base would be under sole United States control. That is part of the provocation that was applied in 1963. This is the attempted provocation now. We set ourselves to remove that notion from the alliance arrangement with the United States. We turned the concept of a sole base into the concept of a joint facility. That is what the base is now. That is what we are being asked to reaffirm. Of course we will reaffirm it. If we were asked to reaffirm the 1963 agreement we would be thoroughly opposed to it. If the Government has any intestinal fortitude in what it is trying to do tonight it will come up with the proposition that we negate what happened in 1974 and go back to the 1963 agreement but it is not game to do that. What we are being asked to do tonight is to reaffirm the 1974 agreement. Of course we will reaffirm it. </PARA>
<PARA> When we took over in 1972 there were no Australian servicemen on the North West Cape. We had the Commissioner for Exmouth who was a clerk of works, no more and no less, but there were no Australian servicemen on the base. Australia itself did not have the facilities. Only one Australian was on the base because the Government of the day, the Liberal Government, had said it was a sole United States base. So we set out to change that agreement, the agreement we are confirming tonight. I want to read to the House the exchange of letters that took place between my predecessor as Minister for Defence and the United States authorities. I will read it very carefully so that even Government members are likely to understand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will go slowly. I have made a dozen speeches on the North West Cape in this House and the very same arguments come up from the other side. Perhaps tonight members of the Government will listen and we will have done with this charade. A Press release by the former Minister stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister agreed that, with the use of the station as a joint facility and consistent with the agreement of May 1963 on the establishment of the Naval Communications Station, Australian servicemen would participate in the management and operation of the station. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Minister said that for this purpose, Australian personnel would commence moving into the station towards the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements will place Australian personnel in key positions and establish a substantial Australian contribution to the management and operation of the station. </PARA>
<PARA> To coordinate Australian activities at the station, an Australian Deputy Commander will be appointed. </PARA>
<PARA>One would have thought that those propositions would have been incorporated in the agreement from the word go but they were not. The Government in 1963 was trying on the same gimmick as the Government in 1982 is trying on tonight. It did not have the guts to put forward to an ally the very simple proposition that any base on Australian territory should be a joint facility. We accept that argument. I think the former Minister for Defence can corroborate that I have expressed the proposition both as Minister for Defence and as a member of this Parliament since 1969. We recognise the role that is played by the United States in the deterrent capabilities of the Western allies. But this does not mean to say that Australia, in terms of a base on Australian soil, does not have a rightful responsibility to act as an intelligent ally; not an obsequious, subservient ally-to play an effective role in those facilities. In 1974-75 we turned the concept of a sole United States base into the concept of a joint facility. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the essential features of the North West Cape which was completely disregarded by the gentlemen opposite, even as far back as 1963, was the form of consultation that must take place between allies. I want to read from a speech made on 21 August 1975. It is a section of a speech that was quoted very recently by the former Minister for Defence. I have no compunction in reiterating it because it was my belief then and it is my belief now. At that time I said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the practical, realistic and effective mode of monitoring and control is certainly not a matter of intervention in the operations of the station. The proper focus of our effort is the United States global policy. If we know what that is about, we will have an accurate understanding of the type of message being transmitted through North West Cape. . . . Through discussions with the United States which form the basis of the legislation which we have here before us tonight-</PARA>
<PARA>This goes back seven years-</PARA>
<PARA>we made that consultation explicit. The substantial features are to ensure, to quote from the document:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that the Australian Government would have full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to the station and their significance for Australian national interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will explain my point in the course of my speech. I am surprised at the reaction of the honourable member for St George. We have heard tonight from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), from the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) and from the honourable member for St George. These gentlemen are very skilled, after years of bitter experience, at putting up the best front for that powerful group in the Labor Party which the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) has described as 'a cancer eating at the heart of the Labor Party'; that is, the socialist left whose victory in the recent ALP leadership struggle has driven so many of their colleagues to despair . These are front of the shop men. We will not hear tonight from the socialist left speakers. We will not hear from the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) who, in the Sinai debate last year, distinguished himself by describing the United States as the greatest threat to peace in the world today. I do not think we will hear from the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous), from the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) and so on. There are so many of them we will not hear from. We will hear from these front of the shop men. Nevertheless, despite their gifts and their cynicism, they cannot conceal the fact of Australian Labor Party policy, which is to impose such impossible conditions on United States retention of the North West Cape base that the United States must reject those conditions so that a Labor government will then close the base down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic doctrine was given in the parliamentary debate last May by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). It was referred to and quoted by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton). It is in essence that unless a Labor government has a veto on the orders to initiate military action from the base, it will close it down. That was stated with appealing candour, with a certain frankness, by the Leader of the Opposition. But as so often happens when Labor policy is stated frankly, the cosmeticians had to get to work to soften it, to blur the outline and to obscure the issue. Of course, one of the great masters of this skill is the Deputy Leader of the Oppositon (Mr Lionel Bowen). Very quickly they got to work to make their leader's doctrine obscure. For example, last April in a media release the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that Labor proposed to renegotiate the North West Cape base agreement-not to give a Labor government the right of veto or the possibility of closing it down if that veto was rejected-we got none of that; we got a more cosmetic formula-but to renegotiate the Agreement to include an Australian representative in Washington who would have access to United States strategic policy which might result in militarily strategic messages being sent through the North West Cape. We see the Morrison influence there or possibly the Barnard influence from earlier times. The next day the Leader of the Opposition quoted that again, but added something which I do not think the cosmeticians wanted. Referring to what Mr Bowen had said, he added:</PARA>
<PARA> This will serve as an interim measure. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the veto principle and the closing down principle are still there, but we have something cosmetic as an interim measure. But even that was not good enough. On 26 July at a colloquium on disarmament the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, getting back to the original Hayden formula albeit wiht a little more obscurity, when referring to the base said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a Labor government would insist that Australia be involved in-</PARA>
<PARA>That is a nice vague phrase-</PARA>
<PARA> any decisions, at the strategic level, regarding the type of signal that would be sent to United States submarines via North West Cape. </PARA>
<PARA>There is absolutely no point in being involved in any decisions unless there is a right of veto, otherwise what is involvement? So we are back to the right of veto, although it is in an obscure way. Of course, the veto would be rejected by the United States, so then a Labor government would wind the base down, according to the Hayden doctrine. Even a week ago-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am referring to the change of policy, not the policy to which the honourable member for St George referred. I am referring to today's policy. A week ago the same Deputy Leader of the Opposition plainly stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Labor government would ensure that . . . the Australian Government would be involved in the strategic aspects of the US communication stations work. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the right of veto, in obscure words, knowing that that veto will be rejected and then, in accordance with the Labor doctrine, the closing down of the base. This base is part of the most important alliance this country has and of the American alliance. The fundamental drive of the Labor Party or of a very significant element of it-it is not unanimous-is opposed to the United States alliance of which this Agreement is a very significant part. But members of the Opposition do not like to say this so bluntly. They prefer to dress it up. They turn to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to speak generally about the alliance. He has developed a technique of his own, and does it very well. The technique, which can be reduced to a rule, is this: 'Whenever the Labor Party criticises the United States of America, immediately follow it with a criticism of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, sometimes even a harsh one, giving the impression that you are dealing with equal impartiality with the two superpowers, implying that there is no difference between them. Then go on to hammer at the United States, whatever its policy-Japan, Vietnam, Latin America, wherever you like'. The result is not in so many words the socialist left posture. It is to adopt what we can call an anti-United States isolationism which will do the socialist left for the time being. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should listen to the way the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does it. I refer to his general views on the American alliance because that is at the basis of this debate on the North West Cape Agreement. I refer to a speech he gave in Brisbane on 24 April. Many honourable members will be astounded. I was. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The principal source of conflict between the US and the USSR is the control of strategic areas and of natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all the United States and the USSR are fighting about! He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has no immediate interest in this struggle . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It does not matter who controls the oil of the Middle East or who controls the world; Australia has no immediate interest in this struggle! It is not a struggle between democracy, or the free world, and the forces of totalitarianism or communism; it is a struggle between two superpowers for natural resources and strategic areas! That is the sort of picture he gives of the world conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to a speech he gave at the Institute of International Affairs symposium in Sydney in May. I was also at that symposium. It was concerned with the role of Australia in Asia and the Pacific Basin and the power balance in the Pacific and Asia. In a quite lengthy speech the Deputy Leader of the Opposition managed to discuss the power situation in Asia and the Pacific without even mentioning the USSR or its expansion in the world-in Asia, in the Indian Ocean, in Afghanistan or in Vietnam. There was no mention of the USSR. That is his understanding of the power balance in Asia and the Pacific. If that seemed extraordinary, to balance it off he managed to make no mention of the United States or the Association of South East Asian Nations either. That is the sort of world he lives in. He deletes the United States from the world power balance, and then deletes the USSR too. That kind of crazy isolationism fits in with his leader's Institute of Public Affairs paper of November last year when he developed his Fortress Australia concept without an alliance-a dream, if members of the Opposition believe it, of a sort of Finlandisation of Australia. But they do not believe it; it is not a serious commitment. It is a cosmetic way of covering up the real thrust of the policy. </PARA>
<PARA> They are using the same technique in relation to the base. They do not say straight out: 'We will close it down'. That would seem unpalatable to some people; they might even lose some votes because of it. They do not say: 'We will close it down.' They say: 'We will insist on conditions and try to make them sound plausible'. Then, knowing that the United States cannot agree with those conditions, they say: 'If there is no agreement we will close the base down, but for goodness sake we have tried to be reasonable'. Exactly the same technique was used last year in the Sinai debate. They did not want to say straight out: ' We will not participate in the peacekeeping force in the Middle East'. That would seem to some people an unacceptable approach. So they said: 'We are prepared to participate in a peacekeeping force provided it is part of the United Nations force', knowing that the United Nations would not have such a force and that the Security Council was opposed to it. They said: 'We will be in a peacekeeping force under certain conditions', knowing that those conditions could not possibly happen. It is exactly the same with the North West Cape base. They say: 'Of course, America is welcome on certain conditions. We are very reasonable', knowing that those conditions are unacceptable. That proposition is absurd. It asks for what no other country asks. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries do not have those sorts of rights and do not expect them. The United States certainly would not agree to them; nor would any other country with which America has this sort of alliance. The Labor Party asks the impossible and it knows that it is impossible. That is the basis for proceeding to close the base down. It was not always that way with the Labor Party. In 1963 , when the agreement was being negotiated, Senator McKenna, referring to this sort of demand, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Opposition has never asked that, with a nuclear missile hostile to Australia or to America on the way, we should be consulted as to what should be done. We have never put up such nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is the sort of nonsense, in the changed situation 20 years later , that the Labor Party now demands. Twenty years ago it was different. In 1963 Senator Fitzgerald of the Labor Party said:</PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the establishment of the United States radio base. To be frank, I wish that we were ringed with such bases. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, times have changed. Tonight the Labor Party with the sort of policy that I have outlined, with all its cosmetic changes, says that it is prepared to agree that this House confirms that this Agreement advances the security of Australia and of the Western alliance and that the present consultative arrangements between Australia and the United States are fully adequate to meet the needs of the Treaty partners. Members of the Opposition are prepared to support that. In a leadership riddled with cynicism, this is the most noisome cynicism of all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As speakers on this side of the House have so rightly pointed out, this is a phoney debate over a got-up issue, in the form of a motion which in its entirety reflects the unconcern and incompetence with which it was drafted. I shall get on to one or two points about that later. It reflects the inexperience of the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) in the same way as his absence from this debate reflects his contempt for the House and for the issue. It is absolutely disgraceful, when the matter that he has determined as vital to the security interests of this country, that he should depart the House while the debate proceeds. There have been three speakers since the evening suspension and he has not been present to hear any of them. It is a pathetic performance which matches the pathetic performance he has put up since he has been Minister for Defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His pathetic performance has been exceeded only by the performances of one or two speakers on the Government side of the House. I am always depressed by the speeches of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) in this place when he discusses foreign policy matters. He is supposed to be the gun Government backbencher on foreign policy and defence issues. Whenever he appears in this House we hear mindless ranting; no more and no less than that. We had another performance of mindless ranting today. It is a shame that the Government cannot do a little better than that. It must be said that some of the other Government speakers put up a slightly better performance but they should have done something about their colleague a long time ago. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of points have been raised about statements made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). We support this motion for several reasons. One of them happens to be that which was expounded by the honourable member for St George ( Mr Morrison). We are pleased to see that at last this Government has acknowledged that it approves of the amendments that we made to the Base Agreement between Australia and the United States of America in 1974. That is not what members opposite said in 1974-oh, no! To them then, Barnard going over to Schlesinger and putting upon him the things that Barnard put upon him then was an act tantamount to treason. But now, eight years later, we find, as is invariably the case, that the changes are part of conventional wisdom and so they now support the amendments to the agreement achieved by the Australian Labor Party. We are pleased to obtain the acknowledgement of the Government on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason why we support the motion is that further down it refers to the question of deterrence. The fact of the matter is that the base is associated at present with a second strike capacity of the United States. A second strike capability is the essence of deterrents. The Leader of the Opposition has raised a couple of points on this matter which I think are important. He has said that the basic purpose of the agreement which, of course, supersedes anything within the framework of this motion is for the defence of the parties concerned. This is somewhat different from the notion of using this facility or anything else for first strike purposes. Even though there are shifts and changes in the doctrine of the United States-sometimes the doctrine develops in more dangerous ways than it does in others-it nevertheless remains essentially fundamental to that doctrine that it is founded on a conception of deterrence which does not envisage a first strike in either a tactical or strategic context. That is what the Leader of the Opposition was referring to. His views are firmly within the framework of the United States Naval Communications Station Agreement and firmly within the framework of this motion. But that is simply not comprehended by honourable members opposite, possibly because they do not get the sort of advice they ought to get from the people who are supposed to be their ace guns on the subject of foreign policy. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been engaged in here is not only just an attempt to tempt the Labor Party into a fatuous debate on the basis of a change that ought to have taken place four years ago in the arrangements associated with the base when a local council was set up; but also a concealment of the very considerable inadequacies in the performance of the Minister for Defence. Since he has been appointed Defence Minister he has wandered around this country and elsewhere like a one- man whoopee cushion sounding off in all directions on doctrines that he has utterly confused. One minute we hear from him that he is in favour of forward defence; the next minute we hear from him that he is in favour of defence self reliance; and the next minute we hear from him that he wants to put the FA18- that extremely expensive, extremely sensitive piece of military equipment-in the middle of Malaysia where it will rot in the tropics in the space of six months. This military genius now presides over our defence policies. One reflection of his whoopee-ness is to be seen in certain parts of this motion. I refer to paragraph (5). Some of the other honourable members on the other side of the House might like to extrapolate on it. Alternatively, when the Minister can grace this occasion again with his presence, he might, in winding up the debate, have a little to say on this topic himself. Paragraph (5) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Asserts that no impediment should be placed by either party on access to the facilities of the base in relation to the use of the base by the other party . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That could be interpreted in a couple of ways. One of the ways in which that part of this shoddy piece of drafting, could be interpreted is that permission should be granted by both parties to have access to each other's communication rooms. One reasonable interpretation of this sloppy and hurried piece of drafting by a sloppy and hurried Minister, who has just returned to the chamber, is that we have now unilaterally renegotiated the agreement to give ourselves access to the United States communications facility. I suspect that this is probably not what has happened, but that there is a degree of confusion in the motion. If it is to be renegotiated, if the Minister wishes to proceed with that that is fair enough. I hope he is a little careful about giving the United States the same degree of access to our communications room. The facility is, after all, on our territory. I do not think we on this side of the House would necessarily want a situation where the United States would intervene in communications with our submarines. Perhaps we could hear a little more about that later from this master draftsman of defence and foreign policy motions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already explained our leader's policy to the House. If the honourable member listens a little longer, he might learn one of two other things about the facility. I wish now to look at exactly what purpose the communications station serves. It does serve a changing function. When the Labor Party renegotiated this Treaty-a renegotiation which at last Government members are catching up with, we welcome them to the side of those who are attempting to establish a sensible and mature relationship with our principal ally-the North West Cape facility was more essential to American submarine communications systems than it is now. All public documents associated with the deployment by the United States of the trident submarine state the intention that the submarines should be deployed principally close to the United States continent where the United States can be absolutely certain that the submarines can be protected from any developments in the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability. When that happens the submarines' principal means of communications will be from the equivalent station to the North West Cape in Washington State. The purpose of the North West Cape, at least in terms of communications with ballistic missile submarines, will be largely redundant. In case this is not sufficient, the United States has also added to its capabilities for communications with submarines-in the experimental stage at least-an extra low frequency system which will be located entirely in the United States and which would subsume some of the functions of VLF systems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing that the United States has done is to have in operation already a VLF capability which is airborne and invulnerable to a Soviet attack. In relation to the North West Cape facility-this causes some comfort to honourable members on this side of the House-the value and the centrality of it to the United States system of strategic deterrence is beginning to decline and will continue to decline. In those circumstances, of course, the likelihood that it will be a nuclear target in a general war also will be reduced. If honourable members on the other side of the House knew a darn thing about this subject, they would at least be able to appear in this House and debate it sensibly. Instead, we have heard the absolutely nonsensical argie-bargie which comes particularly from people like the honourable member for Higgins. He offers no help to our understanding of these considerably complex matters. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that we have constantly stressed in association with all the facilities in Australia, including this one, and is one of the reasons why we support their continued presence in Australia-it is not the only reason; we also acknowledge the defensive purpose associated with them-is that they are an entree to United States decision-making procedures. No thanks are due to members of the Government for our having that entree. That is a result of the negotiations of the previous government when it moved the process of consultation out of the context of the hurrah club that is the ANZUS Ministers council meetings and shifted it to the more solid basis of constant communications between civil servants at a middle level. That gave us not only more serious information on United States strategic policy but also a capability to intervene in discussions of United States strategic policy-a very welcome change. I am glad to see Government members acknowledging it at last in this motion, but I am not sure that they fully understood, when they put this motion forward, that that is in fact, what they are acknowledging. I hope this debate has been something of an education for them not only in political tactics but also in the issue itself. If they learn nothing else from that, the remaining weeks of this Parliament, will be well spent by those about to join the ranks of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The point about that access is that it gives us a chance to say some important things to the United States on matters of strategic policy which affect the future stability of this world. Fortunately when members of the Government move outside this House and outside the context of political debate in this House and go overseas they start to take the high road. On some matters on which they take the high road I commend them. A couple of them have taken the high road on matters of arms control arrangements. Recently, for example, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) put up a fine defence of a nuclear test ban treaty in the face of the opposition of our principal ally. In this instance the nuclear test ban treaty involved an agreement over whether all powers, particularly the United States and the Soviet Union, should abolish underground nuclear testing. The United States and the Soviet Union have argued that verification is not possible for such an agreement. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs have argued that scientific verification is possible because there is established in Australia a facility that does monitor tests. It is manned by Australian scientists. The Government did offer the good offices of those scientists to ensure that such a treaty could be verified. It happens to be a notable exception to the way in which the Government has generally treated its entree.</PARA>
<PARA> One thing that must be crystal clear from our association with the United States and the question of whether we wish to see stable nuclear deterrence is that we have a vested interest now in a way which we never had before in the sanity of the two super-powers-not just the one, the two of them. We have a vested interest in the sanity of the Soviet Union and we have a vested interest in the sanity of the United States. When we debate these matters in this House we ought to be able to debate them with the seriousness that that subject entails. It is a serious subject because we have influence. It is an influence that ought to be used for the prevention of nuclear war and the prevention of super-power tensions which may produce accidents which would result in a nuclear war. We never get that seriousness from the Government members because whenever election time comes around all they want to do is to stress that bipartisanship does not exist where it in fact exists in the hope, for electoral purposes, of breaking it down. They are contemptible. The Minister is contemptible in the way in which he has brought this motion into the House. It is a disgraceful motion serving disgraceful purposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite what the Opposition may say in this chamber this evening, the fact of the matter is, and it is demonstrable, that the Australian Labor Party is in total disarray over the question of the ANZUS Treaty and Australia's defence arrangements. There are as many views in the Australian Labor Party as there are individuals. I just want to reiterate some of the points of this motion. I am speaking tonight in favour of it. What this motion says and what the ALP, through the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen), said earlier in the debate it was in favour of is that the United States Naval Communication Station Agreement is an important element in the bilateral relationship between Australia and the United States, contributing to the fulfilment of our obligations under the security treaty. It also confirms that the agreement advances the security of Australia and of the Western alliance. It asserts that there should be no impediment placed on the use and operation of the base to meet the stated needs-stated needs, not renegotiated needs-and requirements of the treaty partners. It agrees that the present consultative arrangements be preserved and that those arrangements are fully adequate. That is what the Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair) has moved by way of a motion in this Parliament tonight. It is what we on the Government side are supporting and it is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says the Labor Party supports. It is demonstrable, it is on the record, that that is not what the Labor Party supports. What Opposition members are doing in the House tonight is merely bringing forward a range of pious objections to the Government's motion which have no basis and are not supportable in fact. I want to mention a few of the matters that have been raised. In July of this year the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said of ANZUS:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let's make it absolutely clear that ANZUS is not a pact, but a promise to consult in the case of an attack on any of the three signatories. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is not an attempt by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to downgrade the importance of ANZUS, I do not know what is. In June of 1982 the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party will ensure that the presence of these United States facilities in Australia does not derogate from Australia's sovereignty, and that Australia is not involved in hostilities without Australian consent. </PARA>
<PARA>He also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There will be no home porting of foreign warships in Australia, no storage of nuclear weapons on Australian territory, nor the launching of military operations involving nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA>In July of this year the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The entire southern hemisphere should be declared a nuclear free zone. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is not an attempt to undermine the ANZUS Treaty, if that is not an attempt on the part of the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party to redefine in Australian terms what they think the treaty means, I do not know what is. The fact of the matter is that they do not see the ANZUS Treaty, the United States bases and the visits of allied ships to Australia in the same light as the Government. Yet tonight they are trying to tell us that they do not disagree with this motion. The statement on these matters of the Labor Party over the last year or two have been of great concern to Australians. Not only have they been of great concern to Australians but also they have been of concern to the United States. It is most unusual to find the United States Department of State making statements in relation to the pronouncement of shadow Ministers and alternative Government leaders in Australia. It is worth quoting for the record that the United States Department of State responded to the ALP's various statements, threatening ANZUS, with a reminder of how the United States viewed the defence treaty. The United States Department of State stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the present dispute, it should be clear that access to allied ports and airfield for United States ships and aircraft is critical to our efforts to maintain a strategic deterrence. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be difficult, if not impossible, for the United States to carry out its responsibilities to assist effectively in the defence of its allies, if it is denied the use of their ports. </PARA>
<PARA>The United States Government's reaction in relation to the matter is very clear. Specifically relating to the North West Cape, Mr Hayden, in April 1981, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We find the present arrangements covering North West Cape unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith did not seek to move any amendment to the motion moved tonight by the Minister for Defence. That motion states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the present consultative arrangements between Australia and the United States relating to the Joint operations of North West Cape be preserved and recognises that those arrangements are fully adequate to meet the needs of the Treaty partners. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member said that the Opposition will support this resolution. The Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA> We find the present arrangements covering North West Cape unsatisfactory. We would seek to renegotiate the North West Cape agreement to provide first, that Australia's consent is mandatory for all orders to initiate military action which flows from the station and second, that we are given firm and convincing assurances that the station will not be used to send orders for first strike nuclear attack or to initiate a limited strike. If the United States would not accept these reasonable provisions, designed to protect our national sovereignty , then we would request them to wind down the operations of North West Cape as rapidly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not see that what the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are saying about North West Cape and what the Government is saying about North West Cape are the same thing. There is not a bipartisan attitude on the part of the Government parties and the Opposition party on the question of North West Cape. Yet the Opposition is picking one paragraph out of the motion which is before the House and trying to make fun of that and is ignoring the other five articles of the motion which are specifically designed to state that this House is confirming ANZUS, the Australian-United States defence relationship, the importance of the North West Cape facility and the satisfactory nature of the relationships that exist over the management of that base. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hypocritical for members of the Labor Party to say that they support the motion and then to proceed with a debate of the nature that has emanated from that side of the House this evening, in the face of the statements, which are on the record, by various spokesmen for the Labor Party over the last couple of years. It is also important to note that, despite what the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition might say, there is total dissarray and confusion on these matters, as I said at the outset, within the Australian Labor Party and the Labor movement. I want to state a few of the facts. The present platform of the Victorian Labor Party Conference, one of the constituent parts of this great alternative government, contains this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Co-operation with the people of the United States and New Zealand within the context of the Australian New Zealand United States (ANZUS) Treaty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was not passed. It was passed at the Victorian Conference and was put up at the Federal Council but it was defeated. The point I am making is that there is no unanimity even in the Labor Party. Its constituent parts, the socialist Left, the centre unity, the conservative Right and the moderates all have a different view of what the foreign policy ought to be. The Leader of the Labor Party, particularly, the captive of the socialist Left, has no idea of what he stands for and capitulates on every occasion. In May the Premier of Victoria wrote to the Prime Minister in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am writing to give you early notice of my Government's policy that it will not permit visits of nuclear powered or nuclear armed vessels to Victorian ports . </PARA>
<PARA> This policy, which was part of the platform on which my Government was elected, will apply without qualification. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister reacted in the way honourable members would imagine. For a couple of weeks there were at least four discernible positions on the part of the Australian Labor Party in relation to this very important aspect of our defence alliance with the United States. I have quoted the view of the Victorian Premier. The New South Wales Premier, Mr Wran, banned visits by nuclear powered ships but allowed stops by conventionally powered vessels without insisting on knowing whether they were carrying nuclear--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI7">Mr LUSHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Wran's attitude was different again. The Leader of the Opposition opposed visits by nuclear powered ships but was relaxed about nuclear powered vessels which do not carry nuclear weapons. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that a Labor government would allow visits by nuclear armed ships, provided they were simply refuelling and not conducting some staging exercise. So there were four discernible views. As I understand it, there have been some more capitulations since then. I am not totally sure of the separate views within the Labor Party. The only thing I am certain about is that there are so many views within the Labor Party and so many statements on the record which conflict with the intent of the motion before the House that it is not possible for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to say that the Labor Party supports it. He stated that he supports the change of Exmouth in relation to the local commissioner and local government, et cetera. But the fact is that the Labor Party is about to go on record. I am very happy about that except that I think it ought to be honest and state what it is doing. It is not doing that now, and that is what the debate is about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. It is a very sensitive aspect of the United States-Australian alliance and Australia's security umbrella, and it is all part of the same umbrella of which the Harold E. Holt base is also a part. The Labor Party has no idea where it stands on these issues. Everybody in the Labor Party and every faction have separately identifiable points of view. It is a joke for the Labor Party to try to convince this House and the people of Australia that it supports the motion which has been moved tonight in this place by the Minister for Defence. I think it is of vital importance that we understand what the motion says and what the Labor Party says it will support. The United States naval communications station is an important element in the bilateral relationship and contributes to the fulfilment of our obligations under the security treaty. The Agreement advances the security of Australia and the Western alliance. The motion also states that no impediment should be placed on the use and operation of the base and that the present consultative arrangements between Australia and the United States relating to the joint operations of the North West Cape will be preserved. It also recognises that those arrangements are fully adequate to meet the needs of the treaty partners. If the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) and the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith do not agree with that they had better stand up and say so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the benefit of the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) I would like to say a few things about the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party, like all other political parties, thrives on healthy debate and at its conferences it deals with those issues that are the important issues of the day. The Labor Party is the party of Australian nationalism. It is the party that has always stood for a strong, free democratic Australia. It has always stood for the defence of Australia. It was a Labor government that introduced national service in the Fisher Government days. It was a Labor government that established the Royal Australian Navy in the days of the Fisher Government. It was a Labor Government that was elected to office to prosecute the First World War. It was a Labor government that took office in October 1941 during the Second World War when the coalition parties collapsed. Labor was called to take over the government of this country for the greatest war effort that Australia has ever mounted. So the Labor Party has no cause to run away from any of these issues affecting the defence of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To support what I have said I remind honourable members that it was a Labor government at the end of the Second War War that passed the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act, the Act that brought into effect in Australia the Statute of Westminster which was agreed to in 1931 by what was then called an imperial conference. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor Party members are always having discussions about the needs of Australian nationalism in terms of serving our objective to achieve a strong, free, democratic Australia. But there are some consistent elements in the Labor Party policy. I have been curiously interested tonight by numbers of honourable members on the other side because of the way they have talked about debates about the Labor Party and its attitude towards ANZUS and the Australian-American alliance. There are not too many more consistent areas of the Labor Party platform that have stood for the order of 30 or 40 years than those decisions made by the national conference of the Labor Party and which reflect on the Australian-American alliance. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it very sad that something as important to this nation as the ANZUS treaty should be the subject of a petty partisan debate tonight. In terms of the agreement, apart from the pious things with which we all agree, the substance of the motion we are debating tonight is to agree to remove from the Agreement Article 6 which provides for the appointment of a civil commissioner at Exmouth to have such functions as both governments vest in him and to represent them in such maters as they determine. I have found to my amazement that this gentleman had his authority removed from him four years ago. That must be some indication of the importance which this Government attaches to keeping this very important agreement with the United States up to date. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YF4">Mr CROSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am told that this gentleman has been removed from office for four years. I make the point that the ANZUS treaty is the only treaty mentioned in the ALP policy document. The honourable member for Hume has read out that statement which, very briefly, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . Labor will-</PARA>
<PARA>Co-operate with the people of the United States and New Zealand within the context of the Australian New Zealand United States (ANZUS) Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>What has that meant in practice? It has been a consistent attitude for 40 years. Honourable members of this House will recall that it was John Curtin who, in February 1942 shortly after the Japanese had invaded Pearl Harbour and the United States had come into the war, appealed to the United States to join with Australia and help Australia in this nation's hour of need. So the Australian- American alliance was brought into being at the request of a Labor Prime Minister and a Labor Government. The attitude of the Labor Party has been consistent ever since. I could quote a number of people. I could quite easily quote from Sir Alan Watt or Sir Paul Hasluck if I had sufficient time. However I will quote from Mr Alan Renouf's book The Frightened Country in which, on page 93, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> The idea of a Pacific security agreement was first floated by the Lyons conservative government in 1937 without result. It was revived by the 1943 Labour Government without specific proposals. In 1945 Evatt tried to negotiate a pact with the United States as a guarantee against Japanese aggression but the United States was unenthusiastic. In 1947 Evatt, in the context of talk about an early Japanese peace treaty, proposed to the United States a Pacific Regional Security Commission to supervise the implementation of the peace treaty and other aspects of security in the Pacific. The proposal found no favour. Evatt revived the idea of a Pacific security arrangement in 1949, this time including Asian countries, but again unsuccessfully. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know that it was only at the time when a peace treaty was being negotiated with Japan the so-called soft peace treaty, as it was described as in those days-that the United States was prepared to enter into treaty arrangements with the Philippines, that was the PHILUS pact, and with Australia and New Zealand, and that was the ANZUS pact. The man who did the negotiation at that time, of course, was Sir Percy Spender, the distinguished first Minister for External Affairs in the Menzies Government. At the time that Curtin appealed to the United States to establish the Australian-American alliance members on the other side of the Parliament-on the coalition side; that is, the United Australia Party-Country Party side-criticised that appeal to the United States. In those days patriotism was judged by the British connection. It is only in more recent years that by honourable members opposite it has been judged by the American connection. </PARA>
<PARA> One could go ad nauseam, I suppose, through all of the events since then but I think it is useful to reflect on the state of the United States-Australian alliance and indeed the agreement for the North West Cape radio station as it emerged from the days of the Whitlam Government. The agreement we are debating tonight was negotiated by the Whitlam Government. This radio station and its operations survived three years of the previous Labor Government and it will survive six or nine years of the Hayden Labor government in the future. The record is there. The runs are on the score board. Mr Renouf admits that there were difficulties with the United States in the early days. Honourable members will recall that we had been involved in the Vietnam war and we had a distinctively different China policy from that of the United States. It was only in later days that the initiatives which Mr Whitlam and other people had taken were followed up by statesmen from the United States, not the least of whom were Mr Kissinger and, of course, President Nixon. On page 469 of his book Mr Renouf states:</PARA>
<PARA> However, as time passed, the United States got to know Whitlam and his governments and their policies better and then became more understanding, tolerant and less liable to misapprehension. The Whitlam Governments had by that time proven that they were not anti-American and had no intention of dissolving the long-standing United States alliance. When Whitlam was dismissed, Australian -American relations were as good as they had ever been. </PARA>
<PARA>I will quote Mr Marshall Green. The Whitlam Government was very grateful indeed that at a time of sensitive issues such as differences in policy about Vietnam and China the United States appointed a very distinguished career diplomat to this country in the person of Mr Marshall Green. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YF4">Mr CROSS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I will quote from a paper by Neville Meaney in the Australia in World Affairs 1971-1975 in which he mentioned an address by Mr Green in March 1975. Honourable members will recall that Australia in World Affairs is a well established standard work on Australian foreign policy. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Marshall Green towards the end of his term in office gave an international audience in New York a brief precis and friendly appraisal of these changes. He affirmed that Australian-American relations had been undergoing 'a maturation process'. Although the American ties were perhaps not as close as they had been with the previous Australian governments, nevertheless, the relationship was 'in many ways . . . healthier than it was before'. Australia was 'determined to do its own thing', he said. 'They don't want to be in lock-step with American policy'. He described the sycophantic slogans of preceding governments, such as 'All the way with L.B.J.', as a 'downright embarrassment'. Things had altered irretrievably. There was no way back. 'Now all the parties-Labor, Liberal and Country Party-are in favour of a nationalistic policy for Australia. We understand and agree with it. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate tonight has resulted from legislation introduced yesterday for the purpose of using the question of the Australian American alliance as an issue for a possible early election. We all remember 1951 when the Menzies Government had a double dissolution on the banking issue and fought the election on communism. Very clearly the Government is not prepared to fight any election in the short term on its economic policies. It is not prepared to fight any election on the state of the economy. It certainly would not be prepared to fight an election on the basis of the rubbery Budget it brought down earlier this week. Therefore Government members are shopping around for an issue. They are going back to the same issue that they used so successfully in 1966 at the time of the Vietnam war. They suggested then that under an Australian Labor Government the Australian-American alliance and the ANZUS treaty would be imperilled. I am sorry that I have to read so much history into the Hansard tonight but I believe that the record shows that any or those suggestions are totally untrue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian-American alliance emerged at the end of the Whitlam Government- we heard the distinguished former Minister and the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) talking about his personal experiences tonight-stronger than it had ever been before because it was operating on the basis of a new frankness, a greater degree of accountability and consultations and, indeed, in terms of the radio station, a much more practical agreement than had ever been negotiated before. It is very significant that this Government has not sought to change a single paragraph in the agreement negotiated by the Whitlam Government excepting that paragraph dealing with the change in the responsibility of the local authority. I regret that honourable members on the other side have seen fit to introduce many of the elements into this debate tonight. I believe that there is certainly common ground on both sides of this Parliament in support of the American alliance. It is sad indeed that for petty, party political objectives the United States and its representatives in this country will be able to read the Hansard of tonight's debate and see how many trivialities have been spelt out. I say only that when the Labor Government takes office-as it inevitably will after an election is held-we look forward to a firm, friendly and frank relationship with the United States such as we had between 1942 and 1949, between 1972 and 1975 and which we will have again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think an honourable member will claim that the motion before us will cause a lot of disagreement-in fact it has not because the Opposition has agreed with it. But I think it gives us all an opportunity to explore something of the Australian-United States relationship. It is a great mystery to me why the Australian Labor Party reacts so spontaneously to any discussion of this relationship. I have listened carefully tonight and have noted throughout the debate that the speakers on the Opposition side have all been from the conservative right wing element. The Labor Party is not game to put on the left wingers. I think that is very sensible. I have listened carefully to what they had to say and a lot of it made a great deal of sense. I learnt from the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison), who was very much involved in negotiating some of these agreements, and others the background to these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think there is any great disagreement between what has been said tonight on this side of the House and what has been said on the other side of the House. The disagreement would arise if the Labor Party let loose some of its more rabid socialist left members. That is where the schisms would appear. It is the left wing of the Labor Party which causes such tremors with our American allies, with those on this side of the House and will those on the right wing of the Australian Labor Party. They are the people who want to keep our foreign policy in some sort of cacoon, in darkness. They are the ones who react nervously and agressively every time there is mention of B52s and every time we mention we are going to allow some allied ships, which may or may not be carrying nuclear arms, into this country's ports. The left wingers are the ones who react. They are the people who reacted when the going got tough in Vietnam. The left wing of the ALP does not understand the value of strength and friendship, whether during war or peace. Their policy is just to drag everyone down to some mediocre level. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States has been a friend of ours for a long time. Many of us would remember quite clearly what it was like in the years 1942 to 1945. There are a hell of a lot of us who can imagine what it might have been like had the Americans not come during those dark years. Since World War II we have had the ANZUS alliance. It has stood the test of time. It is still the cornerstone of our foreign policy. We want American assistance and the Americans want ours. If we are to get that assistance we have to offer some facilities in this country. We have to offer port and communication facilities. It is very disappointing to me and, I am sure, to many honourable members on the other side to see the Premier of Victoria trying to make petty political points out of what is firstly a Commonwealth issue and, secondly, what is fundamental to the defence of this country. This, thank God, was acknowledged by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and to their great credit by honourable members such as the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) who have the courage to visit allied ships when they are in Sydney to demonstrate that not the entire ALP wants to draw us into some mediocrity. I will dwell, while talking about the Australia-America relationship, on Vietnam. It is quite common for the left wing elements of the ALP to keep blaming America for dragging Australia into Vietnam. </PARA>

We went because we decided to go and not because any threats were placed upon Australia. In those days we were following, rightly or wrongly, a policy of forward defence . We had been involved in Malaysia and I did not hear any great cries from the ALP then or when we were involved in Borneo. What happened when we went into Vietnam? Because it was a different ally-it is not a traditional ally-the left wing members of the ALP decided that it was not in our interests and they were quite wrong. No one on both sides of this House will ever forget the sight of Dr Jim Cairns entertaining a delegation from North Vietnam while Australian soldiers were still serving in that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the future of this alliance. Whether honourable members like it or not we are a country with a small population. We need allies and our allies need us in this part of the world. If we are going to have a friendship or an alliance, there has to be some give and take. The first responsibility of any government is to the defence of its own territories. The second responsibility- one which I regret we have neglected in recent years-is to look after our neighbours and friends. We need some capacity in this area. The distance from one side of Australia to the other is something like 3,000 miles. Taking that as a yardstick, within 3,000 miles of Australia's shores there are something like 30 countries or territories all of which in some way or another, look to Australia for assistance and help in times of trouble. So, if we as a small country are to provide that friendship and that capacity to help we need allies ourselves to assist us when the going gets tough. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it can be said that the fortress Australia attitude which has prevailed since we pulled out of Vietnam is changing. I very much hope that it is. It has been said quite often that we have to look after ourselves. There are certain things we can do for ourselves but there are certain things we cannot and when that happens that is the time when we will need our powerful friends and allies. The ANZUS Treaty is not the final solution, but it stood us well in the past and I hope it will stand us well in the future until we are big and strong enough to undertake all of our own defence capabilities. It is very sad that the Government had to bring into this House the Defence (Visiting Warships) Bill which will be debated next week. It should not be necessary. It is necessary only because the left wing of the ALP has cast doubt on that whole relationship. In fact, one man has done that or started it on his own. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the Premier of Victoria. The Premier of New South Wales has managed to keep it very quiet but has had the same policies for years. How can we expect to go into any alliance if we do not offer our allies port or communications facilities, run joint exercises with them, or offer them maintenance facilities and facilities for re-supplying? The United States of America has chosen to arm its ships with nuclear weapons and to power them with nuclear engines. We have not. That is not our policy. We do not have nuclear power. But who are we to tell the United States how it should power its ships and what weapons those ships should carry? If the United States chooses to do something that honourable members opposite may not agree with, are we to tell the United States to take its ships elsewhere? What fine friends we would be!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ALP keeps harping on the subject that this Government has put us in the position of being obsequious allies. Let us look at the agreement on the North West Cape. The agreement states:</PARA>
<PARA> First, that the agreement and the obligations it creates should respect the sovereignty of each. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, that the control of the station should rest with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, that when desired by either, there should be consultation. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, that the Australian armed forces should have the use of the communication services. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, that the Australian Government should not seek to make a revenue profit out of the American establishment. . . </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, that in the establishment, operation and maintenance of the station, the maximum practicable use of Australian resources should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Seventhly, that, without submitting to the jurisdiction of Australian courts, or compromising its sovereignty, the United States would conform to Australian law and its personnel would observe it. </PARA>
<PARA>It does not seem to me that anything in that agreement takes away the respect and dignity of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to a speech made by the Leader of the Opposition in May 1981. Having visited the North West Cape, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The inescapable fact remains that Australia has a sovereign right to be in ultimate control of affairs on her own territory. </PARA>
<PARA>That is fair enough. But he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We would seek to re-negotiate the North West Cape agreement to provide, firstly , that Australia's consent is mandatory for all orders to initiate military action which flow from the station. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think anybody in his right mind could say to an ally: 'We will determine what your policies will be and we will determine whether you will be allowed to pursue those policies'. I can understand that a lot of that reservation is caused by the fear of nuclear war; but, again, it is a matter of balance. Many of us are concerned about nuclear war. I say again that it is the United States and other countries that have chosen to arm themselves with nuclear arms. We do not have nuclear weaponry. But who are we as allies to say: 'You will not have those weapons and that is the end of it? It would be a hopeless sort of alliance. A two-way street is involved in these alliances. I hope that what I have said tonight might have outlined the facts to some of the more rabid members of this Parliament who do not see the other side of this debate. Time and time again in this Parliament there have been calls for a partisan approach to defence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The despicable tactic involved in this motion is revealed by the total despair of the members of the Government that we in the Opposition are supporting this motion. Let us get clear what this motion is not about. The motion is not about the North West Cape agreement. It is not even, as in part it purports to be, about the momentous issue of dispensing with a civil commissioner at Exmouth, an earth shattering event which was achieved four years ago without recourse to the services of this House by the election of a local council in 1978.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only way in which this motion remotely has anything to do with defence is that it is a blatant, miserable attempt to create a trigger for the pathetic desire of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for a premature, diversionary election-an election which will divert the attention of this country from the total failure of this Government to manage the economic affairs of this country. That is a pathetic failure which, in the 48 hours since the delivery of the Budget in this House, is already crumbling further as the deceitful, lying figures contained in the papers attached to the Budget have been revealed to be in both Houses of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair), in introducing this motion, sought to put this matter in an historical setting by going back to Menzies' statement in this House 20 years ago. At the outset of this contribution I give the members of this coalition Government full marks for one thing in this area of defence and foreign policy: They get 100 per cent for total consistency. But it is a consistency of which they should be ashamed and this country terrified. It is a consistency which is characterised in two ways: Firstly, when the chips have been down in terms of the defence of this country they have been found wanting and have been rejected and, secondly, they have always been despicably prepared to use defence and foreign policy not as the intrinsically important issues which they are but with an astounding and absolute disregard for the truth as a plaything of politics, as something to divide the Australian community, and as an attempt to present the Australian Labor Party as unconcerned with or, even worse, opposed to protecting the security of Australia. In these terms, let us put this issue into its true historical perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> As one of my colleagues has already said, in the time of the First World War it was a Labor government that was called upon for the defence of this country. Let us come to more recent times. In the period just before the outbreak of the second World War a prominent leader of the conservatives of this country was praising Adolf Hitler; he was supporting the appeasement of Hitler that was taking place at that time. Indeed, that same gentleman, as documents which have recently come to light have shown, was criticising Winston Churchill for the attempts that Winston Churchill was making in the latter days of the 1930s to prepare Great Britain for the challenge which inevitably came. So inadequate were that man and his supporters, of whom Government members are the successors, to meet the defence of this country in the greatest challenge to it that has occurred that on 7 October 1941 two independents crossed the floor of this House to take away from the conservatives the responsibility for the defence of this country. That responsibility was given into the hands of the Australian Labor Party under the leadership of the greatest Prime Minister this country has ever seen-John Curtin. That is what happened when the chips were down and defence mattered. The Australian Labor Party met that challenge in war and went on in peace to establish the basis for the economic expansion of this country into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us establish the second characteristic of the way in which Government members have been prepared in peacetime to use defence and foreign policy-not in terms of analysing and dealing with them in regard to the intrinsic importance of those issues but, as I said, as a plaything of politics, and attempt miserably to divide Australia. let us go into some of the issues. Vietnam has been talked about. But let us go back three years before Vietnam. Let us go back to 1963, to an election which I remember as the candidate for the seat of Corio at that time. What device was used then in terms of using defence and foreign policy issues in this country? What did Government members do then? They tried to paint the Indonesians as the threat to this country. What did they do? They sent a dying Mr Townley to Washington to negotiate the F111 agreement. That was not enough. The Government bought the B57s and had them flying over the skies of Australia in an attempt to persuade the people of Australia to accept that they were about to be invaded by the Indonesians. The Government was successful. It knew that what it was doing was totally untrue. It knew that there was not a scintilla of evidence to sustain that charade that it played upon the people of Australia, but it was successful. The Government was not decent enough to understand that one should not do those things because it repeated them in 1966.</PARA>
<PARA> Government members have had the temerity to raise the subject of Vietnam tonight. Let us talk about Vietnam. How did we get into Vietnam? We got into Vietnam on the basis of a phoney, non-existent letter which purported to request Australia to go into Vietnam. We knew at the time that this was not right. Events have revealed that it was not right. But that did not worry the Government. On the basis of a phoney, non-existent letter the Government sent young Australians to die in Vietnam. It had no compunction about it. Government members talk about Jim Cairns talking at the time to representatives of Vietnam. What was the Government doing at that time? At the very time that Government members were justifying the deaths of hundreds of young Australians in Vietnam on the basis that atheistic, yellow, communistic China was about to thrust down towards Australia and had to be fought this conservative Government was allowing the export of materials from Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd to China, material which inevitably ended up in the war machine in Vietnam for use against Australians who were fighting and dying in Vietnam. That shows the depth and the despicable nature of the hypocrisy in which the Government engaged at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party said at that time that this was wrong, that it was based upon a lie. We had the courage to stand up and say that. We paid a heavy penalty in 1966 for it. But we stuck to our principle. As has always been the case with the position of the Australian Labor Party on issues of defence and foreign policy, the events proved the Australian Labor Party right. It took the election of the Labor Government in 1972 to end that infamous participation in Vietnam by Australians which had been initiated on the basis of a lie and which had been sustained on the basis of economic as well as political hypocrisy. Those are the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us move from that time in regard to all those issues in respect of which I have put the facts-not opinions-to the present situation. We of the Australian Labor Party make no apology for the fact that we regard our relations with the United States as important. After all, as one of my colleagues has pointed out, it was in the time of war in 1941, after the electorate threw out the Government and put us in office, that we in the Australian Labor Party in government forged the most effective alliance and relationship between the United States and Australia that has ever existed between any two countries in the history of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It was my party in government which did that against the snide opposition and sneers of the conservatives who could look no further than to Mother England and who said that any suggestion that we should break down those ties and think about a relationship with the United States which would in any way replace that would be regarded almost as an act of treason. The strength of the relationship between Australia and the United States which is still a reality and which is important to the Australian Labor Party was in fact forged by the Australian Labor Party in government. Those are the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is it that in August of 1982 we are being brought to the ridiculous situation where it is being put to us that there should be some surprise about the Australian Labor Party's supporting this motion? As my friend the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) has pointed out, why in the name of everything that begins to make sense should we not support a motion which talks about confirming the agreement of 1963 as amended? It was amended, as has been pointed out, in 1974 in the negotiations which took place between the Labor Government's Defence Minister, Lance Barnard, and the United States Defence Secretary, Schlesinger. What was done in those negotiations? What was achieved in those amendments. Let me refer to two of the significant achievements that had to wait until the Australian Labor Party was in government. This agreement had been in place since 1962 but it took until we got into government to achieve these things. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to just two of them. One of the things which were done by us, which Government members had not been able to do and which they have been satisfied with leaving in abeyance since 1962, was the giving for the first time to Australian submarines access to VLF communications. That is what we achieved. That was our amendment. The Government could not do it. It asks in surprise why we support this motion. It was our amendment of the Treaty which achieved that. I ask Government members to notice the achievement in the 1974 amendment by the Australian Labor Party in government. The Canberra Times of 1 January 1974 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The United States agreed to 'extend and strengthen bilateral consultations to ensure that the Australian Government would have full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to the station and their significance for Australian national interests.'</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we negotiated. It had been entirely absent in the agreement negotiated in 1963. It was in regard to those fundamental issues of importance to the sovereignty and integrity of this country that the agreement of 1963 was amended by the Labor Government. Government members wonder why we have no difficulty in coming into the House and supporting a motion which asks us to agree with what we achieved in our amendment which vastly filled out in terms of the responsibility, sovereignty and respect of this country what the Government had not been able or more importantly had not wanted to achieve in 1963. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this debate initiated by the Government is a miserable tactic. It is a degrading episode of which this Government should be, as the people of Australia will be, thoroughly ashamed and disgusted. The Prime Minister desperately wants to have an early election. He knows that he cannot possibly go to the people of this country and say: 'People of Australia, examine our economic record. Look at what we have done as we claimed we would do at the end of 1975 as the divinely ordained economic managers.' Government members know that if people look at their record as economic managers they will finish up where they belong. What do they try to do? Once again, they try to invoke the miserable tactics of 1963 in respect of Indonesia. They try to resurrect the miserable tactics of 1966 and 1969 in regard to Vietnam. They do the worst thing that members of any political party can do, that is to attempt to represent about half the people of Australia as people who are not concerned with the security, welfare and defence of this country. They try to make people understand that members of the Opposition are not concerned with those things. The Government has not learnt from 1963 or 1966 how to be decent. It only sees that on those occasions its expediency worked in electoral terms. Fortunately, members of the Government have been such abject failures as economic managers that people will see through this miserable tactic. On behalf of the Labor Party I say: 'Go to the electorate as soon as you possibly can and you will finish up where you deserve-with miserable rumps on the Opposition benches of the Parliament.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The full page advertisement appeared in the National Times on that day, 12 October 1976. It pledges the Opposition to oppose military alliances, foreign military bases and military interventions. It went on to state that the presence of bases in Australia was somehow or other to be seen as a diminution of Australia's sovereignty and independence. The interesting thing about this is simply that at the recent conference of the ALP held in Canberra the extreme left wing demonstrated a similar tendency. For example, a certain lady spoke in the most sonorous terms. I refer to a Ms McLean. I must emphasise that I am not saying that this is Labor Party official policy. What I am saying is that the views expressed by Mr Hawke in 1976, when he was the President of the Labor Party, and now being expressed by people such as Ms McLean demonstrate the depth of conviction in the left wing of the Labor Party caucus and throughout the entire left wing organisation of this country which primarily has one view and one view alone, that is, to deny Australia the capacity to defend itself and, at the same time, to make jolly sure that the allies which have backed it in the past will not see it as a reliable ally in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) quite rightly pointed out to us that the amendments to the agreement in 1974 were carried out by none other than the Labor Minister at the time, Mr Barnard. That is true but the important thing is that in the House of Representatives on 5 May 1981 the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden)-the man who one day expects to be the Prime Minister, although I strongly doubt that he will ever make it-said:</PARA>
<PARA> We would seek to renegotiate the North West Cape agreement to provide, firstly, that Australia's consent is mandatory for all orders to initiate military action which flow from the station; and, secondly, that we will be given firm and convincing assurances that the station will not be used to send orders for a first-strike nuclear attack or to initiate a limited strike. </PARA>
<PARA>He repeated those words in other forums such as a luncheon at the National Press Club. It is quite clear that the members of the Opposition have never gone to the trouble-I include the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) when I say this-to get beyond the academic textbook when they try to consider the command and control procedures of defence. We were told by the honourable member for Wills how the Labor Government in 1942 forged the agreement with the Americans for the defence of Australia. Of course that is an historic fact but is he going to come in here-are any other honourable members of the Opposition going to come in here-and seriously suggest that we had officers sitting in the Pentagon from 1942 to 1945 looking over the shoulder of every communicator? Of course not. That is not the way one runs an alliance. It is certainly not the way to run defence and it is certainly not the way to possibly run any war. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that the parties on this side of the chamber believe that war ultimately demonstrates the failure of diplomacy. Nobody wants a war but it is the right of this Government-it is certainly the demand of the Australian people -that the country be adequately defended. One of the elements of the defence of Australia has been the need to enter into agreements which are holding on both sides and in which both parties are prepared to believe in the veracity of the case presented by the other side. What we have simply said in this debate is that whilst the Labor Party may say that the agreement of 1963, reformed in 1974 , is the basis of their policy, there is a contradiction. The contradication has been introduced by none other than the Leader of the Opposition himself. We have the right, therefore, to suggest that the Opposition which says to the Australian people: 'trust us, we will look after your interest, we will defend Australia' in fact speaks with a forked tongue-a forked tongue which started back in 1976 when the then President of the Labor Party quite clearly and without equivocation signed a public statement denying that he wished to support the ANZUS agreement. He now comes in here today and brings up every other possible subject one could imagine in a deliberate attempt to give a smokescreen to what is the essential problem of the Opposition, its lack of credibility and its inability to present to the Australian people a cogent defence policy in which all sides, Left and Right, are prepared to say that the ANZUS agreement is fundamental to Australia's protection and security, that the agreement on the North West Cape is an integral element of that agreement and that the Australian people can have confidence in its policies. I rest my case on the simple fact that from 1976 onwards those people who lead the Labor Party today have been dishonourable and dishonest to the cause of the defence of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday we witnessed in this House a rather stirring debate on the export of Australian fauna and flora. Interestingly, there was much bipartisan concern, which was not evident tonight on another issue, that adequate controls should have been exercised to ensure the welfare of these creatures and the preservation of species. I want to address this House tonight on another matter concerning Australian heritage. I refer to the matter of the disposal of Australian land to foreign interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Foreign Investment Review Board is supposed to have an adequate series of controls over the acquisition of Australian land by overseas interests. Most of this land of concern to the FIRB is land in excess of $350,000 value. What concerns me is that the Government either does not know the full extent of the foreign ownership of Australian land or does not care about it. There is little evidence that the Government is concerned about the kind of business that is growing up around this industry. Of course, this being a government which raises the practice of making a fast buck to the status of a virtue, this does not really surprise me. Nevertheless there are many who are concerned about the practices of this recently evolved industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular aspect that has been brought to my notice concerns the acquisition by Australian companies of old subdivisions in rural areas which are then sold to ill-informed buyers in foreign countries. Much of this land would come within the real estate threshold area exempting it from the major concern of the FIRB. Many of these old subdivisions were made in the nineteenth century when the areas were more densely inhabited than they are today. In my own electorate of Ballarat many were thriving gold mining townships or towns servicing rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> With changed circumstances the mellow patina of age has settled on these townships and they now have that gracious quality of a bygone era which provides residents with a quality of life which is the envy of many who live in urban Australia. But they are not rapidly developing towns. Much of this land which was subdivided in the nineteenth century has reverted to rural use, to all intentions as broad acres. Other estates were subdivided latterly but the assumption was that the land would be sold in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened is that some sharp operators imbued with the 'spirit of Stumpy Gully' have acquired considerable areas of land with the purposes of making a fast buck. A number of companies have gone off-shore to places such as Singapore and Malaysia with apparently attractive propositions to put to the unsuspecting and ill-informed prospective buyers from these crowded countries. As an example, in the Shire of Talbot-Clunes the Shire Secretary has informed me of his Council's concern over this matter. In that Shire over 30 such people have purchased land. As with the Shire of Grenville and the Shire of Buninyong this has introduced a number of serious problems. For example, in the Shire of Grenville there are between 20 and 25 foreign owners in rate areas. These average around $50 per block. This is what Mr Lindsay Oldham, Shire Secretary of Grenville Shire, was reported to have said by an article in the Ballarat Courier of 4 September 1981, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> About 40 two hectare blocks in the Shire had been bought by overseas people through some land sharks. He said many rate notices sent to Singapore had been returned marked 'address unknown'. </PARA>
<PARA>It costs $150 in legal costs to reclaim those rates. This situation is repeated throughout my electorate and I am sure in many other areas as well. In Grenville Shire now about 80 to 90 blocks have been bought by foreign owners. Many of these are two hectare blocks. The average purchase price of these is $11,000. Quarter-acre blocks on the outskirts of the town are selling at between $3,000 and $4,000. This is much higher than the local market is prepared to pay. The blocks are also completely unserviced. A number of the people who bought land contacted local agents when they discovered they had been taken and were told they have no chance of recovering their outlay. </PARA>
<PARA> Another effect, of course, has been the artificial inflation of the price of land to local townspeople and farmers. I do not know any benefits that have been gained by these sales unless the Government can convince me that quick exorbitant profits to land sharks and a lowering of our standing overseas are seen to be benefits. The cost of serving rate notices for rate arrears and for serving fire and hazard notices and for clearing these blocks is falling upon local ratepayers when owners cannot be contacted. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one more serious problem that has arisen in this respect. Recently in a letter to the Secretary of the Shire of Talbot-Clunes a Mr Kok Chye Boon of Singapore has indicated that the director of a company called Property Wholesalers of Australia Ltd, of 731 Glenferrie Road, Hawthorn had given an assurance which could not be honoured. He claimed that the director of the company assured him that if he were to build a house he would be granted permanent residence in Australia. Honourable members may draw their own conclusions about the purposes of this assurance. I seek leave of the House to have this letter incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some six months ago a former member of this House died. His death was duly reported to the House but no eulogy was read or tributes paid in this House of the Parliament. Tributes were paid in the Senate and his friends and family were touched by them. I refer to William Tevlin Arthur, who was a member for the seat of Barton between 1966 and 1969 and who met his death on 28 February this year. I rise at this time to record that many friends of Bill Arthur, or W.T.A. as he was known to many in this Parliament and beyond, are missing his company since his tragic death. It is not my intention to take much time of the House tonight in expressing a tribute. I believe all tributes paid to him were mostly eloquently epitomised by the Reverend Canon Ian George in his address at a memorial service for Bill Arthur on 24 March 1982 at the Church of St John the Baptist, Canberra. I seek leave of the House to have incorporated in Hansard a copy of that address as a fitting valedictory in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The address by the Reverend Canon Ian George at the Church of St John The Baptist, Canberra, on Wednesday, 24th March, 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>Memorial Service for William Tevlin Arthur</PARA>
<PARA>BILL ARTHUR was born at Arncliffe, N.S.W. in 1918, and was educated at Kogarah High School. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1934 he was involved with the Y.M.C.A. and was a voluntary leader since 1938. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill started clubs in Erskineville, Newtown and Darlington for boys who needed guidance. He visited Long Bay Gaol and went bond for a number of men who later became solid citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> He was a gymnastics instructor for many years and was nominated to represent Australia at the 1948 Lingiad World Gymnastics Festival in Stockholm-only held every 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1940 Bill joined the Australian Army as a Gunner, rising to the rank of Lieutenant. He served in New Guinea, Morotai and Borneo, and late during the war he was seconded to the Army Education Service to lecture to the troops on current affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> After the war, the ABC approached Bill to write and compere a series of radio coaching lessons and for some years he did this, branching out into freelance journalism, writing for many papers and magazines. </PARA>
<PARA> He was a champion debater from the age of 18. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally these gifts and experience led him to politics. Bill was a long-time member of the Liberal Party of N.S.W., its State Council and State Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> He contested the Barton electorate against Dr Evatt in 1954, 1955 and 1958, coming very close to winning on one occasion. Dr Evatt held him in high regard and gave him personal letters of introduction to some of the leading people in the world when he hitch-hiked around the world in the forties and fifties. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1960 the US Government gave him a Smith-Mundt Leader Grant to observe the US presidential election. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1966 Bill won the seat of Barton and held it until 1969. Subsequently he was a Research Assistant to PM Gorton (as he then was) from 1970-71. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill was a member of at least 10 parliamentary committees and his speeches display the value of his overseas travel experience. They show a deep concern for people, a fear of communism and a joy in the diversity of the world's races and traditions. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt some here will remember his speech in 1967 when he recounted his attempt to combat the party line given him by his guide in Moscow, apparently with some success. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill's emphasis was always on unity and courtesy. In one speech he refused to call people names. And all those to whom I have spoken remember him for his gentleness and honour. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill regarded his parliamentary duty as an awesome privilege to serve so many people in so many ways. His concern for his electorate and especially the poor, aged, sick and helpless was intense. </PARA>
<PARA> There are few men who have given a more constant and dedicated service to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fitting that we should be here this morning to give thanks for his life among us-especially in the Church which contains a plaque in memory of the service given by his friendly rival, Dr Bert Evatt. </PARA>
<PARA> It is good to remember Bill's own faith. </PARA>
<PARA> We thank God for Bill Arthur and commend him into God's hands, that he may go on from strength to strength in that Kingdom which we at this time barely glimpse. . . .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise in the adjournment debate tonight a difficulty involving representations that I have taken up with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges) on behalf of a constituent, a Mrs Maria Koncewica of Strathfield, who has been seeking to bring to Australia three relatives-two young women and a man-who are Polish nationals. These young people fled from Poland and are now living in a refugee camp in Vienna. In August 1981 my constituent applied for entry to Australia for these young people. She subsequently made three visits to the Sydney office of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs as she could obtain no information about these applications over the telephone. On 12 October 1981 my constituent wrote a letter to the Honourable Ian Macphee, the previous Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and also forwarded a copy to my predecessor as member for Lowe. Unfortunately, she received a reply to neither letter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 23 February 1982 my constituent and her husband went to the Sydney office of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, as they were becoming most anxious about their Polish relatives living in the refugee camps. On this occasion departmental officers advised Mrs Koncewica to sponsor the two young people who were women. She subsequently arranged for their fares to Australia to be paid through the Australian division of the International Catholic Migration Loan Scheme. She and her husband advanced a substantial sum towards bringing to Australia the three young people plus a relative of her husband. My representations were forwarded to the new Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on 20 May 1982. I have since interviewed this lady on several occasions. On 4 June the Minister kindly acknowledged my representations. Because of the worry the delay is causing my constituent, I wrote again to the Minister on 23 July. I informed him that the young man in Austria had been told that he should arrange his own fare to Australia. This was eventually arranged by telephone calls and by letter. He was then refused a visa. He was told he should wait for his cousin-one of the two young ladies-who would soon turn 18. The present Minister subsequently replied directly to my constituent that he regretted that she had not received any reply to her correspondence sent during the last year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is extremely difficult for me to understand why these young Polish nationals with relatives in Australia who are anxious to come to our land as refugees, with refugee status, are denied admission to Australia by petty restrictions and red tape. Initially I thought that this case may have been delayed by the accidental dumping of 600 current files from the Sydney office of the Minister's Department, which was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 24 July. Now, however, I believe that the delay is occurring in Vienna. I know that the World Assembly on Ageing was held in Vienna in July and that a Minister and a large Australian delegation attended. I know that in August an Australian deputation attended the United Nations Conference on Outer Space, also in Vienna. However, such conferences should not delay the important work of the Embassy; that is, the processing of refugees from Poland who wish to settle in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> These young people are fleeing from an oppressive government. The free world salutes and admires Solidarity and this Government has made some show of helping the Polish people. Regrettably, these young Poles living in a refugee camp in Vienna have been forgotten by the Australian Government. They are desplaced persons, they are away from their homes, families, and loved ones. They have nowhere to go, and they cannot obtain full time employment. I ask the Minister to investigate this matter, to examine these cases sympathetically and to take every possible action to bring these young people to Australia to be with their relatives as soon as possible. The conditions in the refugee camp are very difficult. I have raised this matter tonight not to embarrass the Minister but in an effort to obtain at long last some action for my constituent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are still experiencing considerable trouble in the coal mining industry in the Hunter Valley which I have the honour of representing. This week the general manager of Drayton Coal Pty Ltd, Mr Darcy Wentworth, expressed grave concern that the company's colliery in the Hunter Valley had not been able to commence operations. For six months the company has been prevented from employing mine workers. The executive has worked patiently to overcome the union ban on hiring labour. Two weeks ago, after long negotiations led by the Premier of New South Wales and the national leaders of the mining unions, agreement was reached to start mining. However, miners have not been allowed to sign on at Drayton. This is a great shame. It prevents this magnificant mine from starting operations. Drayton has vacancies for 145 men who could start work immediately and total employment would be approximately 400 people if the colliery were allowed to reach its full potential. We have unemployed people; and here would be an opportunity for them to gain employment if the union would approve the commencement of operations at this mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the mine's customers do not receive Drayton's steaming coal they are likely to buy coal from the United States, Canada, South Africa or perhaps, Queensland rather than from other Hunter Valley mines. We are not the only people who are marketing coal. We have opposition from the United States of America, Canada, South Africa, Brazil and other sources. The Hunter Valley's credibility as a coal producer has diminished in the last two years largely through industrial action resulting in a lack of port throughput. Now, when shipments through the Newcastle port have improved, failure to supply Drayton's customers will again raise doubts about New South Wales as a reliable export coal producer. There would be financial losses to the community in the area through the loss of wages and jobs and to New South Wales through the loss of royalties, taxes, rail freights and port charges. </PARA>
<PARA> Drayton colliery has firm contracts with customers in Japan, Korea and Europe. Construction began in 1980, after all necessary Government approvals were obtained, and the first shipment was due in October 1982. Owing to the union intervention, the company will certainly not be able to complete its first shipment of coal, which it had contracted to do. One Japanese customer, Kyushu Electric, was depending on Drayton as the sole imported source of coal for their Minato Power station which was recently converted from oil to coal. Drayton therefore will not meet its first shipment to Kyushu and unless mining commences shortly, this mine will not be able to satisfy other contracts which start in January 1983. What a shameful state of affairs to think that nothing is being done when we have an opportunity for employment, an opportunity for this mine to start operating and provide markets overseas for which it has contracts. I say shame on the unions involved because they are causing a problem which certainly should not exist. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure all honourable members who were in the House this morning were impressed by the device that was displayed to us by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron), a device which could be of assistance to search and rescue vessels which are distressed at sea. Unfortunately the device which was displayed by the honourable member for Fadden has already been superseded. The device was perfected by a constituent of mine, a Mr Laurie Bevan who lives in the town of Scamander on the east coast of Tasmania. He invented a device which does much more to aid in search and rescue than the device that was displayed today by the honourable member for Fadden.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3F4">Mr BURR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, I cannot show it to the honourable member. That is one of the problems that I wish to raise in the House tonight. The device has already been accepted for patent in Australia, the patent number being 486576. The device has been listed for a world patent. Mr Bevan has been working on this device for a number of years because of his concern about the cost involved in search and rescue and the number of lives that can be lost at sea. In his own time and with very little assistance he has perfected a device that will aid in all forms of search and rescue at sea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The device which Mr Bevan has quite ingeniously invented is one that can be attached to the deck of a vessel but can be activated only when it floats. As with the device that was shown to us this morning by the honourable member for Fadden it will be activated when it is turned upside down. When it floats it turns upside down and automatically activates a radio signal which has a 70 mile transmission, unlike the device that was shown to us by the honourable member for Fadden. It also has a flashing light that can be of assistance for night search and rescue. In addition to that the device is attached by a lead line to the deck of the vessel so that in the subsequent event of the vessel sinking, it can assist in the recovery at a later stage, if that proves to be feasible. Taken all round, I think that the House would have to agree that the device that Mr Laurie Bevan has invented has an all-round attraction for use in search and rescue and must supersede the device that was shown to us by the honourable member for Fadden. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all honourable members would have to agree that this device could be of immense value to search and rescue around the Australian coastline and could certainly help in reducing the number of lives lost at sea and with the recovery of vessels in distress. The difficulty that Mr Bevan is facing at the moment is that the fishing industry and those engaged in it are very keen to have this device attached to their vessels. What would be of great assistance in having this device marketed commercially would be for the cost of the device to be accepted by the Government as an allowable tax deductible item. That undoubtedly would be an incentive to fishermen and other owners of small craft to have this device attached to their vessels. Naturally in the case of distressed vessels the fitting of such a device must save a lot of money in the cost of search and rescue, not to mention the saving of lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bevan has suggested also that it would be of value to the insurance companies to provide a lesser premium for marine insurance to those vessels that have this device attached. The recovery at a later stage of a vessel would naturally be a saving to the insurance industry. I urge that the Government accepts the device that Mr Bevan has invented, that it does provide these incentives for it to be marketed commercially and that we give Mr Bevan every encouragement to further the development and marketing of his device. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Dawson, which is a rural electorate, is one of 19 electorates in the State of Queensland. Being a rural electorate it has an entitlement to a 10 per cent tolerance in the number of electors below that of the average of metropolitan seats. From the statistics for the Queensland seats which are recorded in the table just incorporated, I find that Dawson, besides being the fourth largest in area of all the electorates, has the fourth largest average annual growth factor at 3.48 per cent per annum; the fifth largest population of 136,735 and the seventh largest enrolment of voters of 73,458.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last three mentioned factors, the electorates that are consistently ahead of Dawson are the seats of McPherson, Fadden and Fisher, all held by the Government. Three of the electorates, which are Brisbane seats held by Labor- namely Brisbane, Griffith and Lilley-have negative growth rates of 1.24 per cent , 1.07 per cent and 1.09 per cent respectively. The populations on the 1981 figures for these three Labor electorates were between 93,464 and 103,078 compared with Dawson's population of 136,735. The voters who were enrolled totalled between 64,535 and 67,087 again compared with 73,458 in Dawson. One could possibly traverse the Brisbane electorates in half an hour, while to cross Dawson takes about eight hours by car. The figures suggest that the number of constituents is building up in rural seats to an extent that the 10 per cent tolerance is in reverse and is contrary to the provisions of the existing Electoral Act. </PARA>
<PARA> When Labor members talk about gerrymanders in Queensland they may care to look at the situation of the federal seats. Certainly there is a massive gerrymander that favours the Australian Labor Party. All seats held by it except two have negative growth factors; all those seats have fewer constituents to serve; and all of them are pocket size when compared in area to the constituency of Dawson. I believe that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) and the Government should look carefully at the predicament of a constituent in Dawson who is placed at a distinct disadvantage in trying to get equal representation for his inequal vote as compared with electors in Brisbane seats. In mentioning the electorate of Dawson, I believe that it is important for the House to realise that the electorate is responsible for between 6 per cent to 7 per cent of Australia's exports, making it one of the wealthiest and progressive of electorates in Australia. This explains its average annual growth and the increasing population. It is an electorate of opportunity for those who wish to work. </PARA>
<PARA> During this adjournment debate, I pay a member's tribute to Dawson's coal industry which supplies approximately 20 million tonnes of coal to the export market. I also acknowledge the tripartite approach of unions and State and Federal governments in keeping the Bowen Basin coal industry alive and alert as compared with the industry in New South Wales where mines are closing and export markets are being lost as described by my colleague the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O'Keefe) just a few moments ago. The unions, in putting forward their log of wage claims for annual review, scaled down their claims to a 2 per cent increase. I believe that this is a very positive and realistic approach to wage claims and would applaud the unions involved for their positive contribution in a difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Last month the Federal Government played its part by removing the levy of $1 per tonne of steaming coal, accelerating the depreciation write off for new plant and equipment, and retaining the investment allowance. This will allow intending mining companies to rewrite their cash flow projections and some ventures that previously could not have commenced can now do so. The State governments of New South Wales and Queensland announced separate measures to encourage investment. These ranged from lesser infrastructure requirements, longer lead time for payment of up front contributions and a new look at royalties and rail freights. Unfortunately for some this package was too late. Some companies have shelved projects or ceased projects because too many fingers were in the honey pot, that is, until the honey pot dried up. I hope that the example of the Utah miners in accepting lesser increases may be followed by the whole of the Australian work force in this present stagnant industrial situation . Those who are responsible in Queensland at this very time for the lack of essential services and blackouts might reassess their position accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note, Mr Deputy Speaker, that not one member of the Australian Labor Party is in the chamber at this time. I wish to refer once again to computerised legal information retrieval systems in Australia. On two previous occasions, I have raised this matter in the House. I do so now following recent developments especially in Victoria but also in New South Wales which are of such concern that the matter warrants the attention of the Government, all honourable members and, in particular, the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that the Victorian Government acting on its own initiative, and without the full agreement of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, issued an invitation for proposals to set up a State- controlled monopoly Computer Legal Information Retrieval System-CLIRS-in the State. The New South Wales Government subsequently issued a similarly worded invitation. No public announcement of a decision has been made, but it is known that Victoria is currently negotiating with one company to set up the monopoly and that New South Wales is currently working towards making a similar decision. There are indications that the two States will appoint the same operator, effectively creating a national monopoly. This situation will be of great concern to this Government, since a monopoly operation, whether State by State or national, is contrary to the Government's policy. The present position clearly will result in active Government control over the dissemination of legal materials which, by tradition under our system of law, should be in the public domain, and which should, all members would agree, be as free from restriction of access as is possible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pertinent to note by examining legislation recently introduced into the Victorian Parliament the degree of control that is envisaged. The legislation to amend the Council of Law Reporting in Victoria Act would make it unlawful:</PARA>
<PARA> To publish the whole or any part of reports of judicial decisions of any court in Victoria. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment has enormous implications. It purports to cover federal tribunals sitting in Victoria, as well as Victorian tribunals exercising federal jurisdiction. It could be used to stop the reporting of Victorian judicial decisions in the Press, and stop the summarising or discussion of cases in learned journals or text books. It could even be used to stop anybody quoting from Victorian decisions, as the Act has no fair dealing provisions, as in the Copyright Act. It retrospectively takes away from authors the rights to publish freely materials they have written about cases heard in Victoria. It will enable a body such as the Council for Law Reporting in Victoria, which has already tried to levy royalties on case books for students, to start levying royalties on any text book or looseleaf service that merely quotes or discusses a judicial decision heard in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Any legislation such as this should be soundly condemned by all, especially as it was introduced into the Victorian Parliament without general public debate. The Australian in its editorial on 31 July 1982 described this amendment as an ' intolerable attack on the freedom of the press'. The fact that the legislation is deemed necessary, when the Crown and Council purport to hold copyright in Victorian judgments, statutes and regulations, would indicate that the real purpose of the legislation may be to protect the monopoly operator from any competition whatsoever, whether in hard copy or electronic form, or to make other legal publication services, such as the well known loose leaf services, slower and more expensive to produce, and so make the monopoly computerised service more price competitive. A more sinister use of the legislation would be its use to suppress information or discussion about judicial hearings that were adverse to the interests of the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> All honourable members and the Government should soundly condemn legislation of this type, and condemn the move by New South Wales and Victoria to establish government controlled monopoly operations when private enterprise operators have shown their willingness to provide these services and to operate in a competitive market at no expense to government. In view of the Commonwealth Government's stated position that there ought to be more than one system, and that there ought to be competition in the market, I again urge the Attorney- General to take urgent steps to open access to cases, statutes and regulations, to encourage, and not hinder, private enterprise initiatives in the provision of computerised legal services, and to make a public statement of the Commonwealth Government's intentions in this regard. I also urge that the Commonwealth ensures that the public has unhindered access to the law by exercise of its powers under section 51 (xxv) of the Constitution, which enables Parliament to make laws with respect to 'the recognition throughout the Commonwealth of the laws, the public Acts and records, and the judicial proceedings of the States', and section 51 (xviii), which relates to copyright. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr Howard</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) For some years, studies have been undertaken within the Reserve Bank, the Treasury and elsewhere, with a view to compiling aggregates which might assist a broader analysis of financial developments that can be derived from narrower aggregates such as M1, M2 and M3. Such studies have revealed difficulties in both the measurement and interpretation of such broader aggregates, including those which have been termed M4, M5. Until those difficulties have been resolved , such aggregates need to be treated with caution. For these reasons, the Reserve Bank has not to date seen it as appropriate to publish a time series of broader aggregates of this kind. It does, however, publish a range of information on the public's holding of claims against non-bank financial institutions, based on statistics collected under the Financial Corporations Act ; these comprise data from which various broader financial aggregates (including M4, M5 and M6) can be compiled.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) On occasions, broader aggregates have been mentioned in official publications to highlight monetary developments not adequately captured by the standard measure M3. For example, in Statement No. 2 attached to both the 1980- 81 and 1981-82 Budget Speeches, it was noted that the broader aggregates have shown faster growth than M3 during recent years. The point was also made in the 1980-81 Budget Papers that M3 is itself not a definitive measure and the proper course therefore is to monitor a range of financial aggregates.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Seasonally adjusted data on the broader aggregates are unavailable and the compliation sought in part (3) of the question would therefore be meaningless. Instead, the following table records percentage changes for M4, M5 and M6 during the twelve months to the month shown since January 1980:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am not aware that there are delays in effecting payment of the statutory annual increases to pension, which are based on movements in the consumer price index.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. DFRB and DFRDB pensions are increased in July each year in line with the movement in the consumer price index for the 12 month period ending in March that year. This allows the first instalment of pension at the increased rate to be paid on the first payday in July. To use any later CPI figures would cause payment of the increased pension to be commenced from a correspondingly later date.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The present frequency of updating DFRB and DFRDB pensions was introduced following an independent non-parliamentary inquiry by Professor A. H. Pollard into the methods of adjusting Commonwealth Superannuation and Defence Force Retirement Benefit Fund pensions after retirement.</PARA>
<PARA> Professor Pollard's recommendations that Commonwealth sponsored pensions be updated annually in line with movements in the consumer price index, was accepted by the Government and implemented through the Defence Force (Retirement and Death Benefit Amendments) Act 1977.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that most State Government schemes provide for annual updating of pensions as do those private sector pension schemes that update pensions regularly.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr Sinclair</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A study carried out in 1979 to estimate the cost of converting all existing DFRB pensions to their DFRDB equivalent, indicates that the cost, at present day values, would be in excess of $12m (including retrospectivity to 1 October 1972) . The ongoing costs would be in the order of $2m per annum. In addition there would be a considerable cost associated with the implementation of any such proposal which could not be quantified at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA> However, if the thought behind the honourable member's question is that such a conversion would be desirable if financially practical then I would bring the following to his attention.</PARA>
<PARA> The 1979 study also indicated that the adoption of such a proposal would mainly benefit retired senior officers. It was found that two-thirds of the estimated $ 12m would be apportioned among 6% of the total number of DFRB pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1976, following the transfer of the assets of the DFRB fund to the Commonwealth, an actuarial investigation revealed an excess with accumulated interest of $8.3m which was distributed amongst all DFRB pensions. If there was to be any recalculation of pensions payable to DFRB pensioners, the justification for the distribution of the $8.3m would need to be re-examined.</PARA>
<PARA> Beneficiaries under occupational superannuation schemes generally are paid on their retirement the benefits for which they contributed during service in accordance with the rules and conditions of the scheme applying to them at that time. There would need to be the most compelling reasons to depart from this principle.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Due to differences between the United States of America and Australia in health and welfare service practices and funding, it would be difficult to draw too close a parallel between the study's conclusions and the situation that exists in Australia. Nevertheless, an internal review of the funding of family planning services which was completed by my Department in December 1980 found that, in the Australian context, family planning programs are cost-effective. It is even more significant that the benefit/cost ratios are particularly high where teenage ex-nuptial births are averted. In this case the benefit/cost for Government expenditure is likely to be of the order of at least 128:1.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has continued to provide acceptable levels of funding for clinical services provided by the Family Planning Associations. The major part of the costs of clinical services is met through Health Program Grants, the balance being made up from other income (for example, fees income). The total clinical expenditures authorised for Health Program Grant purposes since 1977-78 have been:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 April 1982 (Hansard, page 2023) Mr Kerin asked me a question without notice. His question concerned, inter alia, the importation of rice which may not be disease free and the quarantine and hygiene measures required for such imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have taken up this matter with the Minister for Health and now advise as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Unmilled rice and rice straw are prohibited entry into Australia because of the risk of introducing exotic diseases.</PARA>
<PARA> Milled rice may be imported under quarantine control to ensure it is free of pests and diseases. There is a permissible tolerance of 5 grains paddy and/or hulls per kg of imported milled rice which was accepted by the rice industry in 1978 as being in line with Australian milling standards.</PARA>
<PARA> My colleague, the Minister for Health, who is responsible for quarantine matters, is aware of the allegations and concern expressed by the rice industry . He has had these matters investigated and is satisfied that quarantine standards agreed to in consultation with the rice industry are satisfactory and are being rigidly followed. However, he has agreed to reconvene a meeting of industry and quarantine representatives to reconsider the tolerance in the light of present Australian milling standards.</PARA>
<PARA> Any representations from primary industry groups concerning quarantine risks associated with imports are carefully investigated by the Minister for Health. I am assured that Australia's high quarantine standards are being maintained.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. There are occasional instances when it is necessary to protect intellectually handicapped children from the possible consequences of aggressive or disruptive behavior on the part of a fellow resident. In these circumstances, a child who is placing others at risk is separated in a quiet room for a period of time not exceeding 5 minutes during which time the resident is under constant external surveillance. Strict records are kept of all such occurrences.</PARA>
<PARA> The need for a period of quiet segregation is generally acknowledged by members of the professions concerned with the care of intellectually handicapped children and is generally supported by the parents of residents in the Commission's hostels. Temporary separation is considered to be the only reasonable response in some cases of violently aggressive behaviour, particularly in a situation in which other children, smaller or more frail, may be at risk.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No formal qualifications are prescribed for hostel managers. However, substantial previous experience with the intellectually handicapped, preferably in a residential envirionment, is required. Desirable formal qualifications include basic and post-basic nursing qualifications in mental retardation or psychiatric nursing.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There is a one year special care course conducted by the Canberra College of Technical and Further Education in co-operation with the Commission for the training of hostel staff, including managers. It is intended that all hostel staff will have the opportunity to take this course. No other formal training is given to hostel managers. The Canberra College of Technical and Further Education also conducts a Certificate level Course in Special Care.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The draft Mental Health Ordinance was referred to the Australian Capital Territory of Assembly for advice. The Assembly agreed in principle to the draft ordinance and recommended that a number of amendments be made to the draft. Comments on the draft Ordinance are being sought from the Human Rights Commission. It is intended that the Ordinance be made during 1982.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="794" SPEAKER="Street The Hon A.A." NAMEID="FS7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="CAPRICORNIA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr Street</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The letter was an open letter and was circulated by ACFOA to various members of parliament including myself.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The Brandt Report emphasises the increasing interdependence between the North and the South and draws attention to the dimensions of poverty and the differing development needs of countries in the South. the Report appeals to the common interest of all governments in international economic arrangements which would promote more rapid development of the poorer countries. The ACFOA letter ' regards the Brandt Report as presenting a constructive and helpful package of proposals' while conceding that 'not all of the Report's proposals will be practicable or achievable'.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes. The ACFOA letter lists nine specific proposals, as summarised in the question, from the Brandt Report which it regards as meriting urgent Government action.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (i) The Government acknowledges the important role a public education program can play in creating an awareness and understanding within the community of international development issues and informing people about the Government's program of official development assistance to developing countries. The Australian Development Assistance Bureau provides information on Australia's official aid program to the Australian community and information on North-South issues is also disseminated through Department of Foreign Affairs publications. In 1981-82 expenditure on ADAB's information program is estimated at $63,000 to cover the production of a number of essential publications including reports, occasional papers, statistical data and information leaflets on particular aspects of the aid program.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The Government continues to endorse the internationally accepted aid target of 0.7% of GNP, and will endeavour to maintain its official development assistance at the highest level consistent with the needs of developing countries and Australia's economic and budgetary circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The Government recognises the importance of agricultural and energy research to the future development of third world countries. Agricultural research relevant to the needs of developing countries is fostered through research components in a number of bilateral agricultural projects supported by Australia. Assistance is also given to several international and regional research programs, principally through support to the 12 international institutes which operate under the aegis of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, an Australian Centre for Agricultural Research (ACIAR) has been established in 1981-82. The Centre is to provide a means for Australian institutions to undertake research on problems of importance to agricultural production in developing countries. The Centre will also encourage closer collaboration between Australian institutions and international agricultural research centres.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that international efforts need to be made to tackle the global energy problem and the particular problems of non-oil producing developing countries. Australia has been active in promoting regional initiatives designed to assist developing countries in their attempts to reduce dependence on imported oil. We fund the Commonwealth Regional Renewable Energy Resources Information Service (CRRERIS) and other activities established under the CHOGRM Energy Group. We have been active in promoting and have recently organised discussion on increased coal utilisation for ASEAN countries. Australia funded an energy planning workshop in Papua New Guinea in July 1981 for some twenty developing countries in the region and was a major contributor to the ESCAP Secretariat's study into the particular energy problems of the ESCAP region. In December 1982 Australia will host a UN Symposium on Coal for Electricity Generation in Developing Countries. The symposium, which will be held in Sydney and Newcastle, will be attended by some 32 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Finally, the Government supports the establishment of an energy affiliate in the World Bank.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Australia is sensitive to the concerns of developing countries and is sympathetic to third world proposals for overcoming the mass poverty and deprivation existing in these countries. Australia has taken concrete steps in various fields, such as energy, food and agriculture and trade in an effort to assist developing countries solve the development problems facing them. The developing countries have attached a high priority to launching a round of global negotiations on trade, raw materials, energy, development and money and finance. At the international level agreement has not been reached on the terms of an enabling resolution to launch these global negotiations but consultations are proceeding in New York and elsewhere. Australia has played an important role in attempts to reach agreement on global negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Australia is fully aware of the need for there to be an international trading environment directed to stimulating growth in world trade and beneficial to all countries, including particularly developing countries. We have emphasised the importance of a balanced international approach to reductions in levels of protection and have, more specifically, pointed to the need for international action to combat non-tariff obstacles to trade and to reduce levels of agricultural protection. These measures, if successful, would be of considerable practical benefit to developing countries and would assist them in sustaining their development programs. The Australian Government has been and is involved in a number of reviews examining the effects of trade protection on developing countries. For example, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne established an expert Study Group on the impact of protectionism on developing countries. This Study Group is expected to complete its report later this year. Domestically, the Industries Assistance Commission's various reports on levels of protection in Australia have inter alia been considered in the context of the impact of protection on our relations with other countries, including developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) During the 1970s the international financial institutions expanded and adopted their activities to meet changing economic circumstances. Australia has supported this evolution of their programs. We will continue to support soundly based improvement in the international financial institutions, in particular the IMF and the World Bank, which are of benefit to developing countries, while maintaining the basic roles of those institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) The Government is aware of a number of proposals concerning international taxation, the proceeds of which would be devoted to development assistance. The weight of expert assessment is that such proposals have substantial disadvantages, both of a conceptual and practical/administrative nature. Automatic transfers deriving from international taxation have far-reaching implications for relations among nations. A commitment to the principle of international taxation by levies on activities of sovereign states would involve a degree of derogation of sovereignty which most countries at this stage are unable to accept. For these reasons, the Government has serious doubts that a special UN study would assist in overcoming the essential problems associated with international taxation proposals. It would prefer international attention to concentrate more on other measures to assure volume and continuity of funds for economic development.</PARA>
<PARA> (viii) Australia is not currently a member of the UN Commission on Transnational Corporations, or of the working group on the Code of Conduct ( which has been established by that Commission). While this limits Australia's ability to participate actively in the negotiations to draw up a universally acceptable code, the Australian Government has supported the concept of such a code. The Government has constantly demonstrated its willingness to co-operate with the Centre for Transnational Corporations by responding as fully as possible to its requests for information and statistics. Collection of statistics on foreign investment in Australia by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as requested by ACFOA, has recommenced following a recent review by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> (ix) The allocation of defence spending is decided in the context of many competing demands. With limited resources available, the Government has to decide on priorities. Defence spending is properly within the portfolio of the Minister for Defence and matters relating to this subject should be referred to him.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) and (2) I am advised that for many years my Department has held to a policy of providing equal opportunities for employment although it has no 'program' for this. The policy applies generally throughout my Department, covers all relevant groups, is known to staff associations and has been maintained at a consistent level of priority by the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> Some idea of the effect of this policy in relation to women can be gained from the Public Service Board's 31 March 1982 listing 'Women in senior positions'.
