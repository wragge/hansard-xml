<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. The public of Australia knows that two Ministers have resigned from the Fraser Ministry. It is important that this Parliament be informed as to the reasons for their resignations. We know that the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) wishes to make a statement. There could be no more important business before this Parliament today than the honourable member for Warringah clearly indicating to the Parliament his reasons for resignation. It would be expected, of course, that the Opposition would wish to make some comment about that matter. Therefore, we are anxious to know at the commencement of the sitting of Parliament today the reasons for the two honourable gentlemen resigning. If only one wants to make a statement, that is his privilege. We are moving for the suspension of Standing Orders to put the procedure of the Parliament in order so as to give top priority to the most important matter before the nation this day, namely, the reason for the resignations of the two Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>PRIME MINISTER Monday, April 19 1982 FOR MEDIA</PARA>
<PARA>Resignation of Ministers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> With regret I have accepted the resignations of Mr MacKellar as Minister for Health and Mr Moore as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. Both Ministers tendered their resignations in view of questions that have arisen about their actions in respect of customs procedures and having regard to their acceptance of responsibility for those actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr MacKellar assures me, and I accept, that in bringing a colour television set through Customs last October, he had no intention either to mislead Customs or to evade duty. He has quite properly accepted responsibility for the incorrect declaration that was completed in his name. </PARA>
<PARA> The outcome however was that duty was not paid at the time-although subsequently it will be paid-and the Minister therefore appears to be in a preferred position compared with other Australians-something that Ministerial instructions issued in 1976 sought specifically to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Moore very properly followed-up the question of the incorrectly completed customs declaration form, but not to the extent of establishing whether the item brought in by Mr MacKellar was dutiable or not. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Moore has assured me, and I accept, that his error in not following up this question was an error honestly made. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has always upheld the fundamental principles of Ministerial responsibility, and that the appearance and reality of integrity are indispensable parts of our system of government. I have insisted, and our Party expects, that responsibility should be maintained. It is extremely regrettable that these instances have come into the path of otherwise outstanding performances by these two Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> The penalties in public office are high. Both Ministers accept this and have accordingly volunteered their resignations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my intention to recommend to His Excellency, the Governor-General, that the resignations be accepted. I shall recommend to His Excellency that, for the time being, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Brown, be sworn as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume, be sworn as Minister for Health, until such time as permanent arrangements are made. The appointments will be in addition to their present portfolios. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the Opposition will want to consider these documents. We have not had the opportunity to consider them at this point. I will come back to that matter. Some fairly obvious comments need to be placed on the record immediately. First, the circumstances we are considering today are the product of acts of great personal stupidity; they were morally wrong. It was intolerable that holders of high public office should have allowed themselves to engage in what was a rather unconvincing effort to mislead the public on this matter. What has transpired is the only proper course in all of the circumstances. What is extraordinary, of course, is that it took 24 hours for two members to attempt to put together a simple statement on what they claimed was a very simple and explicable matter. It took a long, tense and speculative weekend for the matter to roll along. Rather extraordinarily, it took a six-hour Cabinet meeting before a final decision was made which resulted in the two members terminating their services as Ministers. One could not have imagined, if the circumstances had not arisen, a situation in which two promising ministerial careers could be ruined over such a relatively trivial item as a $250 television set. One could not have imagined that the Government of the country would be in disarray, that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) again would be under such siege, and that the administration of the nation's affairs would be paralysed at a time of great economic and social crisis, probably the greatest since the Second World War-I repeat, all over a $ 250 television set. But whether the amount be $250, or $2,500,000, the principle is the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the question that we must ask ourselves is this: Does the matter stop there? It is a matter of regret for me that I do not believe that it can stop there. I believe that there are at least three serious principal matters which must be ventilated in this Parliament and which deserve more searching inquiry. The first concerns allegations of intimidation undertaken in an effort to prevent a Customs officer well down the line from properly discharging his duty. The second concerns implications of conspiracy. The third concerns the query: Did someone else in the Government know about these matters before they became public knowledge in the media late last week, or was someone within the Government, within the Ministry, in a position in which he should reasonably have known about such matters before the publicity occurred?</PARA>
<PARA> First, so that honourable members will understand the seriousness of the matters of alleged intimidation and apparent conspiracy, I quote the relevant sections of the Customs Act 1901. Section 232 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Whoever--</PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on to conclude:</PARA>
<PARA>by threats demands or promises attempts to influence any officer in the discharge of his duty, shall be guilty of an indictable offence, and shall be liable to imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding five years. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 232A states:</PARA>
<PARA> Whoever--</PARA>
<PARA>And in paragraph (b) it goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>endeavours to intimidate any officer, or any person assisting an officer, in the execution of his duty, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, upon summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding $500 or to imprisonment for any period not exceeding 2 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 236 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Whoever aids abets counsels or procures or by act or omission is in any way directly or indirectly concerned in the commission of any offence against this Act, shall be deemed to have committed such offence and shall be punishable accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 86 sub-section (1) of the Crimes Act 1914 states:</PARA>
<PARA> A person who conspires with another person-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to commit an offence against a law of the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to prevent or defeat the execution or enforcement of a law of the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to effect a purpose that is unlawful under a law of the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) to effect a lawful purpose by means that are unlawful under a law of the Commonwealth; or</PARA>
<PARA> (e) to defraud the Commonwealth or a public authority under the Commonwealth,</PARA>
<PARA>shall be guilty of an indictable offence. </PARA>
<PARA> Penalty: Imprisonment for three years. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: The allegations of intimidation and the implications of conspiracy represent potentially very serious offences. Therefore, the circumstances of this matter cannot end today. Those allegations and that implication must be thoroughly tested in an independent way. The allegations of intimidation have been commonplace in the last several days in the newspapers. I quote but one source; there are others which report the same sort of thing. The Sydney Morning Herald of 19 April states:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Some days after the incident the officer was taken to the Clarence Street headquarters of Customs, and interviewed by two senior officers of the department'', Mr Spanswick said. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Spanswick is an official of the Customs Officers Association. Talking about the officer, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> He was told bluntly to keep his mouth shut. He was told not to make any further inquiries and to make no written reports. He was told to accept that the matter had been settled at the ministerial level between the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore, and the then unnamed minister, on the understanding that it was a black and white set, and that would have been exempt from duty. </PARA>
<PARA>The point about this is, first, that this is a very serious felony. It does carry a penalty of imprisonment of from two to five years, and the evidence quite clearly on the public record in the newspapers is that the former Minister for Health, the member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), was told on two occasions that the colour television set in his possession was dutiable. That was established at the work face, at the entry point. The evidence I shall give in a few minutes makes it clear that from the top end, the remote end, of the Bureau of Customs, an assertion was being forced back that it was a black and white television and not a colour television, and that accordingly no action should be taken. I will come to that in a moment. That relates to the implications of conspiracy. </PARA>
<PARA> What is significant in terms of what I am raising is that an officer was told to shut up. He was told to keep quiet, even in spite of the evidence that he had seen before his eyes that it was a colour television set; even in spite of the fact that he had told the then Minister that it was a dutiable item and that duty would have to be paid. He was told that people in Canberra, who had never seen the television set, had concluded that it was a black and white television set and that the matter was ended. That is clear intimidation. I want to raise more questions in relation to that matter in a few minutes. However, the issue of conspiracy arises. Having had the assertion that it was a black and white television set rejected by the Customs officer at the work face and having seen him backed by his colleagues who work at that level, someone at the Canberra end persisted in the assertion that it was a black and white television set. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable members to today's Australian, in which this matter is fully explored in a report entitled 'Customs men say inquiry must go further'. On a later page a sub-heading states 'Matter should not be put to rest, say union officers'. The evidence on the record shows that the honourable member for Warringah, when he entered this country, was made aware that the television set, being a colour television set, was dutiable. The honourable member for Warringah wrote to the honourable member for Ryan, who was then the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, on 13 October. In that letter he proposed that he would pay any duty. There was no apparent reply from the honourable member for Ryan. It would be a remarkably incurious officer who, having received a letter from a colleague, or anyone, saying 'If I am due to pay duty on a particular item I have brought into the country I am prepared to do so', proceeded no further with inquiry on the matter and allowed it to rest there. I repeat that those at the bottom end of the system, at the front line, constantly said it was a colour television set but those at the top end fed back the assertion, in an intimidating fashion, that it was a black and white set and that the people at the bottom end had to shut up; they had to ignore their responsibilities under the law. Mr Kelly, the Collector of Customs for New South Wales, was caught in the vice in this matter. On the public record it is shown that he received advice from some source on behalf of the Government declaring that the television set was a black and white set and therefore no action should be taken , but on the other end he was being told quite bluntly by officers at the work face that it was a colour television and that they could not accept this sort of doublespeak because it was, bluntly, contradictory. </PARA>
<PARA> There are further questions because the matter does not pivot on the letter of 13 October, as we have been told. My office has received reliable information from more than one source. The information is to this effect: That Mr Kelly, the Collector of Customs in New South Wales, was advised on 5 October-the date of the entry to this country of the honourable member for Warringah, and the circumstances which led to this matter coming before the Parliament today-of the incident and that it was a colour television set. Our advice is that Mr Kelly then communicated with a Mr Vince Montgomery, who was then Deputy Secretary of the Bureau of Customs. He is now retired. The information received is that Mr Montgomery then contacted Mr Besley, the head of the Bureau of Customs, and that Mr Besley then contacted Mr Moore, as Minister in charge of Customs. It transpires, apparently, that Mr Besley was told that the set was a black and white set and that he was to treat it as such, and that information fed back down the line. That is the information or large portions of it, that my officers received from not one but three separate sources today. It fed down the line to Mr Kelly, who then told the people working under him that that was his advice and he had to proceed on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, there are questions if this is correct. We are not going to accept a mere assertion that it is not correct; we have had too much evidence in this Parliament of repudiation by the Prime Minister and by government Ministers of serious allegations, only to find with the expiration of time that there was substantial evidence to justify those allegations. If this information is correct-and it must be tested independently-why was the then Minister in charge of Customs in a position on 5 October to declare dogmatically that it was a black and white television set well before the question of its being a colour television set had arisen?</PARA>
<PARA> The question is: Did the Minister instruct Mr Besley to tell the Customs officers to proceed on this basis and to take any necessary action, either on that date or subsequently, to make sure that that was the story that stuck? Was the intercept officer, Mr Tony Mayhew, called into the Bureau of Customs and told not to make any report on this matter, to pretend that what he had seen he had never seen? Is it a fact that Mr Mayhew did persist in declaring that it was a colour television set? Was he told that he must not do that, that he must believe that it was a black and white television set? Was the failure to act based solely on the directive that came from a high level, either within the Government or within the Bureau of Customs, and in spite of the statements by the responsible intercept officers?</PARA>
<PARA> These are some facts which must be confronted. If the honourable member for Warringah says that he did not know that he had certain responsibilities about the payment of duty for bringing a colour television set into the community he would have to be deaf because he was told by the intercept officer on two occasions that the item was dutiable. If he did not believe that he owed any duty on the item why did he go to the trouble a little more than a week after the incident arose-when he arrived in this country-to write to the then Minister in charge of Customs advising that he was prepared to pay any duty? If the then Minister in charge of Customs did not know that it was a colour television set he would have to be blind and incurious, having received a letter on 13 May. In any case, how could he make a dogmatic decision, as he presumably did, before then, that it was a black and white set? Did the Minister in charge of Customs then prod Mr Besley, who was then head of the Bureau of Customs, in the course of action which subsequently unfolded? Did Mr Besley instruct his subordinates to shut up an honest officer, and any other officer who sought to give that officer support? If he did not, who did?</PARA>
<PARA> I ask for an extension of time to speak on this matter, because of its seriousness. There are some other matters in respect of which I want to raise the question of perhaps the Prime Minister's knowledge of this matter much earlier than late last week. In those circumstances, I ask for an extension of time. (Extension of time granted). On the basis of the law which applies in this matter, and which I have quoted, the allegations of interference in the proper conduct of the duty of an officer of the Bureau of Customs is a very serious offence. On the basis of published declarations on this matter coming from officers of the Bureau of Customs, it is clear that they believe that that offence has been committed. That cannot be allowed to rest today. It must be investigated further. On the basis of evidence which is available on the public record, the implication is obvious that there has been an effort at conspiracy to cover up in this matter. It is more than just a run-of-the-mill cover-up if there is such a matter. Under the law it becomes criminal conspiracy; it becomes a very serious offence. I repeat that the offences in this matter, if established, involve penalties of two years to five years imprisonment. That makes them major offences. </PARA>
<PARA> Flimsy falsification has been involved in this whole duplicitous exercise. Everyone on the cover-up end down here in Canberra-those who are near the Government, in the Government or working for the Government-has declared that the set was black and white to save the hide of the honourable member for Warringah. Everyone on the working end of the system says it was a colour television. Where and by whom did this concoction start? Who else is implicated? What is the nature of the conspiracy which was got under way?</PARA>
<PARA> There is only one other matter I want to raise, and that is the very serious question which I adverted to a few minutes ago. Again, my office has received information from a source which I would regard as reliable. That information is that either the Prime Minister or the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet received advice about this matter before it became public last week; before all of those events unfolded in the latter part of last week. Is this a fact? If it is a fact there is a very serious matter. Its implications are far reaching and therefore that is an issue that again we on this side of the House cannot allow to rest untested in this House today. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, in association with that, the rather curious behaviour this morning of Mr Jeff Townsend, the Parliamentary Liaison Officer. A little after 11 a.m. today Mr Townsend delivered the documents in relation to this matter which, as reported by him, would be tabled today. He delivered them to a Mr John Young who works in a senior position for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Immediately Mr Young, at about 11.50 a.m., brought into my office two bound volumes of the papers which were allegedly to be tabled today relating to the Moore-MacKellar affair. I will now quote from a note prepared by my principal private secretary, Mr Costello. Mr Costello said: 'I picked them up and Jeff Townsend, the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, rushed in, took them from my hand saying that there were some minor procedural errors in it and we would get them back in 10 minutes. I asked Townsend about an hour later where the papers were. He said they had to be changed and there were additional documents. They would not be made available to the Opposition before the House sat'. Why were the documents snatched from the hands of my staff member? If documents were to be added to the total, it would have been a simple matter to have delivered them. Were there documents which, in the view of the Government, retrospectively, should not have been included? If they should not have been included why, in the view of the Government, should they not have been included? Was it a matter of potentially the gravest embarrassment for the Government?</PARA>
<PARA> In all of these circumstances-I refer to the information conveyed to my office and the behaviour of Mr Townsend in snatching the documents and rushing off with them before anyone had a chance to peruse them-one starts to speculate on the extraordinary behaviour of the Cabinet sitting for something like six hours to make a decision on a matter which should have been clear cut in the Prime Minister's mind and should have been concluded within a thrice by him once the circumstances were clearly understood by him. So in all of these circumstances there are many serious questions which remain unanswered and there are many serious imputations which float about in a way which allows them constantly to stick to the Government in the most damaging manner. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances this matter cannot rest here. It is a very harsh penalty for the two ministers to have what clearly and incontestably were very promising careers cut short by this incident. If the matter rested at that point, that in itself would have been a melancholy fact. But the circumstances which I have raised today are at least equally as melancholy. I repeat what they are. On the basis of the public record there appears to be evidence of an attempt to interfere with the proper conduct and discharge of the duties of a Customs officer. It appears that this was undertaken by direction. That is a very serious offence. Secondly, it appears that a conspiracy was embarked upon to convert what was clearly in the view of the work face Customs officer, and established in fact subsequently, a colour television set into a black and white television set. That too represents a very serious set of circumstances. Thirdly , there is the matter of information being conveyed to my office by a source which I must declare is one I would regard as reliable that the Prime Minister or the Prime Minister's Department was made aware of the circumstances of this incident, if not fully, in clear terms some time before this incident became public knowledge last week. Therefore, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert:</PARA>
<PARA> 'the House is of the opinion that a judicial inquiry be established to inquire into and report on:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) whether the proper procedures were followed within the Bureau of Customs and at Ministerial level to investigate the importation of the colour television set by the former Minister for Health in October 1981 and, if not, whether there was a cover-up;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether a junior officer was victimised for carrying out his duty, both at the point of Customs entry by the former Minister for Health and in the officer' s later complaint;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) what actions were taken by the head of the Department in respect of all matters relating to the former Minister for Health and whether these actions were taken with the knowledge and approval of the Government;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendment. We are impelled to move for a judicial inquiry because of the very serious implications which are inherent in the allegations, some of which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has canvassed. I point particularly to the interrogation and the intimidation of a junior officer within the Bureau of Customs who, believing that he was doing his job honestly and courageously, was impugned, interrogated and intimidated by a departmental officer. I wish to paint the circumstances that led this officer to be involved in the case. The officer's name is Tony Mayhew. He has been employed in the Bureau for about 25 years. He has a meritorious record within the Bureau. He was the Customs marshal who first noticed that the then Minister for Health, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr MacKellar), was carrying a television set. Mr Mayhew asked: 'Is that a television set?' The reply was: 'Yes'. He asked: 'Is it a colour television set? ' The answer was: 'Yes'. He said: 'You have not declared it'. According to Mr Mayhew, the answer was: 'I am a Minister of the Crown and I don't involve myself with the detail on the back of a declaration form'. Apparently the former Minister will dispute that assertion. Nevertheless, that is Mayhew's claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mayhew then said to the then Minister: 'That set is dutiable. Go to that channel and report to that officer'-an officer named Woodley-'that you are carrying a colour television set and that it is dutiable'. The Minister went to the channel indicated. Officer Woodley started a preliminary examination. He got to ask only three questions-'Is this your luggage? Did you pack it yourself? Is there any other luggage following?'-when he was interrupted by his supervising officer, who inter alia conducted a conversation which the former Minister for Health has repeated on television. The officer said: 'Good morning, Mr MacKellar ; how are you?' The answer was: 'I am tired'. The officer said: 'Oh, come through', and Mr MacKellar went through. That is where his basic mistake was made. At that point he should have said: 'I will pay the duty before I go through'. </PARA>
<PARA> 'O what a tangled web we weave, when first we practise to deceive'. That is a very relevant quote. The whole matter could have ended very simply there. The careers of two very promising young Ministers in this Government could have been saved right there at that point, but they were not because the then Minister walked through and took his television set home. Officer Mayhew, upon learning that Mr MacKellar had passed through the point without interrogation or investigation, complained to the supervising officer. The supervising officer said to officer Woodley: 'Why didn't you tell me it was a colour TV set?' He replied quite simply: 'Well, you didn't give me a chance, did you? You took him away and I didn't have a chance to look at it'. Officer Woodley diarised all these facts; they are in his diary. He was then questioned in South Australia. He was a South Australian officer on loan to New South Wales because of extra traffic at the time of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> He diarised all these facts. He has been interrogated in South Australia by officer Drury and the Internal Affairs Unit 3 of the Department. I am sure that that is on file. He also claims that the time was 7 a.m. when it happened. The plane landed at 6.15. Anyway, Mayhew was not satisfied with the way that the Minister had passed through the gate so he complained. As I have said, he reported it to Pattison. Mayhew has consistently complained to his union that the proper procedures were not followed-that the Minister was allowed to go through the gate, which was evidence of preferential treatment for a Minister, evidence that duty had not been paid and that a false declaration had been made. He has consistently reported that to his union. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, the union consistently referred that to the Department. As I understand it, Mayhew has been interrogated by the Department on three occasions -on 18 January, 16 March and 19 October 1981. As I understand it, on every one of those occasions, Mayhew has stood by his allegation that the set was a colour set. The Department has consistently denied that. The Department, right from the top, has said that it was a black and white television. On the last occasion Mayhew was told that he was to stop saying that it was a colour television set and to stop making written or verbal statements about it. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) had decided that it was a black and white set and that was the end of it; it had been solved at ministerial level and Mayhew was not to go on making his statements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition views with great alarm that a responsible public servant, who was doing his job as he saw correctly on behalf of the Australian public, has been pilloried because he was honest enough to stick to his guns. Whether the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs knew this was happening is another proposition. I have no evidence to suggest that he did. But the fact is that the Department knew. The Internal Affairs Unit of the Department knew. It knew that Mayhew had been consistently interrogated and pilloried about the matter He was interrogated by Mr Alan Williams, the Assistant Collector, Port Services, in New South Wales, a man who was filling in for the Chief Inspector of Customs in New South Wales. As the Opposition we will watch consistently and very closely in the future officers Woodley and Mayhew-and officer Spanswick, who is the Federal Secretary of the Customs Officers Association and a preventive officer stationed in Sydney-to see what are their career prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> We had related in this House the odd spectacle of Mr Berthelsen of the Department of Defence who, having given evidence to a Senate inquiry, then suffered in his employment and was persecuted forever after. This will not happen to the three officers in the Bureau of Customs because we will make sure that it does not happen. We will make sure in the case of these people, who are honest and who are concerned, that their future prospects are not jeopardised and that their right to do their job responsibly is protected. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, once the union became fed up with trying to win justice for Mr Mayhew it went to the Press. The Press took this matter up last week and since then we have seen the very odd spectacle, as related by the Leader of the Opposition, of the two Ministers being locked up, quite peculiarly, for 24 hours -trying to present a solution, in a statement that was acceptable to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), because the Prime Minister obviously did not want to sack any more Ministers. Nineteen have already gone and this makes 21. Obviously he was trying to find a way around it. In the long run there is no way around it because the facts are undeniable. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Health, whether by intent or by accident, has impugned the law in three cases. He has made a false declaration; he has evaded duty; and he failed to sign the declaration himself. There is obviously evidence of a forgery there. We are not content to let the matter rest there. Very important principles are involved, quite apart from the staff. There is the whole principle of the collection of customs duties. The whole system depends on voluntary exposition to the officers on a declaration form of what dutiable goods a person is carrying. There is a very important principle here and the whole basis of customs collection revolves around it. Obviously if people were not prepared to make voluntary statements or if their statements could not be accepted as truthful, customs collection would be thrown into awful jeopardy. Every bag would have to be inspected. The system revolves around honesty. If the actions of this former Minister in failing to fill in his declaration form correctly and then failing to pay the duty are accepted as being standard behaviour, obviously the whole system is thrown into real disarray. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from all that, the ex-Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore, introduced a Bill into the House a fortnight ago to increase the penalties for the evasion of customs duties. In his introductory speech he mentioned the difficulties the Bureau of Customs has in collecting duties. I would like to quote from that correctly but I do not have it with me. It is on page 1371 of Hansard if anybody would like to read it. The ex-Minister pointed out quite lucidly and eloquently that the whole system of customs collection depends on the honesty of the importer or the person coming through the gate. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a piddling matter. The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out all the areas of the Customs Act that have been breached and the high penalties involved. Let us not dismiss this as a trifling matter, an error of judgment because the Minister, as he was then, was tired and failed to fill in his declaration form. This is not acceptable. In the back of that aeroplane were perhaps 300 people without the luxury of first class travel, as we members enjoy . They were sitting in a configuration of eight seats with no room to sleep comfortably, yet every one of those would have been held responsible before the law to make sure the declaration was filled out correctly. So it is not a piddling matter. </PARA>
<PARA> May I refer to the Prime Minister now that these two very promising young ex- Ministers have been removed from their jobs in rather tragic circumstances. I say that with some sincerity. The Prime Minister must now accept responsibility for the maladministration of this department. Surely every honourable member must believe, as I believe, the very sacred duty that a Minister has to his ministerial oath, to the whole system of parliamentary democracy, to see that his department is running correctly. The fabric of democracy is very fragile. There are very few democracies left in this world. In the Inter-Parliamentary Union there are, I believe about, 130 member nations. In those nations there are about 30 Oppositions, which indicates 30 democracies. It is incumbent on this Government to pull up its socks and to indicate to the people of this nation, who supported it in three elections, how important it is that its members realise just how vital is the system of ministerial responsibility. It is in the Government's hands. It is the Prime Minister's responsibility to see that this Government develops some form of propriety. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Prime Minister that he is sitting there on borrowed time. He has had 21 ministers sacked, resign or removed from office in six years. I will not recite the list. It is a very sad one. We all know who they are. Might I remind the Prime Minister that when Rex Connor resigned voluntarily in this Parliament he did so because he had made an error about a telex date. He had not bullied any public servant or broken any laws. He breached none of the statutes of this country. He voluntarily resigned on a matter of principle. This has never happened with this Government. Only two of the former Ministers have resigned voluntarily, with the exception of the late Eric Robinson and the Member for Kooyong. The rest have either been sacked or removed. Now the Prime Minister is faced with the problem of looking to the drones on the back bench to find two people and dress them up and make them look like administrators. It is not good enough. May I remind the Prime Minister that half the back bench do not want him. Half of that lot sitting there do not want him. That was clearly evident in the recent polling in the party room-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, let me return to this line, Mr Speaker. The evidence of the last week or so has shown us just what a shoddy Government this is. Ministers make what appear to be very superficial mistakes which have cost them very dearly and for which they have paid a very awesome price, but they are not the simple mistakes that the Ministers and the Government want to tell us they are. They are very serious mistakes and have very serious implications, including a lack of administration of a department and a lack of propriety by another Minister. Are things to be swept under the carpet as appears to have been done in this Department?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out to the House quite clearly that there has been a cover-up from the top of the Department to the work face. Apart from perhaps the New South Wales branch of the Bureau of Customs nobody has come out of this matter with any credit at all. I think there is some evidence to suggest that Mr Kelly up until the sixteenth of this month did not know it was a colour television set. There is some evidence to suggest the branch did not know . But certainly within the bureaucracy in Canberra and certainly within the internal affairs section of the Department there was a cover-up. It was known quite clearly from Mayhew's complaint on the date of Mr MacKellar's entry to Australia that this was a colour television. It has been on the record ever since. He has repeated it ad nauseam to no effect ever since only to be accused of being a liar and of making statements that are false. But we all know now that was not false. The public of Australia knows it is not false. It was quite evident in the letter that Mr Mackellar sent to Mr Moore on 13 October that it was not false. He knew it was a colour television set. Mr MacKellar was told by Mayhew: 'Go and pay your duty-that is dutiable'. He did not do so. Perhaps Mr Moore did not know, but somewhere in the Department there has been a massive cover-up, a cover-up of enormous proportions in physical terms but more in spiritual terms, because what has happened indicates the total moral bankruptcy of this Government which has been illustrated in the activities of one department. The people of Australia will not stand for it any longer. Why does the Government not go to the polls instead of its party room and let the people decide? Let the people of Australia decide whether the right honourable gentleman should be the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Yesterday I resigned as Minister for Health and the terms of my letter of resignation are public. I want to make it quite clear, as I have before, that I apologise for my mistake but I emphasise that it was an unwitting mistake. I would like to add to two matters which have been brought forward in the debate so far today. At no stage, to my recollection, was I told that the television set was dutiable and I emphasise that it was I who volunteered the information that in fact it was a colour television set. That fact is established on page 2 of the third document, dated 19 April, made available to honourable members. At no stage and in no way have I attempted to conceal the facts or evade any consequences flowing from them. Naturally I regret very greatly the incident and the subsequent embarrassment to the Government. I wish only to add that it has been a very great honour to have served Australia as a Minister for over six years. I have strongly supported the Government to the best of my ability, and I will continue to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

Under no circumstances, in the Westminster system, would Question Time be abolished as a result of the mishandling of Parliament by the Government itself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Fourth Report of the Department of the House of Representatives, for the calendar year 1981. I commend the report to honourable members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The presentation of the report of the Department of the House of Representatives provides me with the opportunity to remind the House that there is a need-an urgent need-for the House to seek to improve its efficiency as a monitor of Government administration through reform of its procedures. I mention one or two significant points.</PARA>
<PARA> I regret, as revealed in the report just presented, that the use of legislation committees over the last year has been minimal. I understand, however, that it is intended to refer a number of Bills to legislation committees this week. Legislation committees provide members with greater opportunities to examine Bills in a bipartisan atmosphere and I urge the Government to make them a more regular feature of the legislative program.</PARA>
<PARA> I regret that my efforts to change the nature of the office of Speaker to that followed at Westminster have made little progress. There would appear to be a good deal of public support for the proposal, which has included support expressed in editorials in some leading newspapers. Those writers seem to appreciate the difficulties and disadvantages of the present system. I am pleased to note also a degree of public support and the support of some newspapers for the televising of the Parliament. The newspapers now see it, as I have always seen it, as a means of heightening interest in Federal politics. The community is undoubtedly concerned about many current issues and the televising of proceedings will help to bridge the gap between the community and its elected representatives in this House.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the question period, after years of discussion about the inadequacies and difficulties of the period, in response to the Leader of the Opposition's motion, we are to have a review of our practices. Members will be asked for their views. I hope that the review will produce a satisfactory result , not only from the Parliament's point of view but also for the wider listening audience.</PARA>
<PARA> Although I have expressed some disappointment about progress in the field of parliamentary reform, much has been attempted. I have had preared a schedule which shows action on various reform proposals over the last several years. As I believe it would be of interest to honourable members I shall have it included in Hansard and circulated during the next few days. I shall welcome comments upon it.</PARA>

<PARA>Current situation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Speakership-Westminster Convention</PARA>
<PARA>Adoption of conventions associated with speakership of U.K. Commons (withdrawal from party politics, etc.) seen as</PARA>
<PARA> (a) important in itself; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) essential to increase authority of Chair and acceptance of decisions-with consequential improvement in standards in House</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker has promoted the concept on many occasions, e.g. speech to National Press Club, 8.6.78</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker subsequently circulated 2 papers on the matter,</PARA>
<PARA> In May 1979 on the convention, and</PARA>
<PARA> In October 1979 on ways the convention could be adopted</PARA>
<PARA>In May 1980 a ballot was conducted among Members on the establishment of an all party committee to investigate the matter</PARA>
<PARA>Proposals generated a number of comments-in press, e.g., editorials in Canberra Times, West Australian and within community wide-correspondence received</PARA>
<PARA> 80 replies received (within time); 47 in favour of committee; 32 against; 1 informal.</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker indicated he would seek nominations to committee; he wrote to Whips but matter was not finalised</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition argued that such reforms should be investigated as part of a more comprehensive review of Parliament's operation (Mr Hayden gave notice of a motion proposing a joint committee on the operation of Parliament 22 .5.80, notice was again given in the new Parliament. Not yet called on)</PARA>
<PARA>Proposals not yet resolved, Government has indicated it does not support them</PARA>
<PARA>Televising of Parliament</PARA>
<PARA>Televising of proceedings has been seen as bringing Parliament to the people and modifying the sole interpretive role of the media. Canadian experience, where televising commenced in 1977, in particular, has been observed keenly</PARA>
<PARA>The Joint Committee on Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings reported that it was desirable to televise the Parliament and made recommendations as to the manner in which this might be carried out. PP 61 (1974). In October 1979 the Clerk circulated a discussion paper, recommending televising of selected proceedings of House and proposing a Parliamentary Television Unit be established to produce coverage (and be responsible to a Parliamentary Committee to be appointed to oversight the matter). Speaker has often (e.g. to National Press Club and 1978 Presiding Officers' Conference) strongly advocated televising, being of the view that it would do more than any other single matter to assist in the restoration of Parliament to its proper standing in the Community</PARA>
<PARA>Neither the House nor the Senate debated the report or its recommendations, though part of 1974 Joint Sitting was televised</PARA>
<PARA>Issue unresolved, but planning for Parliament House incorporates facilities for televising as integral part of plans</PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary Appropriation</PARA>
<PARA>Greater independence for Parliament in the management of its own affairs has been seen as essential. The situation of Parliament charged with oversight of the executive, but being subject to executive control of its own finances etc. is unacceptable</PARA>
<PARA>During 1978 the Speaker (and President) made representations to the Government proposing the establishment of a committee of the House (empowered to meet with a similar Senate committee) chaired by the Speaker to examine and confirm Parliamentary estimates prior to their inclusion in the Government's Budget documentation. It was envisaged the proposals would provide the basis for the subsequent development of a series of 'one line' appropriations for the separate Parliamentary Departments</PARA>
<PARA>Deferred by the Government in favour of an alternative proposal to have the Speaker submit the estimates to the Minister for Finance and any subsequent areas of contention being subsequently discussed at Ministerial level. During 1980 this was again deferred. A proposal to increase the flexibility of the Department's management of funds voted to it resulted in the Government's agreement to consolidate several items under a common head of expenditure, thus improving all Parliamentary Departments' ability to allocate resources to meet changing and developing needs</PARA>
<PARA>In a February 1979 Report the Standing Committee on Expenditure recommended that measures which would enable the House to influence the preparation of its own estimates of expenditure should be discussed in the debate on the committee's report. Pp 66 (1979)</PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response was that it had acknowledged the special character of parliamentary estimates and agreed to the amalgamation of some appropriation items for administrative expenses in the 1979-80 appropriation bills, thus permitting the Presiding Officers a degree of flexibility in the management of these funds. Proposals for the formulation and examination of Parliament's estimates for 1980-81, involving personal consultation between the Presiding Officers and Leaders of the 2 Houses, had been conveyed to and accepted by the Presiding officers (H.R. Deb (4.3.80) 581). Debate on the Government's response to the report was inconclusive</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker proposed during 1980 that the appropriations for the House be further consolidated to provide for a 2 line appropriation to cover salary and O /T payments and other administrative expenses</PARA>
<PARA>The Government rejected this proposal on the basis that separate control could not then be exercised of overtime and any relaxation of control in the administrative expenses appropriations would not provide for reasonable disclosure of the Parliament's expenditure proposals</PARA>
<PARA>In the main Appropriation Bills for 1981-82 details as finalized in relation to the Parliament had been altered from what had been submitted but no reconciliation had been sought by Executive</PARA>
<PARA>In June 1981 a Senate Select Committee recommended that the appropriations for Parliament be included in a separate Parliamentary Appropriation Bill and that the Public Service Act be amended to vest in the Presiding Officers the power of appointment, promotion, creation, abolition and reclassification of offices and the determination of rates of pay and conditions of service</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker referred to matter and to wider issues, when appearing before Estimates Committee A on 8 September 1981. The Committee agreed to resolutions that (a) in appropriation procedures for 1982-83 funds for Parliament should be contained in a separate single line Appropriation Bill, etc. and (b) it registered its disquiet at many of the proposed cuts in real terms</PARA>
<PARA>On 18 November 1981 the Senate passed a resolution endorsing the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, resolving that the Senate establish a Standing Committee to consider the Senate's appropriations and staffing and listing five other actions to be taken in relation thereto; resolution conveyed to House. On 25 March the Senate established a Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing</PARA>
<PARA>On 25 March 1982 the House noted the Senate message. The Leader of the House, in explaining the Government's position stated that Government needed to maintain control over the total amount of funds available for expenditure by the Parliament, there would be a separate parliamentary appropriation Bill, 3 Advances would be made to the Presiding Officers, control of staff would be given to the Presiding Officers and the Government did not intend that the House would establish a committee as the Senate proposed to do</PARA>
<PARA>Committees-major review of areas covered, operation, etc.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the late 1960's and early 1970's proposals have been advanced for a more effective committee system, reflecting disquiet that the Parliament, and House in particular, was not an effective monitor of the activities of the executive. These proposals have been re-iterated a number of times in more recent years</PARA>
<PARA>The Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee system was first established in 1974 and reported on 'A Proposed System of Committees for the Australian Parliament' (PP275 (1975)) and 'A New Parliamentary Committee System' (PP128 ( 1976)). These reports contained wide ranging proposals for overhaul of the committee system</PARA>
<PARA>Neither report has been formally debated by the House. The recommendation regarding legislation committees was later taken up by the House (see below)</PARA>
<PARA>The House has basically continued to re-appoint a number of investigative committees which together only cover limited areas of Government activity</PARA>
<PARA>Most significant overall development was appointment of House Standing Committee on Expenditure (first appointed April 1976)</PARA>
<PARA>The Clerk issued a discussion paper 'Development of a Committee System' recommending the establishment of a system of finance and government operations committees for the House, to cover major areas of Government activity (August 1979)</PARA>
<PARA>Reasonable press coverage</PARA>
<PARA>Legislation Committees   In its May 1976 report the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System recommended, inter alia, that standing orders be amended to provide for the appointment of legislation committees to consider bills in detail after they have passed the second reading</PARA>
<PARA>After the recommendation was considered by the Government and Opposition, the Standing Orders Committee recommended sessional orders to provide for the operation of legislation committees on a trial basis. PP133 (1978)</PARA>
<PARA>In June 1978 the House adopted sessional orders for the establishment and operation of legislation committees</PARA>
<PARA>Sessional orders have been adopted for the current Parliament but legislation committees have been used sparingly (7 bills considered in 1978, 2 in 1979 and 4 in 1980). Nevertheless these have provided considerable opportunity for a thorough analysis of the bills in a more bi-partisan atmosphere while Chamber time has been saved</PARA>
<PARA>Estimates Committees   There has been some dissatisfaction at the effectiveness of the House's financial procedures for scrutinising Government expenditure. In its 1976 report the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System stated the House had not fulfilled its role of financial scrutiny and saw widespread support for the House developing effective committees of financial scrutiny but less agreement on the type of committee(s) required. Support was later given by the Government Members' Parliamentary Reform Committee and others for the establishment of estimates committees</PARA>
<PARA>In June 1979 the Government presented for Members' consideration and comment draft sessional orders providing for the establishment of estimates committees</PARA>
<PARA>In September 1979 proposed sessional orders were submitted to the House which referred them to the Standing Orders Committee. The Committee recommended the adoption of the proposed orders with some modifications and these recommendations were agreed to by the House. In 1979 2 Estimates Committees operated, in 1980 4 operated. In each case, despite criticism on specific points a number of benefits were gained, e.g. time available, saving in time of House, opportunity for more thorough consideration of expenditure proposals and contact with officials</PARA>
<PARA>Sessional orders providing for the establishment and operation of 6 estimates committees have been adopted for the current Parliament. These operated in 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Days and hours of sitting</PARA>
<PARA>For some years there has been concern to modify sitting hours so that they were both more predictable (e.g. time of rising) and, if possible, involved fewer late nights. There have also been proposals to change the sitting day pattern</PARA>
<PARA>Automatic adjournment first introduced in 1970 when the then Mr Snedden was Leader of the House. During Snedden Speakership basic sitting hours have been 2. 15 Tuesday and Wednesday, 10.30 Thursday, with adjournment moved at 10.30 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA>In May-June 1978 an experiment was tried involving sitting for 2 weeks of 4 days followed by a 2 week break</PARA>
<PARA>In Budget sittings 1978, House reverted to former pattern. Some dissatisfaction expressed, particularly when workload and pattern of Parliamentary life was associated with premature death/illness of Members</PARA>
<PARA>In 1979 Mr Cohen revived discussion on reform, proposing earlier sittings on each day, and earlier rising. Dr Everingham also proposed major changes, including a 'week on'-'week off' pattern</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker agreed on need for review. Mr Cohen pursued matter in 1980. Mr Speaker indicated no reasons why proposals should not be tried</PARA>
<PARA>In March 1981 Senator Martin proposed regular earlier starts and earlier adjournment</PARA>
<PARA>In May 1981 a ballot was conducted by Mr Speaker giving Members the opportunity to indicate if they wanted a change</PARA>
<PARA>80 out of 102 Members favoured a change</PARA>
<PARA>A subsequent ballot was conducted by Mr Speaker to ascertain the preferred option</PARA>
<PARA>The most popular alternative was for 12.30-7 p.m. Tuesdays and Wednesdays and 10 .30 a.m.-7 p.m. Thursdays</PARA>
<PARA>A preferential ballot was conducted on 10 June in Government Party room using different options</PARA>
<PARA>The result was for 1.45 p.m. starts Tuesday and Wednesdays and 10 a.m. on Thursdays, with 10.30 p.m. adjournment</PARA>
<PARA>These hours tried experimentally from 20 August by use of sessional order</PARA>
<PARA>On 11 March 1982 Senator Grimes gave a notice of motion that would drastically alter the days and hours of sitting for the Senate</PARA>
<PARA>On 25 March 1982 the Senate agreed to Senator Grimes amended motion altering the Senate hours of sitting. The new hours are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Tuesday-</PARA>
<PARA> 1.45 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA>Wednesday-</PARA>
<PARA> 1.45 p.m. to 11.00 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA>Thursday-</PARA>
<PARA> 10.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA> (No break for lunch)</PARA>
<PARA>Accommodation (excluding new Parliament House)</PARA>
<PARA>In April 1978 the Presiding Officers proposed to the Government that West Block and the Hotel Kurrajong be made available for parliamentary purposes in view of the desperate accommodation position in which the Parliament found itself</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1978 the Government announced that it had decided to proceed with the design and consideration of a permanent Parliament House and drew attention to the need, as a corollary of that decision, for maximum restraint in respect of additional expenditure on the present building</PARA>
<PARA>The Presiding Officers indicated to the Government that its response offered no adequate solution to the immediate needs of the Parliament let alone those likely to arise in the next eight years. In March 1980 the Presiding Officers renewed their request for the use of West Block</PARA>
<PARA>In September 1979 the Government informed the Presiding Officers that it intended to retain West Block for use by Government Departments and that it considered the Hotel Kurrajong the most suitable location to have parliamentary staff unable to be located in Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>In September 1980 the Speaker made a statement on accommodation problems confronting Parliament and announced that he and the President proposed to establish Presiding Officers Committees to advise them on the matter</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1980 the Government acknowledged that the location of parliamentary staff at the parliamentary annex and Hotel Kurrajong was not convenient and offered the use of East Block to the Parliament, after the departure of the Department of Administrative Services to West Block</PARA>
<PARA>In June 1981 the Presiding Officers accepted the offer of East Block and requested the allocation of the Kurrajong in its entirety until 1988. Parliamentary staff are schedwled to move into East Block late in 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Administrative matters-</PARA>
<PARA> House of Representatives Department</PARA>
<PARA>In ensuring that Department be able to meet needs of House at optimum level a number of reorganisation proposals had been conidered, however it was decided to have outside expert consultants review the operational effectiveness of the Department</PARA>
<PARA>P.A. Consulting Services, with officers from this Department and the Public Service Board reviewed operation in 1977</PARA>
<PARA>A number of changes made, some forthwith, others progressively since report made</PARA>
<PARA> Joint Departments   It was concluded that there could be value in a joint management review of the three 'service' Departments</PARA>
<PARA>Urwick International, as part of a team, undertook a joint review of the three Departments in 1980</PARA>
<PARA>Some recommendations have been implemented, others are still under consideration</PARA>
<PARA> Information systems   Each Department within Parliament had been taking steps to equip itself to meet the increasing demands for information in the most efficient way, but potential benefits were seen in a co-ordinated approach</PARA>
<PARA>Logica Pty Ltd, with a team of officers from the Parliament and assistance from the Public Service Board, conducted a review in 1980. Members were encouraged to participate in this exercise. A report was presented outlining a long-term plan for meeting the Parliament's information needs</PARA>
<PARA>The Parliamentary Departments have adopted a number of the recommendations</PARA>
<PARA>A Steering Committee, covering the Parliamentary Departments, oversees progress in this area and makes recommendations to the Presiding Officers as necessary</PARA>
<PARA>Privilege-general (and see micro issue)</PARA>
<PARA>In its report dated 5 April 1978 the Committee of Privileges strongly recommended to the House that the whole question of parliamentary privilege should be referred to it in the broadest possible terms for investigation and report (PP120 (1978) )</PARA>
<PARA>The House agreed in principle with the Committee's recommendation but was of the opinion that the proposed investigation should be undertaken by a joint select committee (VP 1978-80/147-8)</PARA>
<PARA>Privileges Committee repeated recommendation for major inquiry, in 1981 reports</PARA>
<PARA>On 23 March House agreed to terms for wide ranging joint inquiry. Resolution conveyed to Senate</PARA>
<PARA>Procedural development-</PARA>
<PARA> House of Representatives Practices</PARA>
<PARA>Over the years there has been some criticism regarding the House's reliance on Commons' procedure and practice as expressed in May and the need for an authoritative reference text on the practice and procedure of the House has been regularly expressed</PARA>
<PARA>In October 1975 Speaker Scholes raised the need for such a text with the Standing Orders Committee. The Committee agreed that the matter be proceeded with as a matter of urgency. In November 1976 the Standing Orders Committee of the 30th Parliament agreed in principle with the need for the work</PARA>
<PARA>Work commenced on the text almost immediately and the establishment of the Procedure Office in 1978 enabled greater attention to be given to the project</PARA>
<PARA>The completed text, House of Representatives Practice, was published in December 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Procedure Committee   Some advantages have been seen in changing the present system of bringing about procedural change in that the Standing Orders Committee has been seen as being too unwieldy and not suited to take a positive and continuing role in parliamentary reform</PARA>
<PARA>In 1976 the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System recommended that the House establish a Committee on Procedure to maintain a continuing surveillance of practice and procedure with a view to making recommendations for their improvement or change and for the development of new procedures. The Committee also recommended that no office holders other than the Speaker and his deputy be eligible for appointment</PARA>
<PARA>Notices have been given under general business of motions to appoint such a committee</PARA>
<PARA>In August 1981 the House negatived a general business motion moved by Mr Scholes proposing the establishment of a committee to maintain a continuing surveillance of the practices and procedures of the House</PARA>
<PARA>The subject of the appointment of a committee on procedure is scheduled for discussion at the next meeting of the Standing Orders Committee</PARA>
<PARA>Review of standing orders</PARA>
<PARA>There has been no major review of the standing orders since that completed in 1962</PARA>
<PARA>Revision of the standing orders has been listed as a matter for priority consideration by the Procedure Office following completion of the House of Representatives Practice</PARA>
<PARA>Programming of business of the House</PARA>
<PARA>Members have expressed reservations as to the way the business of the House is programmed and in May 1979 Mr Speaker was asked inter alia to give consideration to the 'ad hoc process of dealing with legislation'</PARA>
<PARA>In a considered reply the Speaker stated that to achieve proper programming of business it would be desirable to establish a business programming committee, ideally consisting of the Leader of the House, the manager of Opposition business, the Whips and the Speaker (as Chairman)</PARA>
<PARA>(Earlier, in November 1978, Mr Speaker proposed to the Government Members' Parliamentary Reform Committee that he should be authorised to conduct a ballot twice each year to determine the order of general business notices received up to that time)</PARA>
<PARA>Later in May 1979 the Speaker raised the matter again in a letter to the Leader of the House</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the House undertook to respond to the suggestion in detail later</PARA>
<PARA>On 18 February 1982, standing order 101 was amended, for session, altering the position for presentation of petitions in the routine of business</PARA>

<PARA>Question without notice-</PARA>
<PARA> General   In recent years there have been frequent complaints in the House regarding the length and relevancy of answers to questions without notice. The Speaker has pursued the present standing orders to the limit and requested or directed Ministers to conclude answers in some cases</PARA>
<PARA>In October 1975 the Committee considered a proposal that S.O. 145 be amended to give the Speaker greater control over content and length of answers. Though there was a concensus in favour of vesting more power in Mr Speaker, the Committee decided to defer further consideration of the matter</PARA>
<PARA>The matter (in particular the length of answers) has been placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Standing Orders Committee. There is also an agenda item that Commons practice be investigated (Its features are quite different from House practice)</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1978 the Speaker proposed to the Government Members' Parliamentary Reform Committee that the Speaker should be given absolute discretion to control the length and substance of questions asked without notice and both the length and relevancy of replies</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker has used his discretion to allow Ministers to later add to or qualify answers given to questions without notice</PARA>
<PARA>On 25 February 1982 the Leader of the Opposition moved that matters relating to conduct of question time be referred to the Standing Orders Committee. These matters included definition of relevancy in asnwers, length of answers, practice regarding supplementary questions, Senate Ministers attending House to answer questions, specified days for questions to certain Ministers and Question time be minimum of 45 minutes. Motion agreed to</PARA>
<PARA>22.3.82</PARA>
<PARA>Supplementary questions   In November 1978 the Speaker proposed to the Government Member's Parliametary Reform Committee that the Chair should be able to exercise its discretion and allow supplementary questions, and, should it be considered necessary to maintain the balance of questions from each side of the House, the practice of alternating the call from side to side be altered in favour of one which would even out the call over a particular question period or week</PARA>
<PARA>Matter has not been pursued</PARA>
<PARA>On 24 February 1982 the Leader of the Opposition sought to ask a supplementar question. Speaker did not allow. when questioned by point of order Speaker stated he would continue practice of alternating call. Speaker said he would refer matter raised to Standing Orders Committee. Motion of referral moved by Mr Hayden and agreed to on 25 February.</PARA>
<PARA>Rostering of Ministers to answer questions in both Houses</PARA>
<PARA>Over the years the proposal that Ministers be rostered to answer questions in both Houses has been raised on a number of occasions</PARA>
<PARA>Though the matter was on the agenda for its first meeting in 1976 the Committee resolved that it be stood over</PARA>
<PARA>*Concern has been expressed at number of Standing Orders Committee reports presented but not dealt with by House</PARA>
<PARA>Petition   With the remarkable growth in the volume of petitions presented to the House in recent years, there has been concern expressed at the time taken up by their receipt by the House</PARA>
<PARA>The Standing Orders Committee considered the matter in some detail in 1972 and recommended revised procedures to the House. (PP20(1972), presented 21 March 1972)</PARA>
<PARA>The House adopted the revised procedures</PARA>
<PARA>In 1976 the Committee considered a proposal that the time of presentation be altered but agreed no change should be made</PARA>
<PARA>Because of the increasing number of petitions the Clerk's announcement was seen as increasingly taking up prime parliamentary time. For a short period in November 1979 the Clerk's announcement was altered so that Members' names were used instead of electorates and this drew comment by some Members</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1979 the Standing Orders Committee once again reported on the presentation of petitions. The Committee recommended that the time for the presentation of petitions be altered. The Committee was also of the view that the Clerk's announcement should refer to Members by electorate rather than by name and the prayer should breifly indicate the action required. (Report presented 15 November 1979, pp 345 (1979))</PARA>
<PARA>The report was not considered by the House</PARA>
<PARA>Matter has been placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Standing Orders Committee. In the 1981 budget period of sittings (so far) petitions have taken some 6 minutes each day. Matter raised in House 22.10.81 Mr Speaker outlined situation, indicated he would raise matter with Leader of the House</PARA>
<PARA>On 18 February 1982 a motion was agred to, for the remainder of session, altering the routine of business followed each day. The change involved moving petitions from No. 1 to No. 6 in the order. As a result petitions now follow notices, questions without notice, presentation of papers, ministerial statements and matters of public importance. The reason for the change was the length of ''prime time'' being taken to read the list of petitions.</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed abolition of standing order 1 (Reference to Commons practice)</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate decided against adopting a similar standing order in 1903</PARA>
<PARA>In December 1980 the Committe discusses a proposal that standing order 1 be abolished</PARA>
<PARA>The December 1981 publication of House of Representatives Practice may have some bearing on the issue. The matter has been placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Standing Orders Committee</PARA>
<PARA>Discretions of the Chair (e.g. Closure, Closure of Member, points of order and unnecessary calls for divisions and quorums)</PARA>
<PARA>Vesting more discretionary powers in the hands of the Chair in procedural matters could greatly enhance the Speaker's ability in maintaining order and so do much to restore the dignity of Parliament. It is argued that such discretions will help raise the standing of the chair and that all sides would respond to this</PARA>
<PARA>On the recommendation of the Committee and after trial as a sessional order the standing orders were amended in 1978 to give the Speaker some discretion in the case of the absence of a quorum during a sitting of the House. Other issues not involved</PARA>
<PARA>Matter has been placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Standing Orders Committee. Speaker has interpreted provisions of existing standing orders as fully as possible, and has, on occasions, used his discretion in declining to accept closure of Member motion. Mr Speaker gave a private ruling on matter on 11.2.78</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1978 the Speaker proposed to the Government Members' Parliamentary Reform Committee that the Speaker should possess the authority to decline to accept a closure motion if, in his opinion, insufficient opportunity had been available to debate an issue and that he should be able to refuse to accept a motion for closure of a Member if, in his opinion, the Member has not had a reasonable opportunity of putting his point of view</PARA>
<PARA>Other discretions seen by some as desirable to enhance the role of the Chair are discretions to:</PARA>
<PARA> grant greater indulgences to allow Members to speak to certain matters arising in the House (e.g. sub judice and privilege matters and other occasions where the use of such discretion may prevent the House entering into turmoil);</PARA>
<PARA> control unnecessary calls for divisions and quorum calls, and</PARA>
<PARA> accept or reject motions without notice to suspend standing orders moved during debate on other business</PARA>
<PARA>It has also been proposed that the proviso enabling the Speaker's allocation of the call to be challenged (S.0.61) be removed from the standing orders</PARA>
<PARA>Points of order   Members have expressed concern that specious points of order have been taken with the purpose of disrupting the Member speaking or having them broadcast or recorded in Hansard. Suggestions have been made that Mr Speaker be given discretion to penalise offenders (by later denying them the call) or giving the Member interrupted an extension of time</PARA>
<PARA>Matter has been placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Standing Orders Committee</PARA>
<PARA>General business notices   Concern has been expressed that the giving of notices openly has been regarded by some Members as an opportunity to gain publicity for their views and to attempt to debate political issues when giving the notices</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker has continually insisted that notices put propositions to the House only, not contain arguments in support of the propositions and that they are otherwise in accordance with standing orders</PARA>
<PARA>Matter has been placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Standing Orders Committee</PARA>
<PARA>There has also been concern expressed that in order to gain the opportunity of proposing a motion in the House, Members must place that motion on the Notice Paper months or years in advance</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1978 the Speaker proposed to the Government Members' Parliamentary Reform Committee that the Speaker should be authorised to conduct a ballot twice each year to determine the order for general business notices received up to that time</PARA>
<PARA>Time   At more general level advantages seen in allocating time differently to allow more non-Executive proposals to be put to House</PARA>
<PARA>In his 1978 speech to the National Press Club the Speaker was of the view that should Opposition days be allocated here, as in the U.K. and Canada, a much tougher line could be taken on frivolous motions for the suspension of standing orders</PARA>
<PARA>Proceedure for raising maters of Privilege</PARA>
<PARA>In 1976 the Standing Orders Committee considered whether S.0.96 should be amended to omit the requirement for the Speaker to make a judgment as to whether or not a prima facie case has been made out. It was agreed the existing practice should continue</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1978 the Speaker proposed to the Government Members' Parliamentary Reform Committee that the new Commons procedure for raising matters of privilege be introduced into the House of Representatives, i.e. a Member wishing to raise a matter must do so in writing to the Speaker etc</PARA>
<PARA>In its report of 15 November 1979 the Standing Orders Committee recommended revised procedures for dealing with matters of privilege arising. (PP345 (1979))</PARA>
<PARA>The report was not considered by the House</PARA>
<PARA>The Standing Orders Committee has placed the matter on the agenda for its next meeting</PARA>
<PARA>Reference to deaths of former Members</PARA>
<PARA>Concern has been expressed by Members that in cases where no condolence motion has been moved in the House, Members do not have proper opportunity to pay tribute to former colleagues</PARA>
<PARA>In some cases the Speaker has allowed Members to address the House by his indulgence</PARA>
<PARA>Matter has been placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Standing Orders Committee</PARA>
<PARA>Prayers   The Speaker has received a number of letters in recent years suggesting the language of the Prayer be changed to accord more with English as it is spoken today</PARA>
<PARA>In 1971 the Standing Orders Committee considered a submission from Dr Everingham suggesting a different form of Prayer be used and also suggesting that Prayers once a week would suffice. The Committee recommended no change to the existing procedure. (PP20 (1972). Report presented 21 March 1972)</PARA>
<PARA>Matter has been placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Standing Orders Committee</PARA>
<PARA>Ministerial statements-Opportunity to question Ministers following statements</PARA>
<PARA>Advantages were seen in Commons practice of allowing some questioning following ministerial statements</PARA>
<PARA>At its 1976 meeting the Committee agreed that consideration of such a proposal be deferred to a future meeting</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1978 and February 1979 the Speaker proposed to the Government Members' Parliamentary Reform Committee that it would be an advance on our present practice if the Chair possessed the power to permit a limited number of questions to be asked of the Minister after the making of a ministerial statement</PARA>
<PARA>Division procedure   There have been a number of proposals for changing the procedure used by the House during divisions, most aimed at avoiding problems of over crowding or reducing the time taken, particularly at times of large Government majorities</PARA>
<PARA>In 1975 the Committee agreed that the standing orders be amended to provide that when successive divisions are taken and there is no intervening debate after the first division the bells for the ensuing division should be rung for one minute only.

<PARA>At its 1976 meeting the Committee agreed that the proposal be incorporated in a sessional order in 1977</PARA>

<PARA>Electronic voting   In 1970 the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House agreed that, although the installation of electronic voting was not desirable at that time the Chambers of the new Parliament House should be provided with necessary conduits, etc., for its possible installation. The committee noted the view that electronic voting was not warranted in a House of less than 250 Members. (PP32 (1970) 30)</PARA>
<PARA>The matter was considered at a 1973 meeting of the Standing Orders Committee and the committee agreed that no action be taken</PARA>
<PARA>Design brief for new Parliament House incorporates planning for any future introduction of electronic voting</PARA>
<PARA>Speaker Snedden has expressed the view that, if adopted, electronic voting could effect the rights of the Opposition to employ delaying tactics, one method of registering disapproval with the way business may be being handled. To adopt electronic voting without giving the Chair a discretionary power, especially in relation to acceptance of the closure motion, and without the establishment of a programming committee to allot times for debate could weaken an essential element of our Parliamentary process</PARA>
<PARA>Additional tellers     At its 1976 meeting the Committee considered a proposal to enable Mr Speaker, at his discretion, to reduce the time delay in counting divisions brought about by the large Government majority. It was agreed that no change be made and Clerk give consideration to what other solutions may be available</PARA>
<PARA>Motions without notice to suspend standing orders while other business is before the House</PARA>
<PARA>In recent years private Members (when not strictly entitled to call) have more frequently moved without notice for the suspension of standing orders in order to take some particular action, often unrelated to the business before the House</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considered the matter in 1972 and recommended that S.0.91 be amended to provide more restrictive time limits on such motions. (PP20 (1972), presented 21 March 1972)</PARA>
<PARA>The House agreed with the recommendations of the Committee</PARA>
<PARA>In his June 1978 address to the National Press Club the Speaker was of the view of that if there were specific days set aside for the Opposition to promote matters in the House, as in the U.K. and Canada, a much tougher line could be taken against frivolous motions to suspend standing orders which interrupt the programming of the House</PARA>
<PARA>In November 1978 the Speaker proposed to the Government Members' Parliamentary Reform Committee that the tactic of moving for the suspension of standing orders without notice had become far too prevalent and that to sort out the genuine need from the disruptive tactic a discretion should rest with the Chair as to whether it would accept such a motion</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Pursuant to section 35D (2) of the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Act 1962, I present the guidelines for the drafting of electricity supply emergency orders . These guidelines have been prepared in accordance with section 35D(1) of the Act which provides that the Minister may, by instrument in writing, make guidelines to be applied by the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Authority in making emergency orders pursuant to section 35C of the Act. The Authority may make emergency orders only when the Minister has declared that an electricity supply emergency exists in the Territory. The emergency orders must comply with the guidelines, which are required to be laid before each House of Parliament and are subject to disallowance within a period of five sitting days. The guidelines do not come into force until after the five sitting days and the Authority cannot make emergency orders until the guidelines are in force.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5J4">Mr SCHOLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The statement of the Minister indicates a problem of communication that this Parliament and the Australian Capital Territory have. I refer to the participation as a right and not as an act of grace of the residents of the Australian Capital Territory in the decision-making which affects their day to day living. All other sections of the Australian community have that right and are able to exercise it through their State parliaments and/ or territorial legislatures. Canberra does not have that right. In initital statements on the legislation I indicated that I believed the matter should be resolved and should be the subject of a recommendation by the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. Decisions which affect the day to day lives of the residents of the Australian Capital Territory, as opposed to those which have direct relevance to the national capital, should be determined by resolution of the House of Assembly. I believe it is essential that even at this late stage the Minister and the Government bring into being proposals for some transfers of powers to take place following the House of Assembly elections which are due later this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw attention to another current problem in the Australian Capital Territory which has very much the same history but different consequences. I refer to the ordinance concerning Anzac Day. Last year, almost in the dead of night, an ordinance was prepared and gazetted without any real opportunity for anyone to examine it. It was an ordinance which did not embody the normal standards of law which a country such as Australia is entitled to expect. The ordinance was to be applicable to Anzac Day, but this Parliament was unable to deal with it before Anzac Day. On this occasion, in similar circumstances the Minister and his Department, having not acted on the matter during the past 12 months, are to present an ordinance which has not been agreed to by the representatives of the people of Canberra. Because of the timing of the presentation, chaos would result if this House or another place were to disallow the ordinance during the period which is allowed for such a course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an undeniable fact that this Parliament does not want the responsibility- I am certain that Cabinet does not want such responsibility and should not have it-for the day to day civil administrative laws in Canberra. The sooner the residents of Canberra are given the opportunity to elect a body which they know will have certain powers the better. An election for the House of Assembly is due to take place in the next two months. I believe it is not unreasonable for the Government to move to the situation that was applicable to stage one of the two-stage transfer of powers to the Northern Territory. In that case the financial considerations came under the second stage. It is not unreasonable to expect the Government at this time to take decisions on the transfer of the administration of Canberra as it affects the Australian Capital Territory and its residents. There will always be matters in respect of the national capital which will have to be resolved between this Parliament and the residents of Canberra. I believe that we in this Parliament should not and cannot reasonably deal with the domestic matters which affect the lives of the people of Canberra. The sooner we recognise that and divest ourselves of those powers and responsiblities the better it will be for this Parliament and the more democratic will be the processes by which the people of Canberra are governed; they will be governed by themselves. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The 193rd report refers to our investigation into certain aspects of the administration of the Departments of Defence, Transport and Foreign Affairs and the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority. Our inquiry arose out of unfavourable comment by the Auditor-General in his reports for 1979-80 and March 1981. In relation to the Department of Defence, the Committee concerned itself with the administration of HMAS Stirling, the naval base in Western Australia. We were generally satisfied with our findings. Likewise, in relation to the second harbour bridge construction for Tasmania, we looked at the Department of Transport's administrative activities and are satisfied that this agency acted properly in its use of the Commonwealth's financial commitment in this area. Our examination of delays by the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority in presenting adequately framed financial statements for auditing purposes in respect of the years from 1976 to 1979 resulted in a number of important conclusions. We also comment upon the adequacy of that Authority's procedures for accounting for receipt and use of non- government moneys. The Committee finds quite unacceptable the delay by the Authority in presentation of financial reports. We consider that the financial reports of the Authority should be presented to the Minister within three months of the close of the financial year. Similarly, we are disturbed that the Authority continues to use a cash based accounting system in spite of continued requests by the Auditor-General and the Department of Finance to adopt accrual accounting. Our firm recommendation is that this be resolved urgently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Regarding accounting for non-government moneys, The Committee recommends appropriate amendments to the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority Ordinance 1976 be drafted without delay to rectify this accounting anomaly. With respect to the Department of Foreign Affairs we examined comments in the Auditor -General's report for March 1981 relating to accounting at overseas posts. We made recommendations in this area which will have a bearing upon cases such as that of the embezzlement of money from the Australian Embassy in Washington, which was reported in January of this year. The Committee is continuing to examine this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA> The 194th report deals with the Committee's examination of the Advance to the Minister for Finance for 1980-81. Expenditure by departments from the Advance during that year was approximately $47.4m. In its annual inquiry into the Advance the Committee seeks to determine whether expenditure charged to the Advance could reasonably have been foreseen in time for its inclusion in the Additional Estimates. As part of this approach, the Committee examines departments on the efficiency of their administration. The Committee requires departments to submit explanations in respect of all items of expenditure from the advance. In 1980-81 we received 129 explanations in relation to these items, and requested supplementary written information from 12 departments for 31 of the items. As part of the inquiry the Committee examined in public hearings the Australian Federal Police in relation to its administrative expenses, the medical and dental services of the Department of Defence, the Department of Finance on natural disaster relief and restoration funding and the Department of Industry and Commerce on reserve capacity maintenance. The Committee's examinations revealed that in all cases expenditure from the advance was properly confined; that is, it met urgent and unforeseen requirements. However, we were concerned that some departments provided insufficient information in their initial submissions which forced us to make supplementary requests and caused further delay. The Committee expects to see a considerable improvement in the 1981-82 submissions. </PARA>
<PARA> This report also makes recommendations designed to improve the effectiveness of the programs which were examined. For example, the Committee's reommendations concerning the utilisation of defence hospitals by dependants of servicemen and the need for the development of more suitable undergraduate training schemes should improve the recruitment of Service medical personnel. Implementation of the recommendations concerning the administration of natural disaster relief and restoration funding involve the Commonwealth in adopting a more active role in approving relief measures. This should reduce the time taken for payments to be made. The Committee's examination of reserve capacity maintenance at Government factories indicated that the major issues were the length of time taken to resolve compensation cases and the incidence of apeal by the Commonwealth in such cases. The Committee will be considering this matter further in consultation with its legal advisers. </PARA>
<PARA> The 195th report details follow-up action taken on the Committee's recommendations and conclusions from our investigations of the financing and administration of property owned or leased overseas by the Commonwealth Government. The inquiry was prompted by the reorganisation of the Overseas Property Bureau, which was abolished in 1976 and its functions absorbed by the Department of Administrative Services. The Committee then broadened its inquiry to include organisations representing officers and their families serving overseas. The findings of the inquiry were tabled in 1978 as report 172. The response to the Committee, in the form of a Department of Finance minute prepared by an interdepartmental committee, was received in June 1980. After considering the Finance minute the committee decided that the response to certain recommendations was inadequate. Further information was sought at subsequent meetings in August and October of 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The excessive time taken to resolve this Finance minute is not acceptable to my Committee. Two years elapsed from tabling of the report until receipt of a response. Then certain aspects of the response required further follow up. The original response to many sections of the report was generally obtuse and did not pay due regard to our requirements. The Committee believes timely, accurate and complete feedback is essential if the full effects of its reports are to be realised. The conclusions and recommendations of the 172nd report were designed to draw attention to instances of administrative inefficiency and procedural weaknesses and consequently to improve the quality of public administration. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Finance minute on this report several matters are outstanding: The effect upon recovery for losses sustained through property damages and cleaning expenses of a joint management review of overseas accounting recommendations; and the results of a review of the setting of rent ceilings. The Committee expects to be advised on the outstanding matters contained in this report at six-monthly intervals from this tabling until ultimate resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking on these reports I wish also to draw the Parliament's attention to delays we have experienced in receiving Finance minutes on a number of our reports. The Department of Finance co-ordinates departmental responses to the Committee and sends us regular reports indicating progress in each Department. They are dependent upon the co-operation of those departments in compiling the necessary responses which comprise a Finance minute to the Parliament. Clearly the Department of Finance is beyond reproach in its supervisory function. But its job of late has been made most difficult by delays from various departments.</PARA>
<PARA> The response by the Department of Health to our 182nd report, on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, tabled in September 1980, is a case in point of unacceptable delay which continues to occur. The response to our discussion paper on internal audit has also been slow, as has been the case with other matters contained within the 186th report on the Advance to the Minister for Finance. In the case of our report on the Canberra Commercial Development Authority, the progress of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in responding to a major recommendation in that report can be described only as glacial. I may wish to make a separate statement about that in due course. The Committee wishes to put on record that it finds such delays quite unacceptable and that it expects, and will demand, better compliance from agencies in future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I seek to refer only to chapter three of the Report of the Auditor General No. 193, which relates to the accounting systems of the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority. I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to the preface of the 193rd Report, where there is a disclaimer from my involvement in the recommendations of the report as related to the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority because for much of the time of those negotiations I was the Chairman of that Authority. I think it is worth while pointing out to honourable members the reasons for the delay in the Australian Capital Territory school system presenting its reports based on an accrual basis of accounting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First of all, there has been considerable debate since October 1977 over the accounting basis on which the Australian Capital Territory schools system is to report. It has been the view of the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority that a cash basis of accounting is the most appropriate basis on which to submit accounts. But there has been considerable dispute with the Auditor- General, the Department of Finance and now the Public Accounts Committee on the value of the cash basis of accounting versus the accrual basis of accounting. It has been the view of the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority that the cash basis of accounting is much more appropriate. The reason for that view is that the Australian Capital Territory schools system though in fact a so-called independent schools system, functions very similarly to a territorial department . The Senate Standing Committee on finance and Government Operations, in its report on statutory authorities of the Commonwealth, which was tabled in another place, comments:</PARA>
<PARA> There are difficulties in recommending that all authorities should adopt accrual accounting. Some authorities are, to all intents and purposes, government departments which have always operated under a cash accounting system . </PARA>
<PARA>It is the view of the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority that in fact the Authority has the same sort of functions and characteristics of operation as State and Federal departments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority does not receive funds for the full cost of educational services in relation to government schools in the Australian Capital Territory. Funds are also appropriated to the Department of Housing and Construction for repairs and maintenance, to the Department of Administrative Services for school cleaning, to the Department of the Capital Territory for grounds maintenance and to the National Capital Development Commission for minor new works. Therefore, the full measure of support from government funds would not be revealed by prescribing accrual accounting for the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority and with the exception of the National Capital Development Commission these departments operate under the appropriation cash basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority has developed its information system on a cash basis to meet its external reporting requirements in addition to its statutory reporting requirements under the Ordinance to meet the information demands from external sources. Examples are the Australian Education Council and the Commonwealth Schools Commission for comparative analysis of national per pupil education costs and other reports. It is worth noting that each of the State education systems operates on a cash basis and reports accordingly. The Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority is in fact no different from a government department in that it does not depart from the important characteristics associated with a conventional government department. It is also interesting to note that the Australian Capital Territory has a health commission which operates as the territorial health department on a cash accounting basis. Similarly, the National Library prepares and furnishes financial statements on a cash basis. I find it interesting to note a statement in paragraph 13 of a Department of Finance memorandum of 27 May 1981 to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Authority were either subsumed by the Department of Education or if while the Authority was responsible for the administration of education the ownership of resources remains with the Department, cash-based statements could well be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet, while the Authority in practice operates like a territorial department as distinct from a national department albeit subject to almost all of the same rules and conditions . . . appropriate to a conventional department we suddenly have to operate like a trading concern. </PARA>
<PARA>So that has been the main basis of argument. The Schools Authority has submitted views that its accounting system should be based on a cash system of accounting. Meanwhile, the Schools Authority has been carrying out negotiations with various departments and with the Crown Solicitor to try to get a legal position on the basis on which it should submit its accounts. A view was sought from the Deputy Crown Solicitor in August 1978. However, there was considerable delay in any report being forthcoming. But the legal opinion of 28 May 1981 came to the conclusion that as the Schools Authority Ordinance of 1976 stands it is practically impossible strictly to comply with the provisions relating to finance since it would be necessary to examine every transaction involving non- government money to determine whether it is a financial transaction of the Authority within the meaning of section 34 of the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Criticism is made in the report of the Public Accounts Committee of the administrative inefficiency and misunderstanding within both the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office and the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority of getting the legal opinion and determining the legal practices to be followed. The Committee rightly points out that it is unacceptable, and this practice was condemned accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> However, while this debate was going on among the Schools Authority, the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General, the Schools Authority was attempting to present its own accounting reports based on a cash system of accounting. The Authority therefore was not intending to operate in an unaccountable fashion but was acting in good faith to present accounts on a cash basis. An annual report, including an interim statement of receipts and payments for the six months to 30 June 1977, was finished and presented to the Minister for Education in May 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> In December 1979 the Auditor-General's Office was contacted and advised by the Schools Authority that statements for the periods ended 30 June 1977, 1978 and 1979 would be submitted for audit. In August 1980 the reports of 30 June 1977 and 1978 were presented to the auditor. In September 1980 the statements to 30 June 1979 were presented to the auditor. In March 1981 the reports to 30 June 1980 were available to be presented to the auditor. However, they were not able to be submitted because from February 1981 the Authority found itself without an auditor following the retirement of the previous Auditor-General, Mr Steele Craik. The new Auditor-General, Mr Brigden, refused to take on the personal appointment as Auditor-General to the Schools Authority. There was then an attempt to amend the audit regulations to bring the Authority under the provisions of division 3 of section 11 of the Audit Act. This announcement was made in the Commonwealth Gazette of 3 December 1981. On 24 November 1981 the Minister for Finance was advised that cash based statements for 30 June 1980 were not approved. However on 17 February it was agreed that cash based accounting be accepted to June 1981 and Statements from 30 June 1980 were submitted on 3 March 1982 and reports for 30 June 1981 are now in preparation.</PARA>
<PARA> So members of this House can see that there has been a consistent effort on the part of the Schools Authority to present accounts. There has been no attempt at all not to be accountable to the community of the Australian Capital Territory and to the national Parliament. Rather, the understanding was that the most efficient way to present those accounts would be through a cash basis of accounting. It has been determined that the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority must present all future accounts on the accrual basis of accounting. I would hope that sufficient staff and expertise would be made available to allow the Schools Authority to provide this basis of accounting in the manner that has been set out in the 193rd report of the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I refer to chapter 4 of the 193rd report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which deals with the accounting procedures and overseas posts of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Following the inspection of five posts in Africa the Auditor-General reported that there were unsatisfactory features at a number of the posts including: Accelerated payment at the end of the financial year to avoid the lapsing of funds under section 36 of the Audit Act; incorrect practices for the recording of commitments; and poorly maintained and controlled film libraries. The joint management review team report recommends that a uniform accounting system be introduced. This would involve setting up large accounting offices manned by Department of Finance officers in London, Washington and Canberra. All overseas missions would be responsible to one or other of these offices for all financial matters. This system would remove flexibility from individual posts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The move should be towards imprest posts and away from accounting offices as there would be long delays in processing posts' accounts unless large numbers of staff were employed at the accounting offices. Payment by cheques drawn in, say, London would not necessarily be acceptable to embassy suppliers in, for example, Tanzania and cheques drawn in Washington certainly would not be acceptable in Latin America. All accounting work would be done by Department of Finance staff, which would encourage a move away from having competent accounting staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs. Training in accounting is essential in the Department of Foreign Affairs, especially for senior officers and chief accounting officers. Training is vital also for junior officers who handle accounts and who have no experience in managing staff who often are older and far more experienced than they are. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the matter of libraries, which is dealt with at page 37 of the report . It sets out the concern of the Auditor-General that film libraries, an integral part of the information function of the posts, are generally poorly maintained and controlled. Among the problems identified are obsolete and damaged films, poor and inadequate storage, and inaccurate and inadequate associated records. Obviously the prints are generally of poor quality and they wear quickly because of lack of skills by projectionists at the borrowing institutions. Not enough films have a sound track in the local language and the subjects of those films are in the area of either animals or sport, or are insufficiently interesting for local audiences. The entire information effort of this Government at overseas posts is most unsatisfactory. That came out clearly in the report of the Auditor-General. Examples of that are: No funds are available for publications for general distribution; very few publications are printed in the local language; and there is almost no co-ordination between the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Trade and Resources, which runs its own publication efforts, and the Australian Information Service. The Australian Information Service is inefficient and ineffective in this regard. It should be either upgraded to make a serious effort or abolished completely. Films and books which are provided at this stage are used infrequently and post libraries are inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Foreign Affairs posts should be administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Trade posts also should be controlled by the Department of Foreign Affairs. Administrative officers should be trained in Australian Government accounting procedures and should be trained to handle special problems encountered overseas. They should be trained in staff management and should be taught the local language to a competent level-at least in the written form-so that accounts can be checked. Posts should be allowed flexibility. The move is away from imprest posts to accounting posts controlled by the Department of Finance. As a result, accounting posts will have more highly classified staff and will need to travel frequently to resolve problems. Better quality local staff members need to be employed and they need to be closely supervised. Chief accounting officers need training in financial management. At this stage few, if any, of the present heads of missions are competent in this field. The film libraries are poor. They are old and most of them are unsuitable. The Government 's information effort needs a complete overhaul. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last week or so the media has trumpeted the message that the economy is in an appalling state, that we are headed for a severe deepening of recession-if not depression-and that government policy has to change. I am sure that honourable members have noticed this media reportage, but I quickly remind the House of the kinds of headlines we have seen. In the last week we have seen headlines like this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recession: It's here and serious. </PARA>
<PARA> Resources boom euphoria fades. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment surges back as a political issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing downturn set to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Business talks of gloom. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates to rise again. </PARA>
<PARA> $2700m wiped off projects. </PARA>
<PARA>That referred to resource development. Another headline read:</PARA>
<PARA> ANZ overdraft rate hits 17.25pc. </PARA>
<PARA> Nation goes into the red-Interest rates soar as credit squeeze bites. </PARA>
<PARA>Two statements of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) were also reported. The headlines read:</PARA>
<PARA> Howard: I'll come clean on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Hard times ahead but keep smiling says Howard. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer might think this is a time to be smiling and a time for honesty. Indeed, we welcome that. We would like him to come into the house and tell us exactly how he sees the state of the economy. I hope he intends to take part in this debate and to do exactly that: To come clean with the House, to tell us what sort of mess he has got this country into and how far it is likely to go into recession before he sees an end to this process, which clearly is one of enormous severity indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from those kinds of reactions by the Treasurer which I have mentioned the Government's reaction has been to acknowledge that there are problems but to condemn the media for being alarmist and for talking down the economy. In fact, it is anything but alarmist reporting. The position is indeed very serious-we as an opposition have been warning for months that this is the case-and will become much worse unless current policies are changed. Talking down the economy was not something which seemed to concern the Treasurer or his colleagues when their parties were in opposition. They seemed to think that to talk about the adverse state of the economy was the best possible thing to do at the time. I also ask the Treasurer what he wants the media and the Opposition to do. Does he want us to say that everything is good when quite clearly everything is going down the chute?</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the headlines were right and they were backed by substantive analysis. A quick look at the economy demonstrates clearly the failure of the Government's budgetary policy and the slide into deep recession. Let us look at a few major indicators. I turn firstly to employment. The Budget forecast at the beginning of this financial year was for a growth of 2 per cent in the level of employment this financial year. Over the last 12 months the level of employment has grown 1.2 per cent. In fact, since September last year, in seasonally adjusted terms, there has been no growth at all. I turn now to unemployment. The Budget forecast was for a slight rise in actual numbers and a decline as a percentage of the work force in the course of this financial year. In fact, in seasonally adjusted terms, the level of unemployment has increased since June last year. It is now 50 per cent above the level of last year and the rate of 6. 7 per cent for March is almost 50 per cent above-half as much again-the level it was when Labor went out of office in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of inflation, the Budget forecast was for a rise of 10 3/4 per cent. It is currently 11.3 per cent; in other words, another half per cent higher, and likely to remain so for the rest of this year. Real business investment has been the major engine of growth in the last couple of years-not because of any actions by the present Government but because of the fortuituous event of the second oil shock, which made our energy resources so much more desirable for exploitation and generated the big increase in investment. Real business investment increased by 21 per cent in 1980-81. The forecast increase for this year is 10 per cent to 15 per cent, and it is likely to be in that range, but for next year the indications are that we shall be lucky if the real increase is more than 5 per cent, and it may well be less than that-and this in the area in which growth has been mainly generated. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of consumer expenditure, the other growth area, the Budget forecast was that it would rise by more than 3.2 per cent, but recent indications from retail sales figures and motor vehicle registrations, which have both slumped, are that there is likely to be a much smaller increase in consumer expenditure. Indeed, retailers throughout the country are saying that the position is appalling. They are questioning the Government's figures on retail sales and saying that the position is much worse than the official figures tend to be indicating. The Budget forecast was for expenditure on new housing to decline slightly, but it will substantially fall because of the severe fall in commencements in the December quarter and, since then, the even more alarming drop in housing approvals. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of payments current account deficit has increased. It is much worse than was expected in the Budget, where some increase was talked about. The balance of trade deficit, as at March, was nine times greater than it was at the same time last year. The balance of payments current account deficit is likely to be about $9,000m, as compared with a little over $6,000m last year. Real gross domestic product growth was forecast to be in the range of 3 per cent to 3 1/2 per cent. Because of all the factors that I have been discussing it is highly unlikely to reach those levels. We can expect rather more reduced levels of growth than were in the Budget forecast. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, with respect to the Budget outcome, the government forecast a Budget deficit of only $146m. In fact, as we have seen-although the Treasurer is reluctant to put a figure on it-there are all sorts of leaks indicating that the Budget deficit blowout is of the order of $1,000m, or even more, which indicates that the Government will fall far short of its deficit objective. So the economic and budgetary outcome this year will clearly be well below what the Government expected, and the outlook for next year is much worse because of the collapse of the bases of previous growth-that is, the rundown in business investment, the considerable fall in the rate of growth in consumer expenditure, and the decline in export growth. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the reasons for this deterioration? In the time available, one can only quickly indicate those. Let me, first, acknowledge that the world recession has a part in this. We do not deny, as the then Opposition did in 1974 and 1975, that world economic factors have an influence on what happens in Australia, and we accept the fact that the world recession must affect Australia adversely. We acknowledge that that is happening right now. The economies of most major countries are growing only slightly, if at all, and some, such as that of the United States, are actually declining. Total unemployment in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is now 28 million, and there is no sign of a recovery yet. The impact on Australia, on both the volume and the value of exports, which creates severe problems in the export industries and through the deteriorating balance of payments, affects the economy generally. But the world recession has in fact much to do with the fact that conservative governments throughout the world, particularly in major countries, most especially the United States, have been applying policies which are not dissimilar to those of this Government. They are basically monetarist policies of one sort or another, and those policies have been causing contraction in those countries and, therefore, greatly accentuating the world recession which was initiated by the second oil shock. </PARA>
<PARA> This fact that other countries are pursuing Fraser Government-type policies of monetarism is a terribly important factor in explaining why we have an intensified world recession. For the Government to say 'You cannot blame us for what is happening in the Australian economy because of the world recession', is both a grossly simplified and an absurd proposition to start with-although we acknowledge that it has some effect-but it must be borne in mind also that the reason why we have this world recession is that other governments have been following monetarist policies similar to those of this Government and therefore bringing about and intensifying the world recession, which may have taken a much lesser form without these kinds of policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The neo-conservative policies, as they are described-the policies of the Fraser Government, the Thatcher Government, the Reagan Government, the Muldoon Government, and so on-all have a similiar basis. They are based on the monetarist theory which has become popular over the last 10 years, and has become very unpopular over the last few years. That monetarist policy conforms well to conservative ideology-that is, to small government, deregulation, market determined outcomes, inequitable income transfers, lack of concern about unemployment, and so on. Those are the hallmarks of monetarism and conservative ideology. This policy, stripped of all its jargon, amounts to a policy of fighting inflation by increasing unemployment. The Government tries to stop inflation by increasing unemployment. If it requires more unemployment to stop inflation, that is what we get. Therefore, we have growing recession as almost a continuing feature of such policies, as we have seen ever since this Government took office. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which it is done is by introducing contractionary budgetary and monetary policies. We have them both at present-contractionary budgetary policies and contractionary monetary policies which are forcing interest rates up to record levels. The Government provides no stimulus to the economy. Indeed, it reduces activity in its attempts to get inflation down. It then hopes that a non-inflationary recovery will occur. The impact on people of this kind of policy is very severe. Because of slow growth, it means that there is slow employment growth, or increasing unemployment, and an adverse effect on living standards through increased taxes, increased interest rates and reduced government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the hallmarks of the impact of these kinds of policies not only in Australia, where they have been applied, but also in the other countries to which I have referred. Everywhere it has been the same in its general impact- although the detail varies from country to country. The failure to reduce inflation is also a marked feature of these kinds of policies. Despite the fact that they create deepening recession and higher and higher unemployment, they fail to stop inflation. Such policies have been extremely ineffective in stopping inflation. For instance, in Australia, in the last 12 months of the Labor Government inflation was running at 12 per cent. Now, with unemployment half as much again as a percentage of the work force, we have a much deeper recession and inflation at 11 1/2 per cent-in other words, hardly any improvement at all on the inflation front despite a much deeper recession. In the United Kingdom the same thing applies. There was inflation of 10 per cent when the Thatcher Government came to office. Despite a great increase in unemployment, inflation is now at 12 per cent. So these policies not only involve much deeper unemployment but they fail to fight inflation, which was their original intention. </PARA>
<PARA> These policies need more and more unemployment to reduce inflation. We had 3 per cent unemployment in Australia in 1961, and zero inflation following that. Now we have 6 1/2 per cent unemployment and 11 1/2 per cent inflation. That is the kind of problem which these kinds of policies produce. One needs more and more unemployment to keep inflation at any given level. That means that to get inflation down to the one per cent or 2 per cent now, how much unemployment would we need? Would we need 10 per cent, 12 per cent or 15 per cent? No one really nows-but it would be a hell of a lot more than the present level of 6 1/2 per cent, officially, and it makes these kinds of policies an absurdity. They fail to reduce inflation. It also means that this policy can never provide the basis of economic recovery; every time we get any sort of recovery, this Government will come in with policies to contract the economy because inflation will tend to blow out again. That is what is happening right now. We had a mini- recovery in 1980-81 and in 1981-82 for a little while, but now the Government says: 'We must stop all that because inflation is getting bigger again'. So the Government comes up with policies that create more recession and more inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> These kinds of policies must stop. They must stop in this country and in other countries as well. I am sure that, with the effluxion of not a great deal of time, all the Government's pursuing these kinds of policies will be rolled, because the people of those countries and of this country will not tolerate the continuance of such outlandish policies, policies which are so crude and which involve the bludgeoning down of inflation by umemployment and having to use the bigger and bigger bludgeon of unemployment to keep inflation only at levels which are tolerable but still high. Those policies will not be tolerated by the people in future, in this country or any other. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need, in this country and others, and what we will get, are policies which are advocated by the Labor Party in this country and by social democratic parties elsewhere-that is, policies which reject the concept of using unemployment as the basis of inflation control, and which say that what we must have are more direct measures to control inflation. In particular, we must have prices and incomes policies to control inflation and a rejection of the crudity of the monetarism which has blighted this country and the rest of the world for the last several years. They are the kinds of policies we need. Prices and incomes policies have been pursued by some countries. Despite all the difficulties of the last decade or so some countries, such as Austria, Sweden and a few other countries in Western Europe, through the use of prices and incomes policies, have been able to keep unemployment at very low levels and inflation generally at lower levels than have applied in the countries pursuing monetarist policies. So on both accounts-unemployment and inflation, and rates of economic growth-they have performed much better than countries which have relied on the monetarist approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that increasingly people around the world will see that those are the policies to pursue. Those are the policies that the Opposition will be propounding. Opposition members support fully the idea of discarding unemployment as the means of inflation control but we reassert what we have always said-that inflation control is important but that it must be done by other means. Those other means are prices and incomes policies. If we have effective prices and incomes policies we can have stimulatory policies which will enable a non-inflationary recovery to occur. We cannot get a non- inflationary recovery with monetarist policies because every time recovery occurs, inflation blows out and has to be stopped by the introduction of more contractionary policies. We are then pushed further into the recessionary vortex into which we are rapidly being pushed at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In introducing this matter of public importance the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has revived that old chestnut of the Australian Labor Party; that is, the link between inflation and unemployment. The only mistake that the honourable member for Gellibrand made was that he got the linkage the wrong way round. The Government has never denied that inflation and unemployment have to be looked at together, but it has constantly asserted that there is no such thing as a trade-off between inflation and unemployment . Just as we strenuously deny-we have done so in the past, we do it now and we will deny it in the future-that this Government has ever used unemployment as a method of purchasing reductions in inflation, we assert with equal strength that more inflation simply will lead to more unemployment. We are not alone in asserting that because, as the honourable member for Gellibrand well knows, that was a proposition which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden ) embraced when he was Treasurer for a short time, during the Labor Government. He embraced it in almost these words: We no longer live in a simple world where we can do this and that, because more inflation leads to more unemployment. It is no accident that the unemployment situation in Australia has been better during times of lower inflation. For the honourable member for Gellibrand to suggest that in some way we are deliberately using the bludgeon, as he calls it, of unemployment to bring down the rate of inflation is to misrepresent totally the Government's position and it is a charge which I and the Government totally reject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gellibrand has indulged the approach of many other people at present of talking down the economy. He is entitled to do that. He is the economic spokesman for the Opposition and it suits the political purpose of the Opposition to paint the gloomiest possible picture of the Australian economy at present. Of course he will go his hardest to do that. I have not at any time over the last few months, when it has become apparent that economic circumstances in Australia would not be as good as we thought they might be at the time we brought down the Budget, run away from that proposition, nor has the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and nor has or will any member of the Government. As I indicated last week, now more than ever the public has to be taken into the Government's confidence, has to be informed and has to be fully advised as to our assessment of the state of the economy. We have to recognise that circumstances are less rosy than they were at the time of the Budget. They are less rosy not only than the Government thought but also than the Opposition thought at that time. If the honourable member for Gellibrand is honest with himself he will recall complaining in this House last year about how much money was coming into Australia. He said we would have to do something to stop it, that we would have to turn it around and send it out again or introduce capital controls to stop it coming in. In other words, he was complaining about how attractive this country was as a place for people to invest. We should not let the honourable member for Gellibrand run away with the proposition that only we on this side of the House were talking about strong economic conditions in the middle of last year. He knows darned well that he shared similar views. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the House and those who are interested-I accept that the bulk of the members of the Labor Party are as interested in the state of the Australian economy as we are-to keep a sense of balance and a sense of proportion about the real state of the economy. Of course growth will not be strong. For the information of the honourable member for Gellibrand, my latest advice is that non-farm gross domestic product will grow by about 2 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent instead of over 3 per cent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;'Disgraceful', the honourable member for Burke said. That is absolutely marvellous! It happens to be still about a per cent or a per cent and a half above the average of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, so if our performance is disgraceful I would like to know his description of some of those marvellous social democracies of western Europe that his colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand has said are the models that all of us should follow. The fact is that economic growth, even at that lower level, in Australia this financial year will be way above the average of the OECD. We should not let anybody run away with any other impression. Of course economic growth will be less and business investment will be less. But let us get a sense of proportion about that. In the December quarter of 1981-the quarter before last-new fixed capital expenditure was estimated to be 35.6 per cent higher than in the December quarter of 1980. That is some downturn, some recession! It is 35.6 per cent higher than it was in December 1980. It is well within the Budget forecast of a 10 to 15 per cent increase in real terms. Although investment is levelling out, it is still running at about three times the real level of three years ago; that is, 1977-78. I repeat: It is still three times what it was in 1977-78. Of course everybody knows that, despite the revisions, expenditure on mineral exploration is way ahead of what it was in the early 1970s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do ask that in properly assessing and revising expectations about the current and future performance of the Australian economy we preserve a sense of balance. We recognise first and foremost that we live in a world of interdependent economies. No government can hope to insulate this country, or any other country , from the effects of world-wide economic downturn and recession. We will all be affected by it. We are not impotent in the face of what happens abroad but we are affected by it. What we do here with our domestic economic policies has an effect on the degree of damage to this country of economic downturn abroad. We cannot stop the damage but we can reduce it or we can aggravate it. The central question we have to ask ourselves is: What is the right policy? What policies will reduce damage from abroad and, alternatively, what policies will aggravate damage from abroad? We have to ask ourselves what the causes of economic downturn and economic stagnation abroad are and we have to ask ourselves whether the policies that we are following at present are the appropriate ones. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party would have us believe that, overnight, interest rates can be brought down. The honourable member for Gellibrand and the Leader of the Opposition say that we have to control, or regulate, all these interest rates and that is how the problem will be solved. I would like the honourable member for Gellibrand to explain to the Australian people what would have happened if interest rates in Australia had been artificially held down over the last few months. What would have happened to our external account, in the face of the present level of interest rates in the United States? Does he seriously believe that any corporate treasurer worth his salt would not have followed those high interest rates abroad? Does he believe that anything other than very serious difficulty would have befallen Australia's balance of payments if we had tried to maintain an interest rate structure that was markedly out of line with what has been operating abroad, or is operating abroad at present? Yet that is the practical consequence of the alternative economic policy advocated by the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Gellibrand says 'come on' but I remind him and through him the Leader of the Opposition that month after month they have gone around Australia saying that the policies of this Government have deliberately forced interest rates up. They have gone around saying that if we had a Labor government interest rates in Australia could be much lower but they do not tell us how they could be kept down without the consequences that I have described. Are they seriously arguing that, with a prime interest rate in the United States of 17 per cent or more, it is possible for any government to ensure that prime interest rates in Australia will be 3 per cent, 4 per cent or 5 per cent less than they are in the United States? That is the practical effect of what the honourable member for Gellibrand and the Leader of the Opposition are suggesting. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot represent to the Australian people that if they were in government interest rates would be lower, yet deny, as the honourable member for Gellibrand is now doing, the practical consequences of applying their policies. They know well-as indeed a Labor government in Australia has found out over the last couple of weeks-that the realities of office and of the marketplace cannot be ignored. Mr Cathie, the Minister for Housing in the honourable member for Gellibrand's own State of Victoria, made a remarkable discovery the other day. He said: 'We have to let the building societies put up their interest rates because if they do not get the money in first they cannot lend it out.' Of course, Mr Cathie has made the blindingly obvious discovery that, in an environment of high interest rates, if lending institutions are to be able to lend money they have to be able to borrow it from the investing public in the first place. That is a proposition that the Australian Government has argued for some time. It is one that it suits the political convenience of the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Gellibrand to ignore, but it cannot be ignored by those who have the responsibility to make decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the next few months the task of economic management in Australia will probably be more difficult than it has been at any time over the past few years. What this country has to do, above everything else, is strive to regain the international economic competitiveness that it had a couple of years ago but which, because of adverse developments on the wages and prices fronts, it has started to lose. It is a responsibility that everybody, in all sections of the community, will have to share. The fact is, of course, that a couple of years ago the level of inflation in this country was below the average for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. As the honourable member for Gellibrand will know, the truth is that now it is above that average. What we have to do above everything else is work to apply policies that will bring the level of inflation back to a competitive position vis-a-vis that of our trading partners. In doing so, we must apply policies that have an anti-inflationary bite, not apply the sort of high deficit, loose monetary and fiscal policies that have been advocated, in the name of providing a mild stimulus, by the honourable member for Gellibrand. When members of the Labor Party talk about adopting a mildly expansionary Budget approach, when they talk about providing a mild stimulus, what they are really talking about is going back to their habit of running very large deficits. I might say that, in the view of most economic commentators, that state of affairs has been the cause of the high interest rates in the United States. I find it absolutely fascinating that the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Gellibrand should be saying that what is wrong with the present Government is that its budgetary policies are too closely aligned with those of the American administration when, in regard to economic emphasis, we depart from that administration in thinking that its Budget deficit is too high. That is the very policy approach that, if given the opportunity, the honourable member for Gellibrand and his colleagues would implement. They would run a high deficit. They believe in high deficits yet high deficits, more than anything else, have produced the interest rate situation that prevails in the United States. Any analysis of the interest rate structure of that country and its impact upon Australia would bring home to all of us the importance of the level of the United States deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> What has disturbed the Government over the past few months-it ought to be a concern of everybody in this House-is the extent to which our competitiveness has been eroded by adverse developments on the inflation and wages fronts. It is no accident that those countries, such as Japan, West Germany and the United States, that are more competitive are those that have succeeded in holding wage increases at or below their level of inflation. In Japan last year the rate of inflation to February was 3.1 per cent. Unit labour costs rose by 3 per cent. In West Germany the rate of inflation was 5.8 per cent. Wage increases were at about the same level. In the United States the consumer price index in the year to February rose about 7.7 per cent and average earnings rose about 5.6 per cent to 6 per cent. A very clear picture emerges that those countries have been more successful in holding their wage levels and, as a consequence, their competitiveness has improved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Questions concerning the economic policies that are being adopted in Australia have long since ceased to be questions which impinge only on the immediate situation. Increasingly they are becoming serious questions about the whole nature and direction of economic growth in this country. One could almost be forgiven for believing that the chief advisers to the Government are deliberately setting about sabotaging any possible national recovery, and the future of Australia generally. If they had determined to do that it would be most unlikely that they would have chosen significantly different policies. I think that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) really would be well advised to seek independent advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation at present in Australia is that right across the nation industry groups, companies, research organisations and academics are calling for a change of direction in the Government's present economic policies. Yet those calls-of increasing volume-are falling on deaf ears. It appears that the Treasurer and the Secretary to the Treasury are closeted in a situation in which they do not hear those increasing expressions of concern. At one time those concerns were being expressed by increasing numbers of unemployed. At one time they were being expressed by young couples who were being forced out of their homes. The Treasurer, honourable members will remember, referred to them as 'young families trading down'-selling expensive homes and buying cheaper ones. Young families were being forced out of their homes. Farmers were finding it increasingly difficult to meet their interest rate commitments. Families were concerned about the future of their children. Of course, the Australian Labor Party has been consistent in its expressions of concern and consistent in the alternatives that it has been proposing. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that the Treasurer should listen to the Labor Party. I am not suggesting, because I do not believe he would, that he listen to the cries from the unemployed, from the families or all of the three million people in Australia who are living below the poverty line. But I seriously suggest to the Treasurer that he listen to some independent advice from those interests in the Australian community which inceasingly ask the Government to change its direction, to follow the changes that are being made by Treasuries in other parts of the world. I have already referred, on another occasion, to the changes that have taken place in Britain. For the first time, unemployment there has started to drop because Britain has now repudiated the monetarist approach that it has been taking. It is not good enough for the Treasurer to come into this House, or to go out into the community, and continue to repeat things which are simply not correct. He said that the honourable member for Gellibrand was incorrect in his assertion about the Government's historically record high level of interest rates in comparison with other countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer shakes his head. The level of real interest rates in Australia is the highest in the world. Let me give the House some of the interest rates which is fact apply at present and particularly in comparison with situation in the United States. On 15 April interest rates in the United States on 90-day commercial bills were 14.2 per cent. In Australia on 19 April the interest rates were 22.3 per cent. On 180-day commercial bills the interest rates in the United States were 13.7 per cent and in Australia they were 21.3 per cent. The latest interest rate in the United States on 90-day treasury notes or bills is 12.8 per cent and in Australia the yield is indicating an interest rate of 20 per cent. Overnight funds-the Treasurer referred to them-were earning interest rates of 25 per cent in Australia; I repeat, 25 per cent on overnight funds! We know that the rates on 60-day and 90-day bank bills have been hovering around the 20 per cent mark. In comparison with the rate in the United States our interest rate is significantly higher.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, and that creates a pretty good margin, as the honourable member for Robertson has indicated. I have indicated on previous occasions that the strategy that this Government was adopting was such that the target for economic growth in Australia during this current year could not and would not be achieved. I said that right from the start, from the time the Budget itself was adopted. The figures that the Treasurer gave at that time should have given him no cause for surprise to learn that the growth rate target of 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent would not be achieved. He has now indicated that for this current year it will be between 2 per cent and 2 1/2 per cent. I have indicated that for the following financical year it will be less than 1.5 per cent. The Treasurer knows as well as I do that if we just wanted to hold the unemployment level at the present rate we would need to achieve a growth rate in excess of 3.5 per cent. He knows that we are not going to achieve it. Unemployment in Australia, as I have said on previous occasions, will grow towards 10 per cent. In 1961 the then government almost lost office as a result of unemployment in Australia approaching 3 per cent. It is now 7 per cent and approaching 10 per cent. It is my hope that the Australian people will have sufficient conscience, sufficient concern and sufficient compassion for their fellows to react in the same way but to a greater extent than they did in 1961.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer indicated that many of our economic problems were overseas induced. We on the Opposition side are prepared to accept the proposition that the international economic situation is not as good as it could be. But it simply is not correct to say, and we are not going to allow it to be said, that Australia is incapable of marshalling its own affairs and determining its own direction to the extent that we have to be dragged along by developments overseas because that is not what has been happening anyway. In respect of those adverse developments overseas, we have been finding ourselves to be way out in front. I would like to draw attention to a statement made seven years ago by the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). What a remarkable transformation there has been in the attitude of this Government. We are not going to let this Government get away with it. This is what the Prime Minister, seven years ago, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that men and women are governed by inexorable events beyond their control. </PARA>
<PARA> When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped, that it is part of a world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership, when, if they were men of real stature, they would be saying, 'we can overcome.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was said seven years ago by the present Prime Minister; and what do we hear him saying now? He is saying that Australia cannot get itself out of the mire because we are being dragged along by events overseas. The present high level of interest rates is caused deliberately by this Government, and the Treasurer knows it. He knows that the money supply policy in Australia is such as to create an extremely tight domestic liquidity position. Higher interest rates have been deliberately engineered by this Government. It is part of the Government's policy to attract the funds from overseas that it needs to get itself out of the balance of payments problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer and the Treasury are like boys playing around with little machines. They are pulling levers, they are stretching wires and they are sticking springs into the system just to see which way it jumps. They are trying to mesh these things together. It is becoming increasingly difficult for them. I do not believe the Government or the Treasurer's advisers at present sufficiently realise exactly what has been happening. In March 1982 unemployment was 460,000. Since March 1981 it has grown from 409,000 which represents an increase of almost 5,000 additional unemployed every month. Since this Government has been in office unemployment has grown by 1,000 every month. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to the case presented this afternoon by the Opposition I cannot help but be profoundly depressed because what the Opposition supporters have presented is nothing more than a subterfuge for an economic policy. It is very easy for members like the last speaker, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown), to stand up and cite figures. If he wants to refer to unemployment may I refer him to the figures which existed when the last Labor Government of this Commonwealth was in office. At that time the level of unemployment in Australia reached a record which had not been compared since the Great Depression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition supporters must imagine that the people of Australia are stupid enough to accept yet again a re-run of the gloom and doom that came to Australia during the period 1972 to 1975. The memories of the Australian people are not so short that they are prepared to accept a re-run of a policy which has been demonstrated to be fundamentally imperfect. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition supporters come into this House and talk up gloom and depression and then they wonder why they have become prophets of their own results. The simple reality is that in any country, confidence is a fragile thing. No responsible party when speaking to the Australian people should continue to attack a government whose economic policies under present circumstances represent the only route that it can take, unless they can offer a prescription which will work. They know that thesis will not. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the details of the so-called Labor alternative policy. Labor says: 'We are going to solve all our problems. We are going to cut unemployment. We are going to be able to reduce interest rates.' All this will be done through the glorious seed from the tree of deficit financing. Let us be quite frank about this. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) speaking in Brisbane at an economics conference in June 1978-and I have not heard him change his tune on this particular record-simply said: 'If Labor does not gain office this year, by 1983, when we could next hope to gain office, we would face a mammoth task of rebuilding the public sector and maybe an equally mammoth task in convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so.'</PARA>
<PARA> We have heard nothing today about high taxes. We have heard nothing from any of the spokesmen on the Opposition side which suggests that they, through their glorious polices, will be able to give the Australian people everything for free and not come back and demand higher taxation. But it is on the record. The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand, has made the position quite clear: His policy is for higher taxes in Australia. At least he is honest on this point. If we want to give more goods and services to the Australian people and have a bigger public sector somebody has to be prepared to pay for it . We cannot simply go on the principle of deficit financing indefinitely. Just as an individual cannot go to his bank manager year after year and ask for more money, to have a larger demand on the services of the bank, the same applies to a nation such as Australia. We have to reach the stage where we can live within our means. Much of the problem that we face today came about because during the period of the Whitlam Administration Australia did not live within its means. The deficit in Australia during that period reached a record level. Year by year since then the situation has slowly improved to where we are now in a position to say to the Australian people that the hard years of the past were worth while . </PARA>
<PARA> This country is one of the few in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which is at least able to live on the basis of its own capacity to produce. But we are told by the Opposition that we have to have a situation where the demands of the labour force are to be met at all costs. We recall what happened during those difficult years when increases in wages across the board were over 20 per cent in one year. Yet we were told that somehow or other there is no connection between high inflation and wage demands. As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) told us this afternoon, the reality is that Australia's capacity to develop its society in a modern world fundamentally depends on our capacity to trade. If we cannot maintain a comparative cost advantage in those areas where we have a capacity to compete with the rest of the world we have no future as a nation. I cannot say that more strongly to the people of Australia. They will remember this. They will recall that fact. But unfortunately the erstwhile alternative government opposite seeks to imagine that it can live and that the people of Australia can live in some clouded cuckoo land indefinitely ignoring that simple reality. </PARA>
<PARA> Wage inflation is one of the prime causes of the realities of the economic situation that we now face. Average weekly earnings for all male employees rose by 5.8 per cent between the September and December quarters of 1981. They are the most recent statistics available. That reflects an obviously very large rise in earnings and brings the recorded annual rate of increase to 14.5 per cent. The important point about that figure is that it is well above the rate of inflation. As the Treasurer so rightly pointed out, if one compares the record of the Australian economy with our major trading partners such as West Germany or Japan one will see that both of those countries have been able to hold down their basic level of inflation because the demands within their economies for higher wages have also been restrained. That is not what we have seen in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> While we live with the realities of a limited legal power base in the Federal sector, the fact of the matter is that the Australian work force, to a large degree egged on by members of the Opposition-expecting people to believe that they can get twice this year what they received last year regardless of who has to pay for it-has now reached the fundamental situation where today's wage rises will be somebody else's job tomorrow. If we are trying to build a country based on something a little more fundamental than the simple concept of 'I'm all right , Jack', let us get back to that simple Australian virtue of mateship. This nation was built on the belief that if we pull together as a people, if we hold our course and have a quite clear objective before us, this nation need fear nothing. While we proceed on the basis that we can divide the community and that workers and management can argue over every single possible source of friction there is no way that the opportunities facing Australians will be met. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we have been debating the Opposition's matter of public importance: 'The alarming deterioration of the economy due to the Fraser Government's economic policies'. As I said initially, the policies put forward by this Government are an adequate mix of fiscal and monetary policies directed at the realities of the situation. Today inflation still represents to this Government and to the people of Australia the greatest problem which we must overcome. Plenty of countries in the world-I refer to the comment of the honourable member for Hunter, the last Opposition speaker-have changed their policies. In all fairness to him, Great Britain was not one of them. The reason Great Britain has improved the basis of its unemployment situation is that after some three or four very difficult years of cutting away the fat and trying to restore an economically viable community on an industrial base which is able to compete, it is now in a position to seek an increase in productivity. It is the increase in productivity which is at the essence of economic growth. That is a lesson which the Opposition, when it sat on this side of the House, failed to learn. Quite obviously it is a lesson which the honourable member for Gellibrand and all his colleagues opposite continue to despise and ignore. If the economic success of countries such as West Germany and Japan is considered, it is clear that when the economy is based on high productivity a country is then in a better position to make the goods and services which are needed and the people require. </PARA>
<PARA> If we persist with a low relative level of productivity-let us make no mistake about it; during the 1970s the rate of productivity in Australia was by no international yardstick satisfactory-there is no possible way that this economy will develop. It will not do so until we get back to the fundamental requirements of restraining demands, particularly in terms of wages and salaries , in such a way that jobs can be created and more people can be employed. It does not need an economic genius to work out the reality that if an employer finds himself facing not only basic wage increases but also a possible on-cost increase of at least 25 per cent per unit of employment-that is what we are looking at now for employer-he must go for modern technology, change his market profile or sack or reduce his labour force. There is only one other alternative- he can go out of business. That is not what the Australian Government is all about. </PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners, aware that the area is on the National Register, wish to emphasise that this should not be taken lightly. The unique character of the area as a temperate rain-forest, incorporates many individual features which are only beginning to become known. Not the least of these is the recent find of anthropological and other scientific relics in a previously undiscovered cave in the Franklin valley. This find alone intimates potential contribution to mankind 's knowledge which transcends progress that further hydro-electricity may promise when this very electricity can be generated by other means. Another priceless feature of the valley is its splendid Huon pine whose ages (some up to and over 2,000 years), quality and scarcity make it a species to be husbanded with care and respect, not drowned indiscriminately and uselessly as in another Tasmanian hydro-electric scheme.</PARA>

<TITLE>Plant Variety Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: I, Dr Paul Robert Neuman, Leader and Lord of Knights of the Order of the White Cross International, a humanitarian knighthood for the Defence and Protection of Life, jointly with officers and members of the Order and with citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble petition respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That I, jointly with and on behalf of the undersigned petitioners voice our concern and objection about the proposed legislation of the so-called Plant Variety Rights Bill 1981 and that I claim, according to the nature and principles of my organisation, to have a mandate to defend the silent Millions of Life-Forms, which are unable to defend themselves and are not represented otherwise in this Honourable House in order to protect their fate and future and also on behalf of the majority of people, who are not or very little informed about the consequences of this Bill and whose freedom and wellbeing is at stake, should this Bill become Law in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Since time immemorial, life has dominated Earth and has formed in the course of evolution a Web of Life, composed of animals and plants, which are depending on each other and are adjusted to each other within their Eco-system. Man, as part of nature and being bound to the laws of nature, must suffer the consequences if this nature is brought out of balance. The new life-forms, this Bill will allow to enter Australia, are tailor-made creations of genetic engineers, aliens and monsters to our eco-systems, but fit to open an entirely new marketing opportunity for food and chemicals. Scientific achievement or not, the Gene- manipulators play a wicked Lego-game for international finance and the chemical industry. I hold, that the natural species in Australia or elsewhere in the world have not even the slightest chance to compete with the invaders from man's laboratories, since the new creations are invested with the power of money, using man's abilities, man's laws and man's chemicals to clear the way for gene- manipulated commercial mono-cultures, designed and controlled by those who hold the Patent Rights over these plants.</PARA>
<PARA> It requires no imagination to realize that all power for dominance over people is contained by those who control the food. Indeed, control over all beings bound to eat and over farmers and horticulturists as to what to grow, how to grow and with which kind of chemical to treat. It also means control over licenced breeders of the new varieties, who may be directed to refuse supply to certain growers as the patent owners may feel fit. Beneficiary of the entire exercise is the chemical industry, which is eagerly buying up already such patents, thus the toxic pollution level in the environment must rapidly rise as a result of such policy. In the final analysis, I am convinced, that people in fear of famine due to possible repercussions, will to a great extent surrender their freedom and dignity to the will of those, who are in control of food. It has been voiced in various circles of Science and Philosophy that the potential of genetic-engineering and cloning can be more devastating than the Nuclear-Bomb and I believe, a unification of gene-manipulation, cloning, computer-technology and international finance together can form a power able to result in a sort of Domesday for the world as we know it. It may be the beginning of a ''Brave New World'' similar to that, described in Huxley's novel, but whether mankind can survive it's own creations or vanish together with nature, remains a question mark.</PARA>
<PARA> When the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives deal with this Bill, they may also consider the religious aspects of the matter. Australians, being so close to nature, have naturally a strong attachment to the Creator. It is not unlikely that spiritual divisions may be enhanced amongst people over this ethical atrocity, indeed, the scientific take-over of Creation is in a sense a dethronement of God as a control over all beings.</PARA>
<PARA> I am awaiting in anticipation the protest of the World-Leaders of Religion to come to the defence of the Divine-Creation, since they do so very often on the subjects of procreation and abortion and I pray, the very same Leaders will not 'side with the powerful' as they usually do. After all the Foundation of Judeo- Christian Faith is at stake.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure, the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House do share the pride of all Australians over the unique beauty of this continent and the natural composition of it's diverse life-forms. Surely no-one of sound mind would wish to see this marvel of the Pacific Region being harmed and finely transformed into gene-manipulated mono-cultures, and yet this very Plant Variety Rights Bill 1981 is the door-opener for such a future. We believe, the driving forces behind this Bill did get away with far too much already in Australia. I refer here to the chemical pollution and the concerted efforts of that industry to increase the sale of toxic chemicals to the agricultural community. Many housewives nowadays fear the method of high pressure salesmen: ''Foot in the door and no retreat.'' Australia is well advised to keep her doors tightly closed to the salesmen of new life-forms.</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot undo the scientific 'success' of cloning and gene-engineering, but the people of Australia can refuse to legalize their own dependence upon the mercy of Multi-National-Corporations. Such corporations generally do not break the Law openly, but rather lobby for the introduction of new laws, tailored to fit their future intentions. The present Bill, we believe, is a typical example of this kind and will give full cover of the Law to any foreign body or person as outlined in Division 2 Section 12 of the Bill and Division 1 Section 10 states unmistakably that virtually every plant of commercial interest falls under the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> The promoters of gene-engineering may praise Interferon as a Wonderdrug, capable of eliminating cancer. We hold that from the very same corner of the industry once DDT was praised to be the Wonder-chemical, capable of eliminating the insect-pest, but yet the insects have not suffered real losses in the long run, while the environment of the planet is cursed with a dreadful chemical, which causes constant harm to nature now and in times to come and we believe, since the increase of cancer incidents appear in correlation with the increase of chemicals, it may be wise to reduce these chemicals rather than adding more to it, including substances derived from gene-manipulated matter.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude, jointly with the undersigned petitioners that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Plant Variety Rights Bill 1981 bears destructive consequences for the environment of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Due to protective chemicals, required for this kind of plants, the toxic level in the environment must increase.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The independence of people and the free trade is endangered.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Peace of Faith is likely to be disrupted.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The beneficiaries of the Bill will primarily be Foreign Corporations.</PARA>
<PARA> Should this Bill become Law.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia reject the Plant Variety Rights Bill 1981 entirely and in all parts.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>This Bill, together with its companion Bill, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1982-83, seeks interim appropriations for the services of the Government for the period 1 July 1982 to 30 November 1982, by which date it is expected that the Appropriation Bills (Nos 1 and 2) and the Appropriation Bill for Parliament, forming part of the Budget for 1982-83, will have been enacted. Supply Bill (No. 1) seeks appropriations totalling some $4,827m for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $464m, or about 10 per cent, greater than the amounts provided in the Supply Act (No. 1) 1981-82. The Bill includes $125m for the Advance to the Minister for Finance, which is the same amount as has been included in Appropriation Acts (No. 1) for the past several years. I wish to emphasise that the Supply Bills do not anticipate decisions yet to be taken in the 1982-83 Budget context. I commend the Bill to honourable members.</PARA>

This is $134m, or about 20 per cent, greater than the amounts provided in the Supply Act (No. 2) 1981-82. The funding through annual appropriations of certain expenditure which was formerly authorised by special appropriations is a major element of the increased provisions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read with interest recently a report on the front page of the Australian newspaper of 18 March entitled 'Backbench fights cutbacks to State road funds program'. It stated that at the Government caucus meeting the previous day, the National Country Party rose en masse to attack the road funding proposals of its Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). The article specifically mentioned the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). The National Country Party members were joined by several Liberals-the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) and the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean)-who complained of inadequate Federal road funding. Their blood-curdling cries certainly had a major impact on the Minister-so much so that this Bill increases road grants for the next three years by the amounts of only 7 per cent , 6 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, as was announced last year! This is despite the Government's full knowledge that road construction and maintenance costs are rising by more than 15 per cent each year. Yet again, for the seventh successive year, real Commonwealth road grants to the States will be cut in 1982 -83, 1983-84 and 1984-85 unless this Minister and this inept scandal-ridden Government are thrown from office, a fate that they so justly deserve. The only impression the National Country Party back benchers made on the Minister was that he cut his second reading speech to a third of the length of last year's effort. It illustrates the meagre commitment that the Minister for Transport has to roads except, of course, if they happen to be in his own electorate. Later in the debate I shall offer the members of the National Country Party and the Liberal Party an opportunity to bring their principles out of the Government caucus room, to voice them in this chamber, and to back them with their vote for my amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year, Parliament had the doubtful privilege of hearing the honourable members for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron), Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) and Lyne (Mr Cowan) beseeching the Minister to consider increased funding for country roads. They were bought off with his vague assurances that their views would be noted. That assuredly was the only action he took because under the financial provisions of this Bill every State in Australia will be worse off. I hope those honourable members will not be duped so easily again, especially by the Minister's latest tactic that scope for additional funds will be discussed in context of the next Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Last November the Minister finally admitted that Commonwealth road grants were not keeping pace with increases in road construction costs. He said the Government would address the problem of declining real road grants on the release of the Bureau of Transport Economics report on a road construction price index in early 1982. That report, was tabled by the Minister several weeks ago. His response to the problem was again to defer its consideration until next August. The Minister's reference in his second reading speech to altered State relativities constitutes a superficial attempt to encourage dissension among the States in the battle for declining federal road funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to provide financial assistance to the States and Northern Territory for road construction and maintenance purposes. The Opposition does not oppose it. The schedules attached to the Bill detail allocations of $734m in 1982-83; $778m in 1983-84 and $825m in 1984-85. These amounts represent, respectively, increases of 7 per cent, 6 per cent and 6 per cent over the previous year's allocation. The Bill maintains the established relativities and conditions attaching to Commonwealth assistance set out in the existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In his second reading speech the Minister reluctantly confirmed the Australian Labor Party's repeated claims of recent years that Commonwealth road grants have not kept pace with road construction cost inflation. The new road construction price index report tabled by the Minister recently objectively reveals the sharp and irresponsible cutback in real federal road grants. It highlights the increases in fuel and bitumen prices as the two fastest rising components of the index. Both increases are the direct result of this Government's oil pricing and economic policies. The report using 1969-70 as a base of 100, shows that in the 11 years to 1980-81 the index for fuel had soared to 623.1 and that of bitumen to 512.4. By contrast the index for salaried labour rose to only 368.8 and of ' other labour' to 373.6. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard an extract from the report. </PARA>

Note that the adjusted scale (1969-70 = 100.0) version of the overall activity index cannot be derived simply from the three sub-indexes (LGA and SRA construction and maintenance) by using the weights given on page 37; similarly, in the adjusted scale, the three sub-indexes cannot be derived simply from the component indexes by using the 1979-80 weights in Table 4.3.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cite two examples to demonstrate the appalling inaccuracy and inappropriateness of the two indices used by the Government as a basis for its increases in road grants. Using the old BTE index of road cost inflation and the notorious implicit price deflator of gross fixed capital expenditure on private non-dwelling construction, which does not even include bitumen prices, to compare the years 1974-75 and 1980-81 we find that total real federal road grants were cut by 4.6 per cent. However the new index exposes the true level of the cutback as 17 per cent. Secondly, in the 1979-80 Budget Speech the Government undertook at least to maintain road grants at the same level over the three years 1977-78 to 1979-80.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, even using the old inappropriate indices we find that in that period federal grants were reduced by 3.3 per cent. The new index reveals that the real cut back was 8 per cent, despite the promise made in the 1979-80 Budget Speech. It also exposes the massive 21 per cent cutback that has been made in real road grants to Victoria when comparing the years 1975-76 and 1980-81. More telling still is the cumulative total fall in road grants to Victoria compared with what they would have been if the Commonwealth had maintained the 1975-76 real levels for five years up to 1980-81. Expressed in constant 1980-81 prices, using the latest BTE index, the total cumulative fall is a brutal $112m over the five years. Other States have also had to contend with cutbacks in federal road funds . For instance the cutback in percentage terms in Queensland is 19 per cent. In money terms-comparing the years 1975-76 and 1980-81 the cutback is $95m. In South Australia the cutback is 28 per cent and in money terms it is $77m. In New South Wales in real terms the cutback is 15 per cent and in money terms it is $ 92m. So let us put an end to the claims of this Minister for Transport, his predecessor and those who sit opposite who seek to put the lie that the Government has maintained in real terms road grants to the States and Territories since 1975-76. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has stressed many times that the amalgamation of the urban arterial and rural arterial roads categories into a single category of arterial roads would provide opportunities for inequitable distribution of road funds between urban and country areas. If formulae are agreed upon by each State and Territory for distribution of road funds then the former separate road categories should be restored to prevent repetition of the offensive National Country Party practice of 'pork barrelling' favoured regions with road funds, of buying votes in the country with road funds. The next Labor government will re- establish separate categories for urban arterial, urban local, rural arterial and rural local roads. </PARA>
<PARA> During the debate on the 1981 Roads Grants Bill, we warned that expansion of the definition of national developmental roads would result in 'pork barrelling' of favoured areas by the Minister for Transport. Sure enough, there is now prima facie evidence to show that the Minister's declaration of sections of the East- West road between Bourke and Narrabri in his own electorate as a national developmental road was not based on the usual criteria. He has applied $1.5m or 30 per cent of the 1981-82 New South Wales allocation for national developmental roads to the East-West road against the wishes of the present New South Wales Government and contrary to expert advice. This is an initial allocation with the estimate of total cost being, I understand, $25m. The present New South Wales Government has repeatedly stated that this road was not part of its 1981-82 developmental road proposals and that funds expended on it will divert funds from preferred developmental roads, all roads that are associated with the coal trade. The New South Wales Government has further claimed that its preferred developmental roads are used by several hundred vehicles per hour, compared with the less than 10 vehicles per hour that traffic the East-West road. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that the recent report by a committee of senior representatives of Commonwealth and State road authorities on national highway deficiencies listed traffic volumes first on a list of priorities for works on national highways. An analysis of papers tabled by the Minister on 17 March 1982 in defence of his decision does not yield the conclusion, as he claimed, that the former Minister for Roads in New South Wales, the Hon. H. F. Jensen, decided on the East-West road as a national developmental road in 1978. Rather, analysis indicates that the Federal Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Gwydir, took the initiative in declaring the East-West road as a national developmental road. The prejudice the Minister holds towards metropolitan Australians surfaced in his arrogant Press statement of 30 October last in which he said this in reference to the East-West declaration:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The N.S.W. Government has blatantly neglected this area (that is the Electorate of Gwydir) over the years to the advantage of Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong. It is high time north western and western N.S.W. received a better deal. </PARA>
<PARA>I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the House that the 75 per cent of the New South Wales population who live in the metropolitan regions of Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong know their areas have not been advantaged in the allocation of road funds. I can assure the House that the local government bodies of those regions also know they have not been advantaged in the allocation of road funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's claim was offensive, inaccurate and irresponsible. But his prejudice towards metropolitan Australians goes further. Presently he is attempting to reduce funding for urgently needed works on the Newcastle-Sydney expressway from the 52 per cent of the 1981-82 New South Wales national roads allocation as recommended by the New South Wales Government to 36 per cent of the allocation. If the Minister is successful in what he is trying to do, completion of the Newcastle-Sydney expressway will be delayed, opportunities for substantial cost savings in road construction will be lost and avoidable road casualties will occur. The hopelessly inadequate Wyong-Swansea section of the national highway is one of the heaviest trafficked roads in our nation. It has the worst record for road crashes and injuries of any road in Australia, yet this Minister and this Government are determined to delay its reconstruction for party political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The myth that the National Country Party cares for ordinary country people is a myth that has been perpetrated for too long. The absurdity is that the National Country Party is in reality a lobby group for the major mining corporations, many of which are foreign owned, and large corporate farmers. It masquerades as a fighter for the rights of ordinary country Australians. Country people deserve adequate transport services as a right just as they have a right to adequate education, health, welfare and cultural facilities. Under Labor's social audit concept, transport services will be valued by their full resource, environmental and social costs and benefits. This will replace the Government's narrow concept of valuing transport services simply by commercial costs and benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The hypocrisy of the Government's approach to country transport services is revealed in the Minister's answer to a resident of South Australia who had protested at the planned closure of Australian National's vital 'tea and sugar' rail services to people living near the rail line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. I quote from a reply that the Minister wrote to a resident. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> You may be aware that the Government's policy is that the Australian National Railways Commission should operate in a 'commercial' manner. In the circumstances, while I am sympathetic to the difficulties faced by people living in isolated localities, it would be inappropriate for me to direct the Commission to maintain an uneconomic service. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Minister's definition of commercial or uneconomic transport services were applied to all country transport services as it is being applied in respect of that service, few country transport services would remain in existence. </PARA>
<PARA> The crisis facing Australia's road network has been caused by the sharp reduction in real federal road grants by the Fraser Government. It has forced the growing burden of financial responsibility for roads onto the States and local government bodies. Both have limited access to the increased financial resources needed to meet that burden. Naturally there has been a resultant spate of increases in State motor vehicle and licence charges and of local government property rates to raise additional funds for road works. Their borrowings have skyrocketted but due to the Fraser Government's mismanagement of the economy, there is little scope for borrowing except at punitive rates of interest. The subsequent heavy repayments will eat into their future revenues, so restricting their ability to provide other essential services. Funds will have to be diverted from other priorities or necessary road construction and maintenance projects will have to be deferred. </PARA>
<PARA> In Adelaide last week the Senior Vice President of the South Australian Local Government Association, Councillor Des Ross, and the Association Secretary, Mr Jim Hullick, outlined to me and several of my colleagues the financial difficulties being caused for local government bodies in that State by this Government's cutbacks in road funding. They emphasised particularly the disadvantageous share of federal road funds being allocated to South Australia. Elsewhere in this country many councils are considering tearing up bitumen roads and replacing them with cheaper but less safe gravel roads. Federal revenue from fuel related taxes and levy has quadrupled since 1975. The estimated revenue for this financial year is $4,300m of which less than 17 per cent will be returned to road construction and road maintenance. Between 1975-76 and 1980-81 the Commonwealth's share of total road funding was reduced from 30 per cent to 22.2 per cent whereas in the same period the State's share rose from 27.6 per cent to 38 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> State governments, in an effort to meet the costs associated with infrastructure for resource development, have had to divert funds away from freight services for country areas and small to medium size manufacturing industries as well as public passenger transport. The Australian Labor Party advocates a policy of allocating a fairer share of fuel-related revenues to road works and to the provision of alternatives to the private car in urban areas and long distance road transport. The nation's road network is disintegrating under the pressure of irresponsible cutbacks in real federal road grants and the total lack of a national transport policy under this discredited, divided, disoriented and scandal ridden Government. The paucity of federal road funds has forced States and local government bodies to divert an increasing share of available funds away from new road construction to road maintenance. As an example, in 1972-73 New South Wales spent 24 per cent of its total road expenditure on maintenance. By 1980-81, because of the cutbacks in real federal road grants, this share had risen to 34 per cent and for many local government bodies the maintenance share is even higher. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of its contemptuous disregard for the financial plight it has created for the States and local government, the Fraser Government bulldozed legislation through Parliament last May abolishing the long-standing discretionary power of State road authorities to decide which national road construction works they should build or put out to tender. This unwarranted legislation, a political pay off to the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, was opposed by all the States irrespective of their political persuasion. It constitutes a blatant featherbedding of wealthy private construction companies. There is absolutely no proof that private contractors build roads better or cheaper than State road authorities or local government bodies, a fact since admitted by the Minister. The Government acted without regard for the damaging and destabilising effect its decision would have on public road authorities, local government bodies and country towns. Already there is evidence to show that taxpayers' money is being wasted as a result of this Minister for Transport's blind determination to ensure that more national road construction works are carried out by private contractors in preference to public road authorities. Labor in government will restore to the States their former discretionary power over national road construction and end this Government's featherbedding of wealthy private construction firms. </PARA>
<PARA> It is instructive to attempt to understand the Government's rationale for its brutal cuts in real road funding because analysis shows there is no rational justification for its actions. The Government might claim that people do not want good roads and that use of roads is declining. Statistics show that road transport performs about 90 per cent of Australia's passenger task. In terms of passenger kilometres it carries about 75 per cent of freight tonnages. It is expected that for the next few years at least there will be a 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent annual increase in road travel. Again, the Government might try to claim that it is providing alternatives to road transport in order to conserve fuel and relieve congestion. Indeed, it has claimed that the crude oil levy is, in part, a fuel conservation measure. Yet, it has abolished specific purpose funding for urban public transport, the major alternative to the use of the private car. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government could also claim that road expenditure is not a good investment, given other priorities. Professor John Taplin, former Director of the Bureau of Transport Economics and former Deputy Secretary of the Department of Transport, now Professor of Transport Economics at the University of Tasmania, has shown by research and analysis that roads are in fact an excellent investment. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard, an extract from Professor Taplin's paper. As with the earlier incorporation, previously a Minister agreed to its incorporation. </PARA>

<PARA>(Extracts from pages 1, 2, 7 and 8)</PARA>
<PARA> Answers to the question, what is the cost of not having an adequate road system , have been repeatedly given by the Bureau of Transport Economics and its predecessor in this field, the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads. The BTE report, An Assessment of the Australian Road System: 1979, shows that by holding road expenditure to 85 per cent of what it should be, as in the past, Australia would throw away benefits with a discounted present value of $1,785m (expressed in 1979-80 values). To obtain these benefits would cost $1,301m (again in present value terms) so that the net benefit lost would be $484m. Putting it another way , the community could have a 10 per cent return on the investment of $1,301m and have a surplus benefit of $484m as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important question is what are we losing at the margin? If a little more were spent, how great would the benefits be in relation to the cost? The BTE calculations indicate that if only 85 per cent of the warranted program is carried out then some more expenditure would yield benefits, discounted at 10 per cent, amounting to about 160 per cent of the added expenditure (i.e. a B/C ratio of 1.6). In some major classes of roads the yield would be much higher because the shortfall has been greater than 15 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA> And just in case anyone thinks that the BTE or the former Bureau of Roads might be somewhat generous in assessing benefits let me draw their attention to a 1979 BTE report on the connections between the Hume Highway and Canberra-The Federal Highway on the Goulburn side and the Barton Highway on the Yass side. They calculated that upgrading the Federal Highway, on virtually the existing alignment, to National Highway Standards would result in benefits amounting to only 90 per cent of the cost (i.e. a B/C ratio of 0.9) while the comparable figure for the Barton Highway was 80 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> These results provide a useful benchmark because many people know how unsatisfactory are these two highway connections to Canberra, particularly when there is heavy traffic-as there often is. The BTE are telling us that these two would not even get into their total road program. They also tell us that, on their evidently severe criteria, there are many road projects which are twice as good and even three times as good as these two but which cannot be done because of insufficient funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Classes of Benefits Foregone</PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the 15 per cent of warranted road projects which ought to be done but probably will not, one can ask what is the nature of the benefits being lost . </PARA>

<PARA> Source: Calculated from BTE, An Assessment of the Australian Road System: 1979 Part I, Table 7.4</PARA>
<PARA> The first figure in Table 1 means that there would be about 2,000 fewer accidents annually. The BTE calculations imply that this reduction in accidents would include a saving of about 60 lives annually and almost 500 cases of injury . I have deduced from the sources given by the BTE that they were valuing a life at $103,000 in 1976-77 dollars, equivalent to about $135,000 in today's prices. Personally, I think the lengths society goes to in other fields to save life indicates a much higher community valuation of an individual life-perhaps $100, 000 more in today's values. If this is so then the discounted value of the reduced accidents is increased by almost 50 per cent from $137 million to $203 million. </PARA>
<PARA> The discounted value of $607 million for the reduction in vehicle operating costs would result mainly from more economical use of fuel and tires and lessened damage to vehicles. These benefits would be achieved through improved road surfaces, gradients and curves, as well as reduced congestion. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the two classes of time savings the discounted value of the commercial savings, $512 million, would greatly exceed the discounted value of the private savings of $188 million. The commercial savings are paticularly important. Because road transport is a highly competitive industry commercial savings would be passed on in lower freight rates and then through lower prices of goods to the community at large. I would add that the substantial part of the saving in vehicle operating costs accruing to commercial vehicles would also be passed on.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The Government may assert that Australia's roads are safe enough, yet Professor Taplin has calculated that even if only 85 per cent of the Bureau of Transport Economics warranted road program were carried out, 60 lives would be saved and 500 cases of injury would be avoided each year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question uppermost in the public mind is how many people have to die or be maimed in road crashes before this squandering, scandal-ridden Government comes to its senses and allocates a fairer share of road users' taxes to upgrading the road system and making the roads of this country safer for people to travel on, be they in the country or in urban or city areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, the Government may claim that increased road expenditure does not create employment. However, again, BTE research has shown that 64 per cent of direct and indirect expenditure on roads goes to the employment of labour. There is no sensible, rational or responsible reason for Federal cutbacks in real road grants. The basis of the Government's action with road grants is the same as it is for its entire economic policy-bastardised monetarism and a dangerous over- reliance on a few resource exports. This Government and honourable members opposite see road investment, however socially beneficial, as diverting funds from the resource sector. The vast financial and material demands of the resource sector, coupled with the Government's policy of slashing public sector spending to make room for resource sector development, is an alarming gamble with Australia's future. On numerous occasions we on this side of the House have warned of the dangers of placing an over-reliance on a few resource exports. Now , as media and industry reports are showing, the Fraser Government's economic strategy is cracking and its shaky foundations are crumbling. Moreover, the inequitable cutbacks in grants to the States combined with increased State responsibilities under the Government's disastrous new federalism policy and the need to finance resource development infrastructure are imposing immense pressures on the States to switch funds away from traditional areas of responsibility to mineral development infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government has dislocated the public sector, the manufacturing industry, work forces and communities in order to make room for the resource sector to grow. It expected that this sector would rise like the Phoenix from the ashes of the manufacturing sector and carry the Prime Minister on to another election victory. This Government based its electoral viability on its resource export strategy and, now that that strategy is disintegrating, funds are being drained from housing, education, health, transport and the manufacturing sectors , as well as the social wage to prop it up. The deplorable state of many roads, the new employment that an increased rate of road expenditure would generate, the economic and energy savings to be derived from improved traffic conditions and the desperate need to reduce the senseless slaughter on our roads together constitute an indisputable case for a substantial supplementary allocation of Federal funds to be made to road construction and maintenance. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give this Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that a substantial supplementary allocation of road grants should be made available to the States, the Northern Territory and local government without delay to-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I speak broadly about the road funding issue, I would like to comment on a few of the matters mentioned by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). I think he has made it quite clear indeed that if the Australian Labor Party were in government tomorrow it would return to its policies of 1972 to 1975. He made it very clear that a Labor government would initiate legislation which would see a return to various categories of roads. If my memory serves me correctly-I am sure it does-funding for our rural local roads and our main and trunk roads was reduced drastically by the Labor Party when in government. In fact, we can all recall the time when 40 per cent of the petrol tax was allocated to the rural road system within Australia. I am not saying that the Labor Government was responsible for wiping that policy, but I recall that expenditure of $17m or $18m a year for rural local roads was reduced to $11m and $12m a year. I am afraid that my friend, the honourable member for Shortland, will not win many friends in country areas because local councils in particular and people generally have certainly not forgotten those days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Shortland also referred to a statement he said he had seen from the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) relating to the result of calling for tenders for contracts relating to work on our national roads. I make the point that the Minister has made it clear that as yet it is too early to make any conclusive statements in relation to the result of our contract system for the national roads of Australia. The Minister has indicated that the policy is extremely effective. I think that this is the important factor that we have to take into account. I am sure that all honourable members on this side of the House believe that to give free enterprise an opportunity to tender for the construction and maintenance of national roads, arterial roads and, if necessary , council roads, will certainly reduce the cost of roads within Australia. I point out that legislation concerning Federal road aid to the States dates back to approximately 1922. Up to 1959 7d or 8d a gallon in petrol tax was allocated under legislation specifically for the construction and maintenance of roads. After the introduction of legislation in 1959 petrol tax generally became a Consolidated Revenue item. Since then an allocation has been made each year to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before the House covers a three-year period. I recall the fact that originally the program was for a five-year period. That was done for a purpose-simply to allow the States and the councils to plan and to undertake their works accordingly. I do not think that there is anyone who would challenge the forward planning that was advocated within the program, simply because it was to the advantage of the Commonwealth, the States and the councils concerned. We should also recall that there were previously a number of categories of roads , and it is the responsibility of the States to decide, under their own legislation, as to where exactly they want to cast their categories. But under the Commonwealth funding, there are three. As we know, there are the national roads, which are the total responsibility of the Commonwealth; there are the arterial roads; and there are local roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter has been simplified to a very great degree, I shall suggest later that it should be simplified even more, because I believe that under our federal system, contrary to what was said by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), we would get much more value for the dollar if the States and councils were able to accept a greater responsibility for determining spending on our roads. Under the legislation that came into effect a year ago, the Commonwealth gave to all the States a greater freedom in the spending of their money on their arterial and local roads, and the States appreciate this. I know that the Minister for Local Government in New South Wales welcomes this news as a good innovation for the States. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we should keep in mind that there are two avenues by which the Commonwealth assists the road program within Australia. One is the legislation about which we are now speaking, and the other, which must not be forgotten, is the personal tax sharing arrangement. No one on the Opposition benches refers to this, of course, but these are funds made available by the Commonwealth, amounting to $350m a year, which are untied, and which are passed via the States to councils, and councils have the prerogative of determining how to spend the money-whether they balance it off against an increase in the rates or allocate it for roads. I know that nearly all the councils in my electorate of Lyne are allocating extra funding for roads. They will say that this is because of the extra assistance that they are receiving from the Commonwealth. Over a five-year period, over $1,000m has been given directly to roads, untied, as I have said, by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I support that if we were to say 'Right, let us keep that figure there and let us allocate all our extra funds directly to roads', this would be very well received by many councils throughout Australia. But I think that our program is fair, and I would be the first to agree with anyone, in the chamber or outside it, who says that we require more funds for roads. I am sure that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), following the advice of the Bureau of Transport Economics, would be one who would dearly love to come into the chamber and to be able to say 'Right, here are extra millions of dollars which will bring the amount that the Government can allocate up to the recommendations of the Bureau of Transport Economics. </PARA>
<PARA> But we must respect the fact-I am one who respects the fact-that unfortunately Australia is now going through a period of very acute economic problems and we must allocate the funds accordingly to our priorities, as determined by the Government and the Cabinet. It is our responsibility to come into this chamber and to say that we believe that roads in our electorates are one of the most important issues. I say that about my electorate. I am sure that the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), who had 50 or 60 council representatives at the House only a month ago, and who fights very hard for money for roads, is one who would solidly agree. My honourable friend the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is always talking about the problems of the funding of Queensland's roads. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we must accept that the people have made up their minds that passenger and freight transport over our roads is the thing and the coming thing . Our railway network generally is not sufficient and is not up to date enough to meet the general demands of the travelling public and freight movements generally throughout Australia. All country towns today look for decentralisation. They look to have the product manufactured in their town delivered on to the market floor on the following day. It is not always possible to do that with the railway system, but it is becoming possible to do it with our expertise in transporting freight over roads throughout the Commonwealth. Our roads will be used more and more for freight and passenger services. Many seaside areas throughout the country and many of our western towns are not served by a railway but are unable to secure State licence to operate a passenger service over the roads to the metropolitan areas. Outside of air and their own personal transport, there is virtually no other transport available for them. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that we should go even further today because of the councils' concern and the deep concern in many of our rural city areas, and we should be looking at a more simplified system generally for the financing of roads. I advocate that the Government should now look at having only two categories of roads. We know that the Commonwealth has responsibility for national roads, but once we come to the roads that really matter within the local communities-the arterial roads and rural and urban local roads-perhaps the time has arrived when the Commonwealth should say to the States: 'Here is a bulk amount of funds. It is your responsibility to spend the moneys concerned and allocate your own priorities'. In a way, we are virtually doing this today, but we would have only the two categories of roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of roads is so great that perhaps we should look at a proposal, which has been spoken about around the countryside, whereby a certain amount of petrol tax per litre is allocated directly for roads. If we took the $728m the legislation provides for this year and the increasing amounts that will follow through to 1984-85 and allocated it directly to the States on the basis of cents per litre in petrol tax, after taking out the 42 per cent for national roads, I do not believe that there would be any great objection from motorists. The motorist is the one who should be really responsible for the building and upkeep of roads. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that it is time to tie up forever the problems between the Commonwealth, the States and councils, and that a very clear line should be set. This is the opportunity, as I have said, for us to consider a tax on the basis of litres of petrol which can be returned to the States for expenditure on roads . Maybe-I do not know the constitutional powers in this respect-it is time for the States, with the Commonwealth being responsible for the national roads, to put on a tax and spend that money on the roads within their States. In other words, the States could determine the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In New South Wales, the local government assistance fund in 1975-76 amounted to $12m. The previous government allocated that money directly to councils to spend as they wanted in their areas. The honourable member for Shortland should not speak about that, because that amount has been reduced. I believe that today it is only $9m. That is what the State of New South Wales thinks of the funding of roads. I believe I am correct in saying that none of the money collected from motorists within New South Wales goes directly back into road building within that state. This amounts to a considerable sum, involving registration fees, licence fees and fines imposed upon motorists. Virtually millions of dollars are not being returned to the roads in the States concerned. I know the States have their own priorities, but what priority does the Government of New South Wales give to roads? I know it has financial troubles. A State cannot invest its funds in projects that can be financed by private enterprise and expect not to run out of money. That is exactly what happened. I do not suppose it will be long before Mr Wran tries to come to Canberra. Certainly he will try to get here because he will want to get out of the mess he has made in New South Wales. This is evident now. He has ransacked the State so he will want to leave and come down here. He will see that the time is right before he comes. I have no doubt in the world that he will try to come if the opportunity presents itself. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, there is concern around the countryside about road funding. The Government appreciates the problem. The Minister for Transport appreciates the problem but unfortunately there is only a certain amount of money to spend, so priorities must be considered. As I said earlier, I believe there are ways to decide priorities which would clear up the details and let councils, States and the Commonwealth have a clearer view of the future situation so far as roads are concerned. Representatives of the shires and local government associations were in Canberra only a month ago. They talked to the representatives here about the problems that they have. They appreciate the economic situation but they want to know that they can plan. They want to know that extra funding is available because they believe, as I believe, that the general condition of the roads throughout Australia is slowly deteriorating in that the roads cannot keep up with the demands of present transport. The roads are not keeping up with the demands upon the Commonwealth, the States and the councils to provide the roads that this nation requires. If we look back over Australia's history we will all agree that in a continent as large as Australia, compared with European countries and even America, and bearing in mind our time here of less than a couple of hundred years, we have done very well indeed in the construction and maintenance of our roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Roads are productive. We have to realise this as it is important. It concerns me greatly that in all the budgets brought down by governments in Australia, proportionally less is spent on the productive issues of the nation, such as roads and water conservation, and on the matters that really will stand by Australia over the years to come. It is important that every penny that can be allocated to roads ought to be allocated, and ought to be spent efficiently. I outlined earlier what I mean by efficiently. The Minister said in the legislation of a year ago that the contract system is one way of overcoming inefficient spending. I know from the reaction within my electorate that this is being accepted particularly well not only by councils but also by the people at large. It is the people at large who travel on the roads. We can look at the roads up and down the coastline and at the roads leading west. The honourable member for Riverina, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron), and other members of this chamber, are concerned about their local roads-the roads that take the school buses to school, that take people in to do business in the towns and take people's products to the market. The Pacific Highway up the coast is most inadequate. It cannot cater for the demands of freight and passenger transport generally. The arterial roads that leave the coast and go inland, to the hinterland, including the old main and trunk roads, are the ones that generally are still gravel roads. These roads should be in better condition; they should be bitumenised and available for fast transport. </PARA>
<PARA> Besides being reproductive, roads are utilities that are most important for Australia not only for defence but also in regard to the saving of lives. Over 3 ,500 people were killed and 90,000 people were injured on the roads throughout Australia last year. We have to look at these factors. A survey in Canada showed that 60 per cent more fuel is used on a road that is not in a reasonable condition that on a road with a bitumen surface. So there is a tremendous loss of fuel on Australian's roads today. Furthermore, the cost of production within our industries, particularly in regard to freight, can be brought down considerably if we have a better road system throughout the Commonwealth. Whilest I say todays that I support the legislation, I think we should all make it quite clear that we voice the opinion of many people around the countryside that there is a need for greater funding for roads generally throughout the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst I agree with many of the remarks of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), I do take him to task. The honourable member was very vocal in condemning the previous Labor Government for its actions regarding road funding. The honourable member for Lyne was a Minister in the New South Wales Government which denied local government the 20 per cent savings in national roads funds which it had agreed to pass on. I ask him to think very seriously about why his Government, in which he was a Minister, did not hand on those funds. He condemns the roads in New South Wales and yet he was one of the causes for the roads in New South Wales being still bad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the amendment, which I seconded, to the second reading of the Roads Grants Amendment Bill, I could not but notice on the front pages of the national Press in the week prior to the recess a photograph of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser) riding tall in the saddle. I thought at first that he had discovered Marlboro country. Then I thought he had been reading Mungo MacCallum's column in the Age of Tuesday of that week which verbally depicted the Opposition riding off into the sunset, victorious after a parliamentary shoot-out, and which stated that he was forming a one-man posse to catch us before his deputies got him. My third thought was that Mr Russell Hinze or the Federal Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) had told him about the appalling condition of the nation's roads and he had opted for an alternative means of transport. I now believe that the correct assumption was that he had opted for another means of transport because a week later I noticed that the Minister for Transport was pictured in the Australian also trying a horse to avoid the bumpy roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly, their remedy for the road situation does not surprise me because all of their Government's policies are characterised by horse and buggy thinking. The Prime Minister and his sidekick, the Minister for Transport, particularly are off the beaten track in their attitude to Federal Government road grants to the States, as was spelt out clearly by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). One does not have to be Einstein to understand that it is elementary that if the Government increased road grants in real terms, based on a proper road construction cost index, it would: Most importantly, reduce the intolerably high toll of road deaths and maimings which would, in turn, reduce social security and health costs; provide employment; conserve valuable energy; promote tourism; lower transport costs; improve communications in isolated areas; improve the environment; lower air pollution; and, last but by no means least, increase our defence capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that there is no bottomless well from which to draw endless buckets of funds. In fact, this Government's well has all but completely dried out due to careless mismanagement. However, as I have just indicated by the nine points I have made, an increase in real funds for roads indirectly would effect savings in other areas. The Minister for Transport must fight harder for funding and extol the virtues of roads as an investment in the future security and stability of the nation, not just an easy avenue in which to make cutbacks to balance the books. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking of being off the beaten track, no State is suffering more from tight- fisted, Scrooge-like Government funding policies than is my home State of Queensland. I have no trouble in vouching for the deplorable condition of its roads, especially those in rural areas with which, Mr Deputy Speaker, you also would be very familiar. Queensland requires special attention. It requires more funding than do most other States and, indeed, a greater yearly increase in grants than is specified in this amending Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill indicates projected road grants for the next few years. Queensland is to receive proportional increases that will be almost identical to those received by the other States. But Queensland deserves more, and during the course of this debate I hope that I can persuade the Minister of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> As all honourable members are aware, Queensland is growing rapidly-faster than is any other State or territory. In regard to interstate immigration, Queensland is the only State to show a significant increase. Whereas in the 1980-81 period, New South Wales and Victoria each showed a decrease in population of more than 12,000, and Western Australia a decrease of 570, Queensland showed an increase of 26,097. In regard to migration from overseas, Queensland's population increase was 10,000 more than that of its closest rival, New South Wales. Increased population leads to increased traffic, and road wear and tear, and therefore greater demand for new roads and maintenance of existing surfaces. Queensland is also disadvantaged by being Australia's most highly decentralised State. More than half of its population lives outside its south-east built-up area, which includes the north and south coasts, Ipswich and Brisbane. In New South Wales, 37.2 per cent of residents live outside the capital and in Western Australia the figure is 28.7 per cent. I suspect that many honourable members would have regarded Western Australia as our most decentralised State. </PARA>
<PARA> For the last financial year the Federal road grant to Queensland increased by 11.2 per cent, the increase for all other States. The Federal allocation for national highways increased by an overall average of 18.4 per cent. However, Queensland, which has more kilometres of national highway than has any other State, received 2 per cent less than the national average figure, as compared with the Liberal pork barrel State of Victoria, which exceeded the national average by almost 5 per cent. I wonder how that figure will vary now that the Liberals have finally been dethroned in that State. Other States need not feel that they are benefiting from Queensland's loss either. The report for 1979 of the Commonwealth Bureau of Transport Economics claimed that over the preceding five-year period Commonwealth grants to all States fell by 1.4 per cent a year in real terms. They have continued to fall at rates which have increased to six per cent this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of the Government's Machiavellian funding policies towards what I regard as one of this nation's greatest investment hopes-our roads-are many and varied, but mostly detrimental. Of prime importance is the detrimental effect that the gradually diminishing road grants have had on the alarming road toll, of which, following our recent bloody Easter holiday weekend, all honourable member must surely be aware. Australians own 7 million cars. As a past member of the Parliamentary Road Safety Committee, it concerns me that increases in registration of motor vehicles are not matched by increased construction of roads. I quote from the Minister's news release of 13 April:</PARA>
<PARA> The road toll continues to be one of the biggest and most tragic social problems faced by Australians in the 1980s. The Minister added that in 1980 there were 22.4 road deaths for every 100,000 head of population. </PARA>
<PARA> For Queensland the figure is 25.9, or 3.5 more than the national average. Over the Easter period, 37 people died on the nation's roads. New South Wales, with 15 fatalities, had the most deaths. It was followed by Queensland, with 11. I ask honourable members to remember that the population of New South Wales is double that of Queensland, as is its number of vehicle registrations, but not its road toll. </PARA>
<PARA> Even before funeral arrangements could be made for the Easter road accident victims, Queensland's Main Roads and Police Minister and leading contender for the remake of the Incredible Hulk, Mr Russell Hinze, accused the Federal Government of responsibility for the road toll. In the Courier Mail of 12 April Mr Hinze is reported as having said that the poor state of some of Queensland's roads was a major contributing factor to the road toll and that the lack of Federal Government funding was responsible for the State's bad roads. Putting one and one together, Mr Hinze was blaming the road toll on the Federal Government. Although I agree with some of what Mr Hinze was saying, I cannot help feeling sorry for the Minister for Transport, whom Mr Hinze is trying to make a scapegoat in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In a Courier Mail article of 12 April dealing with the '595' campaign, the following appeared:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Queensland can forget about reducing the road toll as long as the Federal Government persists with its dollars-before-lives policy of road funding' Mr Hinze said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The allocation of Commonwealth road funds to Queensland is a tragic joke. A realistic attitude could have halved the Queensland road toll in recent years.'</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hinze predicted that Queensland would have the highest road toll of any State within two years. </PARA>
<PARA>What a disgraceful statement for any Minister to make. Rightly, he was condemned on the next day in an editorial in the Courier Mail, in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of the Main Roads and Police Minister, Mr Hinze, that Queensland's road death record is inevitable represents a defeatist approach to a problem which needs constructive thinking. </PARA>
<PARA>I would give ten out of ten marks to the Courier Mail editorial in that regard, but on 15 April, apparently the 'Incredible Hulk' turned green and in a mad rage got to someone at that newspaper, because it printed an incredible letter from the Minister which begins:</PARA>
<PARA> Your newspaper's record of publishing contradictory and at times ill-considered editorials has not been assisted by Tuesday's leader headed, 'No time for defeatism.'</PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable members to remember that the Minister, in his earlier statement , had accused the Federal Government of being responsible for 50 per cent of the road deaths in Queensland. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> My Ministerial colleagues from other States . . . show that . . . road conditions are now one of the three main contributing factors of road accidents.</PARA>
<PARA>There was no mention of the other factors or of what really does cause road deaths. In the Telegraph of 15 April there appeared a very good story concerning Dr Strong, an eminent surgeon, who is surgical director of the Princess Alexandra Hospital and the newly appointed State Chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons' Road Trauma Committee. Dr Strong is reported as stating:</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland's road deaths occur mainly in country areas but that does not mean that poor roads are to blame. </PARA>
<PARA> The high country death count would well be a result of what happens after a crash, said Dr Strong. 'If you are going to have an accident don't have it in a country area', he said 'You may not be found for a while.'</PARA>
<PARA> Even if the crash is discovered, country hospitals are not geared for the massive injuries that often accompany a high speed road crash. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have the lie to Mr Hinze's statement. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 15 April reference is made to Life Insurance Federation of Australia figures and the following statement is made:</PARA>
<PARA> At least 50 per cent of all drivers and riders killed in NSW, Victoria and Queensland in 1980 had blood alcohol levels exceeding the .05 level. Of these, 50 per cent had levels exceeding .15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> More than 50 per cent of the drivers and riders who died after drinking were aged 24 or younger. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely those factors point out to politicians and State governments where they should direct corrective legislation. I repeat, obviously Mr Hinze was simply shifting the blame for the road toll away from the real issues-Queensland Government pork barrelling, the refusal to act on the alarming number of semi- trailer tragedies recently, and the glossing over of the controversial random breath testing argument as if it was not there. It is to Mr Hinze's benefit to be deprived of funds for roads so that he can throw up the lack of funds as a smokescreen to divert attention from his real failings as Minister responsible for main roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, is also guilty of throwing up smokescreens and avoiding the real issues. In the national debate on random breath testing, the figures that Premier Joh has chosen to protest its introduction are strange indeed. He stated that Queensland police caught more drink drivers on average than Victorian police and therefore the Queensland system was more effective in catching drink drivers. However, when I look at the figures I can clearly see that Victoria's system of random breath testing is a greater deterrent than Queensland's system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also strange that Joh and Russ ignore the figures such as those relating to the road toll. The average for the five years prior to Victoria's introduction of random breath testing was 908.6. It has since dropped to 784.75 which is a 26 per cent decrease. Queensland's toll has steadily risen over that same period. The national average of road deaths per 100,000 head of population was 22.4 in 1980. Victoria's figure was 19.9, having dropped from 23.7 and Queensland's figure was well above the average at 25.9. Without any statistical evidence Mr Bjelke-Petersen dismissed random breath testing as a possible form of assistance in lowering the road death toll by saying that it was an infringement of civil liberties. When has the Queensland Government ever been concerned about civil liberties! Just look at its record. I recall the state of emergency during the Springboks tour, the ban on street marches and now its Commonwealth Games legislation. No, Joh and Russ are diverting attention and passing the buck. If Mr Hinze were concerned with the road toll he would give up his Racing and Local Government portfolios to concentrate on Main Roads and Police. I would like to know whether the Minister for Education (Mr Fife), who is sitting at the table feels that his portfolio is so easy that he could handle a further three portfolios. Of course he cannot, and neither can Queensland's Minister for Main Roads, Mr Hinze. If he were really concerned he would hound this Federal Government and his colleagues for more funds. In that way he would show that he is interested in the main roads situation and that he is interested in reducing the road toll. </PARA>
<PARA> While Joh was strongly refusing to introduce random breath testing, even for a trial period, his wife Senator Flo had the marvellous suggestion of giving the money set aside to buy land for the Aborigines to road projects. Senator Flo said she would push hard for the Federal Government to direct funds from 'much less important areas' to road works in Queensland. I suggest to the honourable senator that if her husband were genuine and sincere about Queensland's roads and road accident fatalities his first step would be to prove his sincerity by setting aside the $2.3m he has allocated himself to buy a new jet to improve the roads not in a Labor electorate but in the electorate of Dawson. I think that would be a sound suggestion for the Premier to take in hand. </PARA>
<PARA> The sorry state of Queensland's political representation is another avenue in which Queensland is greatly disadvantaged. We might ask where would Labor hope to get the funds to allocate to roads. We would not think of roads as a burden, as does this Government. It also thinks of pensioners and those nasty unemployed people as similar burdens. We would think of roads as an investment. The return would come as savings in many areas. Those savings would come in the short and long term and be both monetary and environmental. Just consider one area of saving-the health costs of caring for the victims of road accidents. I would again like to quote from the Minister's Press release of 13 April in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The annual cost of deaths, injuries and property damage in road accidents has been set as high as $3,000 million. </PARA>
<PARA>I add that if one looks at the cost of an accident in cold monetary terms one would see that for every man aged between 20 years and 30 years who dies in a road smash the community loses $500,000 in lost earnings, tax revenue and commensurate returns for the cost of the person's education and upbringing. For those permanently disabled through an accident the loss may increase to $1m and dependants of traffic crash victims become charges on the public purse, something which the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) would no doubt hate to see. </PARA>
<PARA> Although 3,300 died in Australia on the roads last year and the majority of those were under 30 years of age, injuries reached a far higher figure-about 10 times as many. The Minister's figure of $3,000m starts to look very realistic indeed. That figure will increase annually as the road toll increases, more people are being saved from death by the latest life saving medical knowledge, yet the Government continues its stringent slashing of road funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Another detrimental result of the Government's road funding policy which concerns Australia as a nation and Queenslanders in particular is that this country does not have all-weather defence roads connecting vital areas with the north where we would surely be attacked if we were ever in such a danger. To paraphrase a distiguished colleague:</PARA>
<PARA> It took World War II to get a road from Adelaide to Darwin. It will probably take another world war to get it sealed. </PARA>
<PARA>Army officers have inspected the Flinders Highway between Townsville and Charters Towers and reported that they were appalled at the possibility of having to deploy large contingents of armed units along the road in a defence emergency. I have travelled widely on the roads in Queensland and the Northern Territory and I can say with some authority and without fear of contradiction that most of those roads in the wet season are continual bogs and in the dry they resemble the trenches of the Somme in France during World War I. In the event of a natural disaster in or an invasion of the north the possibility of rapidly moving troops and equipment along these roads is virtually nil. It is a national scandal that our northern areas are almost totally cut off from receiving substantial ground support from armed forces in times of desperate need. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has the policies to straighten out this country's road system. We are not concerned with making huge and sweeping cutbacks across the board, regardless of their merit, and at the same time ignoring tax fraud, medical practitioners' fraud and the like. The savings we will make from legislation in those areas will be put to work in other areas such as roads which we consider to be an investment in the future. At present the future does not look too bright, considering the Budget blowout, the worsening economic situation and the appallingly short-sighted Bills such as this amendment Bill which is simply a Government measure for retaining funds to balance the books at the end of the year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Honourable members will recall that on 11 March the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) sought to impugn the integrity and conduct of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in relation to the investigations of the Nugan Hand group. I think at the end of that debate it was demonstrated that the allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition were false. Other allegations have arisen in Question Time and in various debates that have occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent weeks the Leader of the Opposition has taken the view that the terms of reference of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking were inadequate to allow investigation of all allegations of unlawful activities of the Nugan Hand group of companies. He indicated a strong preference to have a new royal commission established for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> As the House has been informed by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and myself on many occasions, the Government envisaged upon the establishment of the Stewart Royal Commission the possibility of an extension of its terms of reference to cover other drug trafficking groups. It felt that this approach ought to be tested before any consideration was given to the possibility of a new royal commission. I wrote to Mr Justice Stewart informing him of developments and the House resolved to send the Hansard of the debate to the royal commissioner. Furthermore, the Commonwealth's law officers were asked by the Prime Minister to examine the documents which the Leader of the Opposition tabled in the House on 25 March and the allegations concerning Nugan Hand made in the House and the Senate as well as a letter to the Prime Minister from the Leader of the Opposition with a view to ascertaining whether the matters raised warranted an extension of the Stewart Royal Commission's terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> The law officers have formed the opinion that an extension of the terms of reference of the royal commission is warranted to cover allegations of:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Nugan Hand's involvement in drug dealing, beyond any association with the Clark group;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Nugan Hand's laundering of money, and association with organised crime;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) interference with earlier investigation of Nugan Hand. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the text of the law officers' report. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>NUGAN HAND</PARA>
<PARA>JOINT OPINION</PARA>
<PARA> We have been asked to examine the recent published material and allegations made concerning the activities of Nugan Hand to ascertain whether they warrant an extension of the terms of reference of the Stewart Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We have examined copies of the documents tabled in the House of Representatives by the Honourable the Leader of the Opposition on 25 March 1982 (House of Representatives Hansard, 25 March 1982, page 1401) and read the allegations in that House and the Senate on that day concerning the activities of Nugan Hand. We have also examined the material and allegations (including the matter incorporated into Hansard) concerning the activities of Nugan Hand raised in the Representatives on 11, 16, 17, 18 and 24 March 1982 (House of Representatives Hansard, pages 890-927, 959-960, 976-988, 1033-1034, 1127-1131 and 1313-1314). We have read as well a copy of a letter dated 25 March 1982, relating to a re- examination of the Commission's terms of reference from the Hon. Bill Hayden to the Rt Hon. Malcolm Fraser, C.H., M.P. </PARA>
<PARA> We think that the material and allegations in the tabled documents and the passages from Hansard above set out warrant an extension of the terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> In our opinion the terms should be so drafted as clearly to authorise, for example, an inquiry by the Commissioner into the allegations of Nugan Hand's general involvement in drug dealing as opposed to such dealing only when in association with Terrence John Clark; into the allegations of a general laundering of money wrongfully obtained or wrongfully concealed from the Australian authorities and into allegations of co-operation with organised crime . </PARA>
<PARA> None of the papers tabled support an allegation of trafficking in arms. There is nothing to suggest public disquiet on the question. We think that in the absence of some credible evidence to suggest it or a sense of positive public disquiet the terms should not be extended to include arms trafficking. </PARA>
<PARA> The transcript of the television interview of a former Narcotics Bureau agent contains statements that Michael Hand was understood to be either an 'ex-CIA operative or a current CIA operative' (House of Representatives Hansard, page 924) and that other people connected with the CIA were within the Nugan Hand organisation. The basis for this, as for similar suggestions in one of the tabled documents, nowhere appears. The imprecision of the statements and their hearsay basis hardly support an extension in this regard of the terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> Suggestions of Nugan Hand's involvement with foreign intelligence agencies have appeared from time to time in the Press. The sensational nature of the allegation is, no doubt, in part responsible. But apart from allegations in the tabled papers of Michael Hand's and Bernard Houghton's association (in the main spoken of in the past) with foreign intelligence services, there is no real evidence to support Nugan Hand's involvement. The additional reference to a retired U.S. Admiral (former head of an Intelligence Group with which Hand or Houghton or both had worked) as employed by Nugan Hand or a subsidiary does not carry the matter further. Nor do references to attendance at meetings called for commercial purposes of retired high ranking members of the U.S. Defence forces. Their engagement in commerce is hardly unusual. </PARA>
<PARA> While it is open to the Government to extend the terms to include Nugan Hand's alleged involvement or cooperation in its illegal activities with foreign intelligence agencies, on the present material we are unable to advise it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hayden's letter says ''it is essential the Commission enquire into allegations that Government officials and/or Ministers inhibited or attempted to inhibit investigations into all or some Nugan Hand activities''. Material which could suggest such action by a Government official, although not by Ministers, is contained in the papers tabled by Mr Hayden and allegations to that effect have been made in the Representatives and during a television interview, the transcript of which is incorporated in Hansard (H. of R.) of 11 March, 1982 at p . 924. The terms of reference, we think, should be extended to include this allegation. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether they should also extend to allegations concerning Ministers is more doubtful. The suggestion is that some Minister other than the then responsible Minister gave the direction to confine the investigation. The issues would therefore be, was any such direction given, and, if so, by which Minister from amongst all those in the Ministry? It is open to serious doubt whether general allegations of this gravity against, in effect, any, perhaps each, member of the Ministry should be submitted to a Royal Commissioner. Nonetheless, the terms should be widened, as we have said, to include whether a Government official improperly sought to confine the investigations. A term of reference raising the question whether any person improperly interfered with, or sought to confine, the investigation would allow inquiry into whether a Government official did so as well as permitting inquiry into a specific allegation against a specified Minister, past or present. Such a term is, we think, sufficient for the present circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having regard to the nature of the matters identified by the law officers as requiring further investigation and their relation to matters already under investigation by the Stewart Royal Commission, the Government does not think it appropriate that a new commission should be established. A further inquiry into these matters will be best handled by the Stewart Commission under extended terms of reference. Extension of the Royal Commission's terms of reference to cover Nugan Hand would be consistent with our announcement on establishing the Commission that the terms of reference might need to be supplemented to cover other drug trafficking groups. It is also consistent with the need for a wide and impartial inquiry into all aspects touching Nugan Hand, including those reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 March 1982 of evidence given to investigators that Nugan Hand supported and was used by persons and organisations across the political spectrum. There is a need for even-handedness in action to be taken by the Government in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has made a decision, subject of course to the views of States which have granted concurrent commissions, that the terms of reference for the Stewart Commission should be extended as recommended by the law officers. The Prime Minister has written to the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland to seek their support in principle to the proposed extension of the terms of reference. The letter raised the need for agreement by at least New South Wales of a parallel extension of its commission to consider breaches of State law. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has noted the law officers' conclusion that the need for a specific inquiry into any foreign intelligence agency links has not been established. There have been firm United States denials about Central Intelligence Agency involvement with Nugan Hand. The Government intends, however , that the extended terms of reference will be wide enough to allow the Commission to investigate Nugan Hand links with any organisation. The Commonwealth has always taken the view that all persons involved in criminal activities affecting Australia, regardless of whether they are members of any organisation, should be thoroughly investigated with the aim of establishing their involvement in drug trafficking or other crimes. In relation to the Royal Commission investigation, the Leader of the Opposition has on occasions raised the matter of the protection of witnesses. I assure the House that the Australian Federal Police will be made available to ensure any necessary protection of witnesses before the Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have indicated to the House, the Government has had repeated assurances from the United States Government that there was no connection between the CIA and Nugan Hand. On 26 March 1982 the Public Affairs Division of the CIA took the unusual step of issuing a statement responding to allegations about links between Nugan Hand and the CIA, and operations by the CIA against the Labor Government. It emphatically denied those allegations. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the text of a cable handed to the Government by the United States Embassy referring to the statement by the Public Affairs Division of the CIA. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to a recommendation from Mr Justice Woodward in his further report into drug trafficking, and on the Commonwealth's initiative, the terms of reference for the Commonwealth-New South Wales Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking were widened to enable it to investigate the evidence concerning Nugan Hand and persons associated with it. Volume 1 of the Joint Task Force report deals with the activities of Murray Stewart Riley, Harry Wainwright and some related drug matters. The draft Press release submitted by the Joint Task Force with Volume 1 and incorporated in Hansard by the Prime Minister on 18 March outlined the reasons why the volume should not be made public. As foreshadowed to the House, the Prime Minister did, however, make a copy of the report available to the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has now considered and accepted the recommendations in Volume 1. Specifically, the Government has endorsed the action proposed for the reference by the Joint Task Force of available evidence, information and relevant papers, concerning the activities of persons named, to the relevant Commonwealth and State Crown law or other authorities so that consideration can be given to the preferment of charges or other appropriate action-such reference is, I am advised, now well in hand; endorsed the proposed reference by the Joint Task Force of relevant information and papers-concerning drug importation routes , unregistered gaol visits, avoidance of the preventative screen by corruption, and sale and purchase of property-to the relevant Commonwealth and State authorities for appropriate action, and agreed that Volume 1 and, where necessary, supportive material be distributed by the Joint Task Force to the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the AFP Bureau of Crime Intelligence. </PARA>
<PARA> A copy of Volume 1 has already been sent to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. I should add that where relevant information and papers are passed to Commonwealth authorities for appropriate action, the Ministers responsible will be asked to monitor progress on necessary corrective action. The Chairman of the Joint Management Committee has been advised of the Commonwealth Government's full endorsement of the recommendations in Volume 1.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the New South Wales Government has taken similar action in relation to matters falling within its areas of responsibility. The Joint Task Force has advised that Volume 2 of its report will deal with the Nugan Hand group of companies and their dealings with known and suspected drug trafficking groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission's extended terms of reference will ensure that it has ample scope to investigate and report on all matters of concern to Australia arising out of allegations made in relation to Nugan Hand. The Royal Commission will be assisted in its work by the decision recently announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) that the Government has decided to amend the income tax law to allow it to be given information held by the Australian Taxation Office. The Prime Minister is writing to the Leader of the Opposition advising him of the Government's decision on extension of the terms of reference of the Stewart Royal Commission. He is informing the Leader of the Opposition that, subject to agreement of the Stewart Royal Commission and the Joint Task Force, he or his Deputy Leader may peruse the relevant files of the former Narcotics Bureau. Those files, which are in the custody of the Royal Commission and the Task Force , hold originals of documents tabled in this House by the Leader of the Opposition on 25 March 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Let there be no doubt in any mind that the Government is resolute in its intention that there should be the fullest possible investigation into the allegations of unlawful activities by the Nugan Hand organisation and persons associated with it in those activities. Moreover, let there be no doubt that the extended terms of reference will make it possible for the Stewart Royal Commission to examine exhaustively all matters of concern to Australia regarding Nugan Hand. As the House has already been informed by the Prime Minister and myself on a number of occasions, the Government has been open and frank in its handling of this matter and has referred all the files to either the Joint Task Force or the Stewart Royal Commission. I remind the House that the Prime Minister and I also appealed to the House and to all persons that if they have any information or documents relating to the activities of the Nugan Hand bank they should come forward to produce that information and documents to either the Joint Task Force or the Stewart Royal Commission. The Government repeats that appeal today. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the statement by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman). It is a substantial improvement on the attitude of the Government in its response to the Nugan Hand matter when I raised it several weeks ago in the Parliament. On those several occasions not only was my concern repudiated and scorned; there was not a small amount of personal vilification involved in the Government's response. Today the Government has acknowl- edged that there was substantial cause for concern on my part and on the part of any person of proper sensitivity about society and his responsibility to society, especially one such as myself in public office. The regret is that the vilification and the attempted obstructionism and obscurantism of the Government of several weeks ago stood between the period when I first raised this matter and the enlightenment which the Government is now displaying. The Government has confessed that I was right and that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) was right too in demanding that there should be a royal commission of inquiry into Nugan Hand's operations and matters associated with that institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has some reservations about a few of the matters that I raised. I will come to those in a minute. The first point I make is that when I wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) responding to his invitation to produce whatever evidence I had, and so on, I pointed out to the Prime Minister that the very strong preference of the Opposition was for a new royal commission to undertake this role. I said that the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking has now been operating for eight months but it is unrealistic to expect the Royal Commissioner to change course by asking him to conduct simultaneously what are in effect two major inquiries. I went on to point out how that would impose an unreasonable strain on that Royal Commission of Inquiry . </PARA>
<PARA> It is better to win some than to lose all the way. It would be better for everyone in the community if we had won all the propositions that we put forward , including the key one that there should be a quite separate royal commission of inquiry on this matter. My hunch is that the Nugan Hand inquiry will be buried in this Royal Commission of Inquiry for months and months-until well beyond the next election and maybe much longer. It is like a horseman trying to ride two horses that decide to go on diverging paths. These inquiries are substantially different in important respects. Having expressed that reservation I will go on to mention some matters in the statement by the Minister for Administrative Services. The Minister has conceded that there should be an inquiry, which goes beyond the Clark group, into Nugan Hand's involvement in drug dealing. Of course there should be. There never should have been any quibble about that. One needed no law refinement, just ordinary common sense and literacy, to understand the terms of reference for the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry. They were too restrictive to allow the sort of inquiry we were proposing and which the Minister said could be undertaken by that Royal Commission when he responded to the concern of my Deputy and me in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry will also consider matters such as the laundering of money, Nugan Hand's association with organised crime and interference with earlier investigations of Nugan Hand. Apparently, it will not investigate allegations of association with the Central Intelligence Agency or of arms trafficking. The Minister, on behalf of the Government, has put up a rather fickle substantiation of that, saying that he has a law officers' opinion. As I read their opinion, the law officers considered only those matters which I raised in the Parliament. A whole huge volume of documentation and commentary, which cannot be ruled out of court, is available in this country on those two matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me tell my story. The last time the Minister interrupted he got himself into trouble. That is why today he is backtracking. I quote from the report of the liquidators, Pegler Ellis and Co., in the case of Nugan Hand. At page 50 the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that some former officers, directors and consultants to the Nugan Hand group had military backgrounds and links at a high level with American Intelligence Organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>From the way in which that is written, it seems to me that the verb 'had' was used as a verb of continuing tense, at the time of the liquidators' investigation. There can be no doubt that Nugan Hand was involved with the CIA and in arms dealing. The Sun-Herald of 15 February 1981 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Nugan Hand Bank had a special arrangement with the CIA to handle its money, including illegal funds from drugs. </PARA>
<PARA> This startling new claim was made by a former executive of the Bank, Mr Neil Evans, a Brisbane tax consultant. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Evans says smuggling operations involving the CIA were worth hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> One secret arms deal through the Bank with Saudi Arabia was worth more than $ 200 million. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have a former senior executive of the Bank declaring this publicly and the Government saying that there is no evidence of it because the law officers said so. Quite obviously, the law officers were instructed by the Government to consider only those matters which were raised in the Parliament. That is a substantial declaration and a matter that demands follow-up and thorough investigation. It is slipshod for the Minister to suggest otherwise. It deceives no one to suggest that the overwhelming evidence is that the Government does not feel that any case has been established for an investigation into that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I express concern as well that the expanded terms of reference for the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking do not provide explicitly for investigation of those matters which have been raised as allegations associating the Central Intelligence Agency with Nugan Hand. They mainly relate to the intelligence association and also to gun running operations with which both the CIA and Nugan Hand have allegedly been associated. The Minister said this in his statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has always taken the view that all persons involved in criminal activities affecting Australia, regardless of whether they are members of any organisation, should be thoroughly investigated. </PARA>
<PARA>And so on. In that context the investigation of any organisation is associated with criminal activities. The Minister was generous enough, at the commencement of the suspension of the sitting for dinner, to point out to me that that, like some other comments he has made in this House on this matter, was misleading. In fact the terms of reference will be couched widely enough, but I suspect not specifically enough for my satisfaction, to include investigation of the CIA. I hope it will allow the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry to initiate investigations into those matters. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says it will and I thank him for that assurance. I do not accept, as he does, the assurances of the CIA that it has never been involved with Nugan Hand. I quote further from the Minister's statement: There have been firm United States denials about CIA involvement with Nugan Hand. Quite frankly, on its record the only people who would accept that sort of guarantee from the CIA would be the sort of people who would believe Ronald Biggs when he said that he had never travelled by train. The CIA has a deplorable record. Let me give honourable members some quotations from a book I read a little while ago by John Stockwell, a former CIA officer. In his book 'In Search of Enemies: A CIA Story' he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I was assigned to a managerial position in the CIA's covert Angola program . Under the leadership of the CIA Director we lied to Congress and to the 40 Committees, which supervised the CIA's Angola Program. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . Our secrecy was designed to keep the American public and press from knowing what we were doing. </PARA>
<PARA>That is from page 10. On page 11 he deals with the pride displayed by Richard Helms, one of the CIA directors, on the occasion of his conviction of perjury for lying to a Senate committee. Who would believe the CIA on its record as an operative agency of the American Government? It has been deplorable and often out of control, and it can be rarely trusted. The CIA has been involved in gun running activity. Let me quote:</PARA>
<PARA> Joe Judge, US arms dealer has given an on the record interview stating that he was told by the CIA to use Nugan-Hand for gun running purposes. He alleges that Nugan-Hand was used in such a manner. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the papers left behind after Nugan's death-</PARA>
<PARA>We have a photocopy of this in my office-</PARA>
<PARA>in his own hand-writing from 1975 was: Military weapons Rhodesia, pay in gold, recoilless rifles, mortars 60/80M, M79 grenade launchers, Quad 50 calibre machine guns . . . ex-factory shipment, expecting phone call . . . Les Collings (Hong Kong Manager for Nugan Hand)-</PARA>
<PARA>That is my interpolation-</PARA>
<PARA>referred by Hand can send for inspections. Lee will take him . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is another quotation:</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other reports of Nugan-Hand being involved in arms deals with Brazil, Thailand and other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Wilson, who was Nugan-Hand's Middle East Manager and also associated with US Intelligence, is a major arms dealer. Wilson is currently wanted by the American authorities in connection with arms sales to Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Patry Loomis, as well as being a member of the CIA, is reported to have used Nugan-Hand to transfer huge sums of money for arms deals as well as payments for intelligence activities. </PARA>
<PARA>That is more than enough substantial evidence to justify an investigation of CIA activity in association with Nugan Hand. The people who have been associated are : Admiral Yates, William Colby, General Ed Black, Ed Wilson, Michael Hand, Walt McDonald, Bernie Houghton, Patry Loomis, Dale Holgreen and Guy Pauker. They are all US military or intelligence personnel of a very senior order. It seems to be an extraordinary coincidence that they all found in a short time that Nugan Hand was a favourite parking station for retired CIA and military officers of United States forces. One has substantial grounds for believing that the CIA operatives were not retired, if indeed CIA operatives ever retire. I mentioned before the dinner break Neil Evans, a former director of the Nugan Hand Bank, who declared that secret arms deals were conducted-I interpolate involving the CIA-by Nugan Hand. Of course, we had the declaration of the liquidator handling Nugan Hand's affairs to the effect that the CIA had in fact been involved in Nugan Hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the role of our own security agency, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I quote from an article written by Brian Toohey and Marian Wilkinson which appeared in the National Times. The authors of the article have carried out some impressive investigative journalism in this very difficult area. It is extraordinarily difficult to penetrate this clam shell. They said this:</PARA>
<PARA> According to a green stamp in Immigration records, Houghton--</PARA>
<PARA>Parenthetically I point out his association with the CIA and Nugan Hand--</PARA>
<PARA>was Security Cleared by ASIO in 1969. A blue stamp in 1972 immigration papers show him as 'Listed ASIO', while he was 'vouched for' by the NSW head of ASIO in other 1972 papers. </PARA>
<PARA>Toohey and Wilkinson went on to say that in spite of all this Woodward, then in charge of ASIO, wrote that ASIO had nothing on Houghton. We do not cop that either, and we are far from satisfied at the way in which these investigations have been conducted to this point. We are appalled at the way the Government sought to obscure and deflect discussions. </PARA>

But let me remind him of what he said about me and the matters I raised in this House in relation to the need for an expansion of the terms of reference for the Stewart Royal Commission of inquiry if it was going to handle this matter. I repeat my preference for a separate commission of inquiry for practical reasons. As a commentary not on the quality of what I had to say but on his own intelligence and application to his task, the Minister, on 16 March 1982, said: 'Has anyone ever heard anything so pathetic?' and 'I am afraid that he has demonstrated his ignorance yet again' rejecting the proposition I was putting forward and the evidence in support of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I find it unacceptable that there will be a total exemption, apparently if one takes the legal opinion, of any authority for the royal commission to investigate any alleged association of an unnamed Minister or Ministers. It will be appropriate for the royal commission of inquiry to investigate all unnamed senior or junior or in-between officials of the Public Service. They are in a different category. That is appropriate. But there should not be special immunity for any member of this Parliament let alone the Government if allegations have been made. It is in their interests that they have a clean record, that the slate be established as a clean one by an independent investigation. I repeat that it is a shame it took the Government so long to realise that the seriousness motivating the Opposition in this matter was well and truly justified. We have had an important moral victory on this matter with this large concession to date.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In resuming the debate on the Roads Grants Amendment Bill 1982 I feel I should seize the opportunity to comment on some of the comparisons made by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), the shadow Minister for Transport in the Opposition. He drew many comparisons which showed that road grants had progressed only by low percentages on an annual basis. But the comparisons he made were unfair because he failed to take into consideration the tremendous increase in general purpose revenue grants made by this Government, both to State governments and to local governments, particularly since 1975. Members of this Parliament will be well aware of the generosity of this Government-the tremendous increase in these general purpose revenue grants and the reason they are paid. General purpose revenue grants are paid to State and local governments so that they can be masters of their own expenditure. Under those conditions, it is unfair to compare purely specific purpose grants without taking into consideration the payment of general purpose revenue grants. From the speech by the honourable member for Shortland I cannot help but feel that once again we have gone back to the era of achievement being measured by how much is spent. That is hardly the birthplace of efficiency. That is exactly what the Labor Government did when it experienced its brief period in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Roads Grants Amendment Bill that is before us is necessary to replace the present controlling legislation which provides for road expenditure to June 1982 . This Bill ensures further funding totalling $2,337m to provide road construction and maintenance funds up to and including the 1984-85 financial year. This Government originally announced a five-year funding program for roads in June 1980. This Bill allows for the completion of that program. I think it is both important and appropriate to reflect on recent developments in our road system. While many people will argue that available funds are inadequate-I can well understand this view-observations can easily be made that disclose that substantial improvements have been made to our road system over the last 20 to 25 years. I ask all honourable members in this House to reflect, in all fairness , on the last 20 to 25 years and to think of the improvements that have been made to the roads on which they regularly drive. </PARA>
<PARA> In a large country with a small population I think the achievement in relation to roads has been quite reasonable. I and many other honourable members drive from Sydney to Canberra quite regularly. Improvements have been made to that road. The expressways that have been constructed along some of the major roads up and down the east coast of my State of New South Wales reflect achievements in road construction. The fact that new bridges are being built and road development is still going on is an indication that progress is being made under difficult conditions. It has not been an easy task to construct roads in this large country-a country with a relatively small population-but this Federal Government has accepted its role to develop roads. It is the role of this Government to develop roads. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to analyse the three tiers of responsibilities for roads. The three sources of funding are the Federal Government, State governments and local governments. It is the Federal Government's role to place emphasis on development and to ensure that roads go to areas with not very large populations . In the more densely populated areas the State governments, but more particularly local governments are able to meet the maintenance costs for their roads. They are better placed than the Federal Government to raise the necessary revenue locally. However, a local authority in the centre of Australia is not as well placed to raise such revenue. So the Federal Government has more of a responsibility to develop roads than to maintain roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the expanded and extended funding provided for in the Bill, conditions of funding remain basically the same as those expressed in the Roads Grants Bill 1981. I should like to refer to the recently reduced number of road categories-down to three-because they remain in this Bill. I should like also to refer to the fact that in 1981 this Government introduced into road building and road maintenance the procedure of open tendering. That has brought efficiency to the building of our roads, and that is a condition which will remain and continue to bring efficiency to our road building and road maintenance programs.</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for $734m for the forthcoming financial year, 1982-83. As the honourable member for Shortland correctly said, that is an increase of about 7 per cent. The Bill provides for $778m for the 1983-84 financial year, which is an increase of 6 per cent, and for the following year $825m, which is, again, an increase of 6 per cent. I realise the concern at the apparent funding restraint embodied in this Bill, but I strongly suggest that judgments as to the degree of restraint can be made only in simultaneous consideration of general revenue grants made by this Government to the States and local government bodies to which I referred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to itemise the increase in general revenue grants to all States, because I want to show, through figures, how the Federal Government is being generous in what it is doing, and that in some cases State governments are not pulling their weight. Looking at this generous increase in general revenue grants-the revenue which goes to States, and is directly tied to personal income tax collections- one finds that all States in Australia in the last four years have had general revenue grants increased from $4,317m to a generous $6,690m, an increase of 53 per cent. I mention those figures because the inflation rate over those four years has not been 53 per cent, so in general purpose revenue grants there has been an increase in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Four years ago total grants from this Government to local government throughout Australia were $165m. It is estimated that in 1981-82, four years later, local government will receive $351m-an increase of 113 per cent. That is a most generous increase when compared with the rate of inflation, and it is certainly an increase in real terms. Those general revenue grants can be used at the discretion of the State or local government authority which receives them. If those bodies choose to do so, they can be used for road maintenance or road building. That was the basic purpose of our tax sharing arrangements when they were introduced in this Parliament in 1975. They were introduced so that those authorities, which have been elected by people, could bear the responsibility for the priorities that they give to their spending areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to my own State of New South Wales, and itemise the general purpose revenue grants received by that State. They are contained on page 209 of Budget Paper No. 7. Anyone can see them. In 1977-78 New South Wales, through the tax sharing arrangements, in general purpose revenue grants, received $1,319,609. Yet in 1981-82-this year, four years later-that general purpose revenue sharing arrangement will net for New South Wales $2,535m. That is an increase of just on 100 per cent. The latest figures I can get on road expenditure in New South Wales are for the year 1979-80. We find that expenditure in that year, through the New South Wales Department of Main Roads, was $119.4m. In that same year expenditure on roads by local government totalled $153.5m. So in New South Wales in this particular year a total of $273m was spent on roads. In that year this Federal Government granted to the State for road expenditure just on $117m, which left roughly $100m for the State to finance out of its own sources. </PARA>
<PARA> Keeping that in mind, it might be worth while to look at just one statistic-how much New South Wales collected in that year from owners of motor vehicles in State taxes and motor vehicle registration fees. The State is short of about $ 100m over and above our grant yet it collected from owners of motor vehicles in 1979-80 $181.4m. So we have a situation-I have no doubt this happens in other States-where the Federal Government gets the blame for not providing funds for road grants and the State Government of New South Wales is short-changing the motorist by expending on roads not even the total amount of charges it imposes directly on owners of motor vehicles by way of taxes and registration fees on their vehicles. Yet when it cannot perform a task or go ahead with a program it does not tell the public that; it takes the easy way out and blames the Federal Government. It says to the people that it is sorry, but it does not have any money. It is just a farce. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about road grants it is important that we keep in mind the general purpose revenue grants that I spoke about. In the example I gave from my own State, not only is the New South Wales Government not using on roads any of the increased general purpose revenue grants that come out of tax sharing, which have been increased most generously, but also it is even short-changing the general public on what it receives directly from the motorist. That is the situation we have. Yet people argue that we are not providing sufficient funds for roads. No matter how much we spend on roads, because they are so essential to the country, nothing is sufficient. But, really, the arguments are very unfair. If other members of this Parliament analyse State financial figures further, they will find that the same thing is happening. The States are not pulling their weight and are not accepting their responsibility for the development of roads. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes I have left, I would like to shift to the matter of road safety. There is no doubt-the community agrees-that the accidents on our roads are of tremendous cost to this community. Some two years ago, in common with the honourable member for Shortland and the Deputy Opposition Whip, I served on the Standing Committee on Road Safety of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stand corrected, of this Parliament. I saw statistics on the tremendous, terrible burden on this country that results from the damage to property and people caused by road accidents. Of course, one of the best ways of overcoming this situation is to build better roads. The Government is sympathetic to that concept but, if I may return to the point at which I started , the Government cannot do that alone. It cannot supply all of the funding necessary for such a massive program. State governments must help. Local governments must help. They have the population and resources to gain revenue, with which do these jobs, from those who are the users of the roads. The job of the Federal Government is to top up such funding and to ensure that roads are developed in the remote areas of Australia. As population moves out into those areas through the development of roads and communication there is created in years to come a local basis from which revenue can be obtained to maintain the roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support the Bill as one that is both sensible and adequate. I believe that that is the correct terminology to use in describing it. But we must always bring home to the people of Australia that governments at three levels are responsible for our roads. I refer to the Federal Government, to the various State governments and to the 800 or so local governing authorities. They must all pull their weight. They must stop shovelling the blame on to this Government because what it is doing for our roads, bearing in mind that it is spending the taxpayers' money, is quite adequate. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I were asked what I thought was the single most important public works project initiated by the Whitlam Government I would say unhesitatingly the National Roads Act, which specified that a national highway would be built. From 1969 to 1975 I concentrated a large part of my parliamentary career upon highlighting the enormously high rate of death and injury on Australian roads. I constantly reiterated the need to build a national highway linking the major cities of Australia. In 1972, at my instigation, the Australian Labor Party held a road safety conference at Terrigal. Approximately 200 people from all over Australia were present. They heard Mr Whitlam announce that a Labor Government would introduce national highway legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Prior to the advent of the Whitlam Government, the practice had been for the Commonwealth to provide substantial amounts of money to the States over roughly five-year periods, under the Commonwealth aid roads legislation. The funds were allocated on a population basis, for the States to do with as they wished. Regrettably, that system led to the funds being used by the States in a pork barrel fashion to dish out benefits to marginal rural areas and thus win votes, rather than build a more efficient and safe road system. This pork barrelling led to a ludicrous situation in which, in rural back blocks, one found superb two-lane roads leading from one small country town to another while the main highways connecting major cities and towns of Australia, on which the greatest amount of traffic occurred, were often little better than goat tracks. I was at a loss to understand how this absurd situation was ever allowed to develop. I have nothing against rural communities having adequate roads but surely if governments are to spend billions of dollars on roads it is logical that their first priority should be with regard to those roads that carry the major share of traffic. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget that while the national highways connecting Cairns, Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth provided improved motoring and greater safety for city travellers, they also benefit the overwhelming majority of the rural communities which live along them. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation which introduced the national highways sytem in 1974 provided that approximately 30 per cent of funds would be spent on developing a national highway. Because of the considerable engineering planning that was required for major highways the fruits of that legislation are only now becoming evident. I am fairly familiar with at least two sections of the national highway and I want to make special mention of those in this speech. </PARA>
<PARA> When I first became a member of this Parliament almost 13 years ago I used to travel from Gosford to Canberra. Apart from the fact that the trip took between 5 1/2 to 6 hours it was at best a dangerous and at worst a nightmarish journey, particularly from Sydney to Canberra. The rural sector of the trip commenced at Liverpool. For the next 150-odd miles it was for the most part a narrow, bumpy, tortuous goat track and one fought to stay on the road against extremely heavy traffic, much of which was semi-trailers. When it was raining one always felt thankful that one had survived the trip. When an accident occurred, as it did with monotonous regularity, the road was often jammed by traffic for a number of hours. The Hume Highway was nototious both for its nightmarish qualities for general driving and the horrific, often multiple, crashes that occurred at frequent intervals. If my recollection is correct, about 90 people were killed every year on the Hume Highway between Liverpool and Albury. I have travelled on the Hume Highway to Goulburn and on the Federal Highway to Canberra on dozens of occasions during the past 13 years. The improvement is dramatic until about 60 kilometres from Canberra. The opening of the 35-kilometre F5 south-western freeway section on 15 December 1980 made it a 40-minute to 45-minute trip from Liverpool to Mittagong and there is an almost uninterrupted four-lane divided expressway from Liverpool to not far from the village of Collector. </PARA>
<PARA> Between Sydney and Goulburn there is now, I understand, 198 kilometres of dual carriageway. The saving in time is dramatic. Where once it would have taken 5 1/ 2 hours to 6 hours to travel from Gosford to Canberra the trip can be done comfortably and safely in 4 1/4 hours to 4 1/2 hours. As yet I have been unable to obtain comparative accident figures but I would be surprised if there has not been a significant improvement. Overseas experience shows that when a new expressway, freeway or autobahn replaces a two-lane road there is a 70 per cent to 80 per cent drop in the road toll. Sometimes the figures are confusing because often a new highway will lead to increased speed and of course increased usage. Motorists are often directed to the new highway, resulting in a significant increase in traffic. So at first glance some of the figures, as I said before, may be a little confusing. It is important to note the comments made by the Minister when opening the Campbelltown to Yanderra freeway section. He said. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of this project is in the vicinity of $80m. With the opening of this new section the distance between Liverpool and Mittagong will be reduced by more than 13 kilometres. It is estimated that there will be an overall reduction in excess of 30 minutes in travel time between the two centres-a saving of $13m a year to the community. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister did not indicate whether the $13m saving included accident savings or just fuel and time conservation. However, assuming the $13m a year includes everything it means that the $80m that has been expended on the expressway will be recovered in six years. In economic terms alone, not to mention comfort, time saved and the safety aspect, we can justify very substantial increases in road expenditure. That is the point that I think the honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield) missed completely. It is acknowledged by the transport economists that good roads pay for themselves through the reduced consumption of petrol and less depreciation and wear and tear on vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me point out that although the Hume Highway serves the millions of people who live in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, it provides the same benefits to all those country residents who live along the route between Sydney and Melbourne as well as many others, such as those who live in the Riverina and southern tablelands who now choose the Hume Highway to travel interstate or intrastate. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to the area which I know best because it is the main route that runs through my electorate of Robertson. When I was first elected as a member of this House in 1969 I represented the area connecting Sydney and Newcastle from the Hawkesbury River to Lake Macquarie. Undeniably it is one of the most beautiful areas in Australia, as indicated by the fact that it is now one of the two major retirement areas in Australia. However, one of the prices which it has to pay for its beauty is the very rugged, almost mountainous, and heavily wooded country that covers at least the southernmost section of the Central Coast. </PARA>
<PARA> In the early 1960s the Labor Government of New South Wales announced that it would build a first class inter city expressway linking the cities of Sydney and Newcastle. A start was made in March 1963 and by the time the Labor Government was defeated in 1965 the Sydney and Newcastle expressway was well under way. </PARA>
<PARA> The section from the Hawkesbury River to Mount White opened in December 1965 and the section to Calga in 1966. The Hawkesbury to Berowra section was started at the end of 1966 and opened at the end of 1968. The cost was about $40m, which seems remarkably cheap in this day and age, but I remind honourable members that we are talking of prices of nearly 20 years ago. From then until the Askin Liberal Government left office in 1976 the only added work was the erection of a new bridge across the Hawkesbury River. It is to the Askin Government's eternal shame that it virtually abandoned the Sydney-Newcastle expressway, which covered the busiest and one of the most dangerous roads in Australia. The motive was clear. The Government distributed its public works expenditure where it felt it would win it the most votes and not where the funds would contribute to a more efficient and safer road system. It was and remains a scandal. </PARA>
<PARA> The advent of a Federal Labor government specifically allocating a proportion of the Commonwealth road grants to a national highway led the New South Wales Liberals to scream like banshees that the Whitlam Government was dictating to them how they could spend their money; their money, mind you! No account was taken of the fact that it was the Commonwealth that had to face the odium of raising the taxes. The cry of the States down through the ages has always been: 'You raise the money in taxes and we will get the credit for how it is spent'. I am not talking just about Labor or Liberal governments. All States love to get the money and to spend it. They love the Federal Parliament to raise the taxes and cop the odium for doing so. To its credit the Whitlam Government, and particularly its courageous Minister for Transport, Mr Charles Jones, held firm. Australia had a responsibility to build a proper national highway system in order to improve driving safety, save lives, benefit tourism, build our defence system and reduce costs to the driver, the consumer and the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Starting in 1974, plans previously pigeon-holed were resurrected and a long slow process redesigning the balance of the Sydney-Newcastle expressway began. Finally, in 1977, a start was made on the Ourimbah to Doyalson section. I want to stress how important this section is. It includes a notorious stretch of winding road from Tuggerah to Kangy Angy where some of the worst accidents have occurred with monotonous regularity. Every few months-sometimes every few weeks- one hears that another serious head-on collision has occurred in that short three or four kilometre stretch. In December last year I asked the Department of Main Roads to take me out for a day to inspect the work that it had done and to explain to me the plans for the completion of the balance of the Sydney- Newcastle expressway. The actual roadwork on the Ourimbah-Doyalson stretch is 11 kilometres. That is nearly completed. As I recall there are some seven bridges of varying sizes to be built. It is anticipated that this stretch will be completed some time in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> Work is well advanced in sections of the Ourimbah to Calga strip, particularly in the northern area near Ourimbah around Dog Trap Road. It is a magnificent feat of engineering. I suggest that honourable members who are interested in roads should go and look at what is being done there. This region is not flat open country such as one sees on the Federal Highway on the way to Canberra. It is extremely mountainous with deep gullies and hills that require huge quantities to fill. I was full of admiration for the engineers, workmen and private contractors all of whom are participating in this superb piece of road engineering that will ultimately lead to a magnificent four to six lane highway of approximately 100 kilometres in length, linking the cities of Sydney and New- castle, which is the busiest stretch of intercity highway in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the building of the first three sections of the Sydney-Newcastle expressway one had to allow 3 1/2 hours of tortuous, dangerous driving to travel from the Harbour Bridge to Hunter Street, Newcastle. I expect that when the expressway is finally completed the same trip will be done in around 1 1/2 hours and with very little risk of a serious accident. For most of the journey it would be impossible to be involved in the worst type of motor vehicle accident, the head-on collision. If plans go according to Hoyle, the expressway should be completed from Berowra to Doyalson, even to Toronto, by 1987-88. That will be a nice present for the Bicentennial to those who use this highway. I have no information about the proposal to extend the expressway south to Pearce's Corner at Wahroonga, although I understand the Federal Government has committed $60m towards this part of the project. Those who travel on their holidays or travel regularly to work on this road, will know what a nightmare the section to and from Sydney is at weekends, holidays and at peak periods. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the good news; now for the bad news. After the State Liberal Government did virtually nothing to advance the expressway during the 11 years it was in government in New South Wales, we now find that the Federal Government, under the stewardship of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), proposes to interfere in the funding provided for the New South Wales Government by directing a large portion of the funds allocated under the National Roads Act away from the Sydney -Newcastle section of the national highway to work on the Hume Highway. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the Press release of the Minister of 27 November 1981. </PARA>

<PARA>(Statement by the Minister for Transport, Mr Ralph J. Hunt, MP)</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport, Mr Ralph Hunt, has moved to ensure a larger share of National Roads funds is spent on upgrading the Hume Highway between Sydney and the Victorian border.</PARA>
<PARA> ''I made this decision after reviewing the National Highway construction work priorities outlined by New South Wales in its National Roads program recently submitted for my approval,'' he said.</PARA>
<PARA> ''The New South Wales Government proposed to commit a disproportionate share of Commonwealth funds to construction of new National Highway works between Sydney and Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA> ''In the Commonwealth's view, this diversion of funds would result in an unacceptable slowing down of urgently-needed construction work on the Hume Highway.''</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hunt said he was astonished to see a press report attributed to a senior DMR officer that works on the Hume Highway, in particular the Mittagong/Berrima bypasses, would be set back for an indefinite period-at least 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hunt emphasised that since 1974 the Commonwealth had repeatedly stressed its commitment to the continued upgrading of the Hume Highway from Sydney to Melbourne as a matter of high priority.</PARA>
<PARA> ''Clearly the New South Wales Government no longer considers the Hume Highway is of any great importance'', he said.</PARA>
<PARA> ''I have already indicated the Commonwealth's dissatisfaction with the proposed New South Wales National Highway program and made it clear that the Commonwealth will not permit such an imbalance in the use of Commonwealth funds by New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> ''Accordingly I have asked the New South Wales Minister for Roads to revise the State program to reflect the Commonwealth's view.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. The first point I make about this Press release is that it indicates a complete reversal of the philosophy espoused by the Liberal-Country Party coalition when it was in opposition from 1972 to 1975. At that time it villified the Whitlam Government for what it described as gross interference in the States' right to run their own affairs. It was good enough to hurl that sort of abuse at the Whitlam Government in 1975, but in 1982 when it suits the Liberals and the National Country Party to court votes in Federal seats such as Macarthur and Hume it is prepared to direct the New South Wales Government when and how it should build its section of the national highway. The New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs and Minister for Roads, Mr Whelan, has made it clear that if he is forced to accept the demand of the Federal Minister for Transport that funding for the Sydney-Newcastle expressway be cut from 52 per cent to 36 per cent it will lead to vastly increased costs, dislocation of workers, disruption of planning and continued slaughter on the Wyong to Swansea section of the Pacific Highway which, as I said before, is one of the worst stretches of killer road in New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In conclusion, I make reference to the road toll and the annual hue and cry that erupts each year for something to be done about it. Many members will remember my long involvement in this issue as initiator, member and finally Chairman of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road Safety, later the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety. In all the brouhaha that goes on in the media about the need to reduce the road toll, it seems to me that the experts-I use the words advisedly-are still not capable of an honest appraisal of what has happened in the past decade or so and of suggesting what approach should be adopted in the future. Two things can be learnt by a close examination of the numbers of Australians killed and injured on the road since 1970. The first is that there has been a reduction of both death and injury in actual terms. When one takes into account the increased number of motor vehicles and drivers the reduction is even more dramatic. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table prepared by the Legislative Research Service showing the number of persons killed and injured from 1970 to 1981.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I hope that honourable members will notice that in 1970 the total number of persons killed was 3,798, yet 11 years later the number killed was 3,322, a drop of 476. When one takes into account the very substantial increase in population of about two million, and the even greater increase in the number of vehicles on the road, the number of lives saved is vastly increased. Had Australia gone on killing people on the roads at the same rate as in 1970 the number of people being killed now would almost certainly have reached 6,000 per annum. Evidence of an improved position in real terms is illustrated by the figures in the column on the right which shows the number of people killed per 10,000 vehicles. In 1970 the number was eight. In 1980, the last figure available, it was four.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one were to examine further the figures indicating the types of persons killed according to how they travel one would see that in 1970 the numbers of people killed in different categories were as follows: Drivers and passengers, 2 ,693; pedestrians, 822; motor cyclists, 173; cyclists, 98; and others, 12. In 1981 the figures were as follows: Drivers and passengers, 2,130; pedestrians, 644; motor cyclists, 390; cyclists, 93; and others, 15. If one examines those figures one will notice that the number of drivers and passengers killed dropped by nearly 600, despite a massive increase in the number of people on the road and the number of miles driven. The big increase, of course, is in the number of motor cyclists killed. The number has gone up from 170 to 390.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to spend a great deal more time on this matter. I am not trying to give the impression to this Parliament that we should be complacent about the road toll-of course not. Until those figures are reduced to a fraction of what they are now we should keep on trying. But I wish that those people who write about and comment on the road toll would at least get their facts right. There is no magic formula for reduction of the road toll. Anyone who has been involved with it for long periods will know that. A whole range of measures have to be assessed on a cost-benefit basis. Improved roads are clearly a major source of saving but, of course, a very costly source. We need improved roadside furniture and continued improvement in vehicle design.</PARA>
<PARA> The last figures I saw showed that 80 per cent of people wore seat belts but that the 20 per cent who did not were providing 80 per cent of those killed. In this country we have never looked at the matter of air bags. In some States we have not yet seriously got down to the problem of looking at how we could stop the drunks getting on the roads. Unfortunately my time is running out. I would have liked to spend more time on this problem because it has been of interest to me for many years. I just say that there is no magic formula. The problem cannot be solved by sensational headlines and clever editorials.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In beginning my contribution to tonight's debate I want to take up the concluding comments from the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) and thank him for his contribution because I think he made a quite important point. It is all too easy for commentators of one sort or another to say that the basic problem of the road toll and the road accident level is the condition of the roads. As the honourable member for Robertson said, of course the condition of the roads is a factor in the whole road toll and road accident level problem. But he did add other factors which I think are important and which ought to be emphasised. For instance, he talked about seat belt enforcement. Fortunately in Queensland it has been law for quite a number of years now that people should wear seat belts, but even there I am afraid that often the simple fact of the importance of wearing seat belts is not emphasised enough and is not enforced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He talked about the possible investigation of the use of air bags. I know that early experiments with air bags in the United States of America, in fact, inconclusive but I know also that there have been scientific advances since those days. Yes, the matter ought to be looked at again. The honourable member did not name random breath testing in his concluding remarks. He may have earlier in his speech, but again it is an area that ought to be seriously looked at by all the States as well as the Commonwealth. It is not good enough for Queensland, for example, simply to say: 'Our way of doing it is good enough. It is efficient enough. We do not need to look at random breath testing'. The road toll over the last Easter weekend is enough to require any State government to think very seriously indeed about introducing random breath testing. </PARA>
<PARA> Of those points the honourable member for Robertson raised I would finally mention the whole problem of driver testing in Australia. I believe driver testing, preparation of using vehicles on the road, is simply inadequate in all States and the Commonwealth. I know that there is a resource problem in providing a better system of driver testing. But if we are to be serious about the road toll and the road accident level we have to be serious about driver testing. I hope that the Commonwealth and all the States will be prepared to take a fresh look at that problem and do something about it, not just talk about it. I fully endorse the comments of the honourable member for Robertson in saying that when looking at the road accident problem of Australia today we have to look not only at the condition of roads but also at all the factors which involve the driving of vehicles on roads. We have to be much more serious about all those factors than I think we are currently. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Roads Grants Amendment Bill 1982. One has to support it if for no other reason, of course, than to make sure that the money is there to be spent. That is what this Bill will do; it will ensure that during 1982, 1983 and beyond moneys will be appropriated to continue the work on Australia's road systems. However, in supporting the Bill I point to three general areas in which, in my view, there are deficiencies and at which I hope the Government will take a fresh look to re-examine its priorities. The first point to which I will address myself flows from the 1979 report of the Bureau of Transport Economics. That report was entitled 'An Assessment of the Australian Road System' and it makes some interesting findings about deficiencies in the funding of road projects in Australia. Secondly, I will draw again from other reports concerning the problem of inflation. The overall level of inflation in Australia is probably running at about 9 per cent, but road construction cost inflation has been running at a far higher rate. We have not so far adequately provided for that. The third area that I wish to address myself to concerns the national highways system and, in particular, the Bruce Highway, Highway 1, in my State of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me start with the 1979 report of the BTE, 'An Assessment of the Australian Road System'. Two important facts come from that report. The first is that in terms of economically efficient allocations for the period 1974-75 to 1978-79, compared with those allocations actually made, there was underexpenditure on all roads in Queensland. In other words, whether we are talking about Commonwealth funding or State funding-the provision of funds by all levels of government-the fact remains that in Queensland in that period there was underexpenditure on all roads. I hope that the Queensland Minister for Main Roads, who is very fond of ticking off the Federal Government for its deficiencies, will take note of that point and recognise that it is not just a Commonwealth failing. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point which flows from that assessment is that in carving up the available Commonwealth cake of funds the Commonwealth is still adhering to a formula which is some seven or eight years old. Taking into account developments in the nation, the more accelerated growth in Queensland, Queensland's own special features, which include its decentralised nature-it being, apart from Tasmania, the most decentralised State in the nation-we can see that that seven to eight-year-old formula is simply no longer doing justice to Queensland. That flows very strongly from that 1979 BTE report. Underexpenditure in Queensland, exacerbated by the use of that formula, deprives Queensland as against other eastern mainland States. I therefore say to the Government that while, of course , one must support this Roads Grants Amendment Bill for the sake of getting money to be spent on roads, one also has to say that one is disappointed that the formula has not been re-examined. One is forced to say that that formula-the way in which the national highway funds cake is divided-must in all equity be re -examined as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not easy to use actual figures to prove the point, but let me use one set of figures which, while it does not necessarily prove the point, at least illustrates that there is this misallocation in the division of the existing road funds. If we take the three mainland Eastern States we will see that Victoria-a very small State geographically-received this financial year for spending on its national highway system something like $77,000 a kilometre. New South Wales this financial year received something like $78,000 a kilometre for spending on the national highways. Queensland received only $15,000 a kilometre for spending on its national highway system. As I say, that does not necessarily prove the point because road usage needs in Victoria and New South Wales are obviously far greater than road usage needs on, say, the Landsborough highway of middle Queensland. But the figures at least illustrate that there is a misallocation. They illustrate that that seven-year-old or eight-year-old formula is no longer a fair way of distributing the national road funding cake throughout at least the Eastern States. </PARA>
<PARA> I move from there to talk about the problem of inflation as it affects road construction throughout the nation. A study was carried out recently entitled ' National Highway Deficiencies and Road Funding Strategies'. It has been considered by Commonwealth and State transport Ministers. This study has drawn two major conclusions. First of all, there is a need for funds to be made available for national highways to be increased significantly if deficiencies in the system are to be overcome within a reasonable period. Secondly, the report indicates that a 25 per cent increase in the present level of national road funds would need to be maintained up to the year 2000 to bring the national highway system up to a minimum standard. In other words those two major conclusions-they relate to the national highways system in Australia, not to all the other road categories we are aware of-point to the fact that our road funding is not keeping pace with inflation in terms of the costs of building roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me relate those two major points to a recently prepared Bureau of Transport Economics report entitled 'Road Construction Price Indices 1969-70 to 1980-81'. This report was tabled here on 16 March this year. It includes road construction price indices for each of the 11 years in that period, as well as annual percentage increases. It can be seen from that report that the road construction price index has increased by 208 per cent in the seven-year period 1974-75 to 1980-81. In the same period, Commonwealth road grants to the States and the Northern Territory have increased by only 172 per cent. In other words, in terms only of coping with the inflationary cost of building roads in that seven-year period we have fallen behind in providing funds, from that 208 per cent cost increase level to an actual 172 per cent provision of funds level. That is a serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Putting my remarks on a rather more simple footing, the Bill that we are currently considering seeks to provide in the 1982-83 financial year some 7 per cent increase in funds when compared with what was provided in 1981-82. The figures suggest that the road building cost increase over that same period is double that figure. We are simply not providing enough funds at the national government level-I have already made the point that the other levels of government have to accept responsibility as well-to cover even the inflation component of road building costs. I was pleased to notice that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) indicated in his second reading speech that the Government will be examining in the Budget context the scope to provide additional road funds so as at least to cope with the inflation problem. In my speech tonight I can only emphasise the need for the Government to do that and to make provision in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no special magic wand to wave when it comes to finding extra money. Of course it is difficult to provide more money in one area as against any other area in a Commonwealth Budget. Of course all of us want to see taxes come down rather than go up. But the fact remains that we have a problem in providing adequately for the road system of this nation. Where we find that increases in funding are not keeping pace even with the cost of building roads, let alone with the cost of improving roads in real terms for the future, we have to think drastically about our priorities and we have to think drastically about the provision of funds for road construction. </PARA>
<PARA> My third major point, as I indicated at the outset, relates to the Bruce Highway in Queensland. Of all the national highways in this nation the Bruce Highway is one of the longest-it is not the longest but certainly it is one of the longest-and in many respects one of the most important. It is important not just in road usage terms. I have already admitted, for example, that the Hume Highway in New South Wales and Victoria would have a greater claim to being important in road usage terms. But the Bruce Highway is certainly important in terms of many other factors which include access for visitors who want to travel to different parts of Australia, particularly to north Queensland. Those factors also include decentralisation. Queensland is the most decentralised of the mainland States. The northern Queensland stretch of Australia is populated by people who live in a large number of developed towns and cities and who are involved in a lot of resource and other development in this nation. Also, northern Australia has a defence importance which is highlighted by the fact that Lavarack Barracks is located in Townsville, my own city. If we are to ensure, at least in peacetime, adequate mobility for defence training and capability we have to consider the need for an adequate highway system. So when we take all of these factors into account we have to conclude that the Bruce Highway in Queensland, and in northern Queensland in particular, is one of the most significant national highways in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, that highway is remarkably deficient. On Sunday of this week I had the experience of having to drive my vehicle though hip-high water in order to return to my home city of Townsville so that I could come to this place to contribute in this debate tonight. I did not like driving through that sort of water, but it had to be done. It is not good enough to say: 'Don't drive in the wet'. The fact remains that some people have to drive in such conditions. This does not occur only north of the Tully River stretch where I was faced with this problem on Sunday. There are many parts of the Bruce Highway in north Queensland where, when it rains, the roads are flooded. The roads are flooded at different times of the year. This is simply not good enough having regard to the factors I have already mentioned: decentralisation, defence, development and tourism. In addition, the Bruce Highway in north Queensland in many stretches is narrow, rough and old; it cries out for reconstruction. </PARA>

<PARA> The Commonwealth Government accepts 100 per cent responsibility for the funding of acceptable projects on the Bruce Highway and other national highway systems. However, a new and exciting development came about some six to eight weeks ago when in my company and in the company of Senator Collard and the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), the State Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Police, Mr Hinze and the Federal Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) travelled part of the Bruce Highway system. As a result of that the Ministers jointly announced a Commonwealth-State study of the Brisbane to Cairns national highway. That study, firstly, will formulate a plan for the necessary construction and associated funding to upgrade the highway to an acceptable standard in 10 years. Secondly, the State Minister, Mr Hinze, offered to seek an injection of State funds if the Commonwealth also provides additional funds for the highway. This is an exciting development. We are entitled to be cynical. We have heard enough in the past about the road being done up, but progress is too slow. At least now a definitive study will be undertaken. It is exciting that within a stated achievable period something better will be done for the Bruce Highway in north Queensland. If the study produces a report it will be worthy of support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is very appropriate that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are sitting in the chair tonight while this debate is taking place. You , Mr Deputy Speaker, were the Minister for Transport in the Labor Government from 1972 to 1975 and were responsible for introducing new innovations in the funding of roads. Of course, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) has been talking about one of those programs-the national roads program. I should also like to commend the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) for his contribtion to this debate. For many years he has been interested in road safety and has been highly involved in the Standing Committee on Road Safety. I thought that his contribution was quite good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris ). I think the guts of the amendment need to be emphasised. In part, the amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) reduce the backlog of established roads needs;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) accelerate the rate of road construction and maintenance works;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) improve the efficiency of road transport services;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) reduce the incidence of road deaths and injuries, and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) assist local government bodies to meet road funding difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>I feel that the honourable member for Herbert should support the amendment. The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) also made a contribution to this debate tonight, and I feel that he should support the Opposition's amendment. Both of those honourable members represent country electorates. Their electorates are getting a raw deal similar to the raw deal that I feel the large country electorates are getting. I refer particularly to my electorate of Grey. Comments of the honourable member for Herbert in relation to the road program of the present Government were reported in a Townsville newspaper. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that the amendment should have the support of all honourable members, especially National Country Party members who face these problems in some of the electorates around Australia. National Country Party members often complain about the raw deal their electorates are getting. For that reason I say that they should support the Opposition's amendment. I appreciate their feelings because I represent a large electorate. My electorate runs into problems just as do all large electorates which contain large undeveloped areas in which there is a need to provide roads. This places a great strain on the funds available to local government. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite recently I was able to attend a meeting of the Eyre Peninsula Local Government Association in South Australia, which represents a fairly large part of that State. There was also a meeting in another part of the electorate last week, which unfortunately, I was not able to attend but at which, I understand, the matter of roads was raised. At the Eyre Peninsula Local Government Association meeting the agenda item which received the most attention was, of course, that dealing with roads. I have 23 local government bodies in my electorate and they are all complaining about roads. That emphasises the problems that these bodies face. They are all in trouble over roads and they are looking for greater support from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said this in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> The amounts to be provided in the next three years involve annual increases of 7 per cent in 1982-83, 6 per cent in 1983-84 and 6 per cent in 1984-85. All States and the Northern Territory have been allocated corresponding annual increases in funding. As a result the 1981-82 funding relativities will be maintained through to 1984-85. </PARA>
<PARA>When we look at the percentage of the increase-7 per cent for the current year, 6 per cent for next year and 6 per cent for the year after-we see that the increases are dropping well behind requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian allocation for 1981-82 is $56.302m. For 1982-83 it rises to $60.327m, for 1983-84 it rises to $63.943m and for 1984-85 it rises to $67. 807m. When we work out the relativities, we see that the figures stick closely to what the Minister said-that is, for South Australian increases of 7 per cent, 6 per cent and 6 per cent. All States are treated the same, with the result that many are crying out for greater assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> At a recent local government association meeting in Adelaide problems of local government were raised and certain indications were given. As we all know, quite recently the Bureau of Transport Economics issued a road construction price index. That index demonstrated a road construction price escalation of 15.3 per cent in 1981, following a 15.9 per cent increase in the previous year. South Australia is disadvantaged in its part of the road funding cake. For example-I do not want to appear too parochial-South Australia has 9.7 per cent of the vehicle population, 9.7 per cent of kilometres travelled, 12.2 per cent of the length of roads, 15.5 per cent of the land area and 9.3 per cent of the total population, yet it receives only 8.2 per cent of the Commonwealth road funds. As was pointed out at that meeting, the fact that the Australian National Railways Commission is at present in the process of closing down country railway services means a greater emphasis is being placed on roadways and greater strains are being placed on local governments and State governments in providing funds for those roads. The meeting went on to record:</PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, South Australian local government is now spending an increasingly higher proportion of its total revenue on roads. For example, in 1979-80 16.8 per cent of local government revenue was expended on roads. In 1981 -82 (the latest figures available) this proportion has risen to 21.2 per cent-a significant increase. </PARA>
<PARA>With a 15.3 per cent increase in the cost of road construction in the last year, if local government is in any way to maintain its road services it must put more and more of its money into that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said tonight in criticism of the Whitlam Government. The honourable member for Lyne was fairly strong in his criticism of what the Whitlam Government did in road works. As I have said, during the 1972-75 era of the Whitlam Government, the present occupant of the chair introduced legislation for the national roads program, something which has been of great benefit to the nation and the individual States. One other significant project introduced at that time was the Minor Traffic Engineering and Road Safety Improvements Program . It gave a lot of assistance to local government and state governments in overcoming some of those problems that they all strike, such as the necessity to provide traffic lights and channelling where they are required, as well as the carrying out of other minor traffic engineering projects. Unfortunately the present Government has done away with that program, with the result that the States have to fund all those works from their own resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier in the evening it was said that we should use private contractors for our road works. I think anyone would say that the roads built in South Australia by the Highways Department are of extremely high quality. An officer of this House said to me once after having taken a trip to Perth, that driving over South Australian roads was a pleasure; they were beautiful roads and a credit to the people who built them. In most cases the credit can be taken by the South Australian Highways Department. This fad for making sure all this work goes to private contractors could be a fallacy. A number of road projects have been carried out in my electorate. I remember two. One was the sealing of the Flinders Highway from Port Lincoln to Ceduna. The work reached a certain stage and the contractor went bankrupt. The State was left more or less holding the baby. It did not have the finance to finish the job started by the private contractor, with the result that that road had to wait until finance was available. If my memory serves me right, two contractors building the section of road between Port Augusta and Whyalla went broke. We are not against the use of private contractors but we should be making more use of State government highway authorities and local government people, because they have the expertise in roads and are the most competent to carry out this work.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lyne criticised the Whitlam Government but later said that local government authorities were now able to pick up the untied grants under the arrangements with the Federal Government. We must remember that for 23 years Liberal-Country Party governments gave absolutely nothing to local government. The Whitlam Government introduced Federal funds for local government . However the formula has since changed. People who condemn that Government should at least acknowledge that it recognised the financial problems of local government and commenced those grants to local government bodies. I hope that those people who criticise the government of those years take those factors into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention was made of the amounts that will be allocated over the next three years. It is expected that for 1982-83 the Government will pick up $4,300m in revenue from petrol taxes and levies, et cetera. Yet, it will allocate only $ 734m under this program. I am certainly not one who says that taxation picked up in a particular area should be spent in that area. If that were the case, we could say that the people who are taxed on tobacco could expect bigger and better public ashtrays. I feel that because of the need for road works the States and local government should expect a higher proportion of the money raised in petrol tax to go into our road works programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that everyone has been asked to cut short their speeches so that more people can join in the debate. I wanted to say a few more things about national highways, but I conclude by again recommending the amendment to the House. I suggest that we look at what we can expect if we allocate more of our finances to roads. With better roads we reduce fuel consumption. We lower hospital and medical costs because, one would hope, there are fewer accidents. Some of the reasons for that conclusion were given by the honourable member for Robertson earlier. Also, better roads facilitate the movement of goods, et cetera, to market and promote tourism. They improve communications between all parts of the country, cut down the massive repair bills and lower insurance costs. Again, better roads lessen wear and tear on machinery and parts, whether owned privately or commercially, provide employment and conserve precious energy resources. I conclude on that point but again urge honourable members, particularly those who represent country electorates, to support the proposed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In common with many other speakers in this debate, I acknowledge that the funds provided to the States for roads are insufficient and probably never will be sufficient. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) acknowledged that in his second reading speech. We all sincerely hope that we will see a higher priority accorded to road funding in the forthcoming Budget. There is no doubt that, apart from the use of our roads for general purposes, our defence roads system is in a state of disrepair. I need hardly mention the benefits that better roads bring to the general economy, to tourism and to recreation, or the very essential point that good roads keep people in the country, where much of Australia's income is produced and its rural and mining industries are to be found. Having acknowledged that point, I wish to direct the bulk of my remarks to the subject of road safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been very disturbing to see, in recent weeks particularly in my home State of Queensland, so many people come out to blame on the state of the roads the high accident rate that has been so much in the news. I regret to say that many of those who have been making such remarks and trying to score political points should know better and, in fact, do. I include in that number the Minister for Main Roads in Queensland. The state of the roads is one factor contributing to road accidents; there are many others. They can usually be grouped in twos or threes and are seldom to be found on their own. I have in mind speed, drink, the overloading of vehicles, vehicles that are not roadworthy and weather. But the two greatest problems, on any statistical basis that one might like to name or produce, are speed and the effect of drinking taken together. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems almost not worth mentioning, but a fact that is always overlooked when people are casting around for a place to lay the blame is that it is drivers who cause accidents. Sooner or later we have to take responsibility for our own actions. That comes back essentially to the driver who is in charge of the vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, it is heartening to reflect, as other speakers have done, that the figures concerning Australian road accidents are not all gloomy. In 1979-80 accidents involving casualties numbered some 70,000. If one establishes some sort of ratio between accidents and vehicles one notes that there are 7,500 ,000 vehicles, or almost one for every two people. Thus, the ratio was one accident for each 108 vehicles, but in 1974-75 it was one accident to 98 vehicles. When we consider that and other factors, the ratio is seen as coming down, which is a very heartening sign. For example, in 1960 some 2,468 persons, or 8.8 per 10,000 vehicles, were killed on our roads. In 1980, 20 years later, unfortunately 3,272 people were killed. But at that time the ratio of fatalities per ten thousand vehicles was 4.3, less than half the 1960 figure. So the ratio is down but I regret that it is still not as good as it is in other developed countries, for example the United Kingdom, the United States of America or Canada. </PARA>
<PARA> The big drop in those ratios started in 1970 and although it is impossible to prove conclusively there must be some correlation between the figures for 1970 and the fact that that year seat belts were generally introduced in this country . I mention seat belts because now all too often people throw up their hands and say: 'Well, there is nothing we can do about our road accident figures'. The fact is that there is something that we can do and something must be done. If we are going to throw up our hands and walk away from the problem, that is hardly the action of any responsible government, State or Federal. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980, to illustrate the extent of the problem as it is with us now, some 90, 000 people were injured on our roads. There were 32,000 people admitted to hospital. There were 3,200 road fatalities. It is beyond me how anyone can walk away from those sorts of figures. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 10 years nearly 40,000 Australians have died on the roads and an estimated one million have been injured. Having said that, what is the first thing we can do. I suggest that the first thing to be done is that those States which do not have random breath testing should seriously consider its introduction. I know it is controversial. There is a good deal of talk about civil liberties, the unpopularity of it in electoral terms and many statements have been made that it does not work. All the evidence that I have been able to collect indicates that in fact it does work and that it is a great deterrent. The principle of random breath testing is supported by the Federal Government, the Victorian Government and the South Australian and Northern Territory Governments and ironically by the Queensland National Party which is somewhat at odds with some of its own Ministers. I do urge those States that have not introduced random breath testing at least to try it. South Australia, I understand, has introduced it for a three-year trial period. The States should at least try it and see what is the end result. We cannot accept the toll as it is. Fifty per cent of all road fatalities involve alcohol. Approximately 30 per cent of all road injuries involve alcohol. Each year in Australia some 250 to 300 quadriplegics and paraplegics come off our roads because of road accidents. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on health costs and on pensions for people injured on our roads, not to mention of course the personal suffering that is caused. In Victoria in 1960 there were 1,061 deaths on the road. In 1980 there were 657. That is a decrease of 404 or 38 per cent. That is a most significant figure. It seems to me to be common sense to try random breath testing but it does not make any sense at all to reject it by saying that the evidence is not available. </PARA>
<PARA> As to other actions that could be taken, I would encourage governments to make closer checks on truck drivers logs to ensure that they do not drive for long periods without some sort of adequate rest because all the evidence shows that truck accidents are caused not only by speed by also mainly by fatigue. I would also urge a closer check to be made on some trucking companies which set impossible times for their drivers to meet. It is no wonder, when one looks at some of these times, that accidents occur which are caused by fatigue. I now turn to motor cycles. A motor cyclist in Australia is at something like seven times greater risk than the driver of a motor car. Tougher tests should be implemented for obtaining motor cycle licences. Motor cyclists should not be allowed to be in charge of very powerful machines on the roads until they have proved that they can drive. This simply means that the States should set aside pieces of land where people can learn to ride and be tested before they are given licences to ride on the roads. </PARA>
<PARA> The third suggestion I would make to try to cut down the road toll would be to increase the number of police highway patrols. It seems to me that police patrols must be one of the greatest deterrents to people who are driving unsafely on the roads. I would strongly support the States looking at the provision of special traffic police-highway patrols, if you like-on our highways . The presence of specialist patrols would free other police to attend to more important anti-crime duties. I am not denying the importance of adequate road funding-it is vital to this country, and I look forward to seeing a higher priority placed on it in the coming Budget-but tonight I am more concerned with road safety. Our casualty figures are declining in relative terms, but we cannot afford to neglect them. We should be trying to reduce the figures further. I utterly reject the suggestion that comes forward time and again that the condition of the roads is solely responsible for the casualty rate on our roads.</PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, I turn to another matter but it is related to this subject. I refer to the state of the roads in northern New South Wales and the roads which lead towards my electorate of McPherson. I urge the New South Wales Government to look at the problem which exists in this area. Northern New South Wales is experiencing a boom but it will strangle itself if the roads are not improved. The boom will fizzle out. Some 80 per cent of tourists to the Gold Coast arrive by road. A lot of them come from the south. I have no doubt that the New South Wales Government will say that insufficient Federal funds are provided. I point out that specific purpose grants for roads are made only to supplement general purpose grants which are given to the States. These general purpose grants can be used as the States wish. In the whole question of road funding this point is too often conveniently ignored by the States. I suggest to the Federal Government that it seriously consider the option of including road grants in general purpose grants, taking into account the mileage of roads in particular States, the area of the State, the population, et cetera, and abolishing the special purpose grants so that the States can spend money as they wish. It is time to consider this option. I believe it should be considered before the Budget is brought down this coming August. </PARA>

Yet, as the Minister knows, the circumstances make it necessary for us to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Back in those halcyon days of the Labor Government, the Hayden Budget of 1975- 76 allocated 30 per cent of all road funds while the States and local government allocated 31 per cent and 28.9 per cent respectively. The situation now is that these percentages have changed and have changed dramatically. The Federal Government's allocation in 1980-81 was only 22.2 per cent. It appears then that it is the deliberate policy of the Fraser Government to reduce its responsibility for the nation's roads. The devolution of responsibility to the States and to local government is exceedingly reprehensible when we consider the implications. For instance, when roads continue to deteriorate someone has to pick up the tab. We know who that is. In all cases this must result in increased taxes and rate charges or a reduction in other services. </PARA>
<PARA> What is more reprehensible is the fact that, as the Commonwealth has reduced its commitment to roads as a significant priority, it has gained enormous revenue from its fuel pricing policies. I am sure that has been detailed elsewhere in this debate. In the same time the Federal road grants to the States , as a proportion of Commonwealth revenue from fuel taxes, has fallen from 53.9 per cent to an estimated 16.1 per cent in 1981-82. Since road construction costs have continued to rise at a rate far in excess of these reimbursement increases, the inevitable result is a rapidly accumulating backlog of essential road works due to a lack of sufficient funds. It is not generally realised that the gradual deterioration of Australian roads is reaching that stage where it will take gargantuan steps to arrest the decline and a mammoth program to improve them. </PARA>
<PARA> Owing to the neglect by the Federal Government and unfortunately that senile and incompetent state of the late unlamented Liberal Government in Victoria, the funds allocated to the Country Roads Board in the State have dropped by 22 per cent in real terms over the past decade. It is no wonder that the Victorian people decided to throw out the Thompson Government and replace it with a Labor government. There appears to be no co-ordinated plan but a sad history of ad hoc decision-making in response to the pressures of external interest groups. What resulted was a great deal of confusion and illfitting policies. The deregulation of the road transport industry by the Thompson Government has caused an enormous increase in heavy road transport in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The shire engineer in my electorate of Ballarat pointed out the problems encountered at the work face that are just not fully understood adequately in Canberra. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The maintenance of the exisiting road network asset is falling further behind due to decreasing funds in real terms being made available to Council. Inevitably, the road surfaces will become irreparable, and the costs of total reconstruction will be unable to be funded by Council or the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again the unco-ordinated policies of the previous Victorian Government are evident. We have been required to cut down on the amount of time we have for our speeches in this debate, so I will limit what I have to say about that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is certainly a matter of great relief to all Victorians to have a different kind of government and one which will initiate plans to upgrade VicRail. This will help by taking some of the burden off the State's deteriorating road system. It seems almost incomprehensible that a government that had been receiving less and less funding from the Federal Government should have encouraged the growth of heavy transport traffic on Victorian roads. The axle loading of those vehicles is up to over 2,000 times that of a family car. It has been shown by tests undertaken in the United States of America that the effect of increased truck traffic can be catastrophic on roads that were never intended for that purpose. The tests showed that the effect-that is the damage- imposed by heavy loads on the loaded wheel is generally proportional to the fourth power of the load. The import of this fact is simple and dramatic. It really means that there is a much heavier burden placed upon the roads by laden trucks than by the family car. Obviously the Federal Government has failed to give the maintenance of an adequate road system a sufficiently high priority in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the current Minister for Transport a particularly pleasant and congenial man but I believe he has to make far more determined efforts to get the required funding. In fact it was stated, I think by the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Connolly), that it was not true that the States were receiving less money for road grants. That is just not so. If he were to refer to page 214 instead of 209 of Budget Paper No. 1 he would realise that the allocation to the States and local government in tied and untied grants was only 8.2 per cent more than last year. This is far less than the rate of inflation. As I indicated, heavy transport places a particularly heavy burden upon the roads. As I have said, I find the current Minister a particularly pleasant person but he must work much harder to ensure that the Government takes him seriously. The demands that have been placed upon our roads have outstripped the capacity of many of the States and local governments to be able to improve the standards, so they have declined . </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in the work load on roads has taken place without substantive recognition by the Federal Government in the form of increased funding. The increase in funding necessary for the maintenance and construction of roads, to keep pace with the increased wear and tear expected to be caused by heavier traffic usage, is far in excess of that which has been allocated. Without looking at the increase in the cost of maintenance et cetera as a result of escalating prices, we can easily see that road maintenance costs are now quite prohibitive for State and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria we are concerned that in 1980-81 the total revenue of the Country Roads Board increased by approximately 8 per cent over the preceding year while the Board's direct works and salary prices index rose by approximately 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past decade the cost of road construction has increased by about 15 per cent per annum. This means that there is a doubling of road construction costs every year, yet the CRB revenue is expected to increase this year by only 6 per cent. How on earth can we expect to meet the need when there could be at least a 15 per cent increase in maintenance costs and road construction costs? In my electorate of Ballarat there has been a reduction in the number of outdoor staff which has been added to the already higher than average rate of unemployment in the area. The decrease in real terms in the allocation for road funding has another very serious effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Federal Government and the previous Liberal Government in Victoria must shoulder a fair proportion of the onerous responsibility of endangering Victorian lives because of the deteriorating state of roads in that State. That this will be so is made quite clear in dramatic terms when it is considered that the funds allocated to the CRB have dropped 22 per cent in real terms in the past decade while there has been an increase of 66 per cent in road traffic in that time. It is an appalling state of affairs. It will be obvious that many of the roads are aging. Without adequate attention the deterioration must actually make them potentially unsafe instruments for people to drive on. I have indicated that I believe the Federal Government and the former State Government must share the blame. I quote from a letter from Mr Robin Nuttall, the city engineer for the city of Ballarat. He says, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there were many ways of presenting statistical comparisons of Federal, State and local government spending on roads . . . </PARA>
<PARA> But the over-riding fact remained that real expenditure on roads was consistently diminishing. </PARA>
<PARA> Road pavements would be rebuilt once in 50 to 100 years when the design life was about 20 years and the real life could be as low as 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA>A point Mr Nuttall made demonstrates how farcical is the Federal Government's concern for matters such as road safety. His point supports my earlier contention. He points out that while finance has been reduced in real terms the ousted Victorian Government lifted the restrictions on road freight, lifted the upper limits of axle loads and reduced rail services. I must make a couple of comments in relation to the remarks of an earlier speaker. A few months ago I had the pleasure of paying a short visit to Townsville which is situated in the federal electorate of Herbert. I experienced at first hand the appalling state of the road system leading to and from that beautiful city. It is nothing short of a national scandal that a city such as Townsville which is working with great diligence to increase its industries, including the tourist industry, is treated so shabbily by the Federal Government. The people of the area are as one in condemning the Federal Government for its lack of apparent interest in the problem of inadequate roads in north Queensland. Given that the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) has recently evinced some interest in the problem, I hope that he will demonstrate his concern by voting for this amendment. In what was possibly an exercise in amateur theatrics, he recently appeared in an act with the Minister for Transport, a notorious member of the Queensland Parliament, Mr Hinze, and a number of other folk. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Herbert has indicated his concern even more recently. He is on record in the Townsville Daily Bulletin of 3 April as having said that this legislation will do no more than allow for the provision of moneys already committed by the Commonwealth Government. His performance tonight will be watched very carefully by the people of his electorate. Knowing how the concern for improved roads transcends party divisions and divisions among all sections of the community there, I am sure that the people of Townsville and the surrounding districts will be expecting a sign of genuine interest in their welfare from their local member. Amateur theatrics will not suffice. As I said before, I therefore invite him to vote for the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> The increased allocation of funds to meet the needs of the nation's roads is a matter of real urgency. The funds allocated in this Bill are obviously inadequate. I urge all honourable members, especially those in rural and provincial areas, to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) and to demonstrate that this great national asset should receive the attention it deserves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Roads Grants Amendment Bill I recognise that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were responsible for roads throughout Australia in your term as Minister for Transport. I understand that in that time national roads were declared a Commonwealth responsibility following lead-up work by previous parliaments. This responsibility has continued. In that way the Commonwealth had to accept national highways in the state in which they were in 1974. I think it must be recognised that some of the highways throughout the nation then were in fairly good condition. In other States priorities had been given to services other than highway construction. In those instances, the highways were not so great. Mr Deputy Speaker, I make the point that it was in your term of office that Commonwealth responsibility for the national highway system came into being. That was the state of the national highways at that time .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have spoken of the road situation in Queensland many times in this House in past years. Today I have a further opportunity to press the real needs of my State in that regard. The Bill before us allocates funds for roads throughout Australia in the four years from 1981-82 to 1984-85 with a total indexed amount for the first year at 7 per cent and for the following two years at 6 per cent, amounting to $3,022m. The funds allocated for national highways for those four years amount to $1,336m. The Commonwealth is totally responsible for that category of roads. The balance of the funds to aid the States is for State and local government roads. I believe that the method of allocation is too indefinite. While the Commonwealth allocates funds to assist in the building and maintenance of State and local roads it must then bear the burden of the criticism which follows from all State and local parties that the blame for the deficiency in road building and maintenance in these other categories can be laid at the door of the Commonwealth. While the Commonwealth's percentage of road funding continues to diminish this criticism will appear to gain additional validity. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the Commonwealth has to bear responsibility for national highways. I have never avoided this responsibility as a member of parliament. Constituents must realise that the States and local government are also responsible for their roads. For this purpose, they have taxing and rating arrangements in addition to grants and tax-sharing arrangements which allow additional funds from the Commonwealth to be used according to the priorities of those involved at those levels of State and local government. The Bill should help in this understanding by making State road funds subject to the same block grant as applies to health and local government grants. Local government bodies should have their allocations washed through the purer waters of the State grants commissions and not through the sullied waters of the State Treasuries. I believe that if we were able to allocate road funds to local councils in the same way as we allocate the 2 per cent share of funds for local government that would be a better way to get money from the Commonwealth to local government. </PARA>
<PARA> I firmly believe that before this occurs a formula for distribution of funds to States, including funds for national highways, should be established which takes into account all relevant road construction needs in addition to population. Such a formula should include lengths, developments, industries, weather, costs in the country-all the matters that such a formula should take into account. I take this matter a little further and draw honourable members' attention to the 1979 assessment made by the Bureau of Transport Economics. In particular, I refer to table 6.19 at page 153 of part 1 of that assessment. It does not argue for grants in excess of those given between 1974-75 and 1978-79. It merely shows the distribution among the States of funds available.</PARA>
<PARA> It shows that funds available at 1971-72 prices, if appropriated on an economically efficient road expenditure basis, would have given Queensland $213m more of the $2,125m available from 1974-75 to 1978-79. The actual funds given to Queensland were $410 instead of the $623m arrived at in the assessment. All other States benefitted at Queensland's loss. This is evidenced in this table. Many qualifications to the figures shown in this table discount to some extent the recommendations or the findings that were made. But it is important that that assessment places emphasis on needs more than on population. It does not argue for more expenditure; it purely assesses the funds made available and compares how they should have been distributed with how they were distributed- basically, on a per capita basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the formula, whilst it has been brought forward from the 1974 type of formula, has to be looked at, but I do not think we can argue in the course of this debate for taking money from one State and giving it to the other. What we have to argue for and have faith in is the indication of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) that he is prepared to look at further funding in the context of the Budget so that if extra funds are available they can be used. In regard to this, the previous speaker for the Opposition mentioned what the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) said about the State of the roads in the electorate of Herbert. Queensland country members have been pressing for additional funds. They have been representing their electorates. The visit through the area was the result of an invitation issued to both Federal and State Ministers so that they could see for themselves the condition of the roads . Members of a committee chaired by the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) also went through the area. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of these representations at last we have had an indication that both Ministers are prepared to look at a report which will be presented to both governments suggesting that additional funding for the national highway might be borne on a dollar for dollar basis. I think this is a breakthrough for the State . It is prepared to pick up its responsibilities for a highway not in the same condition as that of the highways in the rest of the nation. The Commonwealth also has good intentions. If funds are available they will be allocated. That is why the amendment that has been moved by the Oppostion cannot be supported by me . Basically the Opposition is trying to pre-empt what might be in the Budget. I think it is just political grandstanding for honourable members on that side of the House to suggest that what they have indicated will be the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now and again a case is brought to the attention of members which they feel they should mention in this Parliament because it affects people with a medical complaint who are not fully covered, apparently, by our present medical arrangements. I intended to alert the Minister for Health that I would be raising a matter tonight, but of course the Minister for Health is now in another place. A woman wrote to every member of parliament in South Australia and drew attention to her problem. To explain her complaint I shall quote from her letter. She stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I write to seek your help in a problem affecting many thousands of people. As it is my intention to send this letter to all Federal and State Members of Parliament, please excuse this somewhat impersonal presentation. </PARA>
<PARA> Although my plea is for diabetics generally, it is more specifically for the sufferers of 'childhood onset diabetes'. These people can be treated only with daily (sometimes multiple) injections of insulin all their lives. The long-term complication of this type of diabetes is vascular disease affecting the eyes, kidneys, heart, limbs and circulation, and inevitably causing neurological disorders. Each condition is sufficiently distressing in itself, but when grouped together, the resultant distress is enormous. Technology has advanced a great deal to help the diabetic cope with these problems, with home monitoring of blood glucose, blood pressure and possibly renal dialysis. </PARA>
<PARA> But technology has a price. I will cite my own case as an example of the expenses in which this type of diabetic can become involved. I recently purchased (on my doctor's advice) a blood glucose home-monitoring machine at a cost of $230. The strips needed to work the machine are $3.20 per prescription of 25. I must use the machine four times daily to get the most benefit from it and this means a prescription every 6-7 days, at a total cost of $16 per month. </PARA>
<PARA> The needles needed to obtain the blood become blunt very quickly with this continuous use and have to be purchased every couple of weeks at $3.20 for 10. So, the purchase and maintenance of this one item is excessively expensive. Combined with the costs of five prescribed drugs ($3.20 each), insulin (two types-$3.20 each), swabs and syringes (injections 2-3 times daily), urine testing strips (2 types-$3.20 each) regular medical, podiatry and laser ophthalmology treatment, plus contributions to a health fund ($8.50 per week), the outlay gets almost prohibitive. To try and save some money for the future is also very difficult, as life assurance policies are not available to diabetics. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore make this appeal for financial assistance on behalf of myself and fellow sufferers in the sincere hope that something can be done to ease the situation and would be deeply appreciative if you would be good enough to give the matter your serious consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>I feel that that case needs attention by the Government. I hope the Minister for Health, whoever he is, will look at the costs that these people have to bear and see whether the Government can do something to alleviate their problems. It is obvious when one works out the costs that they are terribly expensive. To suffer from the affliction of diabetes is bad enough. Some greater assistance should be made available by the Government to these unfortunate people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the great challenges facing the Australian nation today is coping with the impact of advanced technology. It is a fact that prior to modern technology and communications many of the finer things in life- art, matters of intellect, education, et cetera, were limited to a privileged few. Advances in the print media have allowed books to be scattered more widely, and made literacy practicable. Movies, the record player, radio, television and recently the video have enabled many of the world's marvels to be available and even to be understood by even the poorest and disadvantaged in our world community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the introduction of technology, whilst bringing benefits, often has an unfortunate impact on our communities as well. This can be seen in plans by Telecom Australia to close many of our manual assistance centres throughout Australia and to computerise the services that are presently provided by hundreds of telephonists. In my electorate two such centres at Horsham and Swan Hill are scheduled to close in 1983. If this occurs some 14 women will lose their jobs and communities will lose that personal service for directory assistance, emergency calls and manual bookings that we have received so well and for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, Telecom is an efficient organisation. It is doing its best to offer alternative employment, generous redundancy payments, superannuation and, in many cases, income maintenance payments to these people. Computerisation of such services may also be efficient and effective-I do not know. I do know that in some cases where rationalisation of manual assistance centres has already taken place this has not always proved to be the case. I also know that many job opportunities will be lost in our rural centres and that many of these people will not be able to accept alternative work in Melbourne, simply because they are married and do not wish to leave their home environment. Therefore, I am at this time opposing this decision. I have asked for a thorough review of Telecom' s plans and details of the justification for the introduction of this sophisticated technology. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue, however, raises very important questions. Are we facing up to the dynamic changes occuring in our society? Are we preparing ourselves for them and obtaining the skills necessary for employment in a modern world? Society has always been confronted in its development by the two-edged sword of good and evil. New advances in technology have provided mankind with enormous benefits, but not without serious side effects sometimes. Medical advances, vaccines, antibiotics, et cetera, have improved our life expectancy and rid the world of many diseases. But the side effects of last century's discoveries in the medical field have seen an accompanying drop in the death rate, which is placing enormous pressure on earth's resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Agriculture in 1800 had to feed 900 million people; today less land has to produce food and fibre for 4,000 million. Fertilisers, insecticides and high energy using chemicals have to be used to boost productivity. The food for survival comes from the farm but at a high cost in energy and machinery to plough, seed, weed and reap. Nuclear energy offers a cheap solution to the world 's energy problems yet it places the earth under threat of destruction. Science has provided enormous benefits but created some serious problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There are pressures within our community to return to a simpler, less industrialised, way of life. These thoughts are attractive but of course impossible. We have to move forward with the new advances in technology. We must challenge them, we must conserve our resources and we must find a balance between the good and bad aspects. We are also offered a greater knowledge, greater skills and the opportunity to improve the well-being of the world's people by advanced technology. The important factor is that we equip ourselves well to cope with these changes and use them for progress in our standard of life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several weeks ago I advised my electorate, through the local newspapers, that petitions were available at my office for those who had a concern for the harp seals in Canada. I was not surprised by the response. Numbers of people came to the office and took multiple copies of the petition to collect signatures from their friends, neighbours and work mates. I had a call from a teacher at Monash High School to let me know that the students there had also been busy on the same project. I went out to visit the school and found that five 13-year old boys-Gerard Jacobs, Brenton Carey, Paul Merchette, Maurice Madeste and Stephen Walmsley-had indeed been busy. On their own initiative they had collected 1,068 signatures protesting against the way in which the seal cubs were clubbed to death. The boys have demonstrated that social awareness and concern are alive and flourishing among today's youth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition to canvassing their school friends, the five conducted a doorknock of the local area, arranged to have petition forms left in various local shops and even went to the city to collect signatures in the streets. Their concern for the way in which the seal pups are brutally massacred was real and they intended to do all in their power to have it stopped. They presented me with the result of their mammoth task to bring to this Parliament. As honourable members can see, it is quite a number of pages. Difficult though it was, I had to point out to them that the wording they had used on their petition was in a form not acceptable to this Parliament. They were deeply disappointed because they had put a lot of time and energy into their work. However, undaunted by this bureaucratic obstacle, the five boys have taken copies of my petition forms and have started all over again. It is all too seldom that people in our community are prepared to stand up for and work for what they believe in and actually do something about it. Their starting again is proof of their sincerity. They have gone to a tremendous amount of trouble to put their point of view across and they can be proud of themselves. Their teachers, their school and their parents can also take pride in their achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the first petition I have received with incorrect wording. I suggest to the House that perhaps it is time we relaxed the requirement for the rather outdated wording that is necessary at the moment. It would give those people in the community easier access to the House. It is all very well for those of us who are involved in Parliament to know that we have to have each page correctly worded, but the kids do not know, and many people outside do not know and I think it is heartbreaking to have to reject petitions over which people have taken so much time and trouble. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Since this Parliament last sat in late March a scurrilous attack has been made on the police force under parliamentary privilege in the State House in Queensland. The honourable member for Archerfield, Mr Hooper, made an attack on what one might class as a public servant, the Commissioner of Police, and also the Assistant Commissioner. The attack carried no foundation as far as an argument was concerned. What was said on the floor of the House did not substantiate anything said outside by the honourable member. I understand that the attack that was made at that time was not condoned by members of his party within that State House, one of whom publicly disassociated himself from it.</PARA></TALK.START>

I just want to draw attention to the fact that this is one occasion when the attack was made under circumstances that could not be substantiated. In the meantime the matter was given a tremendous amount of publicity through the Press in that State. The Commissioner of Police, Terry Lewis, has to bear the odium of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what I would like to know. What are the charges? There were none that could be substantiated. This is a very difficult thing. If one member of his Party was prepared publicly to disagree with him perhaps the statement should have been withdrawn. However, a tribunal has now been set up and that allows this member who, under parliamentary privilege made this attack, to bring forward his charges to the tribunal. He has indicated that he is not prepared to do that. In other words he is not prepared to back up what he says inside the Parliament with statements outside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come to the defence of this police commissioner. Terry Lewis is a fine policeman and a very fine commissioner. He is a prominent citizen of Brisbane. He is a great family man, a church man and this is the person who is attacked under parliamentary privilege. I would go so far as to say that although police commissioners and assistants are being challenged in the courts in other States, the whole affair regarding the police is one that is not on a high plane. Other people and other parliamentarians such as a senator from the other place, carried this attack further by making a charge, without any foundation at all, that the police force in Queensland was corrupt. What I would like to say to all parliamentarians is that if they feel they are without sin that they are not in some way tainted with some wrongdoing, then perhaps they have the right to make a charge. But in this case a person who cannot substantiate a charge proves himself to be in that category. What concerns me is that these very blanket charges, made in the Queensland Parliament and by an honourable senator, are made against what I believe is the only thing that can make a democracy work and tick, and that is the police force of any State. If we want a breakdown in the law of this nation all we have to do is do what that State member and the honourable senator did and that is break down the pride that we might have in the police and the police forces throughout Australia. On Sunday I was at an event which probably illustrates this point. During a brawl a policeman intervened to separate two men, and in front of a great crowd of people the two men turned on the policeman. I understand it was a long time before that policeman was rendered any assistance by a member of the public. I congratulate the person who went to the assistance of that policeman, but it proves the point that today there is not sufficient pride and understanding of the role of the police force which is just upholding the rule of law; laws that are made in places such as this Parliament. If we are going to talk about the bad implementation or the bad handling of the law, maybe we should start in legislatures such as this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to draw the attention of the House to the consequences of the proposed closure of some 16 local telephone exchanges in country centres in New South Wales. This matter was referred to briefly by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher) earlier this evening and I would like to support him in what he said about the loss of local jobs. There is no doubt that jobs will go. Some 250 will go in New South Wales. There is no doubt that the effect of this will be devastating for the families concerned. More important is the effect of these closures on the standard of local emergency services. Under the present system a 000 emergency call goes to the local exchange. This local exchange is manned by local people; people who are aware of the location and capacity of local emergency services and who have a good knowledge of local geography.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the new system emergency calls will be switched by computer to wherever spare capacity might exist in the network. A call for help in, say, Lithgow, which is one of the 16 centres facing closure, might be answered in Sydney, Newcastle, Canberra or pretty well anywhere. I am particularly concerned about Lithgow. Although it is not within my electorate it is a city close by to which many of my constituents go to work. They often work in industries that have a high risk of accidents, industries like the local power generation industry, the small arms factory or the many coal mines in the Lithgow district. </PARA>
<PARA> I want honourable members to picture the problems that could arise in the case of an accident at any one of these places. A person at the scene of an accident, excited and emotional, simply rings up the local exchange and reports that an accident has happened at, say, Wang, Newcom, Tunnel Hill or the SAF and hangs up . The local operators would know that Wang is a local contraction for Wallerawang. They would know that Newcom is the name of a local colliery. They would know that Tunnel Hill is a well known dangerous site for motor accidents. They would know that SAF is the local contraction for the small arms factory. The local operators know these things. They would be able to follow up any report and get assistance from local emergency services quickly. But an operator in Sydney, Newcastle or somewhere else in the State simply would not know. What is more, that operator would have no way of finding out this information because the local names do not appear in any index. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that the union affected, the Australian Telephone and Phonogram Officers Association, has mounted a very vigorous campaign on this safety issue. I commend this union for putting in $25,000 of its member's funds to promote publicly what is essentially an issue of public safety. I would also like to place on record the excellent work that has been done on this issue by my friend Mr Mick Clough, the State member for Bathurst, who represents Lithgow in the New South Wales Parliament. Mick has taken hold of this issue and followed it up with his customary enthusiasm and tenacity. I commend him for that. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I would like to urge Telecom and the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) to re-think these closures; to consult with the union, to consult with the many country people who are upset about these closures and concerned about the risk to public safety. After all, this is quite a simple issue. The closure of these exchanges will mean the loss of vital local knowledge and the loss of this local knowledge could mean loss of lives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From time to time I receive a copy of the Australian Consulting Engineer, a journal that is published by the Association of Consulting Engineers, Australia. I assume that other honourable members also receive this publication. I was very interested in a couple of items which appeared in the February edition of this publication. One item refers to a matter which I addressed this House about some years ago, namely the potential for Australian engineering design in the resources development projects taking place or to take place in the near future in Australia. The February edition of the Australian Consulting Engineer makes the point that in a number of recent representations made to the Foreign Investment Review Board concern has been expressed at the continuing trend of allowing foreign engineering firms a virtual monopoly in the resources field. The publication went on to make the claim that at least 70 per cent of every project consists of various elements which fall within the demonstrated capacity of many Australian consulting engineering firms. Examples of these are roads, townships, power stations, railways and water supply projects. In some cases the complete project could be executed entirely with Australian resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that we have to take adequate steps to ensure that companies that are developing major resources projects look for engineering design expertise within Australia. In many cases it may be easier for them to bring in a large engineering consulting firm from overseas because with one transaction they can ensure that that firm can provide them with all the design capability they need for a project. It may be that in the Australian environment they have to work a little harder to put together the appropriate range of skills needed for a particular project. I am aware that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, in examining applications from companies to bring in skilled personnel, examines the availability of appropriate people already in the Australian work force. Similarly, the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, where it engages in training programs in co-operation with State governments and companies, seeks to maximise the potential of the local work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to take up the suggestion by the Association of Consulting Engineers of Australia that, within the foreign affairs guidelines, we ought to pay greater attention to the need to ensure that Australian design engineering expertise is used in these projects for which approval is given for overseas capital participation. I do not think it is sufficient just to look at the participation by overseas capital to see whether that is in the interests of the Australian economy. I think we should also look at the skilled manpower implications of such participation and ensure that appropriate guidelines are observed when we give approval for participation by major overseas companies. I am fully in favour of participation by major overseas companies but I think we ought to look a little more closely at the training and manpower implications of some of that participation. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw an analogy with the standard provision that we have with respect to defence procurement. We have the Australian industry participation program whereby, if we are purchasing defence equipment from overseas, we require that the companies tendering for that business put forward proposals for Australian industry participation. The bench mark we give is that they involve Australian industry to at least 30 per cent of the value of the particular contract in question. I suggest that if some guideline of that nature regarding Australian manpower participation, or whatever one may call it, were imposed as a condition of the involvement of overseas companies in major resources projects, that would be of advantage to Australia. Indeed, it would be of advantage to the companies participating in this way because they would ensure that their investment was backed up by the best possible involvement of highly trained Australian manpower . I commend this sort of examination to the Treasurer (Mr Howard), the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) and to other Ministers who may be involved to ensure that maximum use is made by Australians of projects which have the potential for involvement by Australian skilled engineering personnel. </PARA>

<PARA> Australia, France and the United Kingdom: The same as for the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, 1951.</PARA>

<PARA> (iii) The Australian Shipping Commission's Annual Reports for each of the years to 30 June 1980 have been tabled in the Parliament. Information sought except the isolation and breakdown of labour operating costs is contained in those reports. For commercially competitive reasons ANL does not wish to provide a further breakdown of its labour operating costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (i) Qantas has not had a requirement to date to maintain analysis of this kind and bearing in mind that expenditure is incurred in so many countries worldwide, analysis of an ex post facto basis would be an enormous task. This information is not available from the accounting system.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) TAA has estimated that the percentage paid to the private sector is:</PARA>
<PARA>per cent</PARA>
<PARA>1972-73  88.0</PARA>
<PARA>1973-74  85.3</PARA>

<PARA>1978-79  82.0</PARA>
<PARA>1979-80  80.1</PARA>
<PARA>1980-81  78.6</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The major proportion of ANL's operating costs, excluding capital servicing costs, are paid to the private sector. Other operating costs not paid to the private sector include port costs, some repairs and statutory charges.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (i) Qantas has no analysis maintained in their accounting system but Qantas Management has no recollection of any capital expenditure, either in Australia or overseas, paid to the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) All significant capital expenditure purchases by the Australian National Airlines Commission were from the private sector, either Australian or offshore.</PARA>
<PARA> The only significant capital expenditure paid to the public sector would be in categories such as sales tax and customs duty. An example would be import duty on aircraft purchases.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Most ANL capital expenditure is made to the private sector for the purchase of ships, containers, cargo handling and terminal equipment, and buildings. Five ships have been built at the New South Wales Government State Dockyard during the period. They represent 12 per cent of the capital expenditure during the period.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) (i) (a) and (b) Qantas maintains no such analysis and analysis on an ex post facto basis would be a formidable task.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) (a) TAA is of the opinion that the time required to determine the requested value would be prohibitive, and in respect of many items its records would not indicate whether the ultimate source was local or offshore. A major import derived component would be depreciation on aircraft. Fuel is presently running at about 15 per cent imported and 85 per cent local. Aircraft maintenance and overhaul costs might include imported materials and spare parts to about 35 per cent of the total.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Again TAA feels that the time that would be required precludes an exhaustive analysis, and in many cases records would not indicate the ultimate source.</PARA>
<PARA> In general though, TAA would be heavily reliant on imports for capital items. To a large extent aircraft and the supporting maintenance tools, test equipment, spare parts, specialised tarmac equipment and flight training simulators are not available locally. Also, computers and related equipment are predominantly imported.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, buildings and the construction thereof would represent an area of capital expenditure with a high local content.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) (a) A proportion of ANL's expenses for bunkers, insurance and repairs are payable overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Most of the ships built or purchased by ANL during the period in question were constructed overseas. The five built in Australia would have had a proportion of imported components. Some ANL containers for international trades have been purchased overseas. Other capital expenditure by ANL has been primarily 'domestic'.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Question 2, 3 and 4, a more accurate assessment of the information contained in the above answers would impose a time consuming task which ANL does not have the resources to undertake without detriment to its commercial accounting requirements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Youth employment subsidies under the Special Youth Employment Training Program (SYETP) are paid to employers participating in the program-not to the young people being trained. Two levels of subsidy are available, depending on the period of unemployment. The latest available data for Standard SYETP covers the period 30 November 1980 to 31 October 1981. In the case of Extended SYETP which commenced on 1 February 1981 the data relates to the February 1981 commencements only. These figures show that for Standard SYETP (17 weeks of training) 56.2 per cent complete the full period of training. With Extended SYETP (34 weeks of training) 55.15 per cent of trainees have completed the full period of training.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The following tables indicate the percentage frequency and percentage cumulative frequency of trainees discontinuing training for each week of subsidised training. Table 1 relates to Standard SYETP and Table 2 to Extended SYETP.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Statistics on the retention of former SYETP trainees by the training employers are not kept. However, late in 1979 my Department undertook a survey of a sample of employers and young people involved in private sector SYETP placements in April 1979. The results of this survey indicated that 50.7 per cent of trainees were still employed with their SYETP employer some four to five months after the completion of the subsidy period and a further 17.8 per cent were in full-time employment elsewhere.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ML7">Mr McVeigh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. I am aware of this Conference organised by the Women's Electoral Lobby in Melbourne last November.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Over the five years to June 1981 rents in Melbourne as measured by the private rent component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 36 per cent, compared with an increase of 61 per cent in the CPI.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is very limited information available on the extent of homelessness in the community. A number of studies has attempted to estimate numbers of homeless youth. A study in Melbourne in 1978 by the Victorian Consultative Committee for Social Development estimated there were 15,000 homeless youth per year in Melbourne and studies in South Australia in 1979 and 1980 indicated that there may be between 6,000 and 9,000 young people each year experiencing severe housing problems in South Australia. However these estimates are based on contacts by young people with welfare agencies and have a number of limitations.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. I am advised that this claim was made by Ms Farrar, Co-ordinator of Shelter Victoria, in a paper presented to the Conference.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Commonwealth assistance for emergency accommodation is provided under a range of programs. These include the Youth Services Scheme, Homeless Persons Assistance Act, and the Family Support Services Scheme which are administered by the Department of Social Security and assistance for women's refuges which was administered by the Department of Health until 1980-81. In addition, some of the accommodation provided under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement is allocated by the States on a priority needs basis.</PARA>
<PARA> The following information on expenditure on each program has been provided to me by the Minister for Social Security and the Acting Minister for Health:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Youth Services Scheme: This is a three year pilot scheme designed to provide emergency accommodation and support services for young people up to 18 years. The scheme commenced in 1979-80 and is cost shared on a dollar for dollar basis by the Commonwealth and State Governments. Expenditure is estimated at $1. 15m for 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Homeless Persons Assistance Program: Under this program, which commenced in December 1974, the Commonwealth makes grants towards the capital and operating costs of voluntary organisations and local governing bodies which provide accommodation, meals and a welfare service to homeless people. Expenditure under the program to 30 June 1981 was $21.79m, rising from $0.34m in 1974-75 to $7.67m in 1980-81. (This includes additional capital grants totalling $1.9m made in June 1981 and not originally budgeted for). Estimated expenditure in 1981-82 is $6.3m. A $10m three year capital program for homeless persons (with special provisions for homeless young people) commenced on 1 July 1981. Recurrent subsidies which will be generated by this capital investment will be considered in the context of the annual budgetary process.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Family Support Services Scheme: Under this program, introduced on a three year pilot basis in 1978, the Commonwealth funds some voluntary agencies to provide emergency accommodation and support services to families at risk. The Government has provided for an extension of the scheme for a three year period from 1 January 1982 to 31 December 1984. Total allocation to emergency accommodation services for the period is not yet finalised but for 1981-82 it is estimated that approximately $0.4m may be expended on these services.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Women's Refuges: The Commonwealth funding for women's refuges is now included in General Revenue Payments to the States. Up to 30 June 1981, funds for this purpose were provided in the form of specific-purpose grants to the States under the Community Health Program. The General Revenue Payment to each State for 1981-82 includes a component equal to the Commonwealth specific purpose grant to that State for women's refuges in 1980-81 plus 10 per cent. Funding in 1980-81 was $3,789,315 compared with $49,489 in 1974-75.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also funds child care workers in women's refuges, through the Children's Services Program. The cost this financial year is expected to amount to almost $1m.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the above programs funds are provided to the States and the Northern Territory under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. Under this Agreement, funds are used to provide concessional interest rate loans and grants for home purchase and rental housing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> With these funds and State funds and monies generated from the operation of the programs, States are able to provide housing assistance for those in need. It is a matter for each State to determine eligibility for assistance and the nature of that assistance. While there is no special allocation under the Agreement for emergency accommodation, States provide priority allocation for special cases. They also have provided dwellings to various organisations who in turn provide housing assistance to special groups, i.e., youth, handicapped and women's refuges. Funding under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement in 1974-75 was $ 391.45m. In 1981-82 funding is $262.2m. It should be noted that the proportion of funds provided by way of non-repayable grants rather than loans has increased very substantially from $6.05m in 1974-75 to $116.2m in 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) On the basis of assistance provided under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act and the Youth Services Scheme, and also the allocations of priority ( emergency) assistance in public rental housing, the situation in Victoria appears broadly similar to that in other States.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) As noted in part 5 above the Commonwealth has increased funding for emergency housing under a number of existing programs, for example, the Youth Services Scheme and the Homeless Persons Assistance Program. In addition, the Government has announced the allocation of $2m in the current financial year for the commencement of a new program for crisis accommodation for families in distress. The funds allocated are to be shared by the States and the Northern Territory, and will be used to build up a stock of crisis accommodation for families. This will be done by the construction, purchase or leasing of suitable dwellings. In view of the urgent need of the Aboriginal community for this type of accommodation $100,000 of the money has been allocated to Aboriginal Hostels Ltd.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) From time to time Perth airport experiences rapid changes in weather. This is taken into account in forecasting the need for the nomination of an alternative aerodrome. My Department has no knowledge of any general opinion among senior pilots that it is one of the more difficult airports in Australia to land heavy aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The nearest aerodrome to Perth suitable for Boeing 747 aircraft is Learmonth.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A diversion from Perth to Learmonth of a heavily laden Boeing 747-B would require the consumption of approximately 16,000 kilograms of fuel and take about 90 minutes. There would be no dangerous effect on fuel reserves as international aircraft normally carry sufficient fuel to divert to an alternate aerodrome as well as the normal reserves.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The offer was extended by TAA management so that contributors to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme could, if they desired, become members of the TAA Superannuation Plan which offered a lump sum payment in lieu of the pension plus refund of contributions under the Commonwealth Scheme.</PARA>

'. The minimum retiring age for TAA ground staff contributors to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme is 60 years.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) September 1981, when the Commissioner for Superannuation advised that applications for transfer had been received from employees over the age of 60.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Ground staff affected by this error were verbally contacted within 2 or 3 days and advised of their ineligibility to transfer. Some of these staff were also advised in writing during the next few weeks as a result of representations made by them seeking clarification on the issue.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) No TAA ground staff over 60 years contributed to the AMP Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) A mistake was made in offering the superannuation transfer to staff over 60 years of age when the Superannuation Trust Deed did not permit the transfer from the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme to the TAA Superannuation Plan. TAA management apologised in writing to those who had actually completed transfer applications. Other contributors aged 60 years or more were informed personally.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) What is the current state of negotiations with the New South Wales Government and Sydney inner city councils concerning the construction of a second airport for Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What has been the additional cost resulting from the delay in building a second airport for Sydney since the Major Airport Needs of Sydney study recommendations were first released.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1604" SPEAKER="Hunt The Hon R.J.D." NAMEID="GH4" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr Hunt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The New South Wales Government has not accepted the Prime Minister's invitation to co-operate with the Commonwealth in the development of the close- spaced parallel runway and in determining and securing a contingent site for a future second airport, against the possibility of it being required some time in the next century.</PARA>
<PARA> I could understand the State Government's position if it was the result of a considered decision based on detailed information about all relevant factors. But let us be quite clear about this, the State is refusing even to let that detailed information on some very relevant factors be collected and analysed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth position is clear. A second jet airport must be seen as a long term option only. It could not be counted on to provide any relief until the mid -1990's. An increase in runway capacity at Sydney Airport is essential if ready air access to Sydney is to be maintained in the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA> I can only hope that commonsense will prevail and that a co-operative solution will be found which is in the interests of the State, the travelling public and the domestic economy.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The cost estimates adopted in the MANS Study were expressed in constant 1977 prices. A very broad approximation of these cost estimates at current prices can be obtained by increasing those in the MANS Study documents by 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important not to underestimate the enormous costs associated with strategies bringing a new international airport into operation. The new airport involves the following estimated capital expenditure by governments-$655m for a single runway plus necessary airport infrastructure, $45m for access roads, $85m for a railway link-a total of some $785m at current prices. Additionally, there is further estimated expenditure of another $370m-$325m on airport infrastructure, $45m on access roads-required to enable Sydney Airport to handle demand growth until the new airport could become operational in the mid-1990's. Total estimated expenditure would amount to $1155m at current prices over next 15 years or so.</PARA>
<PARA> It is important also to recognise that the community is already paying dearly for the runway congestion at Sydney Airport. The present cost to the airlines was recently estimated at $10-12m a year and if the time lost by air travellers is included the economic cost to the community could be of the order of $30m a year.</PARA>
<PARA> These costs can be expected to increase fairly rapidly in the years ahead. Indeed, the failure of the State Government to co-operate in this matter leaves the community facing the prospect of air services which progressively cost more, are less convenient and less reliable in terms of adhering to schedules.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) In August 1980 the Government announced a new seven year program of assistance for the Textile Clothing and Footwear Industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Bureau of Customs Notices 80/167 to 80/176 and 80/205 outline in some detail the new arrangements for and changes in quota allocation.</PARA>
<PARA> From 1 January 1982 and for each of the next seven years quota will be allocated to importers on the basis of previous import performance and through a tender system.</PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of quota allocated to importers, on the basis of their previous import performance, is approximately 85 per cent of the import ceiling established for each of the textile, clothing and footwear categories; the ceiling being the quantity of goods imported during the 12 month period ended 30 June 1980.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Home Consumption Price of wheat for human consumption (HCP) was not increased to $187.20 per tonne for the year commencing 1 December 1981 to take account directly of the factors identified in the question, except in respect of shipping costs to Tasmania. Under the provisions of the Wheat Marketing Act 1979 and the schedule to that Act the HCP is fixed annually in accordance with a formula negotiated with the industry and the States when the current marketing arrangements were decided. This formula takes into account the estimated export price during the season, the previous season's HCP, the relationship between movements in export prices and HCPs over the previous eight seasons and past changes in the Index of Prices Paid by Farmers. The HCP also makes provision for the cost of shipping wheat to Tasmania and this has been set at $3.19 per tonne for 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the legislation there is a 20 per cent limitation on the annual movement in the HCP and this limitation has applied for each of the 1980-81 and 1981-82 seasons.</PARA>
<PARA> (2)-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The interest rate paid by the Australian Wheat Board on its borrowings does not have a direct effect on the price of bread. It is not included in the formula which is used to calculate the home consumption price of wheat (see answer to question (1)).</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The interest rates on particular parcels of bills/notes utilised by the Board to borrow commercially vary over time depending on the timing of drawdowns and maturity of borrowings.

Defence contracts for the supply of stores/equipment normally place the onus for insurance and damage responsibility on the contractor until such time as the equipment passes into effective Commonwealth control. For major equipment being constructed to a specific Defence design, the Commonwealth to the greatest extent possible accepts the insurance risks from the time the initial payment is made against the contract. The principal reason for the Commonwealth carrying its own risk is that the cost of premiums which would otherwise be payable out of Commonwealth funds are avoided. However, the extent to which the Commonwealth actually bears the costs of loss or damage is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the concept of equal employment opportunity (EEO) in the Australian Public Service gained momentum in 1977 following the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. In line with Government policy, the Public Service Board has, over recent years, introduced a number of initiatives designed to achieve equal employment opportunities for women and members of minority groups. My Department has progressively implemented and maintained these initiatives, which have concentrated on people in the following categories:</PARA>
<PARA> Women</PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginals</PARA>
<PARA> Ethnic groups and</PARA>
<PARA> the Disabled,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) broadly speaking the aims of our over-all program follow Government policy, which states that there is to be no discrimination in employment on the grounds of:</PARA>
<PARA> gender</PARA>
<PARA> ethnic background</PARA>
<PARA> physical disability</PARA>
<PARA> sexual preference</PARA>
<PARA> religious or philosophical beliefs,</PARA>
<PARA> (c) my Department is satisfied with the success achieved to date in promoting EEO within the Department of Defence, particularly concerning women, aboriginals and the disabled. The ongoing program is subject to continual assessment by senior management of the Department,</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the aims of the program have been enunciated in a number of instructions which have been distributed widely throughout the Department. These aims have been and are being facilitated in the following ways:</PARA>
<PARA> the Department has recently appointed a permanent EEO officer, whose broad role is to provide a focal point for achieving non-discrimination in employment matters and generally heighten EEO awareness in the Department,</PARA>
<PARA> special emphasis is given to EEO principles in the content of appropriate training courses conducted by the Department, e.g. selection interviewing, and supervision,</PARA>
<PARA> in order to strengthen public awareness of EEO considerations, my Department has produced two video programs on the following subjects:</PARA>
<PARA> employment of aboriginal people and their involvement in the National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals Scheme in the Department,</PARA>
<PARA> employment of disabled people in the Department,</PARA>
<PARA> these videos have facilitated the Department's continued success in the employment of the disabled and active participation in the NESA Scheme,</PARA>
<PARA> close attention is given to the selection of women for development opportunities, especially supervision and management courses. In this regard the first female civilian participant is currently attending the Joint Services Staff College, for which civilian attendance is keenly contested by a number of Commonwealth Departments.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the EEO program is aimed at the whole Department,</PARA>
<PARA> (f) broad policy guidelines on EEO matters are issued by the EEO Bureau of the Public Service Board. On EEO issues, the need for, and conduct of consultation with unions is undertaken by the Board,</PARA>
<PARA> (g) the EEO Bureau is the focal point for EEO initiatives and programs in Commonwealth Departments. My Department maintains close liaison with the Public Service Board on all EEO matters affecting it, including EEO measures being adopted in the Department,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The sensors, weapons and data system hardware of Invincible are common to many Royal Navy ships.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) H.M.S. Invincible has almost no commonality of sensors or weapons with United States Navy or R.A.N. ships. However the ship has a data link system ( Link 11) which gives her full operational compatibility with similarly equipped units of United States and Australian defence forces including our DDGs, PC3 aircraft and in due course FFGs.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The ADAWS6 combat system of Invincible will be retained largely intact with the exceptions listed in paragraph 6 below. Since Invincible is one of a class of three ships and since much of her equipment is common to other Royal Navy ships we are looking for any advantages to be gained through co-operative logistic arrangements. The United Kingdom Ministry of Defence and the Royal Navy have indicated their willingness to co-operate wherever practicable along these lines. A project team is in the United Kingdom investigating such arrangements. Details of support arrangements and costs are yet to be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) An upper limit of $5m has been provided for R.A.N. modifications to Invincible. With respect to the combat system, planned alterations or additions are:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Type 184 sonar to be removed.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) IFF/SIF equipment will be transferred from H.M.A.S. Melbourne to Invincible .</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Sea Dart missle system-as I covered in my statement to Parliament on 25 February 1982 the question of whether or not to retain this system is the subject of a special study which is now in progress.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) There are minor communication changes to be implemented before Invincible is fully compatible with the R.A.N. communications system. These include the installation of special security communications equipment to be removed from H.M .A.S. Melbourne. The cost of these changes is included in the aforementioned $5m estimate.</PARA>
