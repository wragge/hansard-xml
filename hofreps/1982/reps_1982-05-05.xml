<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Prime Minister to the news of the heavy loss of life sustained by both Great Britain and Argentina in the military action taking place near the Falkland Islands. I ask the honourable gentleman: In view of the fact that there has been no statement to this House, has he initiated any matter at all by way of a personal discussion or diplomatic intervention to try to bring about a peaceful solution of this problem? Does he support the Irish Government's initiative, which calls for an immediate convening of the United Nations Security Council, to consider a resolution to cease hostilities forthwith and begin talks for a negotiated settlement, and further the lifting of economic sanctions against Argentina by the European Community, as they are no longer deemed to be appropriate?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2229" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think all honourable members of the House will be concerned at the loss of life that has occurred with the loss of a major ship of the Argentine Navy and a significant ship of the British Navy. It would be the wish and the hope of all honourable members that this problem could be solved by negotiation. It would have been our hope that the situation never got to the point of military conflict. Having said that, it is hard to get away from the circumstances in which Argentina captured the Falkland Islands by unprovoked aggression. The talks that were proceeding had been broken off. The problem has always been about how a relatively small number of Falkland Islanders are to be allowed to lead out their lives. But the fact that there are only a small number of them does not diminish the importance to them of their capacity to choose the kind of life they want and the kind of government they want. Democracy, whether it be for one person, 10 people, 2,000 people or 100 million people, is equally important for the individual affected. The Argentinian action was in defiance of everything that all honourable members here would believe in in relation to that right of self-determination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> United Nations Resolution 502 has called for the matter to be resolved in an appropriate way. Argentina, as I understand it, has said that it accepts that Resolution but at the same time, or in the same breath, it said that its sovereignty must be recognised. That, of course, denies the right of self- determination to the Falkland Islanders and therein lies the problem around the negotiating table.</PARA>
<PARA> We have been very closely in touch with the United Kingdom Government throughout this matter. We have been closely in touch with the Administration of the United States of America. Honourable members would not be surprised to know that a very large part of our discussions, both in the Cabinet room between a number of us and in a smaller group, with Vice-President Bush related to the Falkland Islands. We note that the United States stayed, in a sense, in the middle of this dispute for a considerable time, seeking to negotiate and using all its influence-which is undoubted with the United Kingdom and also not inconsiderable with Argentina, as a South American state-in an effort to achieve a peaceful solution to the problem. We would all be equally disappointed that the very considerable efforts of Mr Haig-which I think deserve considerable praise in spite of the fact that they have not been successful-to achieve a negotiated settlement failed. Once it was plain that the negotiations had failed and that hostilities would begin, it would not surprise honourable members of this House to know that the United States felt that at that point it should make its own view very plain about where justice lies in this dispute. It therefore made it perfectly plain to Argentina and to Britain that its sympathies and support were with the United Kingdom. This is the position we are in.</PARA>
<PARA> I would have believed that if there were a capacity for a negotiated settlement , it could be achieved through the good auspices of the United States. That may still be the way it will go because the United States would have influence with both parties. If some useful action can be taken through the United Nations, obviously the Government would want to examine that very closely indeed. But we need to remember that already there is one resolution from the United Nations. It is the defiance of that resolution by Argentina which has led to the opening of active conflict. I do not think any honourable member of this House would want to underestimate the importance of this occasion and the tragedy of loss of life that has occurred over a matter that ought to have been capable of being resolved by negotiation. But having said all of that-I hope with a very real sense of moderation so far as the Government is concerned-we would want to maintain, and do maintain, support for the United Kingdom in her efforts to achieve justice for the Falkland Islanders.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the honourable member showed me the garment which he has just indicated and it is true, as I understand it, that it has a label on it carrying one of the three gradations of warning to potential purchasers in respect of the flammability of garments. The precise answer to the honourable gentleman's question is yes, there are regulations. Indeed, Customs regulations prohibit the importation of some types of nightwear which are excessively flammable. A direction was given under the Trade Practices Act I think in 1978 by my predecessor, the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, and at that time it was indicated that a standard had been issued. The honourable member will also be interested to know that the workings of that standard have already been put under review by my Department. The review is under way at the moment. What it comes down to in the final analysis is whether the three gradations of warning are understood by the community and by potential purchasers, and whether they have the effect which they are intended to have. The purpose of the review now being undertaken is to ascertain whether the community is aware of the warnings that are given and whether the warnings are effective in their precise terms. The honourable member can rest assured that if it transpires that the warnings are not appropriate or suitable, and are not properly appreciated and understood by potential purchasers, then they will be altered or other appropriate amendments will be made to the regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9M7">Mr MOUNTFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Government's decision to lower tariffs on internal combustion fork-lift trucks from 30 per cent to 25 per cent from 1 April 1983. I ask the Minister: Is he aware that the major manufacturer of these units in Australia, Hyster Australia Ltd, will be forced to sack 150 of its employees out of a total work force of 260 people, partly because of the Government's decision to reduce these tariffs? Is the Minister also aware that the dumping of small fork-lift trucks on the Australian market by Japanese companies at prices below the cost value of the units is also causing Australian industries to be placed in a position of being unable to compete on the Australian market? Will the Minister reconsider the decision by the Government to reduce tariffs on these units and will he also assure the House that accusations of dumping by Japanese companies will be thoroughly investigated by his Department?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2231" SPEAKER="Lynch The Rt Hon Sir P.R." NAMEID="YI7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="FLINDERS" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI7">Sir PHILLIP LYNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The dumping question certainly will be investigated. I respond to the honourable gentleman positively on that. Of course that process will take place through the Department headed by my colleague the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. It is a fact that the company to which the honourable gentleman refers, Hyster Australia, has announced that after September it will discontinue the manufacture in this country of its smaller fork-lift trucks. As the honourable gentleman has mentioned, the background to that has been the recent report by the Industries Assistance Commission which recommended an immediate reduction of duty to 25 per cent for one year, followed by a long term rate of 20 per cent. The Government has looked at all the pros and cons of this issue. I am sure the honourable gentleman would share with me the conviction that many of these industry cases are matters that must be decided on balance. The inputs from both sides of the fence-from those who manufacture and those who import-must be seriously considered. The Government determined the long term duty rate of 25 per cent, with an interim rate of 30 per cent for one year, to give the industry time to make the necessary adjustment. The duties chosen were designed to balance the needs of this industry with those of a wide range of user industries which obviously have their own case for examination and for which fork-lift trucks represent a very significant cost factor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The long term duty rate of 25 per cent was, in fact, the level requested by two of the three major manufacturers. Nonetheless, under the duties which have been established, there may well have to be some rationalisation within the industry. The move by Hyster is presumably part of that process since, I understand, it will be continuing to manufacture here its larger machines. Discussions with the company have been held. Its views have been fully represented to the Government and very carefully examined. It has been ascertained that amongst the factors which influenced its decision were the move to the 38-hour week and to higher wage levels. I do not on this platform seek to take a party political point about that except to say to the honourable gentleman and to others who are concerned about the position of business in Australia-the outlook is subdued at the present time-that what really is important is to withstand the increasing cost pressures that are directly disemploying so many Australians at the present time. I can only reiterate to the honourable gentleman that we cannot maintain, let alone improve, our international competitiveness if our production costs are rising so much faster than are those of our competitors.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0N7">Mr NIXON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of the honourable member's question is no, the Federal Government does not have any way of monitoring the level of expenditure or activities which different State governments might have in respect of soil conservation. The Federal Government's role in soil conservation was made clear when, last year, we transferred to the States by way of revenue grants the volume of funds that we were making available previously for soil conservation. That was an amount of some $3m. We transferred that into the general revenue grants which allowed the States individually to determine their own priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose there is nothing so central to the sovereign rights of the States as land use, land control and land policy. For that basic reason, it seems to us quite sensible that they should, therefore, have total control of the financial expenditure that might be undertaken on soil conservation. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth has had a deep interest in the question. It is a very important question to us as a nation. Through our own legislation, we have ensured that the expenditure undertaken by an individual farmer, instead of being deducted as expenditure over 10 years, can be deducted in the year of expenditure. That is a demonstration to the nation of the importance that we place on soil conservation . I make the point that it is now very much up to the State Ministers for soil conservation to argue their case within their own treasuries. Any Commonwealth funds that are made available are made available through the general revenue grants.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are Press reports that the question of a price increase for farm products has been almost resolved, although there are still some general budgetary problems that the British Government is arguing about. The quoted level of the average increase is something like 11 per cent. That is a record increase for the prices of agricultural commodities, particularly those which affect Australia. Of course, this sort of increase is in contrast to comments that were made to me when I was in Brussels, also by the President of the Commission of the European Communities when he was in Australia recently, that there would be efforts to moderate the rate of price increase, which was producing an incentive to produce more and so create the enormous surpluses that are being dumped on world markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To gain some idea of what is happening, I ask honourable members to look at the case of wheat. The world price is currently at around $158 a tonne, whereas the proposed support price for the EEC would be $231 a tonne. That is 146 per cent of the world price. Let us look at the picture for other agricultural commodities. The support price that the EEC is considering for sugar will be 186 per cent of the present indicative world price, for butter 182 per cent of the world price and for beef a massive 263 per cent of the ruling world price. Is it any wonder that countries such as Australia are very concerned about EEC policies and the impact they are having on the international trade in agricultural commodities?</PARA>

We have in fact tackled the problems of new settlers to this country in a somewhat different way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is very conscious of the security risks faced by the staff of the Australian Embassy in Beirut. Security there has been a recurring problem and unfortunately there has been a general worsening of the situation since the post reopened in 1977. We maintain a constant watch on the security situation there and we are currently considering a range of measures to upgrade the physical security arrangements at the chancery and at the residences of the Australian staff. On the question of access, the information available to me is that Lebanese citizens who are resident in east Beirut are able to have access to the western sector of the city. Perhaps it is not as easy at it might be but they do have access to the Australian Embassy, which is in the west. It is also relevant that the Beirut international airport is in west Beirut. So far as visa and immigration questions are concerned, the Embassy in Beirut processes visitor visa applications but the vast majority of migration applications are in fact handled by the immigration section of the Embassy in Damascus.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Treasurer recall telling the House on 20 April that Australia could not have an interest rate structure out of line with that in the United States of America? Is it a fact that treasury notes are being sold in the United States of America at 13 per cent to 14 per cent compared with 19 per cent to 20 per cent in Australia and commercial bills are being traded at around 15 per cent in the United States of America compared with 21 per cent and more in Australia? Is it a fact that Australian interest rates are well out of line with those in the United States of America due to the extraordinarily tight money policy and the deliberate attempt to attract capital? For how long does the Government intend to impose the extremely high cost of this clumsy policy on Australian credit users such as businesses, farmers and households?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I have persistently said is that over any reasonable period it is not possible for the interest rate structure in this country to be markedly out of line with the interest rate structure in the United States. If in recent weeks the authorities in Australia had endeavoured to sustain an artificially low interest rate structure, that would have had a very severe impact on the movement of capital in Australia and would have had very severe consequences for Australia's balance of payments during that particular time. The statement that I have repeatedly made does not gainsay the fact that at various times of the year short term interest rates in Australia will go above their yearly levels because of the seasonal pattern of revenue collections in Australia, where most of the provisional tax is collected during the last quarter. That situation does not prevail in the United States and it adds force to the proposition that many people have advanced for a long time, namely, that we ought to try to find a painless way of developing a less seasonal method of collecting provisional tax in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications. I refer the Minister to representations I made to him last year regarding the possibility of some of Telecom Australia's cable laying being undertaken by contractors or local government authorities when this could be done more cheaply than under the present arrangements and when it could reduce delays in telephone connections, especially in rural areas.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are certainly a number of instances in which contracting out by Telecom Australia has demonstrated an economy in operation and a saving thereby both in the time of providing new facilities and in introducing new telephone connections. Indeed, I understand that in a particular instance in the honourable gentleman's electorate the local council has been able to provide some cable laying assistance to Telecom which has resulted in such economies. Across the board in Australia the Government is very keen on Telecom utilising contract facilities where they can comply with the fairly strict engineering and design standards that Telecom sets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is, of course, true that in many new multi- storey buildings the cabling is done by contractors meeting standards laid down by Telecom authorities. The objective has been to ensure that Telecom lays down standards in the same way as local government and State authorities lay down standards, for example, for the wiring of domestic houses and, having met those standards, the cables are then capable of being connected to, in that instance, the electricity grid and, in Telecom's instance, the telephone grid. The Government is very keen to see that practice being undertaken wherever possible and I have had discussions with Telecom to that end. However, in each instance both the availability of services and the capacity of the contractor to meet standards must be the prerequisite before Telecom can actually let out the contract.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After my recent visit to Broken Hill with the honourable member for Riverina, I am very conscious of the concern that the city has for its future and particularly for future investment in the mining industry. I met with a representative group of people at Broken Hill who referred to the findings of an economic survey published and forwarded to the New South Wales Government in 1980. That survey pointed out that one of the most detrimental things affecting future investment was the very high level of royalties that apply to base metals . Royalties applying at Broken Hill are discriminatory. They are higher than anywhere else in New South Wales and amongst the highest in Australia. These royalties have applied for a long time. Fundamentally, the industry is subjected to a progressive rate of royalty which reaches 50 per cent of profit by the time the operating profit exceeds about $9m. In terms of the massive investment that is required today for mining operations, a $9m profit is not very high at all. As a result, mining companies are now discarding any consideration of the large investment they would have to make if they were to develop the low-grade ore at Broken Hill which could be mined but will never be mined unless the mining of that ore is made more attractive. The royalties that apply now are just too regressive altogether.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of going to Broken Hill with the honourable member, I have taken action by writing to the Premier of New South Wales, who is also the Minister for Mineral Resources. I have asked him whether there could not be some reform of the royalty rates applying to the Broken Hill mining industry so as to try to change the outlook for the city of Broken Hill. I believe this is something that is absolutely essential and must be done. I am also aware that the honourable member for Blaxland in a speech he made yesterday, or maybe the day before, pointed out the severity of State charges and royalties and the detrimental effect that they are having on investment. I do not think there is any better example of this than Broken Hill. If the honourable member for Blaxland is interested, I would be very happy to send him a copy of the letter I have written to the Premier of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government has used the argument that to change the royalty rates would mean that the Commonwealth Government would get a greater return from company tax. I have never noticed any consideration being given by State governments to compensating us when they put on additional charges. I have certainly not noticed that New South Wales has ever considered giving us any part of the massive royalty charge that applies to Broken Hill. So I do not think the argument that it cannot alter the royalty charges because it would mean more revenue for the Commonwealth stands up.</PARA>

How does the Government expect Trans Australia Airlines to maintain its market share when it has access to a diminishing share of the on -carriage passengers from commuter and regional services? As Ansett already owns airlines in South Australia, Western Australia, northern Australia and New South Wales, as well as Wings Australia, Masling Airlines and Vodas Pty Ltd, with which it has exclusive arrangements, how does the Government expect TAA to maintain its market share?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ever since there has been a two airlines agreement in this country, the airlines have been free to make their own commercial judgments and to enter into their own commercial negotiations. It is true that Ansett Transport Industries Ltd has acquired interests in some of the commuter operators and, therefore, has secured ongoing traffic at certain points. On the other hand, TAA has made arrangements with East-West Airlines and, I understand, with some other commuter airlines in an endeavour to secure ongoing passengers and freight. It is a question of commercial consideration and commercial negotiation, and there is no way that we would wish to interfere with the commercial decisions of the airlines, albeit that they might operate under a two airlines agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any event, where takeovers or purchases of intrastate airlines might take place, there is no power available to the Commonwealth to prevent such takeovers . The States have powers to exercise should they so wish. But I should like to see the airlines engage in truly commercial competition within the spirit of the two airlines agreement. I think it is within that spirit that we introduced and passed legislation for the new airlines agreement last year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We shall look in a moment at what the friends of the Australian Labor Party are doing about it in Tasmania. But before I come to that, let me add that not only is it the highest rate in Australia but also it has increased by 34 per cent in the last 12 months. Not only is that a deplorable state as regards the unemployment rate in Tasmania, but also the employment situation is even worse, because in the 12 months to March of this year employment in Tasmania declined by some 5,200. Not only was that a decline in employment in Tasmania but also it went very definitely against the national trend, where there is still a steady growth in employment throughout the country. However, the number of people in employment is in fact declining steadily in Tasmania. There is no doubt, in my view anyway, that at least a substantial reason for this deplorable state of unemployment and lack of employment growth in Tasmania is the fact that the Tasmanian Government seems to have been engaged upon a task of strangling the life out of commercial and industrial activities in that State .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course there is a limit, to some extent, on what governments can do. But one thing that governments can do is at least to assist those projects and activities which are designed to give people, particularly young people, work experience and the skills which will enable them to get jobs. It is a matter of very great regret for me to have to say that only a couple of days ago I received yet another rebuff from the Premier of Tasmania. I think it is the fourth or fifth now. I had invited him to contribute financially to a very worthwhile work experience and skills training program in Tasmania, indeed in Hobart, run by the Centrecare Movement at Mount St Canice. It is a very worthwhile scheme indeed. It has been left solely to the Commonwealth Government to finance that scheme. My understanding was that the previous Premier was prepared to contribute financially to it but the present Premier has refused many times, as indeed has Mr Aulich, his Minister. That is a callous and heartless attitude to young unemployed people who are trying to get into that scheme. If there were more assistance from the Tasmanian Government, the situation would be better in that scheme and indeed better throughout the whole State of Tasmania.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have looked again. On the last occasion when the honourable member for Adelaide asked me the question, I said that I would look again at the answer I gave on 20 August last year. The answer I gave on 20 August last year was to the effect that there had been correspondence between the Treasury and the Department of Industry and Commerce regarding the publication of a particular survey. At that time, a decision had not been made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on whether the survey should be published and, therefore, if I had at that time disclosed the detail of the correspondence it might have been construed by some that I was putting public pressure on my colleague as to whether the survey should be published. My position has never been one of seeking to mislead the House. I believed when I made the statement, not to the House but a general Press statement back in August of last year, that just because the Treasury-and I agreed with the view that was being put by the Treasury-argued that a particular publication ought not to be made, that of itself did not warrant the charge of suppressing information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From time to time, departments disagree as to whether surveys should be conducted or figures should be published, and to dignify every such disagreement as representing a suppression of facts, particularly when many of the facts in question are in fact freely available from State governments, is to give to the arguments put at a departmental level a quality and a status that I do not believe they deserve. At no stage have I not disclosed to the House that there was an exchange between the departments. When I gave my first answer in August of last year, a decision had not been made regarding publication and, for the reason I mentioned, I did not think it appropriate to go any further. When the next question was asked, I acknowledged that the Treasury had argued against me. In those circumstances, I do not believe that in fact I have misled the House.</PARA>

I went on in this Press release:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By denying this information to the States, and to the public, the Treasurer is hoping to avoid this pressure. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, from the States. I said how scandalous this was and that if the Government continues to manipulate its relations with the States by withholding vital information then the States could indeed expect to be further taken to the cleaners as they were taken to the cleaners in the Loan Council meetings and the Premiers Conferences which took place in May and June of last year. I concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> It is about time that public access to information of vital importance in assessing economic policy and resource development strategy was guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA> The States also have the right to this information. </PARA>
<PARA>That drew the Treasurer out of his burrow and caused him to put out a Press release on the next day. I remind honourable members that this exchange could not take place in the House because it was not meeting at that time. The significant words in the Treasurer's Press release were these:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is patently absurd for Mr Hurford to accuse me or the Treasury of attempting to suppress the figures from the various State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>He was not content with that. On 20 August, when the House did meet, I asked him whether a list of infrastructure projects had not to that date been published ' because of objections from his Treasury Department in particular in a letter from the Secretary of his Department to the Department of Industry and Commerce' . Instead of giving a direct, meaningful and accurate answer to my question, the Treasurer chose to table his Press release of 11 August 1981, from which I have quoted and which, I repeat, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is patently absurd for Mr Hurford to accuse me or the Treasury of attempting to suppress the figures from the various State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>The only reasonable interpretation to be drawn from that assertion and the answer given by the Treasurer in this Parliament is that neither he nor his Department had attempted to suppress the figures. My question asked whether the Treasury had any objections to the publication of the list. I and the Parliament were led to believe by that answer of the Treasurer in his Press release-the error was repeated in Parliament-that he was denying that he or the Treasury had any such objections. In his answer today he attempted to cover this over by saying, in effect, yes, he admitted that there was an exchange of letters. That is not good enough. The question put to him was: Did he attempt to suppress the information. Any proper use of the English language must lead one to the conclusion, if one looks at the letter from Mr Stone to Mr Currie, that an attempt was made to suppress that information. Also, it certainly is not true that the information was freely available. That is a subterfuge that the Treasurer has tried before and which he merely repeated in his answer in the House today. Certainly the States make information available to the Commonwealth about their infrastructure. Each individual State does that and it knows, of course, its own position. But it is misleading the House again to suggest that the important fact is for the States to get the total States picture on infrastructure. Unless information like this is published and unless the Treasurer answers truthfully questions in this Parliament, the States will not have the total picture in regard to requirements in respect of their infrastructures when they come to the Loan Council and other meetings. On 23 April this year I had incorporated in Hansard a copy of a letter from the Secretary to the Treasury to the Secretary to the Department of Industry and Commerce. It set out many objections to the publication of the list of projects. I repeat some of the sentences from Mr Stone's letter. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this letter is to convey to you personally my concern about the proposed publication of these estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Of even more concern, however, are the potential difficulties which I see publication creating for the Commonwealth in its dealings with the States in the area of infrastructure financing at the forthcoming meeting of the Loan Council in May and June, and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA>This letter exchanged hands back in April 1981, four months before the Treasurer misled me in this Parliament. Later on, at the end of the letter, Mr Stone says:</PARA>
<PARA> For those various reasons, therefore, I would ask that you consider carefully whether the proposed publication should proceed. As you will gather from the foregoing my own strong view is that it should not. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say that we have mentioned this matter to the Treasurer, who has reacted very strongly to the same effect. </PARA>
<PARA>In light of the answers that the Treasurer has given in this Parliament those words are damning. It is patently clear from that letter that the answer provided to this House by the Treasurer on 20 August 1981 was completely at variance with the facts of the situation. The Treasurer has claimed that this is an inconsequential matter. It is not. The relationships between the Commonwealth and the States are vital to the good government of this country. The Treasurer in his answer of 20 August said that this was an inconsequential matter, and I think we will find from Hansard that he is still saying something to that effect today. Yet the letter that I have incorporated in Hansard, and from which I have just quoted, contains matters of great consequence and indicates that the Treasurer also felt strongly about the issues when they first arose. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, it is not an inconsequential matter in one other vital respect. Ministers' answers reflect clearly a contemptuous attitude to this Parliament. One very established and significant commentator on affairs in this Parliament has made valid comment about the so-called resignation speeches of the honourable members for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) and Ryan (Mr Moore) and the contempt for this Parliament which the inadequacy of those speeches revealed.

It is even worse when, in answers to questions, we do not get the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. On 20 August the Treasurer showed absolutely no desire to answer a proper question on an important subject with any real respect for this place and its right to obtain relevant information. He made no effort whatsoever to give the truth to this House. On the contrary, in answer to my question he gave a completely erroneous impression to me and to the House. On previous occasions only the terms of the Standing Orders have prevented my saying what I felt about this, and I am glad that on this occasion I have had an opportunity to draw to the attention of the Parliament this grave affair, an affair in which the Treasurer was asked whether there was an attempt by him and/or the Treasury to suppress information. The letter from the Secretary to his Department clearly showed that there was such an attempt. The Treasurer's answer sought to mislead this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, of course, treat the motion moved by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) seriously because I treat seriously any allegation made by any member of this House that I have misled the Parliament. I have a total respect and reverence for the Parliament and I therefore respond very directly to the charge that the honourable member has made. In doing so, let me reject categorically any suggestion that I have set out to deceive this Parliament. I would regard it as a very serious matter, and a neglect of my duties as a member of the Parliament, if I were to set out to do so or in fact had done so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The history of this matter is that in the first half of last year discussions commenced between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of the Treasury as to whether a particular survey which was being put together by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the publication of which had been foreshadowed in 1980 should, in fact, go ahead. I am now free to say, in a way in which I was not free to say until a decision had finally been made on whether or not the survey should be published, that my own Department did not believe that any really useful purpose would be achieved by the survey being published and, in fact, had a number of concerns as to whether publication should go ahead . I agreed with that point of view. In the final analysis the survey was published. The Department of Industry and Commerce, which has control over the matter, decided that the publication should go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the observation that it occurs time and again at a bureaucratic level and, indeed, at a ministerial level that there are differences of opinion between departments and Ministers as to whether a particular survey should be published or a particular course of action should be taken. The view I took when I issued the Press statement on 11 August of last year, in response to what I regarded as an exaggerated Press statement by the honourable member for Adelaide which charged the Treasury and me-in the light of the attitude which I had about the matter and which the Treasury had about the matter-with going to the length of trying to 'suppress' this information was that he had exaggerated what we had done and put an interpretation on what we had done which was out of all proportion to the weight of the objection that we had made. What I put to the House and what I had in mind in August of last year when I made the statement is this very simple proposition: Does it really amount to an attempt to suppress facts every time a department or a Minister argues that a particular course of action which may lead to the publication of some information ought not to go ahead? If that were the case, departments and Ministers would be arguing-in the words of the honourable member for Adelaide-very frequently to suppress facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, what the Treasury did on this occasion was simply to put the arguments against the publication of this survey. Those arguments were ultimately rejected as it was always within the authority of the Department of Industry and Commerce and its Minister to reject them. In other words, if there was an attempt to suppress the information, that attempt failed rather miserably. I have acknowledged from the word go that it was a decision to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) and not by anybody else. I refer to the question asked by the honourable member for Adelaide on 20 August. The honourable member referred me to the booklet of the Department of Industry and Commerce which was published at the end of 1980 and asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Will the Treasurer confirm that this list of infrastructure projects has not been published to date-I emphasise 'to date' because I understand it is now to be published in an altered form-because of objections from his Treasury Department, in particular in a letter from the Secretary of his Department to the Department of Industry and Commerce? If this is correct, why did the Treasurer issue a Press release on 11 August denying the facts that I had placed before the Australian public?</PARA>
<PARA>As I have said before, I regarded the words of the honourable member for Adelaide in his Press statement of 11 August as being an absurd exaggeration of what we were attempting to do-the point of view that we were arguing-and it was quite wrong to say that we were going to the length of trying to suppress publication of the figures. When I saw that Press statement I obtained some advice from my Department. I issued a Press statement on the subject the same day. The honourable member asked me the question on 20 August. I indicated then that the final decision on publication was to be taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. When I was first asked a question in this House on 20 August a decision had yet to be taken as to whether the survey should be published. If I had publicly canvassed the contents of all of the exchanges between our departments it may well have been claimed that I was seeking to put public pressure on my colleague not to publish. In that answer I acknowledged that there had been correspondence. I said that I believed the honourable member for Adelaide was exaggerating the situation and I sought leave to have the press statement I had made on 11 August incorporated in Hansard as evidence of what was contained in that Press statement. I said nothing further in that answer about the quality of the allegations made by the honourable member. I was conscious that my colleague was yet to make a decision on whether the survey should be published. I was very careful to acknowledge on that occasion, as was the fact, that there had been correspondence between our departments. I do not believe that an answer in those terms, against all of the circumstances of the matter, represents a misleading of the House. I reject the claim made by the honourable member for Adelaide that that answer of 20 August represented a misleading of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, on 22 April, which was the next time when the honourable member for Adelaide asked me a question on the subject, I said that I would check again what I had said on 20 August. I said that there had been a difference of opinion between two departments. I said that, just because somebody objects to the publication of something, one should not then run away with the idea that he is trying to suppress facts; it was really a question of interpretation. I then went on to say something about the details of resource projects. I again put it to the House that in no way could that answer of 22 April be construed as misleading the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, today, the honourable member for Adelaide asked me a question and I answered the question in very careful and very deliberate terms. Once again, I do not believe that what I said in any way represents a misleading of the House. Of course, the honourable member for Adelaide is entitled to reject my interpretation of his remarks of 11 August last year. Of course, he is arguing that every time somebody at a bureaucratic level, or indeed in a ministerial exchange, argues that certain information should not be made public, that argument represents an attempt to suppress facts. The expression I was objecting to was the allegation that we were attempting to suppress figures, particularly against the background that a great deal of that information, as the honourable member for Adelaide knows, was readily available from the States. In many respects it really represented a drawing together on a national basis of information regarding infrastructure projects that was available at a State level. </PARA>
<PARA> That added even more force to the view I had at the particular time that any charge that the Treasury was trying to suppress the publication of those figures was in fact to exaggerate the circumstances. Of course, we were arguing at a bureaucratic level. We argued, for reasons set out in the letter from the Secretary to the Treasury, that this information ought not to be published. We believed there were good reasons for that. In the final analysis, that argument was rejected by the Department of Industry and Commerce and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. That is the sort of bureaucratic exchange that goes on every day between departments in any government, and indeed between Ministers. Just because a Minister or a department argues that there are reasons why a particular survey should not be published, to give to that argument and to those propositions the quality and the status of an attempt to suppress figures, particularly against the background that much of that information is already available and in the hands of the States, is to exaggerate the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the charge that is made in this motion, the one that concerns me and, of course, the honourable member for Adelaide and concerns the House, that is, that I misled the House on 20 August and that in some way the answer that I gave on 20 August-I will go through it again-represented a misleading of the House. In that answer I said that the question of whether that survey gets published was one for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to decide. There was no argument. I said that I was happy to leave it to him. There was no argument. I said that there had been correspondence on the matter between the two departments. There was no argument. I said that was what normally happened; that permanent heads of departments tend to write to each other from time to time about these matters. I said that I did not know whether the honourable member for Adelaide or indeed anybody else should get particularly excited about the timing of the publication of a survey which in effect merely drew together on a national basis figures about infrastructure proposals. </PARA>

I have continually opposed the extensions of Adelaide Airport both for wide-bodied jets and for the international terminal. I have done so because I believe that the State Government and the Federal Government have an obligation to declare where the new international airport will be located and when it will be commenced. The constituents of mine who live close to the airport have expressed similar views at both hearings of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. It concerns me and it has concerned many other people that the report, which I have not seen as yet, is a foregone conclusion-that the State Government and the Federal Government have agreed, prior even to the conclusion of the Committee's work, that the international terminal was to go ahead. The Public Works Committee and its Chairman gave the residents of Adelaide a good hearing. I hope that their views will be reflected in the report in the recommendations from the Committee. I certainly hope that we will see a statement fairly soon from the South Australian Government and from the Federal Government declaring where the new international airport will be located and when it will be commenced.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Fraser Government's treatment of Australian pensioners is nothing short of a national scandal. Since it came to power in 1975 it has presided over the impoverishment of a growing army of oppressed pensioners who have seen their hopes for a decent standard of living shattered by the blows of indifference and prejudice of this Government. All honourable members will recall that it was the initial aim of the Whitlam Government to increase single rate age and invalid pensions to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Whilst this was only to be a beginning, it must be realised that under the Liberal-Country Party Government preceding the Whitlam Government the rate had not risen above 20 per cent until December 1972. On this evidence and that which will follow, we could be forgiven for believing that the commitment of the current Government to the improvement of the living standards of the poor has no substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In December 1970 the single pension was $15.50 a week or-the percentage figure is most significant-18.8 per cent of average weekly earnings. By December 1975 it had been raised by the Whitlam Government to $38.75 a week or 23.1 per cent of average weekly earnings. What is the situation today? The current figure is $ 73 a week, but that represents only 21.9 per cent of average weekly earnings. In other words, the situation has deteriorated. In percentage terms, pensioners have lost around 1.2 per cent of their earnings. There is ample evidence to demonstrate that the ability of pensioners to maintain a decent standard of living is not being sustained. Many of the very privileged honourable members opposite do not appear to be able to understand that the pensioners are not just statistics. They are not greedy people. They are people who are no longer able to maintain themselves independently. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot escape from the human anguish and, so often, human misery that result from becoming a pensioner. No one looks forward to the time that he will be facing up to a bureaucracy to make official application to join the army of the poor. To be made indigent is a prospect that many members of the Government cannot comprehend. One wonders just what goes through the minds of the people who sit opposite when they are confronted by constituents who are in these necessitous circumstances. Do they realise that there are psychological and social problems created by poverty that lead further to the degradation of these people? How many of them have had to experience the ignominy of the welfare interface? There is little dignity involved for the welfare recipient who must seek assistance from a welfare agency. Asking for a food voucher or handout is an indignity in itself. Yet this is the experience of many thousands of Australians every week. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when greater involvement in welfare programs is being called for, the Government has set in train policies that will reduce its commitment. It is transferring programs from the Federal sphere of responsibility to the States. There has been, for example, a tendency to run only those programs that provide service to those in extreme need. There has been a further transfer of responsibility to private hands or, as has been said, to those that will be able to be run on commercial lines. Obviously those people who live at or below the marginal level of subsistence but who strive to manage their affairs efficiently are hard-pressed simply in their own striving to cope. </PARA>
<PARA> I give to the House an example. This situation could be replicated throughout Australia. The example concerns a constituent of mine in the electorate of Ballarat. This lady is receiving the basic single rate age pension. She has $3, 500 invested in interest bearing deposits at 14 per cent. Over the year this earns $490 interest, which gives her an extra income of $9.42 a week. Since this is in excess of the $6.50 difference now existing between the pension rate of $ 73 and the tax threshold she will now have to pay income tax. Some honourable members might remember a statement by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on 29 January last when announcing the December 1981 quarterly consumer price increase. He indicated what the pension adjustment would be as a result of the CPI figure. He drew attention to the threshold and how much pensioners could earn before being liable to pay income tax. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Single pensioners whose pensions are subject to tax will be liable for tax if their income apart from the pension is about $6.50 a week, while for married couples where one partner has some extra income, tax liability will begin at about $24.70 a week in addition to the basic rate of pension or benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>This lady's money had been put aside for house maintenance and to pay for her funeral. She is being penalised for her frugality. That amount of $3,500 represents her life savings. She desired to retain her independence. Now, with such a small sum, she is being forced to pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I have another example to give to the House. It relates to a young invalid man who attends the Pennyweight Park Spastic Centre in Ballarat. For working in the sheltered workshop which is part of the centre he receives $10.50 a week. As the House would be aware, his pension is not reduced but he does lose his supplementary assistance which helps him pay his rent. As can be seen, he has moved into the lowest income tax bracket because the small amount earned puts him $4-I repeat, $4-above the tax threshold. So much for the charity of this Government. It is a miserable Government. How many thousands of Australians could now tell a similar story? How many Australians could tell a similar story of impoverishment if they had access to the media or if the media were concerned ? This is a society which many would claim to be enlightened, yet it permits these pensioners daily enmeshed in a web of poverty to shoulder the greatest burden-anxiety. </PARA>
<PARA> In so many ways just surviving is becoming an intolerable burden. Whichever welfare agency one talks to the story is the same. There is an increasing incidence of people seeking some supplementary assistance whether it be for food , money or house repairs. Many of these agencies are frustrated by their own inability to meet the needs of these people. There are those who believe that the poor will always be with us. But the actions of this Government are exacerbating the problem and forcing that belief into becoming a fact. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an obscene fact that those who are affluent can wield power to increase their affluence in this country. The examples are legion. They stretch even to tax evasion. There are people who are beneficiaries of this Government's policies. Tax evasion is an industry of vast and growing dimensions. This Government aids and abets this growth industry by its failure to deal with the problem effectively. It pleads that it will not stifle enterprise or initiative. It is guilty of gross double standards because it tolerates and supports a system which so tragically swells the ranks of the poor. How would any Government member like to be a pensioner seeking accommodation, when the response is so often a rejection? Landlords often look upon pensioners as bad risks and they ask for bonds far out of reach of the pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Of those who must suffer the indignity of approaching welfare agencies for good vouchers, 80 per cent are pensioners and welfare beneficiaries. Among these, 28. 2 per cent are receiving unemployment benefits, 16.5 per cent are single parents , and 15.3 per cent are invalids. What is now a major worry is that these agencies, as I said, are no longer able to provide adequately for even the immediate needs of these people. </PARA>
<PARA> There are still those who are affluent and who believe that blaming the victim is an adequate procedure for exculpating themselves. Those people's being judgmental will not assuage the fears of the poor. The Government's record is public knowledge. It cannot extricate itself from the charge of responsibility for the present situation. No matter what index of concern one uses, the Government comes out badly. I wonder whether many Government members are aware that families who have to depend almost entirely on the widow's or invalid pension, unemployment, sickness or supporting parents' benefits, have suffered, since 1976, a 14.5 per cent drop in their incomes in real terms relative to the average weekly earnings. It almost defies credibility, but of the total population of pensioners and beneficiaries, which totals 2,621,495 in February 1982-that is an enormous figure-431,427 were dependent children, that is, children who are forced to spend their growing years suffering the indignities of poverty. These include the children of invalids, widows, supporting parents and the unemployed. Amazing as it may seem to those who have given inadequate thought to the problem, the family allowance has declined by 24 per cent in real terms since it was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> We are constantly exhorted by this morally blinkered Government to be proud of our country, yet so miserably treated are these people that they cannot find time to reflect upon the benefits of the beneficence of this nation as they struggle to survive. On behalf of the poor of this nation, I call upon this Government to raise the level of the basic pension in all categories, to give a commitment to maintain a proper and adequate percentage of average weekly earnings, to raise the family allowance in line with the consumer price index increases, to raise the amount of income pensioners are allowed to earn above their pension before it affects the pension, to lift the tax ceiling on pensions , to co-ordinate the activities of the Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security to ensure that the pension plus allowable income is not taxed and, finally, to lift the staff ceilings in the Department of Social Security to enable that Department to cope adequately with the task that it has. While I am pleased to see that provision has been made for more staff, I hope the Minister will ensure that these new members of staff are so placed that they will reduce the impossible burden being carried by offices, such as that in Ballarat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard very strong criticism indeed from the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Mildren) so far as the performance of the Government is concerned with our social welfare program. I note that he did not tell us one word of what the Australian Labor Party policy is in relation to social welfare. I hope that somebody, at least from the Opposition-as critical as Opposition members are-will today be able to tell us what he or she would do if on our side of the House. How can anybody stand up in this chamber and say that we have been unkind to pensioner folk throughout Australia when in the seven years that this Liberal-National Country Party Government has been in office it has more than doubled the contribution to age pensioners from $2.21 billion to $4.61 billion? The indexation system that this Government brought into being in 1976 allows for an automatic rise every November and May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose that the people who would better judge the performance of the Government would be the pensioners themselves. In Australia actual recipients total 1.9 million. I know that, within my electorate of Lyne, there are approximately 14,000 age pensioners, simply because it is a very prominent seaside and retirement area. It is very seldom that I have a visit from a pensioner who complains about his benefits, both from a pension point of view and from a fringe benefit point of view. This is due simply to the fact that this Government has related those payments to the indexing of costs. This has been a very important move so far as we are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Ballarat mentioned other factors, including the fact that we have passed the responsibility for health and other matters back to the States. Let me make this quite clear: It is the policy of the Liberal-National Country Party Government that if anyone wants efficiency so far as welfare spending is concerned-and health may be included in this area-the responsibility must pass to those who are closest to the matter; in this case they are the States. I challenge anybody to get up and say that we have not adequately reimbursed the States for their responsibilities in health matters. I am speaking about a reimbursement of up to 11 per cent this financial year. The New South Wales Government has recognised that there must be a rationalisation regarding hospital beds and deficiencies, and it has voluntarily undertaken to do this. The honourable member for Ballarat should talk to the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The allocation for social welfare in this Budget is $9,865m which is 28.1 per cent of the Budget. It is the biggest Budget item that this Government has. As I said earlier, since we came to power in late 1975, the overall increase in pensions has been from 21 per cent to almost 28 per cent. The honourable member for Ballarat has the audacity to criticise this Government which has been so good, as it should be, to the pensioner, to elderly folk, to the disadvantaged and to the people throughout Australia, who, we believe, should have substantial help. It is the policy and the intent of this Government to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable member wants to interject on that point, let me take him back to 1972 when Mr Whitlam in his policy speech for the Australian Labor Party said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We intend to raise the basic pension rate to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>That promised increase was not achieved. The pension rose from 19.2 per cent to 23.2 per cent of the average weekly wage. Under the present Liberal National Country Party Government, the pension has reached a record 24 per cent of the average weekly wage. </PARA>
<PARA> What else did the Labor Party's leader promise at that time? I remind honourable members that the Labor Party had the opportunity to do something in this area when it came to office. It sat on the Treasury bench at that time. Another promise made by Mr Whitlam was:</PARA>
<PARA> The means test will be abolished in the life of the next Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>But, in the three years that the Australian Labor Party was in government, the means test was not abolished for those in the 65 years to 69 years age group. Labor has now dropped its commitment to abolish the income test. Members of the Opposition need only speak to their shadow Minister for Social Security, Senator Grimes, and he will outline this fact. In fact, he will take the credit as the one who actually blocked that proposal. Members of the Opposition can be critical of these matters but in response I refer them to what the Labor Party, when it was in government, did for the needy in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, $9,865m has been set aside in the Budget, a rise of 14.7 per cent on the provision in the previous year, or, in money terms, $1,265m. We introduced the indexation to which I referred. It formed a major and important part of the Liberal-National Country Party Government social welfare policy. The cost of the indexation of pensioner benefits between November 1981 and May of this year is $716m. In the Budget for this year we had to make available another $281m to cope with the rises. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the achievements of this Government's social welfare policy. In 1976 it introduced family allowances, which trebled the rate available. They replaced tax rebates and child endowment. This made many low income families better off as previously they were not able to receive the benefits of tax rebates. The Government introduced an incomes test to replace the means test, as well as twice-yearly indexation of basic rates for most pensions and benefits. The handicapped child's allowance was increased from $40 a month to $73 a month. In 1977 the Government introduced the supporting parent' s benefit and expanded eligibility criteria for persons to receive treatment under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. The Government later increased the limits of the pensioner health benefits card from $57.50 a week to $68 a week for a married couple and $33 a week to $40 a week for a single person. We also brought in emergency relief grants, totalling $500,000, which were provided to community welfare agencies. Pensioner health benefits cards were extended to supporting parent's benefit beneficiaries. The Government then increased the additional pension for children from $7.50 to $10 and, furthermore, increased the guardian's allowance by $2 to $6 or $8 a week, depending on the child's circumstances. Age pensions became payable to inmates of mental institutions on the same basis as they were paid to inmates of other institutions. We increased the personal care subsidy from $15 to $20 a week. I could go on to many other things that the Goverment has done. We have done these things to assist the people who actually need assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Ballarat criticised the Government. I want to tell him that the most important thing a government can do today to assist the pensioners and the underprivileged within Australia is to control inflation. During the time of the Labor Government inflation went from 6 per cent in 1972- 73 to 12 per cent in 1973-74 and up to 16 per cent in 1974-75. Honourable members should think of the effects of that on the pensioner, because the pensioner is the one who has to budget according to his income and who has to be very careful about what he spends. We know that if a government is going to be more generous so far as any avenue of the Budget is concerned, it has to know that it has income coming in. Although the honourable member for Ballarat did not say so today, apparently it is the policy of the Labor Party to build up the age pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. That would cost $350m a year. If it were to proceed up to 30 per cent of average weekly earnings it would cost $1,240m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> How can we compare that with the statement of the shadow Treasurer on more than one occasion that a Labor Government would not increase personal taxation? I would say that if the Labor Party were to increase the things it says it will, and bring the age pension up to this 25 per cent level, it would have to do what it did before and build up a deficit approaching $5,000m over a three-year period. Unless the Labor Party budgeted for such a deficit then it would never be able to overcome this problem. A government is like a household, it can spend only the amount that it is able to collect and there is a limit to what the taxpayer is able to pay. The average cost for social welfare to the taxpayer today is $40 a week. That includes both direct and indirect taxation. In 1970-71 the figure was less than $5 a week. In 1979-80 it was $30 a week. We can see the increase, and we can see the commitment of this Government. We have recognised our responsibility to the pensioners and the handicapped in this country. For many years the Labor Party has criticised and talked about this but today we are talking about performance. That is what really counts. I am very proud of the record of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party so far as social welfare within Australia is concerned. We have been able to provide the amounts to cater for a gradual incline in the Budget, bearing in mind the taxation that we are prepared to collect throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners are receiving assistance not only from the Commonwealth but also from all of the States and most of the councils throughout Australia by way of, for example, travel concessions and reductions in council rates. These are very important. I stress the point in the little time available that the Government places tremendous importance on a number of fields within the social welfare area. I have spoken about the aged persons pensions. We must consider also the invalid pension, which this year will cost approximately $990m. The supporting parent's benefit will cost $600m and the sickness benefit $215m. The unemployment benefit this year will cost $1.120m. </PARA>

<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to : (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed.

<PARA> The introduction of a means test to the new proposed Housing Grants Scheme has disadvantaged many thousands of people who were saving under the previous scheme .

<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. the proposal to introduce fees for higher and second degrees will mean that access to postgraduate and recurrent education will be limited to the rich; Australian research and ability to cope with technological change will suffer; this proposal must be seen as a step in the direction of the introduction of fees for all tertiary students.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. the proposed introduction of a loans scheme for students will mean graduating with a heavy debt or being denied a tertiary education if loans are refused because a student is seen as a 'poor risk' (particularly affecting women and those doing non-vocational courses); only the rich will be able to get a tertiary education without course restrictions and the burden of indebtedness.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. in regard to the proposal to restrict eligibility for TEAS and the foreshadowing of reviewing TEAS levels only in the light of the availability of loans, it should be noted that any further downgrading of TEAS, which is already inadequate, can only further limit access to education.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. the proposed restriction of Adult Secondary Assistance to those needing qualifications for employment will severely restrict access to a full high school education and necessary bridging education to tertiary education for those who left school early.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. the proposal not to fund 30 Colleges of Advanced Education if they are not rationalised is an attack on teacher education. This attack will create teacher shortages in the mid 1980s, restrict access to education now and endanger the future quality of teaching available to Australian children.</PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 and by reason of the urgent nature of the work, it is expedient that the following proposed work be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Construction of an oceanographic research vessel for CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA>Recent legal advisings concerning the ambit of the Public Works Act indicate that this vessel is subject to referral to the Public Works Committee for examination and report. The urgent need for the vessel precludes this course of action. In its fourth report of 1981 concerning construction of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation marine laboratories at Hobart the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works expressed the view that a new research vessel was an integral part of the marine laboratories proposal and without it the effectiveness of the laboratories would be diminished. The Committee also stated that it believed acquisition of the vessel should proceed concurrently with the construction of the marine laboratories now scheduled to commence in July of this year and due for completion by the end of 1984. </PARA>
<PARA> A new oceanographic research vessel is urgently needed to replace Sprightly, the vessel at present in service, to enable CSIRO to implement an effective national program of oceanographic research in waters surrounding Australia. The Sprightly is a tug which was converted for oceanographic research. It offers only limited facilities for oceanographic research and at 40 years old has exceeded its economic life. A new ship designed specifically for marine research will offer greater endurance and fuel economy, will carry more scientific equipment and scientists and will accommodate computing facilities and associated equipment enabling data exchange between ship and shore. In addition it will provide air conditioned space for tropical operation, increased manoeuvrability for more accurate station keeping in all weather conditions and reduced maintenance. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced on 15 April 1980 that the then estimated cost of the vessel was $9m. The vessel will require up to 24 months to construct and commission. If the House agrees to support this motion, design and construction of the new oceanographic research vessel can proceed. </PARA>

We also lay claim to 42 per cent of the Antarctic continent and to that 200-nautical mile-370.4-kilometre-exclusive economic zone which surrounds the continent. Apart from oil exploration we have barely tapped the resources of the EEZ. Indeed we hardly know what they are. It is a matter of very high priority that we do understand more of our oceanographic resources. The tug Sprightly is now obsolete. It is older and more battered even than some Ministers in this Government. I repeat that the scheme has a very high priority. It is a matter of urgency.

In fact, it was only on a recent advice from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that we learned that such works should have come within our purview anyway. As reported by the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh), when the Committee examined the proposal for new marine laboratories to be constructed in Hobart, it did comment in its report that there was an urgent need for this research vessel. There is no way in which the Committee would hinder the early provision of this vessel which is quite essential for the work that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation needs to carry out in the marine area. I also remind the Government and the Minister that, when reporting on the Antarctic bases building program, we also pointed out very clearly the need for a vessel to service Antarctica. I hope that the Government's response in relation to a vessel for Antarctica will be as prompt as it has been in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words on this matter. I hope that the new oceanographic ship will be used for research into fisheries and so forth. There has been concern for quite some time about what will happen to the blue fin tuna industry in Australia. I know that some concern was expressed at the largest tuna port in Australia-that is, Port Lincoln-about what the future holds . A survey was carried out by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation which indicated that CSIRO felt that the blue fin tuna stocks were in danger of collapsing unless immediate steps were taken to stabilise the fast declining population of the fish. That statement was made in reports by the CSIRO. I could go on for quite some time detailing the concern expressed by fishing groups in Port Lincoln, by the tuna fishermen and others. It is essential that further research be undertaken on the question of the tuna industry generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the fish that are now being caught are getting smaller and smaller as time goes by. This is mainly because of over-fishing. That means that those fishermen will reach the situation where they will have to look further afield. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that research that has been done in the western Pacific indicates that the skipjack tuna is in plentiful supply in that area. As an alternative, in case of depletion of the stock of bluefin tuna in the southern area, Australia can put in its little piece and try to exploit the skipjack tuna in the western Pacific area. I hope that, in the activities of these research vessels, the CSIRO will put in the greatest effort to find these alternative fields for Australian fishermen. It has been suggested that if there is no restriction on the amount of tuna taken in southern waters many people will go out of business, which will have a detrimental effect on the industry. I certainly hope that the provision of this ship will help towards overcoming this . I agree with the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) in that I also hope that it does not stop at one vessel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We accept this cognate debate because, in fact, the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill provides for the Homes Savings Grant Scheme to be phased out and replaced by the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme under the Home Deposit Assistance Bill. Therefore, even though I am not normally in favour of cognate debates, I think this is a commonsense approach to take on this issue. These two Bills relate to the housing package which arose out of the statement of 18 March by the Treasurer (Mr Howard). As I have said, the Home Deposit Assistance Bill replaces the Homes Savings Grant Scheme with the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme. It is one of a number of potentially expedient ad hoc gimmicks announced by the Treasurer on the eve of the Victorian State elections to address the crisis in the area of housing. The sad thing is that since 1976 this Government has had a quite deliberate policy of diverting money from the housing sector and directing it to the resource sector. The housing sector has suffered greatly. But, because of mass public opinion generally throughout the community, there was enormous pressure from Government back benchers to bring in some sort of scheme to try to build up the stocks of the Liberal Party in Victoria and the conservative Government in this House and save them from the wrath of the people. The scheme is part of that ad hockery. I will have some comments to make on that later. I concede that, because of the actions of the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) and some of the bureaucrats within his Department, there have been improvements in the legislation. I will concede that aspect. But, in dealing with the overall economic aspects, it is sad to see how this matter has been dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The measures which were brought forward by the Treasurer on 18 March failed to relieve the problem facing existing and intending home buyers. They barely addressed the serious problem faced by tenants in the private rental market. They did nothing to reduce the growing problem of homelessness. They did nothing to reduce the number of families-99,000-now waiting on public housing commission lists in this country. The measures included a further one per cent rise in the housing loan interest rates charged by the savings banks. That added to the record of this Government as it has presided over the highest interest rate hike in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1980 the interest rate charged by savings banks on housing loans was 9 .5 per cent. Now it is 13.5 per cent. That represents a 4 per cent increase in interest rates in about two years. The effect of the interest rate rise is to exclude a growing number of people from access to home ownership. In 1980 there were already signs that the level of home ownership in Australia had begun to decline. In 1978 the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimated the level of home ownership-that is, outright owners and those people paying off mortgages-at 73.8 per cent. In 1980 the Bureau revealed that its estimate was 71.9 per cent. Therefore, in a period of two years, there was a drop of nearly 2 per cent in home ownership in this country. Of course, the real pressure has occurred in the last two years because of the high interest rate hike of 4 per cent. I will develop that theme a little more later. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many indications that the home ownership rate has continued to fall as more and more people have been unable to gain access to afford- able finance. It is generally estimated that a one per cent increase in the housing loan interest rate acts to exclude about 9,000 families from access to home ownership . In that case, we are looking at the exclusion of about 36,000 families because of the rise in interest rates over the past two years of 4 per cent. I think that is a conservative figure. An interest rate rise reduces the maximum amount of funds that a borrower can obtain as a first mortgage loan from a bank or building society. The lending institutions ration their lending by imposing a restriction on the proportion of a borrower's income that can be used in mortgage repayments. Usually the banks permit a maximum of 30 per cent of the breadwinner's gross income to be committed to mortgage repayments. The building societies permit a maximum of 25 per cent of household gross income. </PARA>
<PARA> As interest rates rise, the monthly loan instalment on a mortgage increases. Hence, the maximum permissible borrowings fall in order to maintain the repayments to income ratio prescribed by the lender. Each time interest rates rise, intending home buyers have to find a larger deposit in order to gain access to home ownership or they have to resort to a larger second mortgage debt . We know that at present second mortgage interest rates are about 20 per cent in the fringe banking institutions. Through an over-tight monetary policy which has led to the rising interest rates, this Government has widened the deposit requirement for first home buyers. For example, on 18 March the Treasurer announced the rise in savings bank interest rates from 12.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent. The maximum permissible borrowings from a saving bank for a person on average weekly earnings thereby fell by $2,341-from $36,249 at a 12.5 per cent interest rate to $33,908 at a 13.5 per cent interest rate. Therefore, on the one hand, this new proposal increases the maximum basic grant by $500-from $2,000 to $2,500-but it reduces by $2,341 the ability of a person on average weekly earnings to get a loan from the bank. The position is worse still when we compare it with the situation in March 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same statement on 18 March, the Treasurer announced an increase of $500 in the basic grant from the homes savings scheme under a type of deposit assistance grant. On 18 March, intending home buyers were told that their required deposit would rise by $2,341 and that the Government would provide an extra $500 to assist them to meet that deposit requirements. In order to explain the effects of rises in interest rates from 9 1/2 per cent to 17 per cent, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the maximum mortgage loan available for a person on average weekly earnings from savings banks and building societies at interest rates ranging from 9.5 per cent to 17 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The table shows that, at an interest rate of 9.5 per cent, a person on average weekly earnings could obtain from a savings bank a maximum first mortgage loan of $45,200. At an interest rate of 13.5 per cent, such a person could obtain a maximum first mortgage loan of $33,908. The 4 per cent rise in interest rates under this Government means that the maximum first mortgage loan able to be borrowed by an intending home buyer receiving average weekly earnings has been reduced by $11,330 in respect of savings banks and $7, 896 in respect of building societies. In the same period, the Government has raised the maximum homes savings grant, now described as an assistance grant, by $500, from $2,000 to $2,500.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the record of this Government in recent years. In fact, in the last two years the Government has effectively reduced the borrowing rights from a savings bank of a person on average weekly earnings by $11,330 and all it has given that person in return is $500. I challenge the Minister to deny those figures. That is the desperate situation of first home buyers. Yet this proposal is embodied in legislation called the Home Deposit Assistance Bill. It is clear that, as a result of the measures announced by the Treasurer on 18 March, the deposit gap that intending home buyers must meet has been widened rather than narrowed. This so-called deposit assistance scheme is mis-named. It represents a misallocation of resources. When we look at the grant in the light of prevailing land and dwelling prices we see how insignificant it is in reducing the deposit that is required of intending home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> Before going on to that matter, I quote from a Cabinet submission of a former Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development in the present Government, who is now the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman). The submission to the Cabinet is under the signature of Kevin Newman, who is a Minister from Tasmania. It is dated 31 October 1977, in the second year of this Government's period of office. This is what this Cabinet submission had to say at that time in regard to the present homes savings grant:</PARA>
<PARA> The present HSG scheme does not discriminate between the needs of the various categories of first home buyers. Benefits provided are related to savings and not to need and families unable to contract to purchase a home are not eligible for assistance. The great majority of recipients do not need HSG assistance to achieve home ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>Tom Uren or a spokesman for the Australian Labor Party is not saying that. Those are the words of the former Minister for Environment, Housing and Conservation in a submission to his Cabinet colleagues about the real significance of this Homes Savings Grant Scheme. It is designed only for those who have the ability to save-the wealthy-and it really does not help those people in real need. That is nothing new from a government of the calibre of this one. It is a heartless government. In order to amplify these proposals, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard three tables which show estimates of deposit requirements for median- priced house purchase and home unit purchase in each capital city and also for bottom-end of the market price for new house and land package in capital cities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. In the case of the median-priced house purchase, the first table shows that, after the maximum obtainable savings bank loan, the prospective home buyer in Sydney requires a deposit of $41,400. A borrower from a building society requires a deposit of $49,090. Clearly a grant of $2,500, which represents only 5 per cent of the required deposit, is not enough to help the first home buyer in Sydney's median-priced housing market. Only for those able to obtain a savings bank loan in Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth does a grant of $2,500 help to reduce the deposit requirement sufficiently to place the intending home buyer within the range of home ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second table in the three that I have just incorporated shows the estimated deposit re- quirement, after the maximum first mortgage borrowing, for the average income earner seeking to buy a median-priced home unit in Sydney and Brisbane. That home unit is beyond such a person's reach even with the maximum assistance grant. The third table, which is based on a conservative estimate of the deposit requirement for the bottom-end of the market price for new house and land package shows that, even with a grant, intending first time home buyers are excluded from home ownership in Sydney and that first time home buyers in the other capitals must rely on a loan from a building society as their needs are not met by the maximum savings bank loan. The table indicates that the new home deposit assistance scheme is useful to some first home buyers in some centres. I stress the words 'in some centres'. I thought that in a country such as Australia we might adopt a broader outlook to seek to help people in every area in Australia. But, as I say, this grant helps in some centres only. </PARA>
<PARA> The tables also show that the scheme is useless for intending first home buyers in Sydney. If one looks at house and land prices in Darwin, one will see that a similar situation prevails there. I know that the present Minister for Housing and Construction comes from the Darling Downs in Queensland. He should have a better understanding of some of the situations which apply in Queensland. He heard me ask a question of the Prime Minister this afternoon about the demographic population trends in this country. In 1975, Professor Borrie projected that we would have a population of approximately 17.5 million by the turn of the century. Natural growth has increased slightly but, on the whole, that is because of a great upturn in our immigration intake. The population at the turn of the century will be about 19.9 million. I think it could even exceed 20 million by that time. That is an increase of 2.5 million on Borrie's projections. This will have an enormous effect on housing in this country. In fact, if we look at Borrie's projections in the period 1974-75, he argued that, up until the end of the 1980s, at least 150,000 new dwellings would need to be completed each year to meet the needs of those people who reached marriageable age or sought to set up households. But under this Government the number of dwellings has been down to as low as 118,000 and at best about 135,000. So there is a substantial backlog although there has been an upturn in population, particularly because of migration. In fact, the report tabled yesterday by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) indicates that the number of family formations has fallen from 26 per cent last year to 17 per cent this year. One could argue that people who are part of a family formation could in fact be housed by their own families and therefore the position would not be aggravated. But the greatest proportion of migrant intake comprises people who have no connection with people in Australia who in many cases really need housing themselves. It seems to me that even the figures made available by the Government indicate that there will be an accelerated need for more housing. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to take into account internal demographic changes. The Minister for Housing and Construction, being a Queenslander, knows that the real pressure is being put on the population of Brisbane. Just as there has been inflationary pressure on housing in the Sydney metropolitan area over the last couple of years, we foresee a great deal of inflationary pressure on housing in the Brisbane area. At the moment at the bottom end of the market in Brisbane a house costs $44,000 and a flat costs $52,000. We predict that by the end of 1983 the deposit situation will be laughable and that the cost of housing will be much higher. I predict that we will have another difficult situation to cope with in the Brisbane metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this legislation contains some good proposals. To be fair, the Minister for Housing and Construction placed a number of proposals before the Cabinet which were contrary to the wishes of the Treasury. As I said earlier, Treasury's view has always been that money should be drained out of the housing sector and transferred to the resource sector. However, the Minister, with some of his back bench members, has been able to get on top of Treasury. The Minister has succeeded in gaining Cabinet approval for some of his proposals. The Government, after all, was conscious of the political cost of its policy of increasing interest rates. Again, to be fair to the Minister, the Deposit Assistance Scheme is a substantial improvement on the former Homes Savings Grant Scheme. The Minister has been fortunate to have had enlightened bureaucrats working on the scheme. Many of those bureaucrats, with whom I had the privilege of working when I was a Minister, are not from the old Department of Housing and Construction but are officers of the former Department of Urban and Regional Development. I must say that those enlightened officers helped me, and I give credit to them. I now see they are doing some good work for the present Minister for Housing and Construction. Those bureaucrats have worked overtime-I stress the word-in trying to transfer some knowledge to the present Minister. The nine- months waiting time for the grant has been abolished, which is a substantial improvement on the old scheme. I must say that the old scheme was a sham. It was a home decorators account. The Minister smiles and acknowledges that. I am pleased that he does so. Everyone in the industry called the scheme a home decorators account because home buyers got it nine months after the grant was approved. I think every member of this House who makes representations for home buyers must be happy about this change. </PARA>
<PARA> Progressive changes have also been made to the eligibility criteria for the grant, especially in relation to migrant settlers, transient workers and de facto married couples. I give credit to the Minister particularly and to those people who advise him in his Department. I think it is a step forward. I, and I think other members on this side of the House, really are pleased that a little humanity is coming into at least certain sections of the Government. The new scheme is an improvement on the former scheme. It will help some people in some centres-and I stress 'in some centres'-to get some benefit. It contains a sensitive recognition of the circumstances of specific groups of people. But still the scheme is not good enough. There are too many people who gain nothing from it. The figures I have provided suggest that in some centres the scheme may fuel further inflation in the price of dwellings. </PARA>
<PARA> The overriding problem with the scheme is its isolation from an integrated set of measures for giving stability to the availability and price of housing finance and to the housing industry activity. The scheme was announced in the context of a further rise in interest rates. The Government persists with its policies that will drive interest rates up still further. I do not want to be too gloomy but with savings bank interest rates for housing at around 13.5 per cent, with semi-government loans still at 15.5 per cent to 15.7 per cent, with every indication that the rate will go higher; with pressure on the money market , particularly the short term money market, with money coming in at and being lent at a rate of over 20 per cent and with a record increase in capital inflow, with a government that is still keeping tight restrictions on the flow of money, even for housing, I question whether the $400m that was projected in the 18 March statement will find its way into the industry. I foresee at least another one per cent rise in savings bank interest rates and this will further widen the deposit requirements by at least another $2,089. The scheme will then be even less effective than it is now. </PARA>
<PARA> What we need is a scheme for assistance to first home buyers that fits into a set of policies for stabilising the flow of funds for housing at an affordable price. We need a commitment by a federal government that there will be no further rises in housing interest rates. Such a commitment is beyond the capacity of this Government for it is not prepared to make housing the social priority it deserves to be. It is not prepared to use its powers to control assets of financial institutions sufficiently to gain a stable flow of funds into the housing sector which will obviate the need for further interest rate rises to attract deposits. It is from that perspective that Labor seeks to amend this Bill. We see the need for a more effective home ownership assistance scheme to be provided as an option to the Deposit Assistance Scheme so that those who are not helped by this Government will not be left unaided. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's proposal in this regard cannot be put forward in an ad hoc, piecemeal fashion. We are not in the game of gimmicks in the area of housing. The problems are too serious and too far-reaching for that. I have hammered out many times that if we are to attack the situation of housing we have to attack it on a broad front. We need to attack the problem on at least five fronts. We need to upgrade and expand the public sector housing; we need to have a scheme which will assist intending first home buyers into home ownership; we need a scheme which protects existing home purchasers from the growing mortgage burdens; we need to stabilise the availability of the price of housing finance; and certainly we need to stabilise the housing industry's capacity and activity. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted to allow for provision of a more effective form of assistance which will reduce the deposit requirement of first home buyers by permitting larger first mortgage borrowings from savings banks and building societies. </PARA>
<PARA>If we attack the question of home ownership on a broader front, I believe that we shall be able to give some credibility and respect to those people who need a home. From my point of view, this Bill does not meet the deposit gap. The Government's policies have created a greater and greater burden in regard to the deposit gap for home ownership. I have great pleasure in moving that amendment on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a joint debate on two cognate Bills, the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill 1982 and the Home Deposit Assistance Bill 1982 . I shall be addressing my remarks to the latter Bill, generally speaking, unless I indicate otherwise. We are here to discuss measures of prime interest and importance to Australians aspiring to or seeking to maintain private ownership of their principal places of residence. We are in fact discussing private home ownership. We are debating measures which will encourage and sustain the uniquely high level of private home ownership that only Australians enjoy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While negative economic experience warrants these measures, they are a positive response by the Government to those negative influences, influences which are both national and international in their character. Although this is not an economic debate, it is important to remember that the underlying need for this legislation is prompted by economic considerations and that the ultimate remedies to these problems are to be found in the economic recovery mapped out by this Government. The proposed legislation is to overcome identifiable short term problems. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, or it should be, reassuring to taxpayers generally to note that the Home Deposit Assistance Bill is, in effect, subject to a sunset clause. That is, it is not a blank cheque signed on behalf of all taxpayers and payable to bearers on demand for ever and a day. The Home Deposit Assistance Bill is designed to come to grips with particular problems properly identified by the Government as needing interim attention. If the prescribed date, that is, the date on which entitlement commences, does not occur before 18 March 1985, an entitlement does not accrue. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that the next Liberal-National Country Party government will, after reconsideration, extend these provisions, with the approval of parliament, beyond March 1985. But present economic policy renders that option unlikely to be necessary because, by any comparison with economies similar to our own, progress in combatting the evils of inflation and in offsetting the effects of international economic malaise will see the continuation of these measures unnecessary after 1985. So apart from legislative and administrative safeguards in the Bill itself, there is a specified time limit, and that is a development in this type of legislation which I welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Another welcome provision in the Bill is that means testing for a one-off benefit is included in the proposed legislation for the first time, to the best of my knowledge. It fits in nicely with the twin objectives of promoting and maintaining maximum levels of private home ownership as well as confining taxpayer funded assistance to those less well off or in immediate need, or both. The Bill itself is complex. Although designed to meet the clearly stated objectives of the Government, to which I have referred, it has been drafted to cope with the intricacies of defining terms and functions not commonly falling within the ambit of Commonwealth legislation. I am assured that experience with the Homes Savings Grant Acts of 1964 and 1976 has necessitated the detailed work involved. Subject to its passage through the Committee stage and through the Senate, I accept that there is not a simpler, more abbreviated way of legislating for the Government's initiatives in this field. </PARA>
<PARA> If I have any criticism, it might be said to be a minor one. It is that the use of the word 'home' in legislation is presumptuous on the part of any government. Let me remind anyone who may be interested that a home is not an institution of government in the sense intended in the Bill. Homes, thankfully, are made by people and not governments. Usually, but not exclusively, homes are the product of families, and my preference is that the meaning of the noun be not depreciated by governments assuming, if only by inference, some role in the creation of them. </PARA>
<PARA> That little homily aside, and to the extent that it is mostly families that make a home, consideration for the family is an important feature of this Bill. For example, in providing for the adjustment of taxable income in certain cases, special attention is given to the possible circumstances of married women leaving the work force for family or other reasons during a qualifying period. Clause 36 is weighted in favour of such married women, and that is as it should be. Additionally, grants to married couples with children will be increased as an entitlement in accordance with the relevant provisions in the Bill. In other words, a bonus will be payable in prescribed circumstances to families with children. One dependent child will attract a bonus of $500 over and above grants to childless couples, and that will be increased to $1,000 in the event that there are two or more dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with other initiatives already taken, these family oriented measures underline the importance that only this Government attaches to the family as the basis on which Australian society is and will continue to be built. I suppose that I can say, without fear of reasonable argument to the contrary, that while governments cannot create homes as such, this Government has an unprecedented record of fostering the ingredients which enable the maintenance of family units and, in turn, the establishment of homes by family units. </PARA>
<PARA> Another desirable element of the proposed legislation is its encouragement of thrift. Thrift in the form of either savings with approved institutions or money invested in the purchase of land suitable for the purpose of building a dwelling for prime and personal use will attract rewards not available unless the provisions of the Bill are enacted. Those rewards are additional to normal interest earned or advantage accruing because of factors associated with the effluxion of time, such as capital gain. Savings in an approved building-cum- investment institution are encouraged. It is not lost on those Australians with the future and best interests of our country in mind, that private savings are among the most important sources and means of accumulation of capital, capital so necessary for the expansion and future development of our great country. </PARA>
<PARA> Another feature of the new legislation will be the absence of limits determined by or related to the value of dwellings. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren ) touched on that aspect and I think he may have been in error when he spoke about it. Provisions in the Homes Savings Grant Acts precluded many who lived in remoter parts from qualifying for a grant. Higher building costs outside metropolitan areas placed many outside the scope of the Homes Savings Grant Acts . That inequity is remedied in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of a housing package, which includes tax rebates which are dealt with in other legislation, this legislation goes a long way towards assisting first home buyers realise their goals. It is in addition to and separate from the special funding provided for low income purchasers and renters. The legislation embraces the best features of the Homes Savings Grant Acts and it benefits from the experience gained in the administration of those Acts as well as the pitfalls and shortcomings that were discovered in those Acts. The legislation allows for assistance to be provided to those who, for special reasons, may not be able to take up residence immediately. Dwellings erected on rural land or subject to strata titles, or consisting of part of a building, are to be catered for. The qualifying provisions as they relate to savings seem to be well defined and also benefit from the experience gained in administering the Homes Savings Grant Acts. As such, they probably warrant little comment from me. I have already mentioned that these Bills are part of a package of measures announced on 18 March. When these measures are enacted and in place, much will have been achieved for and on behalf of families in particular, but not exclusively, seeking to purchase the dwellings they either occupy or hope to occupy. I welcome the legislation that has been presented by the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) and I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating the Home Deposit Assistance Bill and the Homes Savings Grant Acts Amendment Bill together. I take the view that this opportunistic housing package is enough to cause the most hard boiled and cynical politician to blush with embarrassment. The introduction of the package coincided with the devastating setback for the Fraser Government in the Lowe by-election and was timed in an attempt to avert a similar electoral disaster for the State Liberal Government in Victoria. Hitherto the attitude of this Government to the housing crisis has been characterised by inactivity and indifference. Month after month and year after year the Australian Bureau of Statistics has been providing indisputable statistical evidence of serious adverse trends in the housing industry. Through government inaction, thousands of home seekers have been thwarted in their aspiration to home ownership and others with mortgages have been confronted with spiralling repayments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that there has been an overall increase of $20 a week in home loan repayments inflicted on home buyers over the past two years. Meanwhile Commonwealth expenditure on housing has been cut by a massive 70 per cent since this Government came into office. Last November, for example, the value of housing loan approvals for all significant lenders was $547m which was $100m less than for the same month in the previous year. The number of housing loans by savings banks in November was the lowest since October 1974. First mortgage finance for that month covered 19,223 dwelling units which was 4,045 units fewer than for the same month in the preceding year. For the month of December 1981 the official figures revealed that home building approvals had reached their lowest level for two years, running at 11,279 dwellings which was 13 per cent lower than for the month of December 1980. In addition, public sector approvals were down 40 per cent over the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this year, 1982, the trend was still disastrous. Loans approved by savings and trading banks during January totalled $277m which was $17m less than the January 1981 figure. Dwelling approvals for the month of January 1982 stood at 9,519 which was a decrease of 9.8 per cent compared with December 1981 when the approvals numbered 10,548 and a decrease of 3.3 per cent when compared with the previous January when the approvals numbered 9,841. All the time we have this unrelenting, steady decline and deterioration. In February 1982, not long ago, savings and trading banks approved houses and dwellings worth $289m which was $38.7m less than February 1981 approvals. The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh), who is sitting at the table, should scratch his brow when these figures are unfolded for his benefit because these figures alone vividly expose the extent of the housing crisis which has resulted from the failure of the Government's economic and housing policies. </PARA>
<PARA> No wonder there was a dramatic increase in unemployment in the early part of the year when the number of persons unemployed rose to 437,200 in January 1982, just on 7,000 more than the number for the same time in the preceding year. Of course rising unemployment reflects the impact of housing industry stagnation. Successive Liberal governments have always let the housing industry run down until the Government has been threatened with electoral annihilation. Back in the 1960s the Menzies and Holt governments went close to total abdication from the field of housing. On 20 September 1967, if I may indulge in a bit of history , former Prime Minister Harold Holt wrote to the Housing Minister of the day, Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin, and told her that he was upholding the decision of his predecessor, that is Sir Robert Menzies, that the Commonwealth Department of Housing was to be nothing more than an administrative unit with definite limits on the area of policy and research in which the Commonwealth should involve itself. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we need not, . . . feel that we must have a continuing programme of policy initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a lengthy official letter to this effect. I ask that it be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>My dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 6th July concerning the functions and staffing of your Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that I need reply on only two points. </PARA>
<PARA> The first concerns functions, and I confirm that the Department of Housing should have a policy and research function. In this sense and to this extent I uphold the decision made by my predecessor. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the debate that has gone on about the scope of the Government's intention in establishing the Department of Housing, but I am satisfied that the background supports the view that we were providing ourselves with a principally administrative unit even though, at the same time, signifying our interest, as a Commonwealth Government, in housing. It is in relation to this somewhat limited second aspect that I see justification for a research and policy function. </PARA>
<PARA> What we were not doing in setting up our own Department was moving to put ourselves up in superiority to or competition with the States in housing matters by seeking to move responsibility for housing to the central Government. </PARA>
<PARA> All this places definite limits, in my view, on the area of research and policy which the Commonwealth should involve itself in. It should at all points leave to the States what is properly for them. In other words, the level of its activity in policy and research should have regard to the essentially supplementary and backgrounding nature of the Department's role in the housing field. It would be directed to providing the Department, and thus the Government , chiefly with a background of understanding of housing issues. I do not, of course, question your right as Minister to put a proposal to us as a Government from time to time, but we need not, at this stage at any rate, feel that we must have a continuing programme of policy initiatives. (I know that your letter recognizes this.)</PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the establishment questions which your letter raises. The Treasurer has mentioned to you his worries about growth of staff and expenditure , and these I share. But worries of this kind are in essence worries about the extent of functions, and I would expect to find that the Treasurer's real concern has been in that direction. Whether or not my interpretation of functions requires a review of the staffing proposals already in mind, I cannot myself say. What I can say is that I readily accept that the decisions so far made between your Department and the Public Service Board come within the pronouncement on functions of the previous Prime Minister. But I suggest that in the light of this letter generally, your Department might review its staffing bid and if the review can lead it to propose some form of reduction, I suggest that it make a fresh approach to the Board on the basis of new circumstances. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G7">Mr LES JOHNSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister and I thank the House. Nothing has changed over the years. There is still no policy, only the firm resolve to swamp the housing market periodically with money, an event which occurs under Liberal governments from time to time in a desperate bid to salvage deteriorating electoral prospects. We witnessed a similar situation before the 1972 election when Prime Minister McMahon and Treasurer Snedden tried to hold back the electoral tide. As a result of the policies of the then government the increase in the money supply which in the previous years was running at about 6 per cent to 8 per cent, suddenly jumped to 26 per cent and the housing industry of course became awash with funds. It could happen again. As a result, the value of housing loans by building societies and life offices almost trebled in two years from $1,250m in 1970-71 to $2,988m in 1972-73. As a result the industry was subjected to severe strains and distortions. Shortage of labour and materials became the order of the day. They were extremely acute. Construction times, costs and prices spiralled, causing housing to surge beyond the reach of thousands of families. The entire sorry episode is now being repeated. In the meantime, the only policy initiatives taken have been for the destruction or devolution of the policies enacted by the Whitlam Government. I, as the then Minister for Housing and Construction, had a fair bit to do with a lot of those policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Successive Fraser Government administrations have been totally negative in their approach to the nation's housing problems. For example, the Australian Housing Corporation has been abolished and the funding of State housing programs for low income families has been slashed. Support for housing research, the use of modern housing techniques and economy of scale housing construction processes has been totally abandoned. The initiative to establish a uniform and cost- saving building code throughout Australia is no longer being pursued. The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and the Government Housing Industry Research Establishment are up for grabs. Only the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry, which I established, has been retained, but of course its recommendations are consistently being ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of aged persons' housing programs have been brought to a virtual standstill. It was the administration of the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) which reduced the subsidy under the aged persons' housing scheme from $3 for $1 to $1 for $1. The whole aged persons' housing program has been extended to a five-year period from a three-year period without expanding the amount of money being made available. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the tax relief scheme for housing which was introduced by the Labor Government and which was to take effect from 1 January 1975. The scheme, which gave direct relief to all home buyers on a needs basis, provided tax deductibility for mortgage interest rates and benefited more than one million families at a cost of $120m per annum. Why has this scheme not been maintained over the years? Interest rates have soared under the Fraser Government. Why have we had this great gap in the operation of such a scheme? How much assistance has been denied to needy families by the abandonment of the scheme, a debauched version of which is now to be reintroduced?</PARA>
<PARA> While Labor's scheme was structured to provide greater assistance to all lower and middle income earners, the new scheme-the subject of this debate-benefits rich and poor to the same extent. This scheme looks good on the surface but when we look at the fine print we find it is a different story. The tax rebate applies only to interest payments made after 30 June 1982, and will be limited to families that bought homes over the last five years or are to occupy an eligible dwelling before 30 June 1985. Only about one quarter of the home buyers will receive any alleviation under this scheme. While the value of the tax concession is $230m per annum, the real cost of the increase in interest rates to home buyers is more like $300m per annum. In addition, since interest rates have risen by 4 per cent over the last two years--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addition, since interest rates have risen by 4 per cent over the last two years, interest payments by home buyers have risen by $1,200m. That is close to six times the amount the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is proposing to recoup. Despite the new tax rebate, recent borrowers will still be greatly disadvantaged by interest rises. A couple which two years ago borrowed $30,000 from a savings bank not only will remain $14.30 a week worse off but also will have to meet extra payments over the life of a loan of $26,100. It should be noted that less than 10 per cent of all Australian households will receive any benefit under this scheme; certainly not people who are renting, nor those who purchased five years ago or those who have paid off their homes. Meanwhile, thousands of decent citizens-farmers, small businessmen, home buyers and others- have to pay a high price for this dubious box of tricks by meeting new overdraft interest rates which have jumped to 14.5 per cent or more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Home Deposit Assistance Scheme is a jazzed-up name for the old Homes Savings Grant Scheme. It is interesting to note that the Minister has at least had second thoughts about the principles upon which the Homes Savings Grant Scheme was based and that he has made submissions to the Cabinet along the lines which the Opposition has been outlining to him over a number of years. Apparently, he has at last capitulated. Only people who entered into a contract prior to 18 March to build or buy will remain eligible, provided an application is lodged within one month of the date the legislation is repealed. Under the new scheme the basic grant goes up $500 to $2,500 but a stringent means test is imposed with a maximum grant being paid if income is under 130 per cent of average weekly earnings. No grant is made if the family income exceeds 150 per cent of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent 1 per cent increase in bank mortgage interest rates means that the borrowing limit for an intending home buyer on average weekly earnings has been reduced by $2,000. Under this revamped Homes Savings Grant Scheme, the grant has been increased by only $500. This, of course, means that under the Government's new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme an average family trying to buy a home will now have to find at least $1,500 more in putting together the basic deposit at a time when the minimum deposit required is at least as high as $15,000 for many moderate homes. The means test will be based on the family's income for the previous year, which will throw up a virtual nightmare in administration and in determining a new range of anomalous situations. For example, last year overtime may have been earned in a family and this year there may be none at all. Last year the wife may have been earning an income and this year she may not be earning anything at all. One will almost need a lawyer to sort oneself out in respect of the means test that is applicable to this scheme. The subsidy is now $1 for every $1 saved. A couple will need to save $1,250 a year for two years or $25 a week. In reality, if couples cannot manage that they can borrow it from their families or friends. The whole savings basis of this legislation is obviously a stunt and can be circumvented by anybody who is seeking to do so. People can even go to a lending institution to borrow if they need to get started with this new scheme. In other words, the saving factor is a farce. If it is hoisted on the concept that a low income couple with no saving capacity should get nothing, it is totally without any principle. </PARA>
<PARA> The last matter I would like to make passing reference to-it is tied up with the package-is the housing crisis relief scheme. This scheme is so vague and so poorly presented that it hardly warrants a response at all. It seems to me that no eligibility criteria are spelt out in this scheme; certainly so far as I am aware none have been made available to the public. Presumably such criteria will ultimately differ from State to State because it seems that the scheme is hoisted on the idea of matching whatever the States can afford on a dollar for dollar basis to a Commonwealth government limitation of $20m. Instead of people knowing their rights under the housing crisis relief scheme, they will virtually be mendicants and probably left in the hands of State bureaucrats. As I have said, only $20m is allocated for the whole of Australia and even this will depend on whether the States can scratch up the amount necessary to meet the Commonwealth offer. As we know, already the States are in dire financial circumstances. It is quite possible that in many instances people will thus be deprived of any assistance at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard the legislation before the House as piecemeal and certainly as an unsatisfactory answer. It is quite alarming to note that, in 1981, profits of the five largest private banks in Australia totalled $560m. Banks are to be given a further profit boost to the order of $75m as a result of the lift in interest rates charged to existing home loan borrowers and at least another $50m as a result of the increased interest rate payable on statutory reserve deposits . It seems to me that the Government is far more intent on bolstering the profits of the banks than it is on properly regulating its economic and fiscal policies with a view to ensuring the wellbeing of the average Australian citizen . It certainly has shown little concern over a considerable time about ensuring that people who need housing in Australia are properly assisted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed that members of the Opposition oppose some aspects of the Home Deposit Assistance Bill. When the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced the Government's new housing package on 18 March, he pointed out that the results were the culmination of an exhaustive and thorough review of the difficulties facing home buyers. The Government is strongly committed to preserving Australia's very high level of home ownership and I for one fully endorse the view that home ownership is important for Australian families and that such cohesiveness is one of the great strengths of Australian society today . The policies announced by the Treasurer will make a major contribution towards enhancing these objectives. The Government has acknowledged that many of the difficulties faced by home buyers arise not only from the problem of inflation but also from the pressure of costs on house prices. Increases in land prices and building materials are quite often overlooked when debating the issue of home ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the overall examination of the housing situation, the Government has identified four major problems. They are, first, the availability of housing finance for new borrowers; secondly, the widening of the deposit gap for those seeking to purchase a new home; thirdly, the increased repayment burdens for recent borrowers; and, fourthly, the increased rental payments for some persons in rental accommodation. This Bill deals specifically with the second aspect identified, namely, the widening deposit gap. The Government acknowledges that the original Homes Savings Grant Scheme was coming under considerable criticism and that its value had deteriorated because of inflation. In addition, the nine months waiting list introduced by the Government as a budgetary measure in 1978 did little to help the home buyer at the time of purchase, when cash demands on the buyer are greatest. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) in his second reading speech last Thursday evening provided the information on the mechanics of the new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme. Certain aspects will be most beneficial to the first home buyer. We hear a lot of talk about median house prices whenever the Opposition debates the issue of access to housing. But members of the Opposition always overlook telling us that about 70 per cent of first home buyers pay less than the median house price. For example, median prices paid by first home buyers in some of the capital cities are: $44,000 in Melbourne, $39, 000 in Adelaide, $37,000 in Hobart and $44,000 in Brisbane. The Real Estate Institute of Australia releases house price data for all home buyers-I stress all home buyers-but it is inappropriate to use these figures when looking at the first home buyer. The first home buyer generally purchases a modest home with a view to gaining access to home ownership and trading up at a later stage or extending to cope with an increased family. </PARA>
<PARA> In brief, the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme will provide a maximum grant of $2 ,500 on a dollar grant for a dollar saved basis, with no waiting period for the grant and no value limits, as operated under the old scheme, applied to the house. Naturally the Government is anxious to assist the low to moderate income families and that is why we, as a government, have set a means test for receipt of the grant. A means test of a full grant on incomes of up to 135 per cent of average weekly earnings, reducing to no grant at 155 per cent of average weekly earnings, certainly aims at those most in need of this special form of assistance to bridge the deposit gap. Couple with the grant the family bonus- which I warmly applaud-of $500 for a family with one dependent child or $1,000 for a family with two or more dependent children, and we have a maximum grant of $3,500. I am sure that even the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) would agree that that is a substantial boost for any intending home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> I was more than surprised to learn that only about 50 per cent of eligible home buyers applied for the previous homes savings grant. This scheme operated for all first home buyers and it must not be seen as having assisted only those who were in the know, to use that term. The Government has a responsibility to ensure that every home buyer at least is given the opportunity to make an application, whether the grant received would be the full amount or a lesser amount. As the Minister mentioned in his second reading speech, the new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme will operate from 18 March 1982 to assist people buying or building their first home, the contract having been made on or after that date. I am pleased also to see that the Bill will overcome an anomaly which existed under the old scheme where, for example, a family whose child was born one day before the contract date would receive a family bonus and yet a family whose child was born one day after the contract date would not. I readily acknowledge that all schemes of this nature must have a cut-off date and no matter where the line is drawn there will always be someone just on the wrong side. However, quite often the advent of an addition to the family is the factor which determines whether families will decide to buy their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> Another anomaly which this Bill overcomes relates to the applicant actually residing in the home as his principle place of residence. Under the existing Home Savings Grant Scheme applicants for a grant are expected to reside in the home as their principal place of residence within a reasonable time of its acquisition. Frankly, that is the way it should be. The Government cannot be seen to be financing out of taxpayer's funds an investor who purchases a house to be used purely for investment purposes. However, there could be the case of people in transient occupations-such as school teachers, defence personnel, ministers of religion and the like-who do not always have the opportunity to acquire their own homes and take up residence immediately. This Bill will enable consideration to be given to circumstances such as the location or nature of employment which might prevent immediate occupancy of the home. We would be placing people in transient occupations at a disadvantage if we did no do this. </PARA>
<PARA> Another anomaly that will be eradicated by the adoption of this Bill is that of the ineligibility of an applicant under the age of 18 years. As honourable members are aware, the former Homes Savings Grant Scheme set a minimum age limit of 18 years. One would expect that such a restriction would not debar any potential applicant. However, experience has shown that in several cases applicants have been denied a grant because they have been under the age of 18 at the prescribed date. Whilst under this Bill no upper age limit will be provided, the Government has decided that grantees must be at least 16 years of age, or married or engaged, at the date of entering into the home contract. I feel confident that as a result of this new provision no young person will be excluded from the grant. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the decision that the means test should be applied to the combined taxable income of all applicants. Clauses 32 to 38 relate to 'prescribed earnings'. Clause 33, in particular, provides the basis for determining the prescribed earnings of joint or sole applicants. Whilst taxable income is not defined expressly in the Bill, the term takes its meaning from the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Clause 36 covers a case in which an applicant ceases to receive income from an income earning activity in the year prior to the date of the contract and does not, or is unlikely to, carry on income earning activities after the contract date. This would cover the situation of a married woman who leaves the work force for family reasons. The Government feels that such a person should not be penalised, from a taxable income point of view, when he or she would not continue to have an earning capacity. Sub-clause (3) of clause 36, which provides a formula for the calculation of the applicant's taxable income covers adequately all situations which could be expected to arise as a result of a reduction in income in that vital period when the income factor is being determined. </PARA>
<PARA> Of late much has been said about the need for tax cuts. I, along with most members of the Government and, I suppose, most members of the community, believe that tax cuts will be very important in helping to stimulate the Australian economy in the years ahead. However, the one per cent increase in home interest rates is making it very difficult for many people in Australia-not only first home buyers-to live in their own home. I know of more than one instance in my electorate in which people have been forced to sell up and move into smaller homes in order to meet interest payments that they once thought they could afford. These may sound like extreme cases but I assure the House that they are not. </PARA>
<PARA> Excellent as the Bill is-I realise my suggestion would involve considerable expense to the taxpayer-a high priority should be given to granting a rebate of some sort to meet the higher interest rates involved, especially in cases in which people find themselves unable to afford such payments. What concerns me most is the plight of the one income family, which is far worse off than families in which two or more incomes are earned. Although we want to see as many Australians as possible owning or buying their own homes, we must realise that it is not the first home buyer only who is badly hit by high interest rates . In many cases a young married couple with no children can continue to work for some years, thus receiving a double income and meet the payment of interest rates. I am concerned about the couple who may have had a mortgage on their home for some years, and who have a young family. The mother has to stay at home because of the family, so theirs is a single income family. The Government should give relief to such families also, as soon as that is financially possible. Australia has long prided itself on the high proportion of its people who either own or are buying a home. I cannot emphasise too strongly to the Government, and the Treasurer, the need to look closely at giving assistance to the one-income family, which may be in the older group and perhaps not in its first home, as soon as it becomes financially possible to do so. I promised the Government Whip that I would curtail my remarks because the Government's program is running behind schedule, and I will do so. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Tobacco Charge (No. 1) Act 1955 which was the subject of an amending Bill, the Tobacco Charge (No. 1) Amendment Bill 1982, which was passed in the House of Representatives on 11 March 1982 but which has not yet been enacted. The amending Bill increased to 2.5c per kilogram the rate of charge to be paid for the purposes of meeting the costs of operation of the Australian Tobacco Board and providing funds for research. It provided for the rate of charge to be made higher or lower by regulation. A maximum rate of charge was not specified in the Bill. The intention was to avoid the need for further legislation at some time in the future for the sole purpose of increasing the maximum rate. </PARA>
<PARA> It has now been accepted that the principle of stating a maximum in the legislation, as has been done in all rural industry research legislation in the past, should be applied in this case. This Bill will establish a maximum rate of charge of 6c per kilogram. It will be possible for the operative rate of 2.5c per kilogram to be increased up to that ceiling by regulation. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not opposed to this series of Bills. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill provides for amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 to strengthen the Corporation's control over Australia's export meat trade. The Bill will enable the AMLC to adopt, in certain circumstances, the role of a sole trader or to limit the number of licensees who may trade with particular overseas markets. The Bill will also permit the AMLC to trade in futures for livestock or meat, subject to ministerial approval.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The meat substitution scandal of 1981 and other incidents involving complaints about the quality of Australian meat indicated the crying need for changes and improvements in the control and penalties provisions of the existing Act. Changes to be made to the Act are designed to extend the powers of the AMLC so that it will be properly equipped to carry out its major functions of protecting , developing and promoting Australia's overseas meat trade. The Bill raises existing penalties to realistic levels and further penalties are included. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is complementary to the Export Control Bill which will cover matters associated with the preparation, grading and trade description of exports of food for human consumption. The Export Control Bill requires all premises in which meat is prepared for export to be registered by the Department of Primary Industry. The criterion to be fulfilled under the Export Control Bill will be similar to that which must be met by an applicant for a licence under the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill. The complementarity of each Bill is to overcome a limitation in the Act which prevents the AMLC from taking action against a packer in cases where the packer himself did not export but sold to a licensee who bought 'sight unseen'. Under the existing Act the offending party was the exporter. However, under the amendment Act, neither the packer nor the exporter will be able to escape his responsibilities in regard to the preparation of the meat or in meeting buyer specifications. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, these three Bills also fit in with the export inspection service within the Department of Primary Industry. So we have the situation that, about nine months after the meat substitution scandal, the Government is tightening up procedures under the supervision of the AMLC and giving it enhanced powers to supervise all aspects of the preparation and export of Australian beef. They are powers the AMLC should have had all along but the industry never agreed. By industry, I mean producers, processors and exporters-not just producers. It is strange that in some contexts the Government will recognise the beef industry as a whole but in other contexts it ignores sectors of it. For example, it will do nothing for the abattoir industry despite promises and despite the fact that it is Government actions which have affected it in some ways. One of the changes we are debating is effectively to give the AMLC sole trading powers, such powers to be used particularly when exporters are negotiating with a single buyer. I recall that years ago, when my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown) made such a suggestion, it was rubbished by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) as being just not possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary industry debate overall in Australia has now taken a new turn because respected rural organisations are moving votes of no confidence in the Minister and the Government. There is widespread disillusionment with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in trading matters. The Cattlemen's Union of Australia recently moved a vote of no confidence in the Minister for Primary Industry. The change in farmer attitudes to the Government centres on the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd scandal, the meat substitution scandal and the Government's overall economic policies which do not recognise the interests of rural exporters. The National Country Party is following policies increasingly out of line with the interests of its supporters and, more recently, increasingly out of line with the views of rank and file members of the Party and of primary producers. The Asia Dairy Industries scandal has almost successfully been covered up and the Minister lives in contradiction of the standards of ministerial propriety that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) likes to trot out at appropriate forums but never enforces on Country Party Ministers. While the Prime Minister is prepared to act in respect of impropriety by Liberal Ministers, he is never prepared to act in respect of ministerial responsibility or impropriety by Country Party Ministers. Recently, the National Farmers Federation, in presenting its pre-Budget submission on behalf of Australian primary producers, summed up its attitude towards the Fraser Government as disillusioned, frustrated and angry. I recently said that the weather, international markets and general macro-economic management decide the fortune or failure of the farm sector more than do commodity policies or soothing ideology mouthed by Country Party politicians. </PARA>
<PARA> But this is not to say that nothing can be done. The trouble is that the Government always wants the industry to be agreed before it will do anything. It wants its faithful friends and cronies to come to a consensus. This is playing safe and we understand this; this is keeping out of trouble. But this is rarely initiating; it is never anticipating; it is a failure in leadership and it is never planning for the future. This approach is why there was a complete standstill by the Minister, the Government and the AMLC in reacting to the meat substitution crisis. Everyone was petrified. Half the members of the Ministry were petrified, perhaps because one of their mates was involved. The other half did not know whom to telephone. The National Party in Queensland went for cover. The Queensland Premier came out with a statement that he could guarantee meat from gate to plate. Yet when I went to Biloela in Queensland not so long ago I was told that there was a handful of meat inspectors for the whole of western Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to stress the concern of the Opposition for the Government's policy of always wanting the organisations in primary industry to be agreed. It is causing problems in the rapid reaction to events and in policy making. We already know, for example, that in the next session of Parliament there will be more legislation in respect of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act , particularly in respect of the re-apportionment of fees and levies and a pass- back of those to the producers. We hope there will also be an introduction of a national standard carcass definition to apply to sales and purchases of stock on over the hooks weight-for-grade contracts. I accept that it is good to reach agreement and those two things have required an enormous amount of negotiation and agreement. But surely the Government should be saying what its policy is in these matters. I accept that the Minister has been trying to get the States to agree to a national meat inspection service through the Australian Agricultural Council. But in many areas the Government has been shown lacking because it always wants the organisations, the Department or whoever to be agreed when, quite clearly, the Government needs to take the lead. Some of the people who give the Government trouble in the industry organisations, some of the agro- politicians, are the people who are represented on the statutory marketing organisations. The Department is represented on the statutory marketing organisations as well, so we have somewhat of a club atmosphere which really stops decisions being made quickly and promptly. It is an institutional thing. I do not make any of the allegations that other people make that there is anything untoward going on. But I just say that there are institutional problems in getting rapid decisions out of organisations when there is a crisis on their plate. The Government will need to give a lead to the rural sector in the months ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I will digress briefly. The March issue of Trends published by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics shows that the net value of rural production is down by 4 per cent. If one assumes a low inflation rate this year of 10.5 per cent, the real net value of rural production will be 13 per cent lower than a year ago. It also states that prices will decrease by 3 per cent and prices paid will increase by 12 per cent. That means that the farmers' terms of trade will fall well below last year's figures. It is estimated that the value of rural exports will fall by $770m. The economic situation in the United States of America and Japan is getting worse, due mainly to President Reagan's economic policies which parallel those of Prime Minister Fraser in his belief of socking the poor, indulging the rich and keeping interest rates high. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the Australian beef industry is in desperate trouble. When it was last in similar trouble there was a Labor government and assistance was given. The promises of the then Opposition were something to behold. Beef producers were promised that funds would be provided and interest rates would drop. Nothing was done by the present Government until 1977 when another early election was felt to be necessary. A hastily concocted scheme was put together, implemented and forgotten. What has happened since? By and large, the answer is nothing. Cattle numbers have fallen continuously since 1976 and are now less than 25 million head. The abattoir industry has collapsed without the slightest action by the Government to assist it despite well-documented pleas. In some areas of Australia the cattle herd has decreased since 1976 by 10 per cent per year compound. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation has been criticised by nearly every responsible beef cattle organisation and agro- politician. Only now are there signs of action by the Government for reform, adjustment and enhancement of AMLC powers. I was delighted to see-I think it was yesterday, 4 May-that the Minister, in a speech to the Peneplain Hereford stud sale at Heyfield, at least did indicate that there will be a need for a lot more attention to the organisational infrastructure of the beef industry. But I think that has been just a little bit too late. It is nine months since we had the scandal. Some of these things should have been in place years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the beef cattle industry. In the last 18 months alone Australia' s 50,000 cattlemen have witnessed the final stages of a three-year drought affecting more than 60 per cent of our livestock producing land and a drought not yet over in many areas of Australia. They have seen a 40 per cent collapse in saleyard prices. They have seen the closure of more than 25 meatworks. There has been the meat substitution scandal. There are the new security measures, costing many millions of dollars. Most of those measures were implemented at the insistence of the United States. There has been a 14 per cent reduction in access to the Japanese market; the appearance of the European Economic Community as the world's second largest exporter; disadvantageous exchange rate movements; strong moves within the United States to block Australian imports by new testing procedures; a deep recession in the United States leading to a drop in demand of 33 per cent; and farm inflation, as opposed to general inflation, in excess of 12.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The image of an industry under siege has been well and truly earned. It is a siege that the Fraser Government will not lift and a siege which in fact it supports. As a result today uncertainty and dismay pervade the industry. Uncertainty carries with it significant costs as a large element of guesswork begins to dictate important long term investment decisions. Many cattlemen in the few drought recovered areas face the daunting decision of whether to restock with cattle, invariably using expensive borrowed funds. Many others, particularly in areas most suited to cattle production, must look to ways of further increasing the productivity of their properties in order to stay in business. The major options of property amalgamation or further pasture or herd improvements involve substantial long term investment commitments. The latest savage attack by the Fraser Government is to continue its avoidance of its obligations in the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign. Yet it dresses up its failure to live up to its obligations as 'continuance of the program'. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the facts? Under the current funding arrangements, the future of the national brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign-BTEC-is in jeopardy. The campaign began in 1976 and 1984 has been established as the interim target for provisional freedom from the diseases. The current annual cost of the BTEC is estimated at $51m. The estimated cumulative cost at 30 June 1981 is $214m. The estimated cost of the eight-year program is $350m. Of the annual total, $17m consists of on-farm costs associated with the provision of facilities-for example, yards and fences-mustering, disruption to working schedules and often losses in stock condition and stock deaths. A further $21m a year is contributed by producers through livestock slaughter levies and State stamp duties. The Federal livestock slaughter levy has a current BTEC component of $3 per head. Average Commonwealth contributions amount to approximately $3m per annum-a total of $15.6m to 30 June 1981 or 7 per cent of the total costs since 1976. Federal funds are made available on the basis of compensation for the slaughter of infected animals. State contributions amount to 19 per cent of total costs since 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth's contribution to date is less than half that recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission in 1975. The IAC considered that a Commonwealth contribution equivalent to 15 per cent of the total costs was appropriate. The IAC report was accepted by the Federal Government. The shortfall in Commonwealth funds has occurred because the numbers of reactor cattle which must be slaughtered are far lower than anticipated. Also, the size of the national cattle herd has fallen from 33.4 million head in 1976 to 24.8 million head at March 1981. The number of cattle tested each year appears to have peaked and less reactors are expected to be slaughtered in the remaining 2 1/2 years of the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> In partial recognition of this situation, the Federal Government announced on 6 April that its existing subsidy on the slaughter of reactor cattle would be increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. However, because the number of reactor cattle will continue to fall as testing continues, the Commonwealth's real contribution is expected to fall to between 3 per cent and 4 per cent of the campaign's total costs. The shortfall in Commonwealth contributions to date has led to an industry debt of $22m to allow the campaign to continue. Rising interest rates will lift the debt to $29m by 1984. To cover interest repayments, there is significant pressure to increase the $3 a head disease eradication component of the slaughter levy by $1 a head. This pressure will increase as Federal contributions continue to fall. Progress to date in the BTEC has been satisfactory. The fact that producers have co-operated with the Commonwealth on the campaign is evident as the BTEC is ahead of schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The campaign has reached a critical stage. I referred to aspects of that a moment ago when I pointed to the position of farmers in a post-drought situation , given the present market. Resources now are devoted to reducing the incidence of the diseases in geographically difficult areas-for example, the Northern Territory, the Gulf of Carpentaria and the peninsula of Queensland-and the elimination of residual infection from the provisionally free areas. In provisionally free areas the low incidence of reactors and the high on-farm costs reduce the incentive for producers to continue their participation in the program. The costs of mustering and holding cattle for testing in these areas are commonly between $60,000 and $100,000 per property. Compensation is solely on the basis of payment for the slaughter of reactor cattle and may be as low as $300; that is, $150 a beast. </PARA>
<PARA> Producer incentive to participate in the scheme now is low, despite the introduction of section 75C of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Northern cattlemen are in an impossible position. They support the BTEC and wish it to continue. However, due to the depressed state of the beef industry, they are unable to continue to meet the high on-farm costs of mustering and holding cattle for testing. Many will have no option but to ignore Government directions to participate in the campaign. The Cattle Council of Australia and many other organisations are putting to the Government that some relief should be given in this matter and that the current industry debt of some $22m should be written off in the coming 1982-83 Budget. This would lift the Commonwealth's contribution to $37.6m to 30 June 1981 or approximately 17 per cent of the total costs. This would be consistent with the 1975 recommendation of the IAC. Absorption of the debt has been recommended by the National Farmers Federation and the Cattle Council of Australia in pre-Budget submissions. I think there is a very good case, if the Government can understand the situation of cattlemen, for giving some help in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that the cattle industry raises with me constantly is the fact that the existing meat security measures will soon need to be reviewed. The cost of the new meat security measures is being picked up by the Government until June. The direct cost of these measures is in the vicinity of $10m annually. This works out at about $3 a head and it consists of species testing and carton seals. The Government has been saying that once things settle down in the wake of the meat scandal it will look at relaxing some of the controls where they are not seen as absolutely necessary. However, this does not seem promising as the Americans dictated the arrangements in the first place and America is one of our main export markets. Security measures are applied across the board in such a way that there is an opportunity for duplication and wastage. In certain establishments, the risk of substitution is precluded because all operations take place under one roof. I refer to category A works, major export works, at which slaughter, processing and packing are all carried out at a single site. These works are owned by major exporters who are unlikely to risk their export chances by perpetrating some of the criminal acts that were perpetrated in Melbourne. Together they probably account for about 80 per cent of the export trade. Over the last two months I have inspected meat works in Western Australia , Queensland and New South Wales where this clearly occurs. Category B works are places where meat is taken from an abattoir to a cold store which is off the premises and category C works are boxing and freezing rooms only. There is no killing on the premises. Quite clearly, all the controls and meat security measures in force should continue to apply to that category. There is no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that the beef industry is raising is the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory and the live virus controversy. I do not suppose that this is the most appropriate time to talk about that, but again the industry is taking a very firm stance on that matter and reminding the Government that when the Geelong facility was first mooted and set up the Government gave a guarantee that no live foot and mouth virus would be introduced into the country. I am of the view that if we have a maximum security laboratory and the security is maximum there should be no inhibition about having a live virus in it. But I think the whole question of the maximum security laboratory needs to be looked at because there is a very active debate going on within the scientific community and between scientists and various officials in the Bureau of Animal Health, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other organisations. I think we need to have this question resolved as quickly as possible. At present there are many aspects of this debate which cause the Opposition concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the export control legislation. The Department of Primary Industry's inspection and export controls are currently carried out under the Customs Act 1901 and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act 1905. I think historically the Department of Primary Industry and Customs were in one department. That is going back quite a few years. The Customs Act aimed at clearing goods through Customs and the Commerce Act related only to the description of goods, ensuring that the label was correct. The inspection powers come from the Customs Act and they are inadequate for primary industry functions . The powers come from regulations grouped into 10 areas. Nine of them are repeated under each Act. For example, the Customs and Commerce Acts regulations relate to meat, fish, honey, dairy produce, canned and frozen fruits, vegetables , dried fruit, fresh fruit, fresh vegetables and general. I do not know what ' general' means. The Customs Act only is for grains. This includes wheat, oats, barley and sorghum. The proposals before the House, which the Opposition supports, is to move responsibility for all of these commodities to the Export Control Bill and give the responsibility for this legislation to the Minister for Primary Industry. At present the Minister has no responsibility in this area but the work is done in his Department. The only function of Customs officers is to sight the export permit. If these Bills go through, and I have no doubt they will, the 10 sets of regulations are expected to be rationalised into two. The provisions in the Export Control Bill resemble the provisions of two other Acts, in other words, the Customs and Commerce Acts. This Bill, when it becomes an Act , will allow technological change to be kept up with, it will increase the flexibility of the export inspection service and it will rationalise an inefficient process. The preventative provisions of the Bill will be provided through ministerial orders. A ministerial order is drafted within the Department , signed by the Minister and tabled in the House. After being subject to disallowance, it is then operational. I think this is a good practice because the use of ministerial orders will accelerate the process of changing, for example, export documentation and product standards. At the moment, in some ways , the Department more or less illegally keeps pace with administrative directions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Export Control Bill will supersede the Meat Export Penalties Act, the food or primary industry provisions under the Customs Act and the Commerce (Trade Descriptions) Act and allow falsification and misuse of inspection stamps provisions of the Meat Export (Penalties) Act to apply to all primary industry. The meat substitution scandal accelerated the review of inspection provisions of the Customs Act. I am informed that a proposal was put to the Minister along these lines prior to the meat scandal. I think this just only gets back to my very basic point that the way the Government operates with what can be called the rural establishment-the statutory marketing organisations and primary industry-leads in many cases to a failure to react to situations. I think it is something that the Government needs to take into account. As I see it, it is a very serious deficiency. Never to act until the industry is agreed is a recipe for not really getting on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> We could talk about several other matters concerning the beef cattle industry. There is the whole situation of carcass classification. For example, the Cattle Council of Australia-that organisation represents nearly all the beef producers- supports the mandatory introduction of a system of product description to be included in amendments to the Export Meat Regulations Act which I hope will be introduced in the next session. Significant progress is being made in this regard. The Cattle Council of Australia has informed me that it would like to see an extension of the subsequent proposal for export works to domestic abattoirs. Again, this whole question of carcass classification-the whole question of a national meat inspection service-has been far too long in the gestation stage. It seems to me that again the Minister and the Government have not been pushing as hard as they could for these very desirable measures to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cattle Council of Australia is also concerned about all of the amendments that are coming forward. It is concerned about the industrial situation, as are many of our exporters. It also is concerned about the animal welfare proposals. An inquiry on this matter, which is presently before the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, should be completed soon. At present, the Council is pushing mainly for the Government to write off the current industry debt of $22.5m to offset the short-fall in Commonwealth funding and to ease pressure for increases in the slaughter levy. It is seeking special initiatives towards the mustering and testing costs of producers in difficult areas to undertake an approved testing program. As I have pointed out, the campaign is being conducted in very difficult areas in the north of Australia and there is a need for the Government to take into account the distressed state of the cattle industry at present. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just a few concluding remarks. The Opposition does not oppose these Bills. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill, together with the Export Control Bill, strengthens the Corporation's powers and control over Australia's export meat trade. The Bill also enables the Corporation in certain circumstances to adopt the role of a sole trader or to limit the number of licensees that may trade with particular overseas markets. An argument is put in some areas that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation should be entrusted with 'sole trader' responsibilities in terms of acquisition and disposal of red meats in Australia. There is a parallel argument which, while allowing for private sector involvement in the marketing of meat within Australia, nonetheless insists that the AMLC should be the sole trader in terms of Australian meat exports. Neither of those scenarios is economically or administratively possible, and certainly not desirable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the bad publicity accruing to the meat industry because of the meat substitution issue late last year, the Australian meat industry, in its broadest terms, is one of high reputation and finely developed skills. We need to comment on that and to recognise it. Australia is the largest exporter of meat in the world. Australia has a livestock population which is free of the most serious stock diseases. Australia's processing plants are as modern and efficient as, and in some areas much more efficient than, any in the world. The meat industry is responsible for export earnings of about $1.5 billion. The meat industry employs directly some 85,000 people and indirectly a further 36,000. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a domestic meat distribution system of some 9,000 outlets, which is highly personalised and competitive and, because of its marketing expertise, is responsible for a continued high consumption pattern despite the problems created by repeated peaks and troughs in raw material supply and price. To have the sorts of powers that are enjoyed by the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wheat Board is just not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies now operating in the meat export business have built up an extensive world-wide marketing structure over the past 50 or 60 years. They have developed relationships of long standing with agents and importers in many countries and have also built up a level of staff expertise which would be impossible to replace. It would simply not be possible for the AMLC to duplicate the work which has been done by the meat companies over that period, yet duplicate such work it would have to if it were given the task of sole trader. What the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill does, effectively, is simply to give the Corporation the powers of sole trader, but only for specific purposes. As I have said, it is not valid to use analogies such as the Australian Wheat Board or the Australian Wool Corporation. Wheat and wool products, which essentially flow directly from farmers to processors, and which are not perishable, do not require the continuing ongoing marketing framework required by the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of high government intervention in meat prices and marketing is evidenced within the European Economic Community, where a history of intervention in one form or another has led to institutionalised subsidies for producers, continuing stockpiles, and high consumer prices. Of course, we live with the effects of that, with the EEC trading on third markets and engaging in dumping. </PARA>
<PARA> The meat industry is a volatile, narrow margin, high risk, capital-intensive and labour-intensive manufacturing and marketing operation. It is not the sort of area in which one would expect a statutory body or bureaucracy to have the necessary skills to operate efficiently on a continuing basis. There are 650 or so slaughtering establishments in Australia and about 260 export licences. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Minister's second reading speech he gave an example of the problem of dealing with countries which have a single meat buyer. He also referred in his speech to the Korean market. It is my information that several small exporters built up the Korean market, and then one rather larger meat exporter in Australia started coming in and cutting the price from underneath them. That is the sort of thing that we cannot tolerate. It is not in anyone's interest. I will not name the firms concerned, because that would not serve any useful purpose. But that is one of the things that this Bill sets out to stop. It is not in anyone's interest. It is certainly in the interest of the Australian beef industry that the AMLC has the powers that the Government is now giving to it. The Opposition does not oppose the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my pleasure to speak in support of the Bills. I do this on behalf of my constituents and of beef producers and processors in the industry throughout Australia. I believe that the Bills have many merits. Before starting, I must pull up the honourable member for Werriwa ( Mr Kerin). I know that leaders have cliches, and certainly Malcolm's is very apt to the industry today.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BF4">Mr IAN CAMERON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. The last time a Labor Government was in office, Mr Gough Whitlam's great saying was: 'You have never had it so good'. That is what he travelled the country telling us farmers. We did not take very kindly to that. Along with his colleagues-and I do not doubt that the honourable member for Werriwa was one of those-he proceeded to belt us with pick handles from then on, and to take away from us every incentive that we ever had to produce. Of course, we saw the obvious downturn in the economy and the tremendous swing away from the support that the Labor Party had in the bush. I do not believe that my generation, certainly, will give that support back unless the Labor Party changes its attitude. We have set about doing this. We have given primary producers all sorts of incentives to carry on and produce. These Bills will help to do that, because obviously they will help us, we hope, to get a higher price in the markets to which we intend to export.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also point out to the honourable member for Werriwa that there is nothing wrong with negotiations with those in industry. That is how we should go about making amendments to legislation. There is no good reason-political, business or any other-for going ahead and introducing Bills and making laws for an industry when that industry is completely opposed to them. Obviously that is the Labor Party's position when in government. That is the way in which it would govern. It would set out, as it did previously, to belt down industries. That is not the attitude of those of us on the Government side of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out to the honourable member that the Australian Meat and Live- stock Corporation Amendment Bill that we are discussing applies only in particular markets; it is to give the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation sole trading rights in particular markets. It is not all markets, but only those that have a single purchase operation set up. It is also under the jurisdiction of the Minister. It is most important that before the AMLC can go into any of these markets as a single seller it must have the Minister's consent. Therefore, there will be very few markets where the provisions of this Bill will be used. Korea is one of them. I will come to that matter later. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Werriwa mentioned, the beef industry today is not in a particularly strong position. The AMLC is made up of a chairman and 10 members representing it throughout Australia. All in all, it has done a very good job in representing the industry. We have seen a downturn in the industry, as the honourable member for Werriwa mentioned, of 3.9 per cent, to 24.8 million head of cattle, and this continues. While our markets, particularly those overseas, continue to decline, obviously beef producers will not continue to produce beef at a loss. That is what is happening. Cattle slaughterings are down by 4.5 per cent to 6.999 million head for the year ended June 1981. Total red meat production also fell by 1.1 per cent to 2.307 million tonnes. Exports were down 5.1 per cent. Unfortunately, this is the crux of the industry's problem. While our export market is depressed-it is a worldwide problem-we are not receiving a profitable price for our product. Mutton shipments, of course, are up by 30 per cent. We exported 186,000 tonnes to Japan, Korea and the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> I must give full marks to my Government and to the Minister who was involved for recently sending a delegation of union members and exporters involved in live cattle production and the processing of red meat to the Middle East to look at the markets there to see whether we can maintain our access to those markets. The unions have this ridiculous concept that we should be selling only X number of live sheep or X number of processed carcasses which of course is a ridiculous concept to adopt. The more we are able to export, the more sheep and cattle we will breed and the better off everybody will be, not just union workers but everybody throughout the community. That is the attitude of honourable members on this side of the House. I only wish that the Labor Party would adopt a similar sort of attitude. Let us get on with the job so that we can boost our exports. Surely today one of the main problems that we have in our balance of trade position is that our level of exports is way down. We are running a $5 billion to $6 billion trade deficit. Our living standards will fall if this trend continues. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, per capita consumption of beef in Australia has risen. We know that the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) is a great expert on our new system of weights and measurement; so let me point out to him that per capita consumption of beef stands at 48.1 kilograms which is equal to 105.82 lb. They are the latest consumption figures. There has been an increase in consumption because the price of beef is down. A good deal of joy was expressed at the static level of the latest consumer price index figures. Most of the food producers-for example, wheat or beef producers-are responsible for maintaining the CPI level. Unfortunately, we tend to forget that someone has to pay for the fact that the index is static and in this case it is basically the beef producer . </PARA>
<PARA> Of the markets that have been mentioned, I said that Korea is the only true single market purchaser. As the honourable member for Werriwa has mentioned, this market is the reason for introducing the Bill. The AMLC had no power to enable sellers to have control of these markets. The overseas buyers did not want to deal with the AMLC. They are interested only in dealing with private processors. Of course, they were undercutting one another and they were forcing the price of beef down in the saleyards. Japan has a 90 per cent control of the LIPIC-the Livestock Industry Producers Corporation. The LIPIC gives 27 Japanese importers a price range at which to buy. If they move outside that range the LIPIC does not give them the go ahead to purchase. Therefore, Japanese prices are very much controlled. Egypt is another country with which we have had trouble. It has several buying agencies and it operates in a collusive bargaining price situation. Iran is another country with which we have done a lot of trade. That country has government buying agencies and a general trading corporation. It can be seen that this is a problem that we have been up against. I believe that the industry has been seeking this sort of change for a number of years and at long last we have seen fit to bring it about. I think all those who are involved in the beef industry will benefit from this change, not just the producers and processors. </PARA>
<PARA> The main buyers of red meat are the United States of America, which is No. 1, Japan which is No. 2, Korea which is No. 3 and the Middle East which is No. 4. It is those countries that we are basically dealing with. The European Economic Community has tremondous intervention stocks and it has been subsidising beef sales and competing very strongly against us in some of our Middle East markets. Unfortunately we hope that the Argentine situation may help us in our beef trade , but maybe this will not happen for some time. If that unfortunate conflict continues obviously the European stockpile will run down and European countries will seek more supplies. We hope they will then come to Australia and buy more of our beef. This would give us better access to markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill contains a provision for giving the Corporation power to trade in futures. I believe that is a very good concept. Today futures trading is one of the modern methods of trading and for arriving at a price. Up until now the Corporation has not had this power to engage in this trading. I believe this power will be of benefit to us. The penalties provided under this Bill have been increased up to $100,000. This was brought about by the meat scandal. Unfortunately for us, only two or three crooks-call them what you like-in the processing industry brought about this scandal. The Government certainly is not to blame. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and his Department are certainly not to blame. Unfortunately , these individuals have brought discredit upon our industry. We face an enormous task in getting back to the position of respect which we previously held. I believe this legislation will help in this respect and certainly the penalties will be a big deterrent to anybody else thinking about getting into those sorts of rackets. I do not believe any of these sorts of people would look forward to spending time in gaol for about five years or facing a fine of $100, 000. </PARA>
<PARA> The Export Control Bill and the Export Control (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill relate to the charges that have had to be increased and also, as the honourable member for Werriwa has indicated, they cover other charges that are levied. While I have the opportunity I just want to mention a few other things that I believe the beef industry is seeking. One, of course, is a single meat inspection service. The Minister has been trying for a number of years to bring about a single service. He has not had a good deal of success as yet. He is working on a system in Victoria. I hope he is able to come up with a good system there, because if he can obviously it will spread throughout Australia. We certainly need a single inspection service. We beef producers in Queensland have believed for many years that th States could adopt a single service. If the Minister is able to give us a good program in Victoria perhaps we would be prepared to accept it. The carcass classification scheme is going ahead. We have spent millions of dollars investigating a carcass classification scheme and what it can do for the industry. In fact, well over $10m has been spend over the last 10 to 14 years. The greatest criticism I have is that we have not got on with the job. I believe at long last we will be able to achieve a single service. An amount of $320,000, I think, has been allocated for continuing the search for a carcass classification scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, papers are being circulated within the Australian Agricultural Council and amongst the other people involved in the AMLC and State governments with a view to setting up a manual system, which I have always advocated. I believe that a similar system operates now in abattoirs where meat is sold on a weight and grade basis. There is always someone to weigh the livestock and more or less to grade cattle into what is thought to be the right grading. A manual carcass classification system would go a little further in that it would sex, age and take a fat depth reading on the carcass. Once we get that into place the next thing will be to have a grading system out of the cold stores and a colour grading system into the retail outlets, which I hope will boost the market for beef. We recently introduced this system in Queensland, where various grades of beef, be they lot-fed or grass-fed animals, are being dyed a particular colour. Not all the meat is dyed, it is just a line running down the side of the carcass . As the Minister said, pork producers in Australia have gone a long way to upgrading the marketing of their product. I believe we can use them as an example. The wool industry is using core testing and selling with computers. This is the way to go in marketing, and this is the way beef has to go. I cannot see any other way we can go except by a classification and grading system. </PARA>
<PARA> Tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication has also been mentioned tonight. I would certainly like to press the case of beef producers and support their cause in asking our Government to pay out the $23m that is presently owed by the industry. The industry certainly cannot afford that sort of money. It is being asked to pay higher inspection charges. It presently pays a $3 a head levy which is raising approximately $21m towards the scheme. I must point out that it is a national scheme, it is something that has been done in the national interest, and it is something that our export markets have demanded. If we do not do it, we will lose markets overseas, and we certainly cannot afford to do that. It will make our beef much more disease free and it will also increase the fertility of our herds, which I believe is most desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the Government that because the industry is down at this stage, it should offer an export incentive to boost the exports and the overseas markets. The beef industry did receive export incentives for a very short time, but they were quickly dropped. I believe now is the time for us to reintroduce them. The Anderson Meat Packing Co. Pty Ltd has two meat works, one at Roma in my electorate of Maranoa, and one at Wallangarra, which is right on the border. That meat company is presently running at a loss of $4m. I think as a government we ought to be looking at ways and means of boosting beef exports. Another problem that we have not only in the beef industry but also in other industries is interest rates. I have very much pleasure in supporting these three Bills before us tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not oppose the Australian Meat and Live- stock Corporation Amendment Bill, although I do have some reservations about it. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation was described by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) as a comfortable club. I think 'incestuous' would probably be a more apt description. It does worry me that the Corporation in this legislation has been given this excessive power, because we see that with all these statutory bodies, power tends to gravitate to the National Country Party, with all the incompetence and attendant corruption that that will engender.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sole-trader power causes me some concern for the reasons that the honourable member for Werriwa mentioned. In this country we have some excellent stock as well as a very good level of stock management and, I believe, a very good level of meat processing. But I do think we have very bad marketing. Anyone who has tried to buy Australian meat in South East Asia, will testify to this. The New Zealand and American meat is usually nice and chilled and ours is solid frozen lumps, certainly not the way to get the top end of the market. As an aside, I point out that I was approached by a leading cattleman in my electorate , who also lacks a substantial income from buying and selling rabbits. He complained to me that his rabbit business had just about been stopped because the freezers were full of Australian beef destined for the overseas market and had been for some time. Anyone would know what deep freezing for any length of time does to the quality of meat. It certainly does not enhance it and it is something that should be discouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> The right of the Corporation to determine who will be the carrier-although it has had this power for some time-causes me some concern because it does leave the way open for the old club atmosphere which engenders at the least inefficiency and at the worst corruption. We have had a situation in the Kimberleys where a carrier from the Broome area offered to carry meat at a much lower rate than the carrier nominated by the Corporation. The Corporation's argument was that it had to take an overall national view and that it was cheaper to give it to one carrier. This is the sort of assertion that it is almost impossible to determine, but I would be very doubtful of an assertion like that, particularly as it was said that the meat was carried from a very remote area. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Ian Cameron) had some very interesting comments to make. The last time I heard him make a speech he was lauding the virtues of retrospective legislation. I do not know whether it extended to retrospective legislation in respect of taxation. I suspect not, but to be consistent, of course, it would have to. He mentioned the year 1974 when the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, told farmers that they had never had it so good. In retrospect I am sure a lot of farmers would agree with him. Since then what have we had? The honourable member for Maranoa mentioned in his speech that abattoirs are closing in his electorate and that the Anderson meat works, which is also in his electorate, is in a very bad way. I have a very soft spot for Roma. I bought stud cattle from there and they were very excellent animals. They thrived very well under rather harsh conditions. It grieves me to think of Roma being under this sort of stress. Whose fault is it? It is certainly not the Government's, said the honourable member for Maranoa. This is no surprise. This Government has never taken the responsibility for anything. It is very quick to take the credit but it is never responsible. If we listen to honourable members opposite we would think that this Government has never made any mistakes and if it has they would certainly not be its mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think the rural producers of Australia will cop this sort of nonsense any longer. It is a cop-out and I think it will be seen by a large number of rural producers to be just that. I find in my electorate that although one might say there is certainly a political-I suppose one has to use a euphemism in a situation like this-predilection to conservative politics, I find that more and more farmers' organisations are getting in contact with me and other Australian Labor Party members and asking for our opinions and advice. I am finding a very receptive audience. I do not take credit for that. I am merely benefiting from years of Liberal-National Country Party muddling and I am quite glad to be the beneficiary. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that the most important facet of this Bill is the very substantial increase in penalties which it imposes. It is obvious that under the old Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 a fine of $100 was not going to be much of a deterrent, but we do see some substantial increases in penalties in this Bill. Proposed new section 50 states:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The holder of an export licence who, without reasonable excuse (proof of which lies upon him), contravenes or fails to comply with a condition to which the licence is subject is guilty of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) An offence against this section is punishable, on conviction, by a fine not exceeding $100,000 or imprisonment for a period not exceeding 5 years, or both. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly terms like that should deter people, providing we can be sure that prosecution will be very stringent and not the sort of thing we have seen in some of the other scandals that we have had in the rural industry. I hope that this new Bill will put greater sense of purpose into the industry and is an attempt to clean it up and make it more business-like. The Opposition does not oppose this legislation, but I will certainly be watching with great interest developments in the industry to see what effect the legislation does have on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add very briefly to this debate. The processing industry, in which I declare an interest, and the exporters support this legislation in general, particularly in view of the fact that they have been appalled by the damage done to the reputation of the bulk of the industry, which is very high overseas, by a few cheats in recent times. The point must be made, however, that there is some unease in the industry that the legislation could be misused by a government of a different persuasion, because it does give very strong powers to government and to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. It is in that context that I raise one section in particular- proposed section 16A. In the context of one running the risk of losing one's export licence, that section says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . unless the contrary intention appears, 'relevant offence' means-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) an offence against this Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an offence against any other law of the Commonwealth, or against a law of a State or Territory that is punishable by imprisonment for a period of 12 months or more; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) any other offence against a law of the Commonwealth, or of a State or Territory, that is prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously there is no objection to parts (a) and (c) but part (b) in effect means that when someone is fined under the law of a State relating to, for example, driving with a prescribed amount of alochol in his blood, and in fact pays a fine but the alternative punishment in the event of failure to pay that fine is imprisonment for a period of 12 months or longer, that person is liable to lose his export licence under the very broad terms of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Amendment Bill. I would assume that it is not the intention of the Government-that has been conveyed to me elsewhere-that that sort of consequence should emerge. I would expect that in any instructions that the Government might convey to the AMLC, or any recommendations about the manner in which this Bill should be interpreted, there would be a very clear indication to the AMLC that such offences would not be regarded as those that should lead to the removal of an export licence. I am certain that within the jurisdiction of the present Government there would be no such intention and no such effort. I would only hope that any subsequent government would maintain that kind of reasonable approach to these very wide powers that are being given to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He said it once in Warragul and members of the National Country Party have indulged ever since in saying that he said that all the time. To them an even worse act of the Prime Minister of the day, or the government of the day, was to take off the superphosphate subsidy. Nothing is dearer to the hearts of the farmers and graziers of this country than the superphosphate subsidy. It is very dear to their hearts. We must say, even with all this great affection that the farmers have for the subsidy, that the Government itself is not really wedded to the concept of fertiliser subsidies as such. It is not really fair dinkum. The Government is really taking the gutless approach and letting the subsidy fade away. The subsidy stands at $12 a tonne for superphosphate and $20 a tonne for nitrogenous fertilisers. I give the Government a bit of a bouquet because the IAC recommended that the nitrogenous fertilisers subsidy be phased out but the Government has kept it as $20 a tonne, which now amounts to 3 per cent of the cost of a tonne of urea or whatever nitrogenous fertiliser is being used. In the mid-1960s the superphosphate bounty, at $12 a tonne or whatever it was, amounted to about 23 per cent of the price of a tonne of superphosphate. It is now down to about 11 per cent of the price. It was up to 44 per cent in 1970. So the Government is not really interested in maintaining fertiliser subsidies as such or maintaining any particular level for them. The Government has simply taken the gutless way out and let inflation erode them away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But there is still an equity argument and many of the arguments raised in previous debates are there to be raised again. The majority of the benefits goes to those who do not really need it. The subsidy, which now costs overall between $55m and $60m, flows mainly to large users of superphosphate. Other schemes inequitably advantage larger producers and perhaps there is no reason why there should not be measures that advance larger primary producers. There is a tax call-back. If the affairs of a large producer are so arranged that he does pay tax, the subsidy goes out on one hand and 48 per cent or 60 per cent of it comes back on the other. In evidence to the IAC it has been pointed out that the subsidy has hardly any effect in encouraging the use of superphosphate-which was the whole idea when it was re-introduced in the fifties and sixties. Some form of subsidy has been paid, I believe, since as long ago as 1931. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been pointed out, there are distortionary influences upon the subsidy being of general benefit to the rural sector. Obviously, only the farmers who use it get any benefit at all. Also, there are regional differences within a particular industry. The sheep industry in the semi-arid area does not derive much benefit from the superphosphate subsidy. As I have said, the largest gains go to the people who use it the most. </PARA>
<PARA> A general assessment of what one might call the more independent submissions made to the IAC indicates that there is not much justification for continuing its use, based on the original mid-1960s criterion, that is, the stimulation of production. However, on the second-best criteria, the IAC and others have stated that it should be continued, in order to reduce the impact of protection that is given other industries; also, that it has a marginal welfare benefit. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and the South Australian Department of Agriculture took that approach. The Victorian Department of Agriculture and the New South Wales Department of Agriculture did not make policy submissions. The BAE showed that fertiliser use by farmers is not sensitive to change in price; that assistance has a minimal effect on fertiliser consumption. The IAC said that the subsidies were not stimulating production in cereals and horticulture but were stimulating production, in some areas, for some other commodities-for example, the use of phosphate in higher rainfall areas, its use by the South Australian wool and wheat industries, and the use of nitrogenous fertilisers in the growing of sugar cane, in Queensland and northern New South Wales in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The predominant beneficiaries of fertiliser assistance are the efficient, low cost, broad acre cropping and grazing industries of Australia. The equity of distribution, as I have already pointed out, has never really been properly assessed but in 1973-74 a limited analysis was made of usage in one State. This showed that two farmers used some 5,000 tonnes of superphosphate each but that 18,500 other farmers averaged only 12 tonnes each. The latter derived a magnificent benefit of $144. It is unlikely that that situation has changed. I do not know what the figures were for the middle group-I believe the study was undertaken in South Australia-but there was a large difference. I accept the BAE 's second-best argument that, given the levels of assistance to high-cost industries in the economy, it could not be concluded that removal of bounty assistance would generate an improvement in resource allocation, national income or social welfare; further, that levels of assistance to the rural sector by way of fertiliser subsidies should be retained, although not necessarily in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Department of Agriculture expressed a preference that both be discontinued but only on the prior condition that other forms of assistance to rural industries be introduced such that the overall level of assistance would be sufficient to compensate other rural industries for the disproportionate costs associated with assistance to other industries, particularly those engaged in manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC, in its recommendations, made two judgments: Firstly that the current effect of assistance is positive and so should continue for now; secondly, that there will be future reductions in the general level of assistance-one hopes-so the fertiliser bounty and subsidy should cease in three years to maintain the current balance in the economy. I would not really hold my breath while awaiting the lowering of levels of protection or on guarantees being given by 1985; the Government will have to look at the subsidies again. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose to refer briefly to the summary and conclusions of the BAE, which point clearly to the fact that a valid second-best argument exists. The BAE stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The use of fertilisers by farmers has not been found to be sensitive to changes in its own price and the bounties have a minimal effect on fertiliser consumption. </PARA>
<PARA>It found also that there are now no economic grounds for maintaining the bounties in terms of the original objectives for the fertiliser subsidies. By itself, that conclusion implies that the subsidies should be discontinued. However, it was stated that on broader economic grounds, given the levels of assistance to high-cost industries in the economy, it could not be concluded that the removal of bounty assistance would generate an improvement in resource allocation, national income or social welfare. Indeed, the removal of fertiliser bounties could conceivably reduce national income and/or represent a departure from social welfare goals. In any case, the real cost of providing bounty assistance had declined and would continue to decline, owing to inflation, if the bounties were maintained in their present form. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence required in order to decide whether the removal of the fertiliser bounties would improve or reduce national income does not currently exist. In view of the complexity of the issues, it is not likely that such evidence will be forthcoming. At the same time, alternative assistance provisions for the rural sector which could improve national income and welfare may exist; but, by and large, no one can point to them very clearly. The BAE, in its submission, made some suggestions concerning possible areas of assistance and criteria for the evaluation of assistance measures. It centred, I believe, on the provision of more adjustment assistance, a Commonwealth commitment to the soil conservation campaign and things of that nature. However, there is no way in which any one measure can affect such a large group of farmers. The BAE said that these broader issues implied that the level of assistance to the rural sector by way of fertiliser subsidies should be retained, although not necessarily in their present form. Following these findings the BAE concluded that:</PARA>
<PARA> Fertiliser subsidies in their present form should be discontinued but the aggregate level of assistance so afforded the rural sector should be retained, with consideration being made as to the most appropriate means of providing this assistance that might promote national income and welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> Or, if better means of providing assistance cannot be found, then, as long as high levels of protection exist for high-cost industries, the fertiliser subsidies be retained. </PARA>
<PARA>I have gone through the summary rather at length and I emphasise it. The BAE was at pains to point out that it is the second-best argument. Also it was the second-best argument that the IAC emphasised in its recommendations. The Government has picked up that argument. Those are exactly the reasons why the Opposition feels that the continuation of the subsidies should not cease at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support these Bills. I was interested to hear that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) believes that the subsidies should not be dropped at this time. I only hope that the Australian Labor Party has learnt its lesson from the early 1970s. I hope not just that it has learnt a political lesson, but also that it looks at the reasons why these superphosphate and nitrogenous fertiliser bounties are so important to agriculture and to the production of food in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The net value of food production in 1980-81 fell by 27 per cent in real terms and, according to the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, will fall another 11 per cent in 1981-82. Much of this loss has occurred because of a generally depressed outlook, on the demand side, for agricultural products which, in turn, reflects the difficult international conditions. In the last few months Australian primary producers in many industries have seen their competitive edge falling due to the exchange rate pressures and/or to the inflation rate which, for the farm sector, has been running at up to 50 per cent higher than the general domestic inflation rate. It is for these reasons that this Bill is most important as far as Australia's productive capacity in agriculture is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> As the second reading speech of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown) stated, the purpose of the Bill is to extend the operation of the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy and the phosphate fertiliser bounty schemes at current rates for a further three-year period until 30 June 1985. This assistance in regard to fertiliser, which is due to expire on 30 June of this year, was introduced in the mid-1960s to stimulate the increased use of fertilisers as a means of expanding agricultural production. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industries Assistance Commission recently submitted to the Government its report on continuing assistance in regard to the use in Australia of nitrogenous fertilisers and phosphate fertilisers. Following an examination of that report the Government decided, quite rightly I believe, to accept the IAC's recommendation that the current schemes be extended for a further three years. However, the Government has also quite rightly decided to defer a decision on a further recommendation. (Quorum formed). Once again, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) has indicated his disdain for any legislation introduced in this place which provides any benefit for people who live in country areas or who are involved in the agricultural sector. Before he interrupted the proceedings of this House I was pointing out how the Government has rightly decided to defer a decision on the IAC's recommendation that assistance should be terminated after 30 June 1985. The existing subsidy rate of $20 a tonne on contained nitrogen and the existing bounty of $12 a tonne on single strength superphosphate, or $138 a tonne on the available phosphorous content of other phosphatic fertilisers, will continue to be payable for the next three years. The cost of this assistance is estimated to involve a relatively constant budgetary outlay of from $50m to $60m. </PARA>
<PARA> Many factors influence the productivity of Australian agriculture. One factor is the skill that the Australian farmer is able to develop through his own efficiency. The other has been the ability of the Australian farmer to adapt rapidly to change. Chemical farming and the use of weedicides have been very important factors in the continual increase in productivity in agricultural production in this country. Of course, the use of mechanisation and technology has also contributed very much to agricultural expansion. I was interested to read in a newspaper yesterday that the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) had said that country people and the National Country Party had no knowledge or application of the use of technology. I submit that the Australian farmer has been the one person in this country who has been able to adapt very quickly to the very rapid technological change which has taken place in his particular area of production. </PARA>
<PARA> Better plant varieties and improved species have also added to the agriculturists' capacity to produce. Along with all of these new improvements there is no doubt that the use of fertiliser has been one of the most outstanding contributing factors to the increasing production in Australian agriculture. Most Australian soils are deficient in phosphorous and nitrogen in that potential yields of crops and pastures usually cannot be fully realised without the addition of the phosphatic nitrogen and sulphur status. In all these areas our soils are low. Large areas are also deficient in potassium and trace elements such as copper, zinc and molybdenum. In 1978-79 an amount of 1.5 million tonnes of superphosphate was applied to pastures in lucerne. This accounted for 57 per cent of total superphosphate use in that year. Approximately 39 per cent, or one million tonnes, was applied to cereal crops, of which 0.6 million tonnes were applied to wheat. Approximately 30 per cent of the superphosphate used in Australia in 1978-79 was applied in Western Australia ; about 21 per cent was applied in New South Wales; 24 per cent was applied in Victoria and 19 per cent was applied in South Australia. Wheat and other grain crops account for a little under half of the total Australian consumption of fertiliser nitrogen. The other major use is in sugar cane. Sugar cane accounts for some 25 per cent of total consumption of nitrogenous fertiliser used. This is a most important additive to the productive capacity of that industry. In 1979, 46 per cent of Australia's fertiliser nitrogen was used in Queensland; 24 per cent was used in Western Australia; 19 per cent was used in New South Wales, and 7 per cent was used in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa mentioned that the removal of the bounty by the Whitlam Government in the early 1970s did not contribute to smaller uses of superphosphate and reduced production. I challenge that statement. The IAC report stated that in the mid-1970s the use of phosphatic fertilisers fell, coinciding with the removal of the bounty on superphosphate at the end of 1974 and also with the general increase in fertiliser prices. I believe that this effect is carried through even today. At that time it coincided with a drop in the economic situation in the dairy industry. Dairy farmers tended not to use superphosphate because of the reduced benefit of the bounty. Many of the dairying areas of Australia are still feeling that effect. I am also very pleased to support the proposed amendments to this Bill. They propose to provide both a subsidy on locally produced phosphate fertilisers at the same rates and for the same period as was proposed by the Bill to be provided by the extended bounty and a subsidy on imported phosphate fertilisers at those rates and for that period. </PARA>
<PARA> While we do not import very much fertiliser into this country, I believe some of the figures which I am about to give clearly indicate the benefits that Australian agriculturists can obtain by having some competitive element introduced into fertiliser use. For example, the landed United States of America price of fertiliser into Australia in 1979 was $205; in 1980 it was $219 and in 1981 it was $187. At the same time the local price of phosphatic triple strength super fertiliser in 1978 was $136 a tonne; in 1979 it was $140 a tonne; in 1980 it was $177 a tonne and in 1981 it was $214 a tonne. That is a significant difference between the landed imported price and the landed local price. I believe these amendments will bring about a reduced price in fertilisers in this country due to increased competition. </PARA>
<PARA> The world is desperately short of food and fibre. In the 1800s agricultural produce had to feed 900 million people throughout the world. Today there are 4, 000 million people in the world and there are fewer farmers to meet that need. By the end of the century the world population will have doubled. I believe the agricultural sector has a major responsibility to meet this desperate shortage of food and fibre. I support the Bill. I have no doubt that this super bounty and the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty will provide an incentive and will allow Australian agriculturists to meet their responsibilities towards the increasing demand for world food. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of the amendments which are being circulated in my name is to replace the phosphate fertilisers bounty, currently payable on locally produced fertilisers under the Phosphate Fertilisers Bounty Act 1963, with a subsidy which will be payable on both locally produced and imported phosphatic fertilisers. The possible extension of this fertiliser assistance to cover imports was foreshadowed in my speech introducing the amending Bill on 27 April 1982. The extended assistance will ensure that farmers will have adequate access to fertilisers from any source at competitive prices and also receive the full benefit of the Government's fertiliser assistance. The proposed subsidy rates will be exactly the same as the current rates of bounty. Those rates are $12 per tonne of single strength superphosphate or $138 per tonne on the available phosphorous content of other phosphatic fertilisers. </PARA>
<PARA> The subsidy in respect of locally produced phosphate fertilisers will be payable in respect of goods which are sold by the producer beween 1 July 1982 and 30 June 1985 for use in Australia as a fertiliser or which are used by the producer in that period in the production of fertiliser mixture for use in Australia. The subsidy in respect of imported phosphate fertilisers will be payable in respect of goods which are imported during that period and which, also in that period, are sold for use, or used by the importer in Australia as a fertiliser or are used by the importer in the production of a fertiliser mixture for use in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In deciding to extend the eligibility for benefits under the scheme to imports, the Government considered the situation of Australian fertiliser manufacturers who receive a measure of assistance from the current arrangements. In this regard the Government has accepted the Industry Assistance Commission's view that the extension of fertiliser assistance to cover imported phosphatic fertilisers would not be likely to lead to a significant reduction in the local manufacture of these fertilisers. The IAC considered that single strength superphosphate produced in Australia had a significant price advantage over potential imports. The IAC also found that domestic production is efficient in that output is generally competitive at world prices. Currently, Australian manufacturers produce virtually all of Australia's phosphatic fertiliser requirements including high analysis types. I commend those amendments. </PARA>

There will be sackings and resignations and the Government wants to get out of the House. There is not ample time to debate any topic. Even in the defence debate yesterday the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) was allowed only 15 minutes to talk about something as serious as defence. Nowadays in the Parliament we do not have adequate debate. The managers of business on both sides of the House restrict debate all the time. Now we are debating amendments which were given to us today. The Australian Labor Party is supposed to take these on board without consideration. We have not had time to talk to all the fertiliser manufacturers in this country to find out exactly what the situation is. The draft we were given even had alterations made by pen. That shows how much of a rush the Government is in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us put that aside and look at what the Government is proposing. A subsidy is assistance on imports, payable on domestic and imported products. A bounty is assistance payable on domestic production only and that is what has prevailed. Currently nitrogenous fertiliser assistance is a subsidy and the phosphate fertiliser assistance is a bounty. What the Government wishes to do is to rewrite the phosphate legislation to call it a subsidy so that the imported superphosphate can receive the present level of assistance of $12 a tonne. The National Farmers Federation has been pushing for this as it says that it will make superphosphate cheaper. I accept that it has used arguments that indicate that this is so. But I think there are quite a few other arguments that question seriously what the actual situation is. For example, the National Farmers Federation, in putting the case to Government, used only the last 12 months' figures. In a moment I will seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table that shows that over the last four or five years the price of imports has been more expensive than the locally produced product. The imports will be double and triple strength superphosphate because of the freight advantage. About 80 per cent of phosphate used in Australia is single strength superphosphate. The position varies from State to State. The trend appears to be towards high analysis double and triple strength and compounds. Single strength superphosphate has a higher sulphur content than other high analysis fertilisers and Australian soils are said to have sulphur deficiencies. This is said to be a predominant reason for the dominant use of single strength superphosphate in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has already said, the Industries Assistance Commission, has stated that it does not see floods or dollops-whatever is the appropriate word-of superphosphate being imported if assistance is extended to imports. But the IAC did not propose this because it saw assistance being reduced and administrative costs in extending it not justified for the short term. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take as an example one firm that may be affected by this decision. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) has been agitating on behalf of his constituents because Adelaide &amp; Wallaroo Fertilizers Ltd employs 800 people in South Australia at Wallaroo, Port Adelaide and Port Lincoln. Many of those constituents drink at the Colac Hotel which is a watering hole well known to the honourable member for Port Adelaide. The Wallaroo company does not have a high analysis plant and it would cost $10m to build a phosphoric acid plant. In 1981, of the company's sales of 650,000 tonnes of superphosphate, 10,000 tonnes was triple strength, which it got from interstate. We can look at the impact that imports could have on that one company. One ship load of, say, double strength would be 20,000 tonnes of superphosphate. That would produce 40,000 tonnes of single strength superphosphate. That would mean a decrease in single strength production in South Australia. For that firm, that would mean a 6 per cent decrease in production and something like a 26 per cent decrease in profitability. That is the reason for our concern. As I have said, we have not had time to go to other local manufacturers such as CSBP &amp; Farmers Ltd in Western Australia, Australian Fertilizers Ltd in New South Wales, Pivot in Victoria, Consolidated Fertilizers Ltd in Queensland and Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd in Tasmania. I do not know what the impact will be on those firms. I know that as far as Wallaroo is concerned it could be in a bit of a bind. That is why we ask the Minister whether this matter has been considered thoroughly or whether he is simply responding to the National Farmers Federation case and request. The analysis of the United States-Mexican Gulf prices for the last four years or so shows that in only 20 of those months could superphosphate have been imported cheaper. I seek leave to incorporate that table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we can say that the NFF underestimated handling and distribution costs. But there is nothing to stop farmers importing. There is no need to extend the assistance. It is only 11 per cent of what they say is a high price anyway. The NFF price information indicates that even without assistance farmers are still better off importing. But what will happen if Adelaide and Wallaroo import superphosphate and not buy interstate? Will the producers be better off with fluctuating or stable fertilisers prices? What will the costs of converting super bounty to subsidy be? What disruptive effects will there be on local manufacturers?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The extension of this bounty or subsidy is for three years, until 1985. There are now contracts with Christmas Island which have been signed for five more years so that rock phosphate supplies to Australia are not in doubt. The Australian Government underwrote those contracts. It pays if we do not buy. Very little high analysis fertiliser will be imported in the next six months as it will have to be stored. What will the overseas price be by November? Since 1978, as already shown in the table, until early 1981, Australia's primary producers benefited substantially from buying domestically produced superphosphate and not being subject to the international market. If imports are encouraged by the extension of fertiliser assistance to imported superphosphate, this will disrupt the profitability of Australian manufacturers and it will encourage Australian manufacturers to import which will mean that people will be put out of work in Australia. It will also jeopardise, to some degree, existing distribution and supply systems and Australian primary producers will have to accept international prices for superphosphates. These prices have been volatile in the last four years. Farmers will still want a reliable supply when imports are uneconomic. However, fertiliser manufacture has a high fixed cost component. Manufacturers will import when prices are cheap and the current agreements between the six Australian manufacturers will finish. Indeed, these have more or less stabilised prices, although some instability has been upwards. So what we are saying is that the profitability of companies may be in jeopardy. Farmers may use more high anlaysis fertiliser due to the price difference, thus exacerbating the problem. As I said, there may be employment effects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition apologises. We are not 100 per cent clear on this matter. We know that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has a close and intense interest in fertiliser. Perhaps he can answer some of the questions we are putting to him because at this stage the Opposition is concerned about making the bounty a subsidy. We agree that it should be open and we agree with all of those arguments. But we are worried about the impact on Australia's manufacturers and the potential loss of jobs which could be inherent in this move. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has said, I do have an intense interest in this subject. I will be happy to answer the points that he has raised. With respect to the administrative matter to which he referred at the outset, I should say that there is certainly no intention to be discourteous to the Opposition. In fact, we were endeavouring to assist the Opposition by providing honourable members with an early copy of the proposed amendments. It is for that reason that the amendments have some alterations to them. However, the honourable member will find, and perhaps I could assist him in this regard, that there are printed copies of the amendments on the table. They are not altered in any way. They are available for the perusal of all honourable members and all honourable members can see the amendments that the Government proposes to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the specific matters that the honourable member has raised, may I say that the argument which really answers all of the separate matters that he raised is that there is no reason in logic that has been demonstrated to me as to why this assistance should not apply to imports. No reason has been advanced why there should be a different practice with respect to imports compared with the product manufactured within Australia. I would have thought, with respect, that the honourable member's own document which he incorporated in Hansard proved exactly the opposite of the contention that he was making. Although, as he quite rightly said, if we go back over the last few years we find, on his evidence, comparatively few months when the imported product was cheaper than the locally manufactured product, nevertheless, for each of the last nine months , on his own material, the imports were cheaper. The document that he has incorporated makes that plain for everyone to see. That position exists in respect of each of the nine months. </PARA>
<PARA> May I say with respect to the honourable member's very commendable concern for the viability of local manufacturers that this matter was, of course, investigated by the Industries Assistance Commission. It came to the conclusion which is set out on page 57 of its report on phosphate and nitrogenous fertilisers. I will not read out the whole sentence. I pick it up from where the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Commission considers that removal of fertilizer assistance or its extension to imported phosphatic fertilizers-</PARA>
<PARA>And I emphasise 'or its extension to phosphatic fertilizers'-</PARA>
<PARA>Would not be likely to lead to a significant reduction in the local manufacture of these fertilizers. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if this reduction could be shown to be significant, it has not been demonstrated that fertilizer manufacture should be shielded from import competition or that consumption assistance is an appropriate means of achieving this. </PARA>
<PARA>The point was addressed by the IAC in its report and that is the answer that the IAC gave. With respect, that is a persuasive answer which in my view answers the mild criticisms of the honourable member for Werriwa and in my submission the material that we have put supports the fact that the Committee should accept the amendments proposed by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will provide an exemption from income tax for income derived by a new company that is being formed to take over the Australian Wool Testing Authority as a going concern and to continue the Authority's functions. The new company will be called the Australian Wool Testing Authority Ltd. The existing Wool Testing Authority is a body corporate established under the Wool Industry Act. Its income is presently exempt from tax. Following the Review of Commonwealth Functions carried out last year, the Government decided to transfer the Authority to the private sector and legislation authorising the transfer was subsequently passed by the Parliament. Members of the new company will be drawn mainly from bodies representative of the various sectors of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The exemption from income tax provided by the Bill will be limited to income derived by the company from carrying out functions of the kind that the Wool Testing Authority is authorised to carry out. Accordingly, the exemption will apply to income derived on or after 1 July 1982 from the testing of wool and other fibres and their products, and from the issuing of certificates and the making of reports on such tests. The exemption will correspondingly apply to income derived by the company from the investment of surplus income from its testing activities or of funds that are to be used in or in connection with its testing operations. An explanatory memorandum on the Bill is being made available to honourable members, and I commend the Bill very warmly to the House . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) deals with two important sets of amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act. The first proposes to alter the secrecy provisions of the Act to provide access to tax information to the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and any subsequent royal commission which is given appropriate terms of reference. In addition, amendments will be made to permit the supply of tax information to the Secretary to the Department of Housing and Construction for the purpose of the new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme. The second set of proposals provides further amendments related to the Government's housing package announced on the eve of the Victorian elections. These will allow a rebate of tax for home loan interest payments made after 1 July 1982 for owner- occupiers for the first five years in which they occupy their own homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I propose to deal initially with those amendments relating to the secrecy provsions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Section 16 of the Act prohibits any officer who acquires information under the provisions of the Act from disclosing or using that information except for the purposes of the Act and in its administration. Similarly, an officer cannot be required to produce in court any document or information relating to tax matters. The penalties associated with breaches of this section are quite severe. Any officer who discloses tax related information in breach of section 16 is liable under section 16 (6) to a fine of $500 or imprisonment for 12 months. There are, however, exceptions provided by section 16. Authorised persons are permitted to disclose tax information to a considerable list of persons, including persons acting under any State tax law, the Repatriation Commissioner, the Director-General of the Department of Social Services and of the Department of Health, the Commissioner for Employees Compensation, the Commonwealth Statistician, the Secretary to the Department of Defence and the Secretary to the Department of Education. While these exceptions basically involve persons administering programs under which Commonwealth moneys are outlayed, they do illustrate clearly that information obtained from tax records is disseminated quite widely and in this sense the proposed amendments do not break any new ground. Where they do break new ground, however, is in the co-operation which they presage between taxing authorities and authorities responsible for enforcing the laws of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, in contrast to many other nations, the income tax laws have operated in isolation from other laws and, because of the secrecy provisions, tax officials have not been able to assist other Commonwealth officers in their areas of operation. By contrast, in the United States of America, for example, the Internal Revenue Service is an important part of that country's crime detecting service. The Internal Revenue Service in the United States directs special attention to persons suspected of violating other Federal laws, especially in the narcotics area and, in co-operation with other Federal, State and local law enforcement bodies, the Internal Revenue Service is often responsible for providing documentation and other evidence essential to bring major offenders, especially drug offenders, to justice. </PARA>
<PARA> The urgent need for that sort of co-operation in Australia has been vividly pointed out by successive royal commissions in the recent past. The Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into drugs and the current Royal Commission into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia have both pointed to the wide powers available to the Taxation Commissioner in enforcing the Income Tax Assessment Act and the scope that this gives for access to information which, if available to the royal commissions, would have, or could have had, considerable bearing on their inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 161 (1) of the principal Act requires all persons to lodge with the Taxation Commissioner an annual tax return containing a full and complete statement of total income derived by him or her during the preceding year. The Act makes no distinction between income derived from legal sources and income derived from illegal sources. Just as an ordinary pay-as-you-earn taxpayer is obliged fully to disclose his income, so a drug trafficker, for example, is legally obliged to furnish an annual tax return with a full statement of his total earnings from drug trafficking. The Commissioner has wide powers to enforce these provisions to prevent tax avoidance and evasion. He can require a further or fuller return from any taxpayer under section 162, while section 263 gives him full and free access to all buildings, places, books, documents and other papers for any of the purposes of the Act. Furthermore, he may require information and documents from any person, government department or local authority or examine such persons on oath. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these statutory powers the Taxation Office and its investigators have developed considerable expertise in collecting information and in financial exercises directed at detecting tax avoidance and evasion. All of these factors must obviously combine to provide the Taxation Office with a wide range of information which could prove invaluable to crime investigators in Australia. As the Williams Royal Commission said in its final report, on page 372:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Information contained in an income tax return may be invaluable to a law enforcement agency which is investigating the illegal importation, production and trafficking of drugs. Discrepancies between the income which can possibly be earned from a disclosed legitimate source and the income actually enjoyed and manifest in accumulated assets and lifestyle may indicate the nature and extent of a criminal activity related to drug trafficking. Material contained in a return . . . may indicate sources of funds, lines of communications and associations, and open other lines of inquiry by, for example, identifying such things as bank accounts and similar matters.'</PARA>
<PARA> Confidential evidence received by the Commission, not from the Australian Tax Office, leads it to the view that many criminals in Australia do lodge income tax returns. The accuracy of the returns lodged is another matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Costigan Royal Commission into the ships painters and dockers expressed similar sentiments. Furthermore, both royal commissions stated that the Taxation Office had told them that they had been able to establish with reasonable certainty that particular persons had drug or other criminal connections but that section 16 of the tax Act prevented this information being made available to the royal commissions or the police. For instance, in the Williams Royal Commission report, again on page 372, the Commission had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Confidential evidence received by the Commission, from senior officers of the Australian Tax Office establishes that everyone where, in the course of their duties, the officers acquire information establishing with a high degree of certainty that a particular person the subject of their attention is or was a drug trafficker, the provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act preclude that information being made available to a police force. </PARA>
<PARA>Or to quote from the third interim report of the Costigan Royal Commission, tabled this year:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me a scandalous waste of time and money for the Taxation Commissioner not to supply information to the Commission in areas of common interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly the effectiveness of both royal commissions would have been considerably enhanced and less time spent pursuing more indirect routes of information had such information been forthcoming from the Taxation Office. The Taxation Office has apparently argued strongly against these proposed changes to section 16 because, so it is reported, in its view, confidentiality of tax records encourages criminal elements to submit returns, knowing they cannot be used as a basis for prosecution, thus ensuring that at least some tax is paid on this illegally-gotten income. If, the Taxation Office argument goes, criminals know that such information could be made available to royal commissions and thence the police, there is little likelihood of any of this income being declared and, accordingly revenue collections will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> While these arguments may have some merit, although I find it hard to accept the picture of hardened criminals breaking every rule in the book yet still submitting tax returns with anything like full and complete disclosure of their incomes-so did the Williams Royal Commission find that difficult to believe- still it is true that those arguments are more than outweighed by the social advantages of a more effective crackdown on organised crime, drug trafficking and large scale tax avoidance and evasion in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Williams Royal Commission strongly made the point that law enforcement in this country has been hampered by the lack of access by enforcement agencies to tax information and that the opportunity to increase the effectiveness of the enforcement against the drug trade, in particular, provided significant benefits to Australian society as a whole, more than outweighing objections to such a move. To quote the Commission's final report:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . law enforcement in Australia must be more effective . . . The key, the Commission is convinced, is co-operation and the co-ordinated and concerted direction of all available resources to areas in which they will be most effective. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments proposed by this Bill are a substantial step in that direction. Under these amendments, tax information provided to the royal commissions may be passed on to the Attorney-General if the Commission feels that the information indicates that Commonwealth laws may have been breached. In turn, the Attorney- General, if he considers it appropriate, may pass the information on to the Australian Federal Police for their use in internal investigations, but not for prosecutions. In this way the police will have the use of tax information in their efforts to detect law breakers but will have to rely on other evidence for conviction-certainly a large step forward on the present situation as far as law enforcement goes. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House do, however, have some concern at these procedures and the possible use to which information gained from tax records may be put. Secrecy is a cornerstone of the Income Tax Assessment Act and while, as I have indicated, we strongly support these amendments in the expectation that they will strenghten the effectiveness of law enforcement in this country, we do propose to move two amendments during the Committee stage of the Bill-amendments which we feel will more effectively safeguard the confidentiality of tax information without hindering efforts to detect and prevent crime and tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these amendments will require that a positive motion be passed by both Houses of this Parliament before any particular royal commission can be deemed to be a royal commission for the purposes of this section and given access to tax files. In our view, this will ensure that Parliament approves the purposes for which a royal commission is established before it is given freedom of tax information and that such access is not given lightly or as part of a vendetta by government against some particular group. Secondly, we will propose that a royal commission may pass on tax-related information to the Attorney- General only if it believes on reasonable grounds that an offence has been committed and that that offence is of a serious enough nature to warrant the transfer of such information. From the time that identified tax information is made available to the Attorney-General, it is likely that there would be a wide group of persons given access to tax related information and from this point the possibility of misuse of such information increases. Accordingly, this amendment aims to ensure that such a spread of information occurs only where the possibility of serious offences exists. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as increasing the effectiveness of the fight against crime in Australia , these amendments to the Act will be a further weapon in the fight against abuse of our tax system through tax avoidance and evasion. These problems were strongly highlighted by the recent interim report of the Costigan Royal Commission. This report, tabled in this House earlier this year, painted a picture of an intricate circle of tax avoidance involving criminal elements, of fraud, of deliberate falsification and destruction of company records to avoid detection, and of huge losses to government revenue. In four cases quoted by the Royal Commissioner, $2m in tax revenue was avoided, and he said that there were hundreds of such cases. The Costigan Royal Commission had to use its own devices to uncover the circle of tax avoidance and evasion which was revealed in its report and, not surprisingly given the efforts of the tax evaders to cover their tracks, a very great deal of time was spent by the Commission, and is still being spent, in this process-time that could undoubtedly have been spent profitably pursuing the Commission's inquiries in other areas had it had access to tax records. The Commission's report states that it was informed by the Taxation Office that it had a great deal of information connecting criminal elements with the type of scheme mentioned, but was unable to provide such information to the Commission because of the secrecy provisions of the Act. In these circumstances it is easy to sympathise with the Commission's sentiments when it said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . denial of access to taxation records will not only lengthen considerably the work of this Commission, but may, in the end, frustrate it. </PARA>
<PARA>Just as the Opposition strongly supports these amendments because of the greater effectiveness they will mean for general law enforcement, so we support them for their likely effect on tax avoidance and evasion. The Costigan Commission vividly illustrates the effects on Australia's tax system of tax avoidance and evasion. To quote the interim report:</PARA>
<PARA>This industry has developed in Australia, particularly over the last five years, at a rate far in excess of any other industry and has brought with it profits comparable only to the heady days of the Victorian gold rush . . . The impact on the community has been very serious. It has introduced into the community a class of people, almost invariably the highest earners, who pay little or no tax and make no contribution in that way as citizens to their fair share of community costs. In addition it has made more difficult for government the task of providing for the community as a whole a more equitable and reduced taxation burden. </PARA>
<PARA>These concerns expressed by the Royal Commission echo exactly the concerns continually voiced by the Opposition over the last several years. Tax avoidance has become a boom industry during the term of this Government. As we have mentioned previously, the number of detected tax avoiders is now 23 times higher than it was during the last year of the Labor Government, and detected tax avoiders represent only the tip of the iceberg. Estimates of revenue losses range up to $7,000m. Even on the Government's own admission, at the end of last financial year $1 billion in tax revenue was uncollected due to tax avoidance schemes-enough, if that money were collected, to cut taxes by almost $4 a week for all wage and salary earners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government itself must bear much of the blame for these developments and the inequities they create. Its failure to encompass fully retrospective legislation against blatant tax avoidance schemes has meant that the Taxation Office is always one step behind the tax avoider and that as soon as one scheme is knocked over another springs up to take its place. It remains to be seen what effect the new general anti-avoidance section enacted last year will have. If this section is used widely by the Commissioner and is given a broad interpretation by the courts, it may well inhibit the use of the more blatant paper schemes. However, this may only force potential avoiders off-shore or into less blatant tax shelters which the Government continues to ignore or, indeed, actively promotes-for example, films and trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, through its lack of action must also bear part of the responsibility for the unchecked growth of tax evasion in recent years. Tax evasion is a nebulous concept in some ways and, by its nature, is difficult, but not impossible, to quantify and act against. No official studies exist in Australia on the nature or extent of tax evasion. However, using overseas experience it is possible to make broad estimates of the tax losses involved. For example, the American Internal Revenue Service subjected a sample of all personal income tax returns to a thorough audit to determine a rate of tax evasion compared with total tax collections. These results, if applied to Australia, would indicate tax losses due to evasion in the order of $2,500m per annum. European experience, when applied to Australia, gives a broadly similar figure of around $3,000m. I stress that these are figures for evasion alone and do not include avoidance. The crudeness of these figures cannot be denied, but they do indicate the extent of the problem-that the lost revenue amounts to around 15 per cent of all personal income tax collections. The burden of these losses is inevitably borne by ordinary wage and salary earners in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, action against tax evasion is difficult, but not impossible. It seems, however, that this Government has given in to these problems with very little fight. In the 1978-79 Budget, the current Treasurer (Mr Howard) gave every indication of moving to tackle tax evasion head-on. At that time he announced proposals to subject to tax at source cash payments made to sub- contractors and individuals in certain areas, particularly the building and entertainment industries. He soon dropped these proposals, however, when subjected to pressure from the interests concerned, which interests were obviously worried about the impact such measures would have on their own activities. Little more has been heard from the Treasurer on this issue, although he did say in 1980, some two years later, that investigations were still proceeding. We still await the result of those investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> The only concrete action taken by the Government in this area came last year with the enactment of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. This Act made it a criminal offence to indulge in one particular scheme for tax evasion-that involving the use of stray companies with bogus directors and untraceable addresses to shift profits out of otherwise taxable companies. This so-called ' bottom-of-the-harbour' scheme-to denote the final resting place for the records of many such companies-is the scheme referred to by the Costigan Royal Commission. Such schemes had been widely used and one promoter alone is known to have stripped profits from 2,086 companies in this way over a short period with revenue losses over $200m. Action in this area was obviously urgently necessary and the Government's proposals for five years' gaol or a fine of $50,000, or both, for persons participating in such fraudulent schemes, were welcome when they finally arrived. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that must be asked, though, is why action has been restricted solely to this one case when tax evasion is such a widespread and serious problem. It seems that the Government regards tax evasion as too intractable a problem and sees the obstacles surrounding legislative action as too formidable. There is, however, one area where action could be taken immediately. This involves the penalties applied to detected tax evaders. The penalties contained in the Income Tax Assessment Act range from a minimum of $2 to a maximum of double the tax sought to be evaded. In the limited case of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, which I have just mentioned, and in the case of section 229 of the Act which covers perjury, there are gaol sentences involved. On the face of the matter though, most persons caught for tax evasion could expect to face a penalty of 200 per cent of the tax which he or she sought to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA> In practice though, the Commissioner of Taxation rarely enforces the full penalty. Usually, after negotiating with the taxpayer, the Commissioner seems content to settle for a penalty of around half of the tax sought to be evaded. This is evident from an examination of the reports to Parliament provided by the Commissioner each year. Each report contains general information on breaches of the tax Act and also a list of persons convicted of understating taxable income who have been charged additional tax exceeding $1,250. This information provides the only publicly available official evidence on the extent of tax evasion in Australia and the attitude taken by the Taxation Office towards convicted tax evaders. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1979-80, according to the Commissioner's report, 168,000 persons who either failed to furnish an income tax return, omitted assessable income or falsely claimed rebates or deductions were detected. This represented around 3 per cent of all taxpayers. These taxpayers were charged a total of just over $ 87m in additional tax or on average $517 each. Where information is available on the tax evaded and additional tax charged it is evident that, on average, the Commissioner sought a penalty of slightly less than 50 per cent of the tax due, even though the maximum penalties under the two sections of the Act involved- sections 226 (1) and 226 (2)-were 100 per cent and 200 per cent additional tax respectively. It is interesting then to turn from the general statistics to the list of persons charged additional tax of more than $1,250 for similar offences. During 1979-80, 1,567 persons or companies were named in this list as understating their taxable income. These persons were charged additional tax of 5.3m-or on average $3,410 each compared to tax sought to be evaded of $13.5m. This represents a penalty on average of just under 40 per cent additional tax. From these facts it seems that the Commissioner charges those persons higher up the scale of tax evasion a lesser proportionate penalty-although of course more in money terms-than he does where the amounts involved were less. We on the Opposition side would like to know why that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole situation seems to us to be ridiculous and not conducive to a determined attempt to stamp out tax evasion. The low penalties for serious tax evasion seem absurd. This is even more so when it is realised that it is often up to three or four years before tax evaders are detected and even longer before they are forced to pay the tax due. During this time inflation will have significantly reduced the money amount of tax involved and a smart investor will have had his money earning high interest so that by the time he has to pay back taxes and penalties he will probably end up well ahead on the whole arrangement. The inadequacy of these penalties is even more obvious when compared with the penalties involved for tax officers who breach the secrecy provisions of the Act which, of course, are involved in the legislation now before us. As I said earlier, in this case the officer could be liable for a fine of $500 or up to one year's imprisonment. It is ironic that had an officer of the Taxation Office disclosed information to one of the royal commissions enabling it to reveal the operations of tax evaders, that officer would have faced harsher penalties than the tax evader. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly there is a case for the Commissioner of Taxation strongly reassessing his application of the penalties provided in the Act for serious offences involving tax evasion. It is essential that the penalties applied should provide a real deterrent to prevent tax evasion on a large scale. This would in no way preclude effective action on other fronts but is an obvious starting point for an all out attack on tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The second set of amendments proposed by the Bill deal with the taxation side of the Government's housing package announced by the Treasurer, conveniently, just before the Victorian State elections. As an aside, I am sure that this package was greeted with little more than utter dismay by the then Victorian Liberal Government, whose leader had only just delivered his policy speech the centre point of which was a housing interest rebate which was almost completely duplicated by the Commonwealth measures. This forced the then Victorian Government to ditch its scheme only days after it was announced and to search for some stop-gap alternative to restore its credibility with the electorate, or at least to attempt to do so. Needless to say, this episode was symptomatic of the debacle which the Liberal campaign in Victoria became. I wonder how the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) must have felt sitting behind Mr Thompson as he delivered his policy speech, knowing full well that within a few days his Treasurer would make a complete farce of the then Victorian Government's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment before the House proposes a tax rebate for home loan interest payments made after 1 July 1982 for a sole or principal residence with the rebate being limited to the first five years of owner-occupancy. Home buyers who have purchased or purchase their first home any time since July 1977 and up to 30 June 1985, will qualify for the rebate. The maximum rebate will be $500 in the first year in which a home is occupied, reducing by $100 per year for each of the succeeding four years. For families with a dependent child or children the rebate will be increased by $200 each year. While these proposals look attractive to home buyers, they are, in fact, little more than a superficial sugar coating on an increasingly bitter pill of higher and higher interest rates which home buyers are being forced to swallow. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened to the living standards of Australian home buyers over recent times. Since March 1980-that is, in the last 2 years-interest rates on savings bank mortgages have risen by 4 per cent from 9.5 per cent to 13 .5 per cent. Mortgage rates from other lenders have risen by a similar degree. These increases have had a disastrous impact on the disposable incomes of home buyers. Every percentage point increase in mortgage rates adds approximately $ 300m a year to the total interest bill of all home buying households. Thus total mortgage repayments have risen by $1,200m per annum over the last two years-that is four times $300m. That means $1,200m has been transferred away from the disposable incomes of home buying households all over Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this massive increase in mortgage repayments the Government's proposed interest tax rebate will cost $230m in a full year. This meagre measure will go a very little way towards reimbursing home buyers for the massive increase in their loan repayments over the last two years. It amounts to less than 20 per cent of that increase. In fact, the rebate will not even cover the cost to home buying households as a whole of the latest one per cent rise in interest rates, announced in the very same statement in which the Treasurer announced this rebate. Once again the Government has continued its practice of more than taking back with one hand what it gives with the other. </PARA>
<PARA> What will the impact of these changes be on individual households? The Treasurer has admitted that only 28 per cent of home buyers will benefit from the rebate in any way-not all households, but just home buyers. So 72 per cent, or about 1.2 million home buyers will receive nothing but even higher interest rates. In fact, the 450,000 households covered by this scheme represent less than 10 per cent of all households when renters or owner-occupiers are taken into account. So over 90 per cent of households will receive no benefit whatsoever from this rebate. Many of these-the renters and non-qualifying home buyers-still have to bear the heavy burden of the high interest rates resulting from the Government's policies. Renters, for example, face rent increases in the capital cities of around 20 per cent in the near future, the greater part of which can be directly attributable to the effects of this Government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA> Very few of the households which actually qualify for the rebate will, in fact, be better off in money terms when the effect of recent interest rate increases is taken into account. For example, a couple without dependent children who took out a loan from a savings bank for $30,000 over 25 years during March 1980 will still be $14.28 a week worse off after these measures are implemented. Over this period the couple's repayment will have risen by just over $20 a week, compared with $5.80 a week which they will get back from the tax rebate next year. Almost all home buyers will be in a similar position. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows the position of households both with and without children, which have taken out varying sized home loans over the last two years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. It is obvious from this table that the only home buyers to benefit from these measures are those who have recently purchased their homes and who have been able to do so with only a small loan. And it is most doubtful whether these home buyers will manage to stay in front for long. Future further rises are likely in mortgage rates if the policies pursued by this Government are continued and, with the yearly decline in the dollar value of the rebate, it will not be long before these households, too, find themselves in difficulty with the mounting cost of their home loans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The biggest winners out of this housing package-of which this rebate is just one part-are not Australian households, but rather Australian banks and other financiers. At a time when the banks especially are reaping huge profits from the current high level of interest rates, they are to be handed the opportunities to make even greater profits by the Government's desire to move along the road of Campbell style deregulation. While it is inappropriate to pursue these arguments at present, I indicate that we on this side of the House are seeking to achieve a package of housing assistance which will provide real benefits to Australian home buyers who genuinely need assistance. It is our intention that most financial institutions-not just the banks and building societies-should help share the burden for achieving society's home ownership goals. We do not oppose this Bill. We do, however, have certain reservations which I have expressed regarding particular aspects of it.

One of the purposes of this Bill, the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2), is to provide a flat tax home loan interest rebate for some existing home purchasers and intending home buyers. When the Treasurer (Mr Howard) announced the Government's intention to provide the rebate the Opposition argued that the proposed scheme was very blunt, badly targeted, unnecessarily expensive and highly regressive. We acknowledged that there was a problem for those people on moderate incomes who had recently bought their first home through a mortgage which stretched to the limit of their own means. They had suffered a decline in their real household disposable income as a result of the regressive policies of this Government. They had been hit with an increase in their mortgage repayments as a result of the rapidly increased rate rise brought on by this Government and by its overtight monetary policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The tables show the problems faced by recent home buyers-before the March 1980 announcement-of a further one per cent rise in savings bank interest rates. The Government's rebate scheme fails to meet the problems that were evident before the additional interest rate rise. The scheme is even less effective since the rise. The situation for existing home buyers is that in March 1980, when the savings bank interest rate was 9.5 per cent, repayments on a $30,000 loan were $262 a month, with a total repayment of $78, 630 over the life of the loan. In April 1982, when the savings bank interest rate is 13.5 per cent, the monthly repayment has increased by $88 a month to $ 350 a month and the total repayment has increased by $26,300 to a total of $105, 000. Over that two-year period the total post-tax income of a household consisting of a breadwinner on average weekly earnings, a dependent spouse and two children, rose by $20 a month.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That income rose by $20 a month but the mortgage repayments over that period rose by $88 a month. As a result, the household is $68 a month, or $816 a year, worse off. The Government now propose to give a family a maximum rebate of $700, which will still leave such a family over $100 short. The Government has failed to make clear its general approach to housing policy in order to allay the insecurities, the confusion and the fears that pervade both consumers and providers of housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two preconditions for any effective scheme to protect existing first home buyers from crippling mortgage repayment burdens. The first is to ensure that there are no further reductions in real household disposable income as a result of Government policy measures. The second is to gurantee that there will be no further rises in housing loan interest rates. The plain fact is that this rebate scheme was introduced in conjunction with an announcement of a further interest rate rise and it is equally plain to see that this Government is intent in pushing housing loan interest rates up further. That is why about half of the $230m allocated for this scheme is directed to future first home purchasers.</PARA>
<PARA> About $100m will be allocated to assist 28 per cent of existing home purchasers . Many of those assisted are not given enough to make up the losses incurred by households as a result of the interest rate rises that this Government has brought on. The rebate is not targeted to those who need assistance most. On the basis of the 1980 home finance survey findings of the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, 45 per cent of first home buyers had incomes in excess of 150 per cent of average weekly earnings. Those upper income groups will be assisted by the rebate while deserving families on lower incomes will get nothing. Of the 450,000 households to be given assistance, the 202,000 in the top 25 per cent income bracket will be given about $100m. That is a gross and inequitable misallocation of resources. But this is nothing new for this Government because it has always taken resources away from the great bulk of the people on low incomes and transferred them either to wealthy individuals or to wealthy companies.</PARA>
<PARA> We need a more closely targeted scheme of assistance based on the principle that the first home buyers should pay no more as a proportion of their incomes in mortgage repayments than the amount they committed at the time of purchase of their dwellings. To achieve that a different thrust is needed in housing policy. The national Government needs to take up its responsibility to make housing policy a social priority. It has the powers available to it to ensure a stable and adequate flow of funds to the housing sector. It has the power to lift the pressures on housing loan interest rates and to contain further rises in those rates. That is the most constructive contribution a government can make to the stabilisation of housing industry activity and to the security of shelter for the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA> Those are the remarks that I wanted to make. I do not want to delay the House but I do hope that honourable members will respect the fact that I have kept my speech short to allow other members of the Opposition to speak. In conclusion, the whole problem of housing policy can be solved only if it is attacked on a broad front. It has to be attacked first of all in the public housing sector. It has to be attacked with a first home buyer's program. It has to be attacked to protect those people already living in homes who, because of the rising interest rates, are finding it difficult to meet their mortgage repayments. Housing policy also needs to have the stability that I have stressed. It should be a social priority of the Government to prove that it will make money available to the housing sector. Lastly, it certainly has to stimulate the building industry. For every $100m injected into the building industry, jobs are provided for 5,000 workers in the building and associated industries. It seems to me that there is enough action and enough assets and resources available to provide a stimulus of at least $500m to the building industry. That, alone, could provide employment for over 25,000 people. I will leave it at that because I know my colleagues want to contribute to the debate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) includes first an amendment that will permit the Commissioner of Taxation in very special and limited circumstances to disclose to certain royal commissions information obtained from official income tax records. The second main amendment introduces the home loans interest rate rebates that were foreshadowed by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on 18 March. The Government naturally welcomes the Opposition's support for its vigorous attack on tax evasion and is glad that it is supporting the Bill. However, it is remarkable, after having listened to the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), to note the difference between his version of history and the reality. Unlike the present Opposition, when it was a disastrous and incompetent government, this Government has been able to identify tax loopholes and then close them. (Quorum formed). Certainly the effort of identification that the present Government has succeeded with, is far greater than any effort ever shown when the Australian Labor Party was in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me to be extraordinary that the honourable member for Gellibrand should allege that we have given in with very little fight when, in fact, the legislation is full of measures that have been introduced as a result of our having identified loopholes in an extensive way since we came to office-an effort that was not made during the term of the former Labor Government. In fact , Labor's only solution now to the problem of tax evasion is to introduce retrospective legislation. That is the only measure that the honourable member for Gellibrand can come up with as an effective solution to the problem. At the same time the Opposition is prepared to go along with and accept, the legislation this Government has introduced, with some piddling amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the way in which the Labor Party wants to run this nation- if it ever gets the opportunity to govern again-is to introduce legislation which makes it illegal to do something long after the deed has been done. In other words, something is done within the law but a law is introduced later to change the situation retrospectively. A basic principle of English law, one on which this country has been governed, is that laws are not made retrospective. That the Labor Party considers that retrospectivity is the way to resolve the problem of tax evasion reflects its desperation rather than its intellect. It seems to me that the combination of the Government's recent catch-all, anti- evasion legislation, as set out in Division 4 of the Act, of many other specific items of legislation, and of statements which have been made ahead of specific legislation-warning potential tax evaders that if they proceeded to use similar devices they would be caught by legislation to be introduced later-has been effective. The combination of that legislation and the much more reasonable approach that has been taken by the High Court in recent times represents a major change in regard to the very serious matter of tax evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is incredible that the Opposition should maintain the fiction that the Government is doing nothing effective to stop tax evasion when, in fact, the legislation is full of very effective laws blocking it. I remind honourable members of the success that has been achieved in the courts. They should remember that it takes quite a while for new legislation to be effectively tested through the courts. In the first place the effect of the new legislation has to be seen against the returns for a given tax year. Obviously, tax returns do not come in until after the end of the financial year. Once they have been examined the Commissioner of Taxation can decide whether legislation which may well have been introduced 18 months to two years before has been broken. If he believes that it has been a dispute will ensue. But let us recognise that when legislation is introduced not even the enormous intellects on the Opposition side can establish clearly whether it will be seen by the courts to be effective . In view of Labor's abysmal record in this arena it is incredible that is should have the hide to attack the Government on this score. The Government's record is unassailable. It has introduced far more effective legislation to prevent tax evasion and protect revenue than the Labor Party has been able even to think of. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the second part of the Bill which has been the subject of an amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand. He alleged that the Bill fails to provide adequate compensation to Australian home buyers for the massive increase in interest repayments over the last two years. Let us look at what has really been the factor pricing Australians out of their houses. Has it been interest rates or the cost of the houses themselves? This is the key issue that the Opposition scurries away from. It will not accept the fact that the major reason people have been priced out of their houses, in the Sydney area particularly, has been the enormous increase in the price of those houses. I commend to the House a study in that regard and seek leave to have the resulting statistics incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

They have been most affected by interest rate changes. No doubt some families in that category need the help that the Government proposes giving by way of this legislation. Many families have purchased recently, but those who purchased some years ago are now paying out-even allowing for these interest rate rises-a much smaller proportion of their wages on average than they were when they first purchased their houses.

By December of last year, after the interest rates had gone up by 25 per cent, that 31.5 per cent proportion of his average weekly earnings which he was paying off on his house had fallen to 25.8 per cent. The figure had fallen. Certainly, the amount he was paying had gone up from $295 to $350 in current dollar terms; but the reality is that, as a proportion of his wage, there had been a fall of 17 per cent in the amount going to pay off his house.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Mr BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite frankly, I do not mind all these interruptions. I had sought to speak for only 10 minutes because I was attempting to provide sufficient time for other Opposition members to join in the debate. I thank them for their co- operation with me in seeking to give a call to other Opposition members. I presume that by now that indulgence may well have departed with the clock. I will proceed, over the constant barrage, to point out that not only has there been this reduction in the proportion of average weekly earnings of someone paying off a median-priced house in Sydney but also had such a person bought that house now instead of in 1978 he would pay $76,900 for it instead of $40,700 . If he were paying off the house at the interest rates which applied in December last year-that is, a saving bank rate of 12.5 per cent-he would be paying 49.4 per cent of his average weekly earnings in interest instead of only 25.8 per cent. The reality is that he borrowed that money back in June 1978. In other words, the increase in the cost of housing-not of interest rates-creates that enormous difference between 25.8 per cent of average weekly earnings going to pay off the house and 49.4 per cent. This totally excludes any interest rate rises. That is the difference. The increase in the cost of houses has nothing to do with this Federal Government's interest rate policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We see here in actual money terms exactly what the situation is. Such a person would have been paying $350 as a result of interest rate rises as at December 1981 compared with $295 as at June 1978. Now he will be paying $671. The difference between $671 and $350 is, in fact, the difference in cost to him caused by the higher price of housing. The higher price of housing has emerged basically out of the supply and demand factors. These are matters over which the Federal Government has no control. The cost is based generally on the market price. The cost of building materials represents a minor proportion of that increase in the cost of Sydney houses. The major reason for that increase in cost has been the price of land. Not even the enormous cacophony opposite could manage to deny that proposition. It seems to me very simple. When there is an increase of 90 per cent in the cost of houses and a 25 per cent increase in the cost of money, it is nonsensical for the Opposition to maintain that interest rates have caused this problem. </PARA>

At that time the figure was 31.5 per cent. The same trend exists. I would suggest to the Opposition that it would be far better to concentrate its attack where it is accurate and meaningful.

I refer to the use of the rebate as a method of providing assistance. There are many low income tax earners who will not get the full benefit of the rebate. I would suggest that in matters such as this, where we are giving a benefit through a rebate, that rebate should be able to be carried forward in the event of a loss in taxable income for the year. I hope that the Government, particularly in situations where we provide assistance through a rebate, will examine this matter of allowing that rebate to be able to be carried forward in years when there is no taxable income against which the rebate should be placed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move the following amendments to clause 3 which have been circulated in my name:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Clause 3, page 2, lines 33-36, proposed paragraph 16 (4) (k), omit sub- paragraph (iii), substitute the following sub-paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> '(iii) a Royal Commission in respect of which each House of the Parliament has by resolution declared that the Royal Commission is a Royal Commission to which this sub-paragraph applies,'. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Clause 3, page 3, lines 12-15, proposed sub-section 16 (4A), omit paragraph (b), substitute the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> '(b) the Royal Commission may communicate the information to the Attorney- General if the Royal Commission believes on reasonable grounds that the information indicates that a person may have committed an offence against an Act punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 6 months;'. </PARA>
<PARA>As I indicated at the second reading stage of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982, there are two amendments. The first relates to the provision of the Bill in clause 3 which provides not only for the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking to have the right of access to tax records, but also for any future royal commission which may be established by the Government for which the letters patent issued by the Governor-General declare that the royal commission is a royal commission to which such powers will apply. The Opposition has moved the first amendment because we believe it is unwise to give the Government an untrammelled power to establish royal commissions which can have a power to investigate the tax records of Australian citizens or corporations. We feel it is unwise because it may be the case-we do not suggest that this is the case with the other two specific royal commissions-that a royal commission could be established by the Government with the intention of conducting a vendetta against a particular group in the community. By giving that royal commission power to investigate tax records, it could make life even more difficult for the group being assailed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We think there should be some kind of limitation on the right of government simply to declare that it will establish a royal commission with the power to investigate tax records of Australian people. We think that the kind of limitation which we propose in our amendment is not an unreasonable one. The limitation is that the royal commission would have to be approved by the Parliament, with a declaration by both Houses of the Parliament in favour of any royal commission that may be established having the right to investigate tax records. If we include that kind of provision, I believe that would be a safeguard against maverick action by the Government which may possibly occur at some future time if we do not have some kind of limitation on the power of government to undertake that kind of action. It is true that in the history of Australia, royal commissions have been set up which it has been strongly believed by sections of the community were an attack against a particular section or individual. It is not impossible that that could happen again in the future. We believe that this amendment is a worthwhile one. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendment that I have moved relates to the provision that the royal commission may communicate information to the Attorney-General; that is, identified information in respect of tax records of a particular taxpayer, if he is of the opinion that the information indicates that the person may have committed an offence against an Act. That is the way the Bill reads at present. That seems to us to be a little too open. First, we believe that the words 'of the opinion' are perhaps a little bit broad and it would be better to make it ' on reasonable grounds' rather than just having 'formulating the opinion'-perhaps not on reasonable grounds-more or less off the top of the Commissioner's head. We believe that there should be those reasonable grounds. More importantly, it should be believed that the person who is to be the subject of this information has committed an offence of a serious nature. As the legislation stands, it provides that where a person may have committed an offence against any Commonwealth Act-many offences, of course, are very minor indeed-but on the basis of even some very minor offence, information about tax records could be passed on to the Australian Federal Police and others and a wide group of people could have access to that information. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned in my speech at the second reading stage, once that information goes to the Attorney-General, staff of the Attorney-General's Department have access to that information and then when it goes to the Australian Federal Police, members of the police force have access to that information. It seems to the Opposition that if we are to allow that-and as I mentioned we can see good reason for the kind of provision that is generally intended to be provided here- there should be some limitation on this general power and that limitation should be that there is a presumption on reasonable grounds that a serious offence has been committed. What we propose in this legislation is that an offence against an Act punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding six months has been presumed to have occurred. I believe those are quite reasonable amendments. As I have indicated, we support the general tenor of what the Government is doing in respect of the disclosure provisions but we believe that they would be considerably improved by these added safeguards being adopted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join in the debate and ask the Government to consider very seriously these amendments. I hope that, if the Government does not agree to them here, the Senate will take appropriate steps to insert those amendments. I would have thought that, if honourable members thought about the amendments, both sides of the House ought to agree-because in principle we believe that governments are not always beneficial or beneficent to their subjects-and ought to support these limitations on government powers. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), who moved the amendments on behalf of the Opposition, pointed out the question of royal commissions. The present proposition is that the Government can appoint any royal commission. It can then give that royal commission the power to obtain records from the Australian Taxation Office and pass those records, and I emphasise this, to the Attorney- General and to the Australian Federal Police under certain very wide circumstances-no specified circumstances as far as passing the records to the Attorney-General and to the Australian Federal Police is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give both sides of the House some examples of royal commissions which for different reasons honourable members may object to having that sort of power . This Government could well appoint other royal commissions into unions or, for that matter, into the Australian Labor Party. We would not like to be faced with the proposition that people who are somehow involved in that royal commission have all their taxation records exposed and given to the Attorney-General's Department and to the Australian Federal Police and all their employees. I think that honourable members on the other side ought to be careful. The chances of a non-Liberal Party government are obviously quite good. We could appoint a royal commission into multinationals or into the financing of politics. They would be quite reasonable royal commissions and, unless we insert the proposition that we are putting, that both Houses of Parliament should declare that a royal commission is to be a royal commission to which this sub-paragraph applies, the Government if it wished to do so, could declare that royal commission to be one which could obtain taxation records. I do not think that the people who normally support the Liberal and National Country Parties would be very keen to have their taxation records spread widely. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that governments of both kinds in the foreseeable future will be faced with hostile Senates. Those in this House who believe that the good of the country depends on passing the maximum amount of legislation are probably opposed to this. Those who tend to share my view that passing a large volume of legislation is not necessarily the best way to run the country may not be so perturbed about the fact that the Government does not have a majority in the Senate and may well appreciate the protection of having a relatively hostile Senate preventing interference with the privacy of the individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point more or less follows the first point; that is, that once a royal commissioner has been able to obtain records-in this particular case from the Federal Commissioner of Taxation-at present all that has to be said is that some sort of offence has been committed. I assume that it could be almost any sort of offence if it is intended to have been an offence dealing with Federal legislation. If it is an offence which could have been committed in the Australian Capital Territory, it could be anything from parking to conspiracy; it would be included under this heading. I think that limiting it to an offence against an Act punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding six months puts at least some limitations on the spreading of private information-or what people until now have considered to be private information-to a large number of people. Let us remember that. It is given to the Attorney-General and to his employees. It is given to the Australian Federal Police Commissioner and all his employees. I know that at present people are talking glibly about the great record of the Australian Federal Police vis-a-vis the New South Wales Police. I will not be one of those who defend the record of the New South Wales Police, but I remind the House, as far as the Australian Federal Police are concerned that two or three years ago there was a royal commission which dealt with aspects of the Narcotics Bureau. Following that royal commission, the Narcotics Bureau was dissolved and most of its members were added to the Australian Federal Police. I think honourable members in this House who have absolute faith--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Scholes" NAMEID="5J4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SH4">Dr KLUGMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I think honourable members who have absolute faith in the honesty and integrity of every member of the Australian Federal Police would be just as disappointed as those who have absolute faith in the integrity and honesty of every member of the State police forces or, for that matter, any member of overseas police forces. That would be my view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I commend these amendments to the Government. I think that generally the Government tends to look at amendments and reject them out of hand. I hope in this particular case that the Government will look at them. I think in many ways , at least theoretically-if one is against a maximum amount of government interference in the lives of people-they follow the lines of the Government's political direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one final point. I think people who believe that a lot of information will be available from taxation records as far as criminal activities are concerned will probably be sorely disappointed. Obviously I have not seen other people's tax returns. But I would be very surprised if people who engage in crime, even if until now they had given a correct description of the origin of their income to the Federal Commissioner of Taxation, will do so any longer once this legislation is passed. They would be idiots if they did. There is a complete difference between the tax setup here and the setup in the United States where criminal penalties are involved if people give the wrong information. As we have all heard many times over, Al Capone was finally convicted of taxation offences. This does not happen in this country. We would open up a Pandora's box if everybody who cheated on the Taxation Commissioner finished up in gaol. Whilst many politicians will tend to make long speeches in favour of that sort of proposition, I think many of their constituents will have reservations about it. I am certainly one who has some reservations about it. I therefore ask the Government to consider these amendments in some depth and not to spread this new power which interferes with the privacy of the individual any further than is absolutely necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first observation that I should make about these amendments, the detail of which I will come to in a moment, is that having sat in this place and listened to quite a number of powerful speeches from the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) about the desperate urgency for the Government to implement without delay the complete recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union regarding access to taxation records, we now find the Opposition moving amendments which in effect say that we have gone too far and that what we are proposing falls short of what Royal Commissioner Costigan asked for and therefore falls considerably short of what the honourable member for Wills was arguing for. One can only conclude that the honourable member for Wills did not do too well on this subject in the caucus room.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dealing with the two amendments and taking them in a reverse order, may I say that I see some merit in the second amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). I should like to consult with my colleague the Attorney- General (Senator Durack) regarding it. I can see some advantages accruing from the amendment. It is with some trepidation that the Government has moved in this area. We think it is a pretty difficult balancing act on the one hand to accede to the legitimate desire of the community to see that criminal behaviour is brought under restraint but at the same time protecting the desirable confidentiality of taxation records. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I cannot at the moment indicate in this place on behalf of the Government that the second amendment will be acceptable, I can indicate that I see some merit in it. In the debate on this matter in another place, the Government will indicate its final attitude on that amendment. Obviously it is an area in which we have to hasten slowly. We have to give some access to the royal commissions which are now taking place. But we do not want to go too far. We want to test these changes very carefully and we want to see that under no circumstances is there any abuse by royal commissioners or their agents. Whilst I make no reflection at all upon the integrity and competence of the existing royal commissioners, nobody can be certain in the future that anybody can be immune from perhaps an excessive power in this area. Of course, as the honourable member for Gellibrand knows, tax evasion is a very emotional subject. As I have said in this place in the past, and I say again, one of the remarkable features about this whole exercise and about the Costigan interim report is that the very conduct that was the subject of such dramatic reporting around Australia and drew all the headlines and comments, the Slutzkin scheme, had in fact been outlawed by this Parliament in December 1980 with the support of both sides of the House. In other words, the very conduct that the royal commissioner had complained about had been a criminal offence for 18 months. Yet if one were to read some of the reports one would imagine that a blinding discovery of this particular taxation offence, never before seen by man, had been made by this royal commissioner. That perhaps illustrates--</PARA>

Above everything else, a sense of proportion about the subject is needed.

<PARA> The purpose of these further amendments is to make some changes to the earlier amendments proposed in this House to the secrecy provisions of the income tax law. The further amendments are in response to representations put to the Government. They are designed to remove any doubt that effective use may be made by royal commissions of Taxation information obtained from the Commissioner of Taxation-particularly in the context of in camera examination of witnesses-and at the same time to preserve as far as practicable the essentially confidential nature of taxation records. Amendment (1) is of a purely technical nature and is necessary because amendment (3) will insert further sub-sections in section 16 of the Income Assessment Act. Amendment (2) is designed to overcome a possible technical deficiency seen in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill previously proposed that a royal commission could disclose taxation information in its 'public proceedings', provided that the name of the person to which the information related was not revealed. It has been suggested that the words used in the Bill to give effect to that intention might have led to an unintended inference that the royal commission could only use taxation information in the course of its public proceedings. To remove this uncertainty this amendment, in conjunction with amendment (3), will set out more clearly the manner and circumstances in which a royal commission will be permitted to use and disclose taxation information received by it. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be permitted to reveal in appropriately confined in camera proceedings, but not in public proceedings, the taxation information to the person-including in the case of a company, to relevant representatives or officers of the company -to whom the information relates and to the person who furnished the information to the Commissioner of Taxation, if that person is not the person to whom the information relates. Taxation accountants, legal firms and others who, for example, prepared tax returns of a witness before a royal commission would be included in this category. So as to enable effective representation, it will also be permissable for a barrister or solicitor representing such a person before a royal commission to be provided with tax information relating to the client. Consistently with secrecy constraints applying to taxation officers and other persons privy to taxation information of a confidential nature, amendment (3) contains a safeguarding prohibition against the further communication of taxation information obtained from a royal commission under these additional measures. </PARA>
<PARA> The last amendment-amendment (4)-clarifies another doubt that has been expressed about the present amendments. It will remove any doubt there may possibly have been as to whether tax information disclosed to a royal commission could be passed to a barrister of solicitor appointed by the Attorney-General to assist the royal commission. Amendment (4) makes it quite clear that tax information can be passed on to counsel so appointed as well as to persons such as instructing solicitors who need the information in providing assistance to counsel assisting the commission. I commend the amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill simply proposes that the salary of the Governor-General, which for the current incumbent stands at $37,000, should be increased to $70,000, tax free of course, per annum, for the new appointee. The Opposition opposes this proposal. It is relevant to say a number of things about this legislation to justify that opposition. The first is that there seems to be a contemptuous effort on the part of the Government to propose that this substantial increase should take place at this time when concurrently it had been appearing before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission arguing that no increase should take place in the national wage claim of the trade union movement. There is a substantial difference between the living standard available to people on moderate to lower- middle income and that standard of living which would be provided tax free at $ 70,000 per annum for the new appointee as Governor-General. It is brazen and it is effrontery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordinary people in the community have an extremely difficult task day by day trying to make ends meet on a pay packet which in real spending terms is constantly being reduced, not just by inflation and the lack of any productivity adjustment in the gross wage packet, but by the vicious taxation bite, direct and indirect, that is imposed by Government policies, by the high cost of health insurance, by the substantial increases in interest rates for home mortgages and consumer finance and by the high cost of petrol as a consequence of the Government's excise duties policies. All of these things together have reduced in a most indiscriminate and brutal way the living standard of the average family. Calculations show beyond any doubt that there would have to be an increase of more than $27 a week in the average income of Australian families to restore the real spending power that they had seven years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In the context of a demonstrable collapse in living standards in the sense of dignity and security available for average families, that the Government should be proceeding nonetheless persistently to hector them in this Parliament day after day at Question Time, through the media and before the Arbitration Commission, claiming that wages are a cause of the nation's inflationary problems and concurrently propose this substantial increase in the salary for the Governor-General is the height of mockery of the intelligence of the great bulk of people in this community. This argument will not wear at all; it will not be tolerated by ordinary decent-minded citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> What I am saying has nothing to do with the personality of the new incumbent to be appointed to the position of Governor-General. We are debating a matter of practice and principle on the part of the Government. This legislation is a demonstration of the Government's lack of consistency and sensitivity. The Government can go on day after day, week after week with this unparalleled assault on the sense of self respect and integrity of ordinary families, asserting that they are the cause of the economic problems of this country and therefore must accept quite savage wage restraint and yet propose this unparalleled increase in the salary for the new incumbent to the position of Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation very largely is a product of Government policies, not of the wages of ordinary people in the community which have lagged between the combined movements in the cost of living and productivity. There has been no productivity adjustment since 1974. The substantial cause of inflation, rests with things such as skyrocketing health insurance rates, the petrol pricing policies of the Government, interest rates on mortgages, and indirect tax charges which the Government, one way and another, has been seeking to impose on the the community . So that in context this must be regarded as a contrived offence to the intelligence and sense of self-respect of ordinary members of the community. On those grounds, therefore, we oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other grounds justifying opposition. How does the Government establish a case in support of this extraordinary increase in the rate of remuneration for the Governor-General? The annual rate of remuneration will go from $37,000 a year to $70,000. In both cases, existing and prospective payment has been and will be tax free. It is little more than pocket money. The Governor -General is provided with additional advantages that are not available to the average member of the community. He has a chateau at Yarralumla which is very well appointed, not only in its physical furnishings but also in the support that is available to him at various levels in various categorisations of staff. His requirements for meals are amply provided for under these arrangements, at no cost. Outside of some very light running costs in the form, I suppose, of clothing, there do not seem to be any real expenses that the Governor-General can incur. So this becomes pocket money for the gentleman. </PARA>
<PARA> The sum of $70,000 a year tax-free is the equivalent of $150,000 gross before tax. In fact, it is more than that, but for nice round figures it is the equivalent of $150,000 gross before tax. Thrown in as a fringe benefit are a stable of motor vehicles of considerable luxury and expensiveness, with people to drive them, and a small army of people to serve the wants of the Governor- General and to support him in the discharge of his duties, but also there for his personal needs. That makes a very handsome package as remuneration for anyone in any position in this country. How is that justified in the context that I have already described of unremitting offensiveness, almost abuse, directed towards the great bulk of ordinary families in this community which are confronted by the extraordinary difficulties of trying to live under the severe economic policies of the Fraser Government?</PARA>
<PARA> There is a third matter to be considered which is no less important in the general context in which I have been speaking. The salary for the Governor- General, under the Constitution, is struck at the point of his appointment and cannot be adjusted thereafter during the term of his appointment. Because of that, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has personally put to me that it is necessary for a salary range to be struck which at the beginning of the term will be somewhat higher in real terms than it will be at the end of the term. The purpose of that is so that averaged over the term the Governor-General is not disadvantaged in his-I repeat-average real rate of remuneration. It will be higher in the beginning, in that sense, and lower at the end, to get an average; so at the mid-point the amount of money provided is about right. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, if we take the mid-point of the term of service of the present incumbent of the office, use what have been the applicable rates of wage inflation, and work on the assumption that the rate of increase to the mid-point , assuming a five-year term, of the new appointee will be the same, we get an increase of about 50 per cent in wage inflation, and therefore, using that factor, an increase of about 50 per cent in the rate of remuneration for the Governor-General over that provided for the present appointee. So the rate goes from $37,000 to $55,500-not $70,000-tax free per year. It is an increase of $18, 500, and not an increase, as the Government is proposing, of $33,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference is this: On the basis of a reasonable adjustment in the rate of remuneration, in turn constructed upon experienced movements in the wage inflation factor plus a projection of that rate of movement into the period of the new incumbent, and doing it from mid-point to mid-point on the basis that I have already mentioned, the rate of increase that can be justified is only a 50 per cent improvement in the tax free salary of $37,000 a year provided for the present Governor-General, taking him to $55,500. But we get this extraordinary increase of 90 per cent in the rate of remuneration that is to be provided for the new appointee. Why should he be getting a $33,000 increase when all that can be justified is an increase of $18,500? It is almost double the increase that can be justified being provided on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> So there are the grounds on which we harbour very strong objections to the proposal that this increase should be provided for the new appointee. It is, I repeat, a brazen affront to members of the general community for the Government constantly to be assaulting them in terms of their living standards. What the Government is really saying is not that they have never had it so good but that they are getting it too good and you ought to have a lower living standard. All of the objective evidence and all of the verifiable statistical data show that people's real living standard, the money that they have left to spend after taxes and after various charges that the Government imposes for things such as health insurance, which I have adumbrated, is lower today than it was seven years ago when this Government came to office. </PARA>
<PARA> If anyone wants to quibble about the calculations, let him look at a document which Mr Eric Risstrom from the Australian Taxpayers Association put out a few months ago. While there may be an argument at the margin over a few dollars, the fact is that no one who has sensibly calculated the deficiency in living standards today for average families as against those of seven years ago put the figure at anything below $20 a week. My calculation was more than $27 a week. Here we are giving this extraordinary increase without any explanation or justification. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has it been necessary to negotiate a settlement as generous as this? It is $70,000 a year tax free, which is more than $150,000 before tax, together with a stable of motor vehicles of great luxury, with people to drive them about, and a small army of supplicant servants to keep the system going at the chateau at Yarralumla, provided rent free, with all the appurtenances that go with it. This is pocket money on an unparalleled scale, and there has been no explanation, I repeat, for a rate of increase of some 90 per cent in the remuneration when all that can be justified is a rate of increase of 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was recently-at the time that it reached a conclusion on this matter it was concurrently-appearing in the arbitration jurisdiction opposing the mildest increase in the income of modest and middle income earners in the national wage case. This is a totally unacceptable set of contradictory standards on the part of the Government. It is cynical. It is offensive. It is brazen in its crudity of operation. In those circumstances we have no choice but to oppose it. If the Government is going to do this sort of thing, it ought to give a justification for concluding such an extremely generous package arrangement-its generosity is unparalleled-for the new appointee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I am very disappointed at the contribution made in this debate by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). One is disappointed because of the false analysis that the honourable gentleman has made of the Government's arguments in the national wage case, the submissions of all parties to that case-that is, the unions, the employers, the Commonwealth Government and the State governments-having been concluded. The second ground upon which I, having sat here and listened to the honourable gentleman's contribution, am so disappointed is the derision which he has deliberately heaped upon the office of the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia. The third reason why I am so disappointed is the misrepresentation-perhaps if one were to be kind to the honourable gentleman it is because of misapprehension-as to the basis upon which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) approached the Leader of the Opposition before introducing this legislation into the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind honourable gentlemen that it was the Government of Mr Whitlam which introduced the 1974 Bill which established a new salary for the then new Governor-General and also sought by legislation for the first time to put upon a firm statutory basis the pension entitlements of the widow of a Governor-General . When this Government came into office and found itself in a position in which because of the Constitution it had to introduce a new Bill to establish a new salary for the new Governor-General, we found to our consternation and our surprise that the stand taken by the Whitlam Government was completely reversed when that party found itself in Opposition. Again this evening we find that the Opposition rather than approaching the fixing of the salary of the Governor- General on the bipartisan basis which it when in Government in 1974 said was the manner in which it was approaching the fixation of the Governor-General's salary , sought to make political capital of it and, I think, worse than that to its great shame sought to heap derision then and today upon the great office of Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite legitimate for any member of this House to hold particular views about the political shape of our Federation but one way or another there has to be a head of state, and it so happens that the head of state of Australia today, as in 1901 when our Federation was formed, is the Governor-General, a person who stands above politics but by virtue of his office and the requirements of the Constitution must exercise a judgment and make decisions at particular times in the political history of this country. I would have thought that, if people were true to the Constitution of Australia and were true patriots of Australia, they would not seek to make political capital out of the office of the Governor- General with respect to the payment of a salary to the holder of that office whomsoever that may be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitution of Australia fixed the first salary to be paid to the first Governor-General and provided that the salary could thereafter be fixed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Constitution also provided that the salary so fixed could not be altered during the term of office of the incumbent. That meant, for example, that, whether a Governor-General held office for one year or 10 years, the salary fixed at the time when the person took that office remained and must remain unaltered throughout the term of that office. Is it not then reasonable that the government of the day should submit to the Parliament a salary which in itself is reasonable throughout the prospective term of office of the Governor-General? We do not know whether the new office holder will be there for one, five, 10 or 20 years, but we must make the best judgment that we can against the prevailing situation in the community as to what is a fair and reasonable salary for the incumbent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, as was pointed out in the second reading speech, when it was in government sought to draw some comparability between the salary of the Governor- General and the salary of the holder of the office of Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. So, we likewise have drawn as best we can, looking in to the future, a conclusion as to what is a fair and reasonable salary for the incumbent of the office of Governor-General, whoever that may be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition made a totally false analysis of this Government's submission to the present national wage case. We have not said that the working men and women of Australia should not receive a rise in their wages. We have said that the method by which different groups in society at present should be pursuing their wage claims before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and in direct negotiation with employers is what has been variously called the industry-by-industry or case-by-case approach. We argued that that approach should be allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not said that on the basis of that approach, which has been the way in which the unions in Australia have pursued their direct negotiations and their claims before the Commission up to now, those claims should not continue or should not lead to any wage rises. We have also said that, in the interests of the economy, in the interests of the whole society those claims before the Commission should be pursued in a spirit of moderation rather than extravagance. So the arguments that have been put before us tonight by the Leader of the Opposition have been a totally false analysis of this Government's submissions to the national wage case. I invite any member of the Opposition to obtain and read the submission of the Government. That document is freely available to anyone who is interested in making a true analysis, not a false analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot accept the objections of the Oposition for the reasons that I have mentioned. I conclude by saying-I think I speak for all honourable members on the Government side of the House-that it is indeed a great disappointment to us to hear the Leader of the Opposition, who puts himself forward, let us remember, to the people of Australia as a future Prime Minister operating under the Constitution of Australia, embark in this House upon cheap political capital and seek to heap derision upon the office of the Governor- General. </PARA>

As I understand it the reasons were that it was thought that in the future there might be a division of that State into three separate areas.

One of the points I want to raise is that while we are seeking to make some amendment to the 1901 arrangement so far as Queensland is concerned, other matters that relate to the same procedure of voting and representation so far as Tasmania is concerned receive no such mention. A member in Tasmania has the support of, or is elected by 42,000 to 44,000 voters. In Queensland the number is 72,000. Yet we seek to dilute representation from Queensland and allow the Tasmanian situation to remain. What does concern me is the centralisation of power as far as the Senate is concerned.

There is a feeling in north Queensland that it is being neglected in representation. Whereas it had three members before the last election, it now has two.

That is about the situation as far as southern Australia is concerned. We will be voting on legislation that is applicable to Queensland and Queensland alone. I must say that I do resent this legislation so far as that dilution is concerned. I go on a step further and mention what was discussed in the Upper House about the gerrymander in the State of Queensland. I refer those people to the situation that exists in the federal sphere concerning representation. My electorate, which is a rural electorate with an area of 67,000 square kilometres-the fourth largest in Queensland-has the seventh largest number of voters in Queensland. In fact, the electoral roll for Dawson is larger than the rolls for five of the Brisbane electorates. The percentage of voters is above average whereas in three of the seats held by the Australian Labor Party the percentage is well under that. Could I just give the percentages? The honourable member for Griffith, who did defer to me in this debate-I thank him for it-had an enrolment in his electorate on 31 March of 63,171. The Lilley electorate had 65,188 and the Brisbane electorate had 66,324 compared with the Dawson electorate of 74,000. We are one per cent above average and the other three are below average. So when the members of the ALP in Queensland want to talk about gerrymanders I draw their attention to the situation in the federal area. Here again it is a dilution of the voting representation and the general representation of country people in Queensland. I see this move-as I say, it has never been attempted before-as a diminution of that particular power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say that the Australian Labor Party, particularly its members in Queensland who have promoted this change, would have to face the people of north Queensland in this regard. It would be unfair to suggest that in representing north Queenslanders they would see in this Bill any improvement in the situation. In fact, they would see it as a lessening of power. Perhaps it is a cross that the Labor Party will have to bear in Queensland-particularly north Queensland-in this regard. I speak on this matter as somebody who represents a minor party as far as numbers are concerned but a major area in terms of size. I am sure that the people I represent would want me to speak against this Bill in this way. Having said that, I again make mention of the fact that the honourable member for Griffith did defer to me in this debate and I thank him for that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can well understand why the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is concerned. I feel sure that he has received a telephone call from the Premier of Queensland this evening. None of the other National Country Party members would stand up for the Premier; they would not be game. I congratulate the honourable member for Dawson for having the hide to represent his Premier here tonight. I will shortly remind him in my speech of a few of the Premier's acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take the opportunity tonight to congratulate Senator Colston for the drafting of the Senate Elections (Queensland) Bill and for the manner in which he presented and guided the Bill through the Senate. His efforts and research have been rewarded by the senators of Australia with the Bill being passed through that House without amendment or opposition. I hope we will have the same success in this House, which I feel will delight the honourable senator. </PARA>
<PARA> His second reading speech explains quite clearly why he was concerned with the situation existing in Queensland at the present moment so far as Senate elections are concerned. I am pleased to see the honourable senator in the gallery of the House this evening and I feel quite sure that he will be proud when this legislation passes through the House this evening. The honourable member for Dawson seemed to be concerned about the Bill. It will be interesting to see whether or not he votes for the legislation. I remind the honourable member that if he listens carefully to my speech he will see that it refers not only to the National Country Party but also to any political party in Queensland . I am sure he would not be worried after reading the second reading speech which was presented in the Senate by Senator Colston. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to require that senators for Queensland shall be directly chosen by the people of Queensland, voting as one electorate. It removes from the Parliament of the State of Queensland the right to divide Queensland into divisions for the purpose of electing senators and thus puts Queensland on the same footing as each of the other five States in relation to the election of senators. I do not know why the National Country Party is concerned, because we are trying to bring in legislation which may help it one day. In Australia, we have become accustomed to electing senators on a State- wide basis. This method of selection is used because of a provision in section 7 of the Constitution which specifies that, until the Federal Parliament provides otherwise, senators shall be chosen by the people of each State voting as one electorate. The Federal Parliament has not provided otherwise, so senators are currently chosen in State-wide ballots. It is clear, however, that should the Federal Parliament determine that there was a more preferable method of electing senators it could legislate to have that method adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> The constitutional requirements in relation to the election of senators for Queensland are more complex. The Constitution allows the Queensland State Parliament to divide the State into Senate electoral divisions and to determine the number of senators to be elected in each of those divisions. This provision is embodied in section 7 of the Constitution which, in part, states:</PARA>
<PARA> But until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of the State of Queensland, if that State be an original State, may make laws dividing the State into divisions and determining the number of Senators to be chosen for each division, and in the absence of such provision the State shall be one electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>In Queensland, senators are still chosen on the basis of a State-wide vote, because of two factors. Firstly, the Parliament of the Commonwealth has not yet provided that there shall be another method of selection. Secondly, the Parliament of Queensland has not made any laws dividing the State into divisions . The Queensland Parliament, however, retains the right to divide Queensland into divisions for the purpose of electing senators and to determine the number of senators to be chosen in each of those divisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Quick and Garran outline in The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth that this unique provision was inserted in the Constitution because of the:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . special circumstances of Queensland, its vast territory and scattered population, coupled with the fact that its population seemed to be naturally growing and developing in three divisions which may hereafter become separate States. </PARA>
<PARA>Lumb and Ryan in The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia Annotated note that the provision:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . was designed to assuage the feelings of separateness prevalent in the northern and central areas of the State, feelings which had adversely affected Queensland's participation in the convention activities. </PARA>
<PARA>It could be argued that although this special provision has been in the Constitution since Federation, it is unlikely that it will be used in the future . The fact that successive Queensland parliaments have seen fit not to establish a divisional structure for the election of senators could lend credence to this argument. Recent events, however, suggest that the part of section 7 dealing with electoral divisions in Queensland could well be used by a Queensland parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards the end of 1979, the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, announced that he would give serious consideration to those provisions of section 7 of the Constitution which specifically relate to Queensland. At that time, it was reported in the media that electoral divisions in Queensland could be drawn in such a way that in a half-Senate election, three National Party senators could be elected, with the Labor Party and the Liberal Party both having one of their candidates elected. When this matter was being discussed in Queensland in 1979, a three divisional structure was suggested. Division 1, which would elect one senator in a half-Senate election, consisted of the Federal electorates of Leichhardt, Herbert and Kennedy. Division 2, which would also elect one senator, consisted of the electorates of Dawson, Capricornia and Wide Bay. Maybe the honourable member for Dawson wants to be the senator for that area. The third division, which would elect three senators, consisted of the remaining 13 Queensland Federal electorates. Those three divisions could loosely be termed the northern, central and southern divisions respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> After the results of the 1980 Senate election were available, the detailed voting figures in Queensland permitted calculations to be made to determine the likely result if the five senators for Queensland had been elected on the three- divisional basis which has just been described. It should be acknowledged that if the Senate election had been based in a divisional structure, there may have been different candidates and different emphases in campaigning by the major political parties. Nevertheless, calculations made on the detailed results within those three divisions reveal that, all other things being equal, the National Party would have won the vacancies in Divisions 1 and 2 and one of three vacancies in Division 3. The Liberal and Labor Parties would each have won a vacancy in Division 3, giving an overall Queensland result of three National, one Liberal and one Labor. Considering that the actual result in the 1980 Senate election in Queensland was two Labor, one National, one Liberal and one Democrat , the divisional structure would have been particularly appealing for the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite naturally there was spirited debate in 1979 when Mr Bjelke-Petersen anounced that he would give serious consideration to the provisions contained in section 7 of the Constitution. Mr Bjelke-Petersen would have perceived that public opinion and perhaps his coalition partners would not have been on his side if he decided to press ahead with legislation to have senators elected in Queensland on a divisional basis. It was not surprising that he did not pursue the idea. The point which should be stressed is that the matter was given serious consideration in 1979 and it would be most unwise to presume that no future Queensland Parliament will legislate to set up a divisional structure for the election of senators. It should also be kept in mind that it would not be difficult to devise a divisional system-even one which embodied a one vote, one value concept-which was biased towards any particular party, not necessarily the National Party, Section 7 of the Constitution could be used by any political party with a majority in the Queensland Legislative Assembly to set electoral divisions which would assist its Senate candidates. </PARA>
<PARA> If appropriate legislation is not enacted by the Federal Parliament, there is little if any doubt that some future maverick Queensland Government will use this archaic provision of section 7 of the Constitution. It could choose its timing in such a way that the Federal Parliament would be temporarily powerless to frustrate the actions of the Queensland Government. For example, the Governor -General on 19 December 1980, prorogued the Federal Parliament. If the State Government had acted on that day to set up Senate electoral divisions and had subsequently issued writs for the election of senators in those divisions, the Federal Parliament could have done nothing until the newly elected parliament met after the elections. Indeed, it would have been required to accept the senators who had been elected under the divisional system. It would be much better for the Federal Parliament to act now, rather than be out-manoeuvred by a future Queensland Government intent on using section 7 to influence the outcome of Senate elections in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members might well say that it would never happen, but let me just refresh their recollection concerning some of the past performances of our present Queensland Government. It is a State government that is controlled by a premier who charges his stooges $25,000 to have his company at breakfast; who knocks down historic buildings such as the Belle Vue Hotel in the dark of night; who allows freehold coastal land to be sold to overseas interests; who refuses to declare the whole of the Great Barrier Reef a marine park; who reigns over draconian legislation such as land rights for Aboriginals; who tries stand-over tactics with the Federal Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) in order to persuade him to have the law changed to enable him--</PARA>

<PARA> The passage of this Bill will prevent the Parliament of Queensland from legislating to set up a divisional structure for the election of senators. When it was being drafted legal advice was given which suggested that the power granted the Commonwealth Parliament to otherwise provide could be interpreted in two ways. One interpretation is that the power allows the Commonwealth Parliament to provide expressly that Queensland senators shall be chosen by the people of that State voting as one electorate. The other interpretation is that the power simply allows the Commonwealth Parliament to deny the competence of the Queensland Parliament to make laws dividing the State into Senate electoral divisions. Therefore this Bill has been drafted to cover both possibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I mention that the Bill would in no way affect the Senate representation of any new State which may be established within the existing boundaries of Queensland. The representation of any new State is provided for in section 121 of the Constitution, which states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has come to my attention that for many pensioners , living in a nursing home is like living in a prison. I hasten to add that this is not because of the conditions or treatment received in individual nursing homes but because of the Government's policy of not paying the Commonwealth benefit to the nursing home when the patient is absent from it. The funding arrangements in private nursing homes vary. However, as they are able to set their own fees the Commonwealth Government pays, in New South Wales at least, a basic benefit of $161 a week towards the bed cost. The balance is made up by the patient and generally will take almost the entire pension. However, if a patient is required to go into hospital for a short period, or wishes to spend several days with a relative, the only way in which he or she can be assured that there will be a bed to come back to is by paying the Commonwealth benefit. Unless a pensioner can afford to pay $161 a week, plus his or her pension, he or she would be unable to leave the home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just last week a constituent of mine telephoned my office to inquire about this kind of situation. Her 84-year-old mother, who has cancer, lives in a nursing home. Last week she was required to go into hospital for a week to receive cobalt treatment. My constituent said that she had been told by the nursing home that in order to keep the bed available for her mother when she came back from hospital she would have to pay $214.20, made up of $161 Commonwealth benefit and $53.20 patient contribution. The woman could not believe that this could be the case. Unfortunately, I had to tell her that it was. As the doctor has informed her that her mother would require similar treatment at regular intervals, she is concerned about whether she would be able continually to pay such costs. She is also extremely concerned that her mother might find out about this. Her mother is very old and very sick. To be told that she would have to change nursing homes each time she came out of hospital if she did not pay $161 each week, would be devastating. The importance to an old person of being in familiar surroundings and with friends cannot be measured. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is not unique; people find themselves in such predicaments daily . Those who have relatives who are willing to pay what is called the bed retention fee, are at least able to spend some time away from the nursing home. However, those who cannot afford to pay, and have no relatives who can do so, are confined to the home, even though they may require hospitalisation. I believe that this situation demonstrates the callous and heartless attitude of the Government. Last November the Minister for Health announced that the Commonwealth would meet the cost of up to one night's absence per month from private nursing homes, provided the patient's doctor supported the request for overnight absences. However, the Minister made no provision for the people who had to go into hospital for a limited amount of time. There should be some provision for the people in this situation. To do this there must be an amendment to the legislation. I call on the Government to do this as a matter of urgency and as a matter of compassion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time available to me tonight I wish to draw attention once again to the situation regarding meat inspection at meat processing works throughout Australia. For instance, New South Wales has three sets of meat inspectors-one for local government, one for the State Government and one for the Federal Government; that is, the Department of Primary Industry. This is a ridiculous situation. I feel that an abattoir which is processing meat for the domestic market should come under the responsibility of a State meat inspector. Where a works is processing meat for the export market the inspection should be carried out by a DPI inspector. Throughout the State at present there are three sets of inspectors in our works. This absolutely ridiculous situation is costing the housewife and the meat industry hundreds of thousands of dollars, possibly millions of dollars over a period. There is no doubt that the works are overserviced by inspectors. The downturn in cattle numbers in New South Wales and throughout Australia means that the usual numbers are not going through the works. I feel they are overstaffed by a long shot but I cannot get this message through to the Department of Primary Industry. Indeed, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) is a bit tardy about dealing with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In New South Wales abattoirs have closed at Dubbo, Goulburn, Moree, Guyra, Tenterfield and Wallangarra and in other places. Where have the inspectors from these works gone? Surely they must be available for service in other parts of Australia. I would like to see this situation corrected in my State. The State Government will not give way. The State Department of Agriculture has built up a large number of inspectors. The Federal Government will not give way. At present it is a no win situation. It is understood by me that other States have a single meat inspection system. For example, I understand that this system operates in South Australia. The other day the Minister, in replying to a question regarding meat inspection, indicated in this House that it was hoped that the meat inspection service in Victoria would be performed by one section of the meat inspection service. Inspectors employed by the Department of Primary Industry let us down badly regarding the meat scandal when kangaroo meat was mixed with beef and sent overseas. They let us down badly in Victoria and Western Australia . This is a great shame because it caused a great problem for our meat exports and gave Australia a bad name. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the rules meat inspectors are required to work shift work. The Gunnedah Shire Abattoir, with which I happen to be connected, wants them to do shift work. It cannot get the DPI to agree to it. Yet the DPI has agreed that inspectors may work shift work at night at the metropolitan meat works at Homebush in Sydney. In view of the restrictions which are now imposed on our works owing to the meat scandal, it is necessary for inspectors to be on the premises at night. The rules state that shift work is allowed. Yet we cannot get agreement for the inspectors to work at night on a shift work basis in certain parts of New South Wales. Surely this situation can be altered. I ask the Minister to take it up with the Department of Primary Industry and ensure that this service is offered on a shift basis at those works in New South Wales. This would greatly assist the meat industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not even take the full five minutes allotted to me. Each year Freedom House in the United States of America brings out a tabulation of the ratings of political rights and civil liberties and the status of freedom in every country and dependency in the world. I think they are important ratings. I think that when we get representations from all kinds of countries and information, or alleged information, from lots of countries it is worthwhile looking up that list to see just what kind of status those countries have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Freedom House first published these comparative surveys of freedom back in January-February 1973. They have been issued in its journal every January since then. As a subscriber to the journal it has given me great pleasure to incorporate the surveys in Hansard. I think we should all remember that freedom is the basic quality of democracy, the political arrangement resulting from a yearning, I suppose, for human dignity. I think it is terribly important that we are continually aware of progress, or the opposite of that, as far as political rights and civil liberties are concerned in societies all around the world. Some of those countries which most often criticise other countries for their alleged dictatorships are often the ones which appear in this table with number seven- number one being as good as one can get and number seven being the opposite. I am pleased to be able to say that for the tenth year in a row Australia is number one in terms of political rights and civil liberties. It has continued to be considered as a free country. The list of the least free countries, in alphabetical order, goes from Afghanistan to Vietnam. That has not changed very much in the years since I have been submitting this list to the Parliament. I ask leave for these tables to be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THE TABULATED RATINGS</PARA>
<PARA> The accompanying Table of Independent Nations and Table of Related Territories rate each state or territory on seven-point scales for political and civil freedoms, and then provide an overall judgment of each as ''free'', ''partly free'', or ''not free''. In each scale, a rating of (1) is freest and (7) least free. Instead of using absolute standards, standards are comparative-that is, most observers would be likely to judge states rated (1) as freer than those rated (2), and so on. No state, of course, is absolutely free or unfree, but the degree of freedom does make a great deal of difference to the quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> In political rights, states rated (1) have a fully competitive electoral process and those elected clearly rule. Most West European democracies belong here. Relatively free states may receive a (2) because, although the electoral process works and the elected rule, there are factors which cause us to lower our rating of the effective equality of the process. These factors may include extreme economic inequality, illiteracy, or intimidating violence. They also include the weakening of effective competition that is implied by the absence of periodic shifts in rule from one group or party to another. </PARA>
<PARA> Below this level, political ratings of (3) through (5) represent successively less effective implementation of democratic processes. Mexico, for example, has periodic elections and limited opposition, but for many years its governments have been selected outside the public view by the leaders of factions within the one dominant Mexican party. Governments of states rated (5) sometimes have no effective voting processes at all, but strive for consensus among a variety of groups in society in a way weakly analogous to those of the democracies. States at (6) do not allow competitive electoral processes that would give the people a chance to voice their desire for a new ruling party or for a change in policy. The rulers of states at this level assume that one person or a small group has the right to decide what is best fo the nation, and that no one should be allowed to challenge that right. Such rulers do respond, however, to popular desire in some areas, or respect (and therefore are constrained by) belief systems (e.g., Islam) that are the general property of the society as a whole. At (7) the political despots at the top appear by their actions to feel little constraint from either public opinion or popular tradition. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the scale for civil liberties, in countries rated (1) publications are not closed because of the expression of rational political opinion, especially when the intent of the expression is to affect the legitimate political process. No major media are simply conduits for government propaganda. The courts protect the individual; persons are not imprisoned for their opinions ; private rights and desires in education, occupation, religion, residence, and so on, are generally respected; law-abiding persons do not fear for their lives because of their rational political activities. States at this level include most traditional democracies. There are, of course, flaws in the liberties of all of these states, and these flaws are significant when measured against the standards these states set themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Movement down from (2) to (7) represents a steady loss of the civil freedoms we have detailed. Compared to (1), the police and courts of states at (2) have more authoritarian traditions. In some cases they may simply have a less institutionalized or secure set of liberties, such as in Portugal or Greece. Those rated (3) or below may have political prisoners and generally varying forms of censorship. Too often their security services practice torture. States rated (6) almost always have political prisoners; usually the legitmate media are completey under government supervision; there is no right of assembly; and, often, travel, residence, and occupation are narrowly restricted. However, at (6 ) there still may be relative freedom in private conversation, especially in the home; illegal demonstrations do take place; underground literature is published; and so on. At (7) there is pervading fear, little independent expression takes place in private, almost no expressions of opposition emerge in the police-state environment, and execution is often swift and sure. </PARA>
<PARA> A cumulative judgment of ''free,'' ''partly free,'' or ''not free'' is made on the basis of the foregoing seven-point ratings, and an understanding of how they were derived. Generally, states rated (1) and (2) will be ''free''; those at (3) , (4), and (5), ''partly free''; and those at (6) and (7), ''not free''. When the ratings for political rights and civil liberties differ, the status of freedom must be decided by rough averaging. It must be remembered, however, that the ratings are not arithmetical units, but merely categories on arbitrary scales. There are, of course, marginal cases. A (6) and a (5) may lead either to a rating of ''not free'' or ''partly free'', depending on whether the (5) and (6 ) are a high (5) or low (5), a high (6) or low (6). </PARA>
<PARA> The tables also include an entry for ''outlook.'' Since we are not in a position to adequately judge the futures of all the societies under review, this column reports many fewer trends than a more detailed study would discover. Primarily, we include cases where a forthcoming election appears likely to improve the freedoms of a country, or a downward trend is in prospect because a retrogressive process underway at the time of the Survey has not yet acutally reached fruition. By the nature of the signals we use, more pluses are likely to appear under ''out-look'' than minuses. </PARA>

<PARA>Notes to the Table</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>1 The scales use the numbers 1-7 with 1 comparatively offering the highest level of political or civil rights and 7 the lowest. A plus or minus following a rating indicates an improvement or decline in 1981. A rating marked with a period (*) as been changed since the last survey due to revaluation by the author. This does not imply any change in the country. For further information on the scale and Survey. see Freedom in the World 1978. </PARA>
<PARA>2 A free state is designated by F. a partly free state by PF. and a not-free state by NF. </PARA>
<PARA>3 A positive outlook for freedom is indicated by a plus sign, a negative outlook , by a minus and relative stability of ratings by a zero. The outlook for freedom is based on the problems the country is facing the way the government and people are reacting to these problems, and the longer-run political traditions of the society. A judgment of outlook may also reflect an imminent change, such as the expected adoption of a meaningful new constitution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just refer the House tonight to an article that appeared in this week's Business Review Weekly which is rather interesting but also very startling. It refers to the underground economy. We have known this by various names-the cash economy, the subterranean economy and the black economy. Basically, it is that part of the economy that is lost to revenue, lost to production and lost to statistics because people are wilfully evading tax-not avoiding tax-on what they earn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The article refers to a survey made by the Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd 18 months ago in which it estimated then that the underground economy represented 10 per cent of gross domestic product. The figure, on a 1980-81 valuation, was $ 12.7 billion. This is a startling figure when one realises that the underground economy, the cash economy, is not included in GDP. Details are not available to record whether a person is employed or unemployed. As a result, many of the statistics we have thrown at us today are inaccurate. The article lays the patterns of the Australian ethos by saying that for a long time the underground economy has been part of the easy-going Australian way of life. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>When the household drains block it's natural for a plumber mate to fix the problem for $40 cash. When a work colleague slips away 30 minutes before knocking-off time to do a casual shift taxi driving you automatically cover up his absence to the boss. </PARA>
<PARA> Everybody comes into contact with the underground economy: some people earn their livelihood in it; others a cream on their wage. Most of us are passive participants who, given the chance, gladly get a job done on the cheap and don't think twice about paying a tradesman by cash rather than cheque. </PARA>
<PARA>In one way we have the active participants. In many cases we have passive participants. </PARA>
<PARA>This means that Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) labor market, inflation and savings figures are inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody yet knows that figure of inaccuracy. I think it is a matter of grave concern, when we are talking about taxation in Australia, what is equitable and what is reasonable, to have illegal marketing going on to this extent in the taxation system. My estimation is that between $4 billion and $5 billion is lost to Commonwealth revenues every year just by this economy. If that money were put back into the system, how much more equitable the tax system could be made. What it does is to prevent a real reduction in tax rates because those who are on pay -as-you-earn taxation, those who are honest taxpayers or perhaps, should I say, those who do not have any opportunity of evasion are called upon to carry this burden of $4 billion to $5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the figure has risen startlingly from 1973 to the present. The important feature is that that figure will only increase; it will not decrease. I understand that in Italy the 'black' economy is said to account for 40 per cent of all incomes. Australia is fast embarking on that way with the estimate here being 20 per cent of all incomes or 10 per cent of gross domestic product. It is important for us to realise this point when we look at statistics. Often we base a figure on the GDP. For instance, the tax take of the Commonwealth is often referred to as a percentage of GDP. If we take the GDP as being 10 per cent greater than it is, in fact tax rates are not as high as they were many years ago. We are often charged by the Opposition that the unemployment rate is some figure that we pluck out of the air and that the level is actually so much larger. If we take $12 billion to $13 billion as the amount lost in revenue from the cash economy and convert that to payment of $10,000 a year, representing the average salary paid to workers, that would mean-and I hope my calculations are right-that 127,000 people who could quite possibly be on unemployment benefits would gain work. I suggest that, far from the rate of unemployment being larger in this country than what it actually is, as the Opposition often claims, in actual fact it is smaller because of the effects of the cash economy. The people I am concerned about are those people-the youth of the nation-who under the pay- as-you-earn system are victims of the present situation. I am particularly concerned for those people. </PARA>
