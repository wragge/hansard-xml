<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Communications confirm or deny claims made on today's A.M. program that there are links between Telecom Australia officials and organised crime? Is it true, as claimed, that as quickly as police raid starting price betting premises, some with up to 50 telephones, the telephones are re-installed in new premises and that numbers are changed within 24 hours? Does this contrast sharply with the long delays often experienced by potential telephone subscribers? Has the practice reached such dimensions that any system of police raids is successfully negated by the next race day? What is the Minister's response to the call on the A.M. program this morning for a full scale investigation into these allegations?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2139" SPEAKER="Sinclair The Rt Hon I.McC." NAMEID="5E4" PARTY="NP" ELECTORATE="NEW ENGLAND" MINISTERIAL="LEADER OF THE HOUSE; COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At no stage and in no way is the Government prepared to condone any behaviour by officers within Telcom or any other officers that in any way breaches the law. It is for that reason that Telecom lays down very tight procedures which inhibit the provision of telephone connections to any known illegal activity. Allegations were made last year in the Press, which I referred to Telecom and asked it to take up, regarding the treatment of starting price bookmakers. I understand that this matter has been discussed at the recurring meetings of Police Ministers, the last one being held last November. My colleague the Minister for Administrative Services has advised me that he is awaiting a report from police officers, who are now intent on trying to ensure that there has been no failure to pursue inquiries, that any illegality in the connections pursued by Telecom has been corrected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Telecom has advised me that there have been at least 40 disconnections as a result of illegal use of the telephone system this financial year. There has also been a number of post-conviction disconnections where, as a result of action taken within the courts by police authorities, the telephone has been seen to be used for illegal purposes. I would hope that if the honourable gentleman or the person who made the assertion on the A.M. program this morning have any information that could be of help in identifying persons concerned he would pass that information on to the New South Wales Police Force, to the joint task force that is presently inquiring generally into drug activities and so on, or to the Federal Police.</PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of Telecom itself, this activity is in no way affecting its capacity to connect subscribers as and when they apply. Every effort is being made by Telecom to connect new applicants for telephones as soon as possible, subject to the availability of suitable local facilities. If the honourable gentleman has any information about this matter, I would be very happy if he passed it on to the sources I have mentioned. However, I certainly see insufficient substance in any of the assertions made to date to justify any wider-based inquiry. If the honourable gentleman has any such information which might assist in broadening the necessity for an inquiry, I would be very happy to receive it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer will be aware of the opposition to the Government's proposal to amend the sales tax regulations to allow retailers, if they wish, to require local government and related organisations, parents and citizens organisations and other organisations to pay sales tax and then claim the refund . Is it still the intention of the Government to proceed with these amendments?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2140" SPEAKER="Howard The Hon J.W." NAMEID="ZD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BENNELONG" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the opposition, particularly from a large number of local government bodies in Victoria. I would say to the honourable gentleman that that opposition has arisen as a result of a misunderstanding of the announcement I made on 18 December and also a misunderstanding of subsequent announcements I made in an endeavour to remove the original misunderstanding. At no stage has it ever been contemplated by the Government that people would be obliged to take advantage of the procedure that I outlined on 18 December. The purpose of that procedure was to enable bodies which would be exempt from the payment of sales tax included in the class of sales tax extension, which has been rejected in another place, to pay, in effect, the sales tax, and then to claim an exemption. But it was to be quite optional, and those purchasers were still to retain the right to deal on an exemption basis in respect of individual items with individual retailers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, be that as it may, the fact is that, now, through the combined opposition of the Labor Party and the Democrats, the legislation has been stalled in the Senate. In those circumstances, it is highly questionable whether there is any point in proceeding with giving effect to the announcement that I made on 18 December. I had to obtain advice on certain procedural matters from the Taxation Office, but my own disposition-and, I believe, that of the Government-is that as the 2 1/2 per cent is not going ahead, the exemption procedure that I outlined is, therefore, academic, and that ought not to go ahead.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question without notice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the Minister to a report in Monday's edition of the Australian Financial Review that there has been opposition by the Department of Trade and Resources and the Department of the Treasury to the Australian Government's ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty. Is the Minister in a position to explain why these departmental differences have been allowed to become public, so that they can now be used by United States interests as an argument against ratification of the treaty in order to protect such narrow interests as those of the deep sea mining companies? Will the Minister indicate to the heads of the relevant government departments the necessity of having an Australian bipartisan attitude, which is in the interests of the developing countries, particularly the countries in the Pacific region? Will he also indicate to the departmental heads the words of the Prime Minister of Fiji-that unless the United States ratifies this treaty, it will not have a friend in the Pacific?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2140" SPEAKER="Street The Hon A.A." NAMEID="FS7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="CORANGAMITE" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to the comments just made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I am informed that there was agreement between the departments about Australia's attitude. Be that as it may, government policy is made by the Government, and the Australian delegation was instructed to vote in favour of the Convention on the Law of the Sea at the 11th session, which ended in New York on 30 April. I think that it would be of interest to the House if I outlined precisely what happened at the end of the conference. The convention was adopted by a vote of 130 in favour, four against, and 17 abstentions. As I mentioned a moment ago, Australia voted in favour, and we expect that the text will be open for signature later this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This has brought one step closer the objectives of this Government and, indeed, of the Australian Parliament, of getting a comprehensive and widely accepted international convention. The text adopted contains many new principles and provisions which have been accepted by consensus after a great many years' work. I extend thanks to the members of successive Australian delegations who have worked so hard over this period. There is considerable satisfaction at the widespread support for the convention. It is, nevertheless, disappointing that the text was not adopted by consensus, and it was particularly disappointing to us that the United States voted against the convention.</PARA>
<PARA> We understand the concerns of the United States, most of which were directed particularly at section XI, relating to the exploitation of the deep sea bed resources and, indeed, we sympathise with some of those concerns. But I hope that, as the heat of debate cools in the aftermath of the conference, the United States and the other countries which did not support adoption of the convention will carefully reconsider their positions as the convention is open for signature. I hope that they will look again at the advantages of working within a secure and agreed international framework, even though it might be at some cost to their own national goals. I hope that they will agree to do that.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2141" SPEAKER="Viner The Hon R.I." NAMEID="EE6" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="STIRLING" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE6">Mr VINER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can report to the House the results of that conference. It was indeed a very successful one because an undertaking was given by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Confederation of Australian Industry that they would investigate, with their own affiliates, the existing consultative arrangements and dispute-settling procedures on the waterfront and in the maritime industries. That was an important undertaking because it means that the parties themselves recognise that there is room for improvement. The ACTU and the CAI have agreed to provide me with an interim report so that I may in turn report to the Premiers at their June conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the features of the conference last Friday was the number of people who were there. About 50 delegates attended. They represented 18 of the 22 unions which had been invited and 8 employer bodies, including the Australian National Line and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. The very fact that so many people and so many different unions and organisations had to be invited does identify an immediate problem on the waterfront and in the maritime industries. There are moves already afoot for the development of common negotiations and a common award on the waterfront and of course to reduce the number of unions with which employers have to deal. I understand that on the maritime side similar moves are being made in the background within the union movement.</PARA>
<PARA> It is against that background, of course, amongst others, that the Government put forward its proposals to open the door within our industrial legislation for the formation of industry unions. The observation was made to me that when one looked around the conference and saw the number of different organisations and unions involved one could immediately put one's finger on one of the fundamental problems facing the waterfront and the maritime industries of Australia. I look forward to receiving the reports from the ACTU and the CAI because I think they will provide us, from a basis of self-examination, with a foundation upon which we can do further work to improve the industrial climate in the ports of Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a large measure of success in the operation of the Government's manpower and training programs including the Special Youth Employment Training Program to which the honourable member has referred. However , the success has not been confined to that program. On the evidence that I have seen, a number of the other programs have been very successful. The evidence for that proposition is evidence which comes to me from employers. Indeed, I was at a function on Friday where a number of employers spoke very highly of the success so far as they were concerned of the Special Youth Employment Training Program. It is not simply a question of the fact that a subsidy is paid because there is evidence-and I can certainly go this far-that well over half of the young people who undertake work experience under that program either stay on with the same employer after the subsidy has come to an end or virtually immediately obtain employment without a subsidy with another employer. That is the first part of the evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second part of the evidence relates to an investigation of the operation of the program undertaken recently by the Bureau of Labour Market Research. This is being conducted with the assistance of a detailed survey. I have seen some preliminary results of that survey and an analysis is being undertaken to provide me with the details of the results. However, the early and preliminary results indicate quite clearly that that scheme is successful. It may not be the case that other schemes are as successful. We have never maintained that there is a 100 per cent success rate with respect to young people and others undertaking training under our programs. Nevertheless, a great deal of evidence is available to suggest that the programs have been successful.</PARA>
<PARA> There may be some shortfall in the number undertaking work experience and training under the programs. It is very difficult to predict accurately at any time of the year the complete use that will be made of the scheme for the succeeding 12 months or, indeed, for any long period. As a result the Government announced recently a concerted drive through the Commonwealth Employment Service to encourage more employers to take on more young unemployed people under the Special Youth Employment Training Program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the pre-Budget consultations between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government the possibility of more detailed discussions taking place, possibly on a tripartite level between employers, representatives of employees and the Government, was discussed. The Government, for its part, reacted positively to the idea of such talks taking place. It was agreed between the Government and the executive of the ACTU that for talks of that kind to have any prospect of success in making a contribution towards an improvement in national economic understanding, it would be necessary in the first instance to agree to a sensible basis on which the talks should take place. To that end we invited the ACTU to put to us concrete proposals as to how the talks might be structured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have, through my colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations, discussed the matter in general terms with a number of employers' representatives. The Government sees great value in fostering such talks taking place. I think all of us in this House would be aware that nothing but good can come of a greater understanding between employers, employees and the Government of the economic consequences of certain action by different sections of the community, not just the actions of employees, but also the actions of government and employers. Equally, we all recognise that overnight we cannot bring about a change in climate and in attitude. If we are to have any prospect of something useful coming out of discussions of this kind, on the one hand there must be a willingness on the part of all parties to respond positively-for our part we have that willingness and we have already responded positively-and on the other hand, equally, we must have realistic and not unrealistic aspirations as to what might be achieved.</PARA>

Most of these retirements are in the senior levels of the Third Division of the Public Service , as exampled by the Taxation Office, where 90 per cent of the 114 voluntary retirements were from that Third Division-in other words, those with the high pensions who can afford to retire and go on part time consultative work, et cetera.

The matter was discussed and debated for many months-indeed, I think for a year or two-before it finally became law and therefore a backlog of people would have wanted to take advantage of the provisions. I find it odd that the honourable gentleman believes that people within the Public Service but who wish to get out should virtually be conscripted to stay within the Public Service. I would not have thought that that would work well and to the advantage of the Public Service, for the benefit of the morale of the Public Service or for service to the Commonwealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen accounts, as I am sure all honourable members of the House have, of the two large pro-Solidarity demonstrations held in Warsaw in recent days. The demonstrations emphasise the continuing gulf between the Polish people and the martial law regime there, despite some relaxation of the martial law restrictions. While the Government welcomes any betterment of the present lot of the Polish people, we cannot lose sight of the fact that martial law, itself, still remains in force, that thousands of people are still interned and that many factories still remain subject to military discipline. I note that in recent days the Polish Ministry of the Interior has issued a warning relating to the present relaxation, saying that internment, reinternment and summary penal provisions are still in operation under martial law regulations. As I stated in my Press release of earlier this year, the Government calls for the lifting of martial law in Poland, the release of detainees and an early return to the circumstances in which the people of Poland can be left free to decide their own future. These conditions have not been met and until they are the Government cannot consider conducting business as usual with the military regime in Poland.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it also a fact that today pensioners who earn more than the allowable income are already the highest marginally taxed people in Australia because for every additional $2 they earn the Department of Social Security takes $1 and the Australian Taxation Office takes another 32c-a total of 66c in the dollar compared with the highest marginal tax of 60c in the dollar? Will the Treasurer ensure that any measures necessary to remove these unconscionable imposts upon pensioners will be taken?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that shortly, when the pension next goes up, it will be closer to the ceiling of the zero rate step in the tax scale. But as the Minister for Social Security and I have said time and again-I repeat it in the interests of allaying unnecessary fears on the part of pensioners-there is no substance to any suggestion that as a result of the next increase any person who relies on the pension alone will be subject to tax. To raise the matter in the manner it was raised by the honourable member for Hunter is calculated only to disturb and not to allay the fears of Australian pensioners. It does the welfare of Australian pensioners no good at all for the honourable member to try, by a cheap trick, to make misleading representations about the effects of the Government's policies. The honourable member has again talked about the marginal rate of tax payable by pensioners. He is talking about the combination of the withdrawal rate of 50c in the dollar and the application, for the first time, of tax. If he knows anything about the history of taxation and pensions in Australia, and I am sure that he does because he follows these matters very closely, he knows that that kind of charge has been capable of being made ever since the taxation of pensions was first introduced-not by a Liberal Government but by a former Labor Government of this country. That sort of charge has always been capable of being made, but to suggest that the combined effect of the withdrawal of the pension at a rate of 50c in the dollar and the application of the standard rate of taxation of 32c represents in reality a marginal tax rate is completely to misread the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was in 1979 that the Government made a decision to seek a commercial feasibility study of the possibilities of having a uranium enrichment industry in Australia. As a result, the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia was formed. It consisted of four major Australian companies: Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, CSR Ltd, Peko-Wallsend Ltd and Western Mining Corporation Ltd. This group set about looking at the various forms of technology. In April of last year it presented a pre-feasibility study of the work that it had done. The Government then gave it further authority to go ahead with a full commercial feasibility study and it has been working on that. Of course, the success of a uranium enrichment industry in Australia will depend wholly on whether it can be competitive. I think there is every chance of such an industry developing in Australia and being competitive because this group is not in a hurry. It is looking at the progress that is being made in technology. Changes are taking place all the time. It is hoped that in the course of the group's study, which will probably take a couple of years, it will be able to pick up the most advanced and latest technology which, if we do move into an enrichment industry, will make it competitive with the rest of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Education whether it is a fact, as declared in the final report of the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, that there has been an overall decline in the number of students entering tertiary education and that a major reason lies in the 'striking reduction in recent years in the public financial assistance for tertiary students'. Is this claim supported by the fact that the maximum Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance is now worth nearly $12 a week less in real terms than in 1974 and the further fact that the proportion of tertiary students receiving public assistance has fallen from 79 per cent in 1974 to 59 per cent currently, that is , a drop of 20 per cent in the period of the Fraser Government? In view of the convincing evidence establishing that the TEAS allowance is inadequate to provide a reasonable level of support for students from lower socio-economic homes dependent on this allowance, and the extraordinary reduction in general public assistance available for tertiary students since this Government came to office, will the Minister guarantee in the forthcoming Budget to increase appropriately the TEAS allowance and ease the severe means test that so savagely discriminates against students and their families with greatest need?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the report referred to by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to student allowances and the question of enrolments in universities. There has been a change in the balance of enrolments in universities and colleges of advanced education. I am sure that this is also known to the Leader of the Opposition. In recent times there has been an increase in the number of students to whom we would generally refer as mature age students. There has also been a decline in the number of students going straight from school into universities and colleges of advanced education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of reasons have been advanced for this change in the balance, including desire on the part of some potential students of universities and colleges of advanced education to take some time off after leaving school before returning to full time education. It has also been advanced-as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition-that the level of student assistance allowance, or the Tertiary Education Allowance Scheme as we call it, is also a contributing factor . In responding to that part of the honourable member's question, I draw attention to the fact that it has been stated by many people in the higher education field that when, I think in 1974, the previous Government did away with tuition fees and TEAS was introduced, there was not a big change-indeed there was not a noticeable change-in the entry into higher education of people from the lower socio-economic group. I know that the Leader of the Opposition did not seek to suggest this, but it is not true, as suggested by some people, that the assistance provided by way of TEAS is the factor that determines whether more young people from the lower socio-economic group enter universities and colleges of advanced education.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned about this whole area of student assistance. It is being reviewed at the present time in the context of the forthcoming Budget. The Government has also announced its intention to introduce a students loan scheme. I emphasise that this proposed loan scheme, which the Government hopes will be operating at the beginning of 1983, will be in addition to TEAS and not a substitute for TEAS. It is a new scheme that is being devised by the Government to provide another means of support for students undertaking higher education. I give the Leader of the Opposition and the House an assurance that the level of TEAS and the means test applying to TEAS will be reviewed in the Budget context. In addition, details regarding the proposed loans scheme, that is, eligibility and the conditions under which loans will be provided, will be considered in the Budget context and an announcement will be made soon after that.</PARA>

I ask the Minister: First , what are the Commonwealth's priorities for construction of national highways in New South Wales? Secondly, what action is being taken to implement these priorities?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since 1971 priorities for the national highway program in New South Wales have indeed been shared between the Sydney-Newcastle section of the northern highway and the Hume Highway between Sydney and Melbourne. The Commonwealth's first priority has been the Hume Highway which, of course, links two very important population centres. In May last year I wrote to the New South Wales Minister for Roads informing him that I would expect the New South Wales program for national highways to be consistent with the ratio of funds between the two roads, that is, the Newcastle-Sydney road and the Sydney-Melbourne road. I was surprised to receive the program from the Minister in New South Wales three months after the commencement of the financial year, asking the Commonwealth to increase the effort on the Sydney to Queensland border road by 7 per cent and to reduce the effort on the Hume Highway by 6 per cent. I sought from him a revised program to conform with the Commonwealth program. Five months have now elapsed and I have had no further response from him. So far this has not resulted in a hold up of any work in New South Wales because projects were approved on the Hume Highway and, of course, some projects were ongoing and were approved on the Sydney-Newcastle end. But it seems extraordinary that the New South Wales Minister would not have a sense of urgency regarding full approval for the New South Wales highways program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can assure the honourable gentleman that we will maintain our priorities. There are some very important unfinished works on the Hume Highway and, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the New South Wales Government will adhere to the priorities we have established. Of course, the State governments receive each month one-twelfth of the total sum for all categories of roads. If New South Wales continues in this vein we may have to cease payment on a monthly basis.</PARA>

If so, what does he intend to do about this situation? Will all CYSS participants who engage in work experience or voluntary activities be automatically covered by existing workers compensation provisions in each State?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did have brought to my attention the article to which the honourable member refers, including the part in which I was recorded accurately as having said that the Government has received a great deal of praise from a large number of Community Youth Support Scheme projects and their committees for the reforms that have been made to the scheme which is now working very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the three matters to which the honourable member referred, firstly, it was never intended that young people who are participants in CYSS would work on a full time basis. They work for work experience. That is intended to give them the experience which will better fit them when they apply for jobs. They will then be able to say accurately that they have had practical working experience and that will put them in a much better and stronger position when they apply for jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the workers compensation aspect, the policy in the past has been that the committee which has been given funds to cover all or most of the running costs of the scheme was given the responsibility of taking out its own insurance. Many of the committees have done that. Those committees which have understandably drawn our attention to that matter perhaps may not be aware of the fact that other committees have taken out their own workers compensation insurance from time to time. If, however, there is a particular and widespread problem with respect to that matter I will, of course, investigate it.</PARA>
<PARA> With respect to Commonwealth Employment Service officers attending committee meetings, it will be recalled that it was felt, we believe on very good grounds, that there should be more of a liaison between the Commonwealth Employment Service and the CYSS projects to make the local committees more aware of employment opportunities in the neighbourhood and to make CYSS more employment oriented. We believe that that was a good decision. It was never intended or suggested that the CES managers should attend every single meeting of the local committees and I would be surprised if in fact anyone expected them to do so. They will be there and they will be available when their assistance is needed.</PARA>
<PARA> I have not as yet had it brought to my attention that there has been any problem in respect of overtime. I freely concede that in the future there may well be such a problem because there is not unlimited money to be made available for overtime for these particular public servants or, indeed, for any other public servants. But I am quite confident that there will be enough money available to enable the CES officers to perform their proper functions.</PARA>

The Australian has this morning editorialised on the basis of this report, saying that it is difficult to see much advantage in this proposal and that no doubt Mr Macphee will be able to make clear precisely what he has in mind. I am informed that Mr Sam Lipski on radio station 3AW in Melbourne this morning has expressed similar reservations and has called upon me to make a clear statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to make it quite clear to the House and to the Australian people that the Australian report yesterday is utterly wrong. It is a complete misrepresentation of what I said. I did not say that Australia should adopt a second language. I am in fact completely opposed to any such proposition. It is a nonsense and it is something which I would never have thought of advocating. Specifically, I reject the suggestion that Australia should ever have a policy leading to a reduction in the predominance of English in areas such as the law, the administration, education and even in day to day conversation. That was what was imputed to me. Any genuine examination of my speech which was released to the Press will show that I was not advocating what has been attributed to me. My speech in fact concerned multiculturalism, not national language policy. In it I stressed the importance of what one might term our core culture, which includes the English language, our Parliament, our judicial system and the freedoms which are integral to those. I stress that successive waves of migrants have embraced those values and that they are the essential core of our society. What I said on language was that I hoped that an understanding of other languages would enrich our own society while maintaining Australia's social cohesion and would extend our effective dealings with other countries. </PARA>

But in any event, had that been done the editorial should not have eventuated. Even though the editorial referred to reports of what I said, the only person who interpreted my speech as calling for a second language was the Australian's own reporter. So the editorial fed upon its own misrepresentations. That reporter set up straw arguments which the editorial demolished. I agree with the demolition but I resent my name being associated with that newspaper's creation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order that this astonishing misrepresentation of my speech might be fairly dispelled I draw the attention of those interested in this subject to the fact that my speech will be in the next issue of the Commonwealth Record so that all reasonable persons might judge for themselves what I really said. Because of the number of people who have phoned my office protesting about what has been attributed to me I ask for your indulgence, Mr Speaker, to read three quotations from what I actually said. First of all, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> In truth the core culture of Australia is based on the historical accident of British rule and owes virtually everything to the English essence of that British rule: The language, the parliamentary tradition and the judicial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>I also said:</PARA>
<PARA> Each successive wave of migrants has embraced the English core culture; not only by adopting its language and institutions but by the freedoms which are essential to those institutions. The adoption of the core was said to be assimilation but in fact it was integration because the culture which surrounded the core was an identifiably new mix of cultures. It is a continually evolving multiculture. For that cultural diversity to retain social cohesion, however, it must guarantee equality of opportunity to all. Thus the new Migrant Selection Scheme places an emphasis upon literacy in the language of origin-not on a prior knowledge of English; but persons arriving in Australia as migrants are expected to learn English as soon as possible and, through that language, to gain other skills. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I also said:</PARA>
<PARA> Language is the deepest manifestation of culture and enables the expression of features unique to a particular culture. Major domestic and international advantages to Australia are already evident from the linguistic abilities of its population. There will shortly be an enquiry by a Senate Committee on matters relevant to the formation of a National Language Policy and perhaps Phillip Institute of Technology will make a submission to the enquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea of a National Language Policy which will enable future Australians to acquire a fluency in languages other than our national language is most important. It is sad to reflect that many people here today do not speak the language which was the native tongue of their parents. This was because the philosophy in Australia when those parents migrated was that people should abandon their former culture (including language) and become Australian even though no clear effort had been made to define what that meant. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no dispute that English is the national language and the the institutions and freedoms associated with it are central to the Australian culture. There ought also be no dispute that services should be delivered to people by Federal, State and local government and by the private sector regardless of their ethnic origin though having regard to any special disability they might have. Thus English language disability must be rectified as soon as possible by the availability of language courses--</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, English language courses-</PARA>
<PARA> But ethnic specific services-positive discrimination-ought to be carefully circumscribed, so that what are often called 'mainstream services' are delivered to everyone but with a greater degree of cultural sensitivity than used to characterise the Australian way of doing things. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that those extracts expose the nonsense of the Australian's report and its editorial. My words are contrary to those attributed to me. My sentiments could not be more opposed to those which have been falsely attributed to me. My sentiments were very clear to any reasonable observer and they were very well received by the 2,000 people who were in the audience. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This statement relates to Australia's demographic trends and the 1982-83 immigration program. Population size, composition and distribution have far-reaching implications for many policy areas. This was recognised by the Government when it decided to present annual reports to Parliament on Australia's demographic trends. The first such report, which I tabled last year, provoked a great deal of discussion. I believe it has added a good deal to the growing awareness of population issues in government, in private enterprise and in the community in general. I now have pleasure in tabling the second such report, 'Review of Australia's Demographic Trends 1982'. This report has provided valuable background to the Government's decisions on future migrant intakes, to which I will return shortly. I would first like to draw the attention of honourable members to some of the main points of the review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's population growth rate fell from above two per cent at the beginning of the 1970s to a little above one per cent in 1975-76. Since then it has increased, to 1.64 per cent in 1980-81. This is higher than in all but a few developed countries. For example, recent estimates of annual population growth are: Canada 1.1 per cent, Japan 0.9 per cent, the United States 0.7 per cent, New Zealand 0.3 per cent and the United Kingdom 0.1 per cent. In Australia in 1980 the net reproduction rate, a common measure of population replacement, was 0.91. This was nine per cent below the long term replacement level of 1.0. It was also below the previously lowest recorded levels of the depression years of the early 1930s. Nevertheless, there has been some increase in the numbers of births during the last two years after the steady decline throughout most of the 1970s. In 1980-81 there were 231,000 births, compared with 224,000 in 1979-80. This rise is the result of an increase in the number of women in the peak childbearing ages of 20 years to 29 years rather than an increase in fertility, as measured by the average number of babies born to each woman. The rate of decline in fertility has, however, lessened over the same period. This may foreshadow an upswing in the near future, following similar trends in some other developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an increase in immigration since the mid-1970s. Settler arrivals in 1980-81 were 111,000 and are expected to be about 123,000 in 1981-82. In deciding upon future migration levels, programs have traditionally been expressed in terms of numbers of arrivals. However, once a migrant has been issued with a visa, he or she may choose to travel to Australia at any time in the following 12 months. This has made management of the program somewhat unwieldy. It has led to the delay in the departure of intending migrants on occasions in order to meet arrival targets. To improve the management of the migration program it will be expressed from now on in terms of numbers of applicants issued with visas. It is estimated that about 5 per cent of applicants issued with visas do not in fact migrate. New Zealand citizens are not subject to immigration selection and visa requirements and are no longer included in migration program numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background I can announce to the House today the Government's decision on the migration program for 1982-83. The number of migrant visas to be issued in 1982-83 will be in the range of 115,000 to 120,000, and I would expect that there would be a modest increase in the program over the following two years. These figures will, of course, be kept under review and adjusted as might seem appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> This immigration program reflects the Government's new migration policy, effective from 19 April 1982. It is a response to the community demand for more family migration, Australia's continuing humanitarian commitments, and shortages of workers in some professional and skilled occupation groups. However, it also takes account of the need not to import unemployment, and to that end independent applicants with occupations not in shortage here or without close family resident in Australia will not be eligible to apply under the new policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The population effects of migration also depend on permanent departures and on long term movements into and out of Australia. Net annual migration gains can be expected to continue to fluctuate from year to year, but broad population trends can be illustrated by using a long term average annual net migration gain of 100 ,000. On this assumption, Australia's population in the year 2001 would reach 19 .9 million, or 14 per cent higher than the 17.4 million which would result from a zero net gain from migration. Together with expected levels of natural increase, this level of net migration gain would give us an average annual growth rate of about one and one half per cent over the next 2 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to mention some changes in the age structure of the population . Since the beginning of the 1970s our population has been aging. Preliminary figures from the 1981 census show that the population aged under 15 years declined by 43,000 between 1976 and 1981, while the population over 60 years grew by 250,000. Immigration has tended to slow the aging process because most migrants are younger than the average age of the population. Nevertheless, even with the average net migration gain of 100,000 a year I mentioned earlier, the number of people aged 65 and over will grow much more rapidly than numbers in other age groups: More than 60 per cent by 2001 compared with a 34 per cent growth in the population as a whole, and a 24 per cent growth in numbers of children under 15. By the year 2001, the proportion of the population aged 65 and over is expected to be nearly 12 per cent, compared with 9.7 per cent in 1981. However, in many developed countries this aging process has already proceeded much further. For example, in 1980 the proportion of the population aged 65 and over in the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, Sweden and the United Kingdom was between 14 per cent and 16 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Changes in the age structure will have implications for many areas of policy. For example, in education considerable flexibility will be required in teaching and ancillary staff and buildings and equipment because of expected substantial fluctuations in the numbers reaching primary, secondary and tertiary education age groups. As the population ages, so will the labour force. By 2001 there are expected to be relatively fewer working-age people under 35 years and appreciably more between 35 and 55 years. The labour force may thus become more experienced, but perhaps less mobile. An aging population will also lead to changes in demand for goods and services. Market growth can be expected to move from teenagers and young adults to the more mature. </PARA>
<PARA> Because many demographic changes are gradual, there has in the past been a tendency to disregard them. The few examples that I have given demonstrate that the consequences of demographic trends will play a very important part in determining Australia's future. It is therefore critical that we monitor those trends regularly and forecast their implications. We will then be better prepared to face the challenges of tomorrow. The matters covered in the 'Review of Australia's Demographic Trends 1982' are very important long term issues. I commend the Review to the House. I present the following papers:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition welcomes the tabling of the report and the comments of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee). Before referring to either the report or the comments I raise with the Minister a question that is directly concerned with our immigration policy; that is, the implications of the changes in the law that took place as from 19 April. A very long investigation throughout 1981 brought about those changes. A great deal of information was passed out as to how both sides of the Parliament saw this as an opportunity for reinforcing family reunion as the basis of our migration program in Australia. Many thousands of people are now flocking to the migration offices seeking information, forms and guidance on how they may be able to use the new migration program in order to facilitate entry into Australia of members of their families. Unfortunately the bureaucratic processes have not been oiled up to meet the expected demand. The Public Service Board has had before it for some time applications for increased staff for the Department. As yet we have no reply as to when that is likely to take place. There is no doubt that the major offices, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, have not been able to deal with the number of people who have come before them. I am told that in some sections of the Department in Canberra-I would like the Department to check on this-even incorrect forms have been handed out to people who have sought information, in the hope that perhaps they can be put off for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a great pity that having had such fanfare and such mutual support in the introduction of this new scheme, there has been a breakdown in the mechanisms to deal with the people making inquiries. Obviously a lot of the people making inquiries will be disappointed because they have not looked at exactly how they will be affected by the changes. They expect that the family reunion program has quite a wide interpretation and, in fact, is in accordance with their own interpretation of 'family reunion'. Nevertheless, a number of people seeking assistance will be within the new guidelines. If the Government is serious about making these changes it should have been serious about seeing that the Department had the required number of staff to deal with the people now coming before it. Since 19 April our office has been inundated with complaints from people making inquiries and from staff who have been expected to cope with this rush of new inquiries without being able to deal with them. I ask the Minister to move speedily on those matters because a lot of people have been extremely disappointed with the way the Department has dealt with them to date. </PARA>
<PARA> When this report was tabled last year I said, and I repeat, that it is an impossible exercise for the Parliament to deal in isolation with a report on demographic changes. Demographic changes are of enormous importance to Australia but to have the report in isolation of what will happen to the aging of people, what will happen to the Government's decision about the migrant intake and what will happen to the percentage of people who will retire, means absolutely nothing at all to us. If this Parliament were not so lazy and if this Government were not so lazy in terms of utilising all the abilities that preside in this Parliament, parliamentarians would be used to look at all the policy areas that should be a part of this report. All we are doing here is saying that next year we will have a migrant intake of between 115,000 and 120,000 people. Without really knowing why, the majority of people in Australia support a general increase in Australia's population. The number announced by the Government will service not only the domestic demand of the ethnic communities here in Australia who want to bring out their own people but also it will service in a humanitarian way the refugees and the special humanitarian program which has been announced by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> But what does it mean for Australia to say, for instance, that we have 15 million people now but in 18 years' time we will have 20 million people? The Government should not just ask the Parliament and the people outside it to accept that the additional five milllion people will be a good thing and we hope it all works out okay. This Government, especially now-or any government in power in any country-when it is embarking on a program that will see a 33 1/3 per cent increase in its population in 18 years ought to have some idea of the ramifications of that increase. What will it mean, for instance, for people who live in Sydney, a city which by that time will probably have 4 1/2 million people? What will it mean for those who live in Melbourne, which will have four million people? This is the likely outcome of the actions on which we are embarking. We do not really know the impact on local or State governments, on the planning authorities or on all the social welfare authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not really know what will occur industrially in 18 years' time that might change the sort of pronouncements made by the Government in this demographic report presented today. For instance, at this very moment Sweden is going through an election campaign. The Socialist Party of Sweden is predicted to be winning that campaign and is likely to be re-elected on 19 September. One of its platforms is the introduction of a 30-hour working week. This is the position in 1982 in Sweden. We are just getting into 36 and 38 hour working weeks in Australia. What will be the ramifications for Australian industry over the next 20 years? What will be the make-up of the work force? Now we refer to people who are over 65 years of age and retired as the aging community. Who will we refer to in the year 2001 as the aging community and how will we cater for those people? Every one of us knows, if we face reality, that today we are not looking after the people who have retired. The 60 per cent of people who do not have access to superannuation are being looked after very poorly by the governments of Australia. But what will occur when we see the massive increase in their numbers, as predicted by the Minister today, working on today's standards? No one expects the standards of today to apply in 18 years' time, so the 12 per cent or 14 per cent increase in the number of people over 65 years is likely to result in a 20 per cent increase in the number of people who have retired from work in the year 2000. Are we seriously considering going from year to year embarking on this process of trying to maintain all these retired people on the same sloppy sort of pension system that is applicable in Australia today?</PARA>
<PARA> That is one area of the spectrum. What will happen in the field of education? What will it mean if we have fewer kids aged between five and 15 years in 10 years' time or if we have troughs and peaks in the field of education? How is Australia factually facing up to the number of people who will go through its educational institutions over the next 18 years? That is another area. We have the whole question of urban development. There will be a lack of mobility because of the numbers of people who will be unemployed. Half a million unemployed will not have the right to move around Australia. How many people do we expect to be unemployed because of what will happen to our industries in the next 18 years?</PARA>
<PARA> All of those things should be ancillary to this report tabled today. These are not matters that are so abstract and so far removed that we can leave them to the next generation of politicians. In the year 2000 people will be living virtually by the standards that we set in the Parliament today and we cannot run away from that. But we should face the fact that there are vast gaps in the way in which we are dealing with these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The report says, very briefly, that in Australia fertility rates and mortality rates are highest amongst the Aboriginal people. As a nation we can never hold our heads high until the mortality rate of the Aboriginal people is exactly the same as that of the white communities of Australia. For 200 years we have lived with a disgraceful record of treatment of Aboriginal people. We cannot pass that off by saying: 'Well, they are having bigger families and they die younger than the rest of us do'. We should be able to say that we have a program in that regard. No one expects any government to be able to overcome the problems with which Australia will be faced in the next year or two, but how far ahead are we planning?</PARA>
<PARA> We do not seem to be doing anything which recognises that governments, to be successful, must be able to work according to plans which have been laid down by far-sighted predecessors. For instance, we cannot say, as does the report, that, if we continue to take 120,000 migrants a year, in the year 2000 we will have 20 million people. None of us can give carte blanche for an intake of 120,000 migrants annually. We do not know what will happen in our region. The approximately 60,000 Indo-Chinese refugees that have been accepted by Australia in the last five or six years came to us as a result of the great political turmoil in that region. We cannot say that the same turmoil will not be experienced in other parts of our region and that we will not be expected to take the same number from different areas; or that other areas of the world will not be affected and Australia will be called upon to assist; or that there will not be political turmoil in the areas from which our traditional migrants come and that pressure will be brought to bear on us to take greater numbers of members of their families. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time we will be confronted with all of these problems. But the infastructure of our method of accepting migrants and of how we are to deal with them when they arrive should not be planned from year to year. It should be laid down as a basis for looking after these people because Australia will remain a country of high migrant intake for a long time. It seems to be the general consensus that that is a good thing for Australia. Therefore, we should be able to plan a lot further ahead than we are at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Also to be considered is the whole question of the effect on the environment of having a population of 20 million. An enormous pressure is built up by virtue of everyone living in the major capitals. The great majority of our population lives in six or seven centres. We should be looking ahead at what it all means in terms of energy, water resources and trade. Everything that will be required by a nation of 20 million people ought to be part and parcel of a report of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has said that this is an enormously important report and that a great deal of discussion ensued last year after it was tabled in the Parliament. That is probably true. Academics from the various universities got hold of it and argued about it. Some supported it, some argued against it. Some are pro- migration; others are anti-migration. The one place where discussion is not taking place-as it should before it takes place anywhere else-is in the national parliament. The House will be going into recess on Thursday and will not be resuming until 16 August. By anybody's standards outside that is not a bad break . One would have thought that it would be a golden opportunity for any government to send a batch of parliamentarians to study some of the questions that I have raised in relation to this report, because these will be the important issues of the future. If we all sit around between now and 16 August worrying about who will get a tax cut it might help the people who are in work this year but it will not help the unemployed very much. It will not help the migrants who come here in the next year or two. There are probably other things that could be done which should receive priority. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters should be the subject of inquiry by standing committees of the Parliament. As I have said to the Minister on many occasions, Australia's migrant intake and attitude to the refugee problems which exist around the world ought to be the subject of an examination by a standing committee of this Parliament. Such a committee ought to be looking at these questions all the time so that when they come before the Parliament experts who have been working on the committees and who have visited the places, if necessary, can advise us in the positive way that congressional committees of the United States of America do. This would enable us to become experts on the subject. We would not be completely dependent upon bureaucrats coming back and telling us their views on what is happening outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The one great failure of a report of this nature is that it comes to us in isolation; we are told only the bare figures. No one can argue with them because if the material being fed into the computer proves accurate over the next 20 years the conclusions will prove accurate. We need to know of the ramifications of embarking on a program which will lead Australia to having 20 million people in another 18 years. Jimmy Carter asked Congress and the people associated with Congress to prepare a report on the situation in the United States in the year 2000. That was done. Unfortunately, Ronald Reagan pushed it into the rubbish bin . This sort of exercise ought to be carried out in Australia. We may argue about the conclusions or the criteria that are used to reach those conclusions, but it would be a very worthy exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not criticise Australia's migrant intake. We have reservations on some occasions about the way in which refugees are brought here in terms of where they are coming from. Perhaps other countries have been ignored because of the dictatorships that may be present in those countries. It seems to be of the utmost importance that we take it one step further. We should not talk just about numbers and the migrant intake; we should also talk about long term planning of the services that will be available and the way we will overcome the problems that will exist in another 20 years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Committee's 198th report is the result of its investigation of the administration and management of the Government Aircraft Factories at Fishermens Bend and Avalon in Victoria. I should stress at the outset that while our investigations relate largely to GAF, we realise that much of what we say has relevance to all government factories. Many of the problems we identified-in particular, the problems for a commercially oriented organisation operating within a government framework-may be applicable to other areas of government commercial activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the early 1970s GAF has received repeated criticism from the Auditor- General with regard to its accounting, financial control and management procedures. The Auditor-General's unfavourable comments in his reports for 1979- 80 and previous years led the Committee to the conclusion that the problems being experienced at GAF, whilst serious breaches of Commonwealth accounting practice and procedure, were a symptom of more complex issues, including the management of the factories and their relationships with the mainstream departmental administration in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Our investigation of GAF concentrated on three main areas: Firstly, issues raised by the Auditor-General; secondly, efficiency of the factories' management , including level of support received from the Department of Industry and Commerce in Canberra; and, thirdly, the future of the maintenance of production capability appropriation and the current and future viability of the aircraft industry, which was referred to in great detail in the 1976 report of the Industries Assistance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In our examination of the comments of the Auditor-General in relation to specific matters of accounting procedure and practice, we found a low standard of government accounting, resulting from years of neglect. Consequently, we endorse the comments of the Auditor-General when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . collectively the unsatisfactory accounting disclosed by audit represented a critical state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee cannot excuse the neglect of the GAF in many basic accounting procedures and practices. Nor can it excuse the lack of action by the management at GAF to rectify these irregularities, particularly since many have been the subject of repeated comment by the Auditor-General over the last decade. The Committee is in no doubt that there has been a lack of commitment by senior management at GAF and within the Department of Industry and Commerce to the observations of the Auditor-General, and a regrettable tardiness in the control of existing systems and implementation of new systems to take account of the changing requirements of modern business practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Management staff at GAF have consistently proven over the last decade their inability to react to constructive criticism directed at encouraging remedial action, or even to rectify problems of this nature that they have identified. An example of this was Project Phoenix, a management review which cost the taxpayer $1m between 1973 and 1976 in consultants and equipment costs alone. It appears to have had little effect on managerial efficiencies. The Committee found that management of GAF had only a rudimentary knowledge of this review. As Project Phoenix was originally designed to be a continuous system of managerial review designed to produce savings of around $1m per annum, the Committee regards the handling of this project as quite unacceptable. We examined in some detail management deficiencies at the factories and found that in the areas of staffing , working conditions, remuneration, industrial relations and the adoption of modern business practices, GAF lagged far behind its competitors in private industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee feels that the multitude of problems facing GAF is due to the lack of a co-ordinated and integrated approach by factory management over the last decade to its responsibilities and a lack of prompt action on factory issues by the Department in Canberra. The Public Accounts Committee believes that the major reason why GAF has been unable to develop adequate management and financial control systems is the extraordinarily long decision making process involving the General Manager of GAF, the Department of Industry and Commerce in Canberra and the various other departments such as Defence, Finance, Administrative Services, the Public Service Board and so on, all of which have an input into many areas of factory management. This process severely limits the General Manager's ability to respond in a timely and effective fashion to day to day management problems, and to develop modern management practice. The Committee strongly endorses the general proposition of letting the managers manage. The inflexibility and inefficiency caused by the present management approach should be eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA> A further area of concern to the Committee is the fluctuating work load in the aircraft industry as a result of the time lag between major defence re-equipment programs. Because of this, the industry suffers from problems of morale and retention of technological, research and manufacturing capability. The Committee is of the view that, if GAF is to function efficiently in a quasi-competitive environment, many of the problems caused by its formal attachment to the mainstream of Government departmental administration must be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Possible options canvassed by the Committee included, first, that GAF and other Government factories be formed into separate independent statutory corporations with policy advice and co-ordination being provided through a new department of defence production, which would also be responsible for defence purchasing. The second option was that a tripartite aerospace corporation including the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, Hawker De Havilland and GAF, with the Commonwealth retaining a proportionate share of the equity, be established. The third option was for a separate company to include GAF with a majority shareholding vested in the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that the most acceptable solution would be the first, namely, to re-form GAF into a Statutory Corporation. This solution could also be applied to all other Government defence factories. Our conclusions and recommendations are directed towards placing GAF on a more efficient commercial footing. However, irrespective of the future of GF, the Committee recommends that financial reporting arrangements for GAF be rationalised, taking account of the many new developments in government accounting practice currently under consideration by the Government and the Public Accounts Committee. In this regard, the Committee will shortly table a report on the form and standards of financial statements of Commonwealth undertakings. This must include one set of accounts prepared and submitted to the production board as statements examined by the Auditor-General which are then presented to the Parliament as a record of the financial achievements of GAF. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the major point to emerge from the inquiry was, as I have already mentioned already, the inappropriate nature of a Government departmental framework for the efficient operation of commercial undertakings. It is essential to remove GAF from this framework and to place such undertakings on a similar footing to private industry, particularly regarding the decision-making process. It is also considered important to centralise the policy and co- ordination function for the operation of government factories into one separate department reporting directly to an appropriate Minister. I commend the report to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This report is one of the most important of the many recent reports of the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. It is, I think, a report which highlights the value of the Committee and the excellence of its staff. The 198th report is important because it raises central philosophical and institutional issues with which any Government involved in public enterprise must deal. It is, I think, of particular importance to the Australian Labor Party because of our commitment to the expansion of public enterprise. The valuable lesson which can be learned here is that while expansion of public productive enterprises is a desirable thing, many administrative pitfalls can arise to frustrate the achievement of the objectives of such public enterprises. If the Government is to own factories, it must act to ensure that those factories operate in an efficient and responsible manner. This has not been the case with the Government Aircraft Factories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clear from this report that a publicly owned enterprise such as this can be efficient only if it is given substantial autonomy from intervention by government departments. One of the main problems of the Government Aircraft Factories has been that managers of the factories have had to clear decisions with not only the Department of Industry and Commerce but also often the Department of Defence, the Department of Finance, the Department of Administrative Services and the Public Service Board. No private manager would have to go through such lengthy and bureaucratic processes. This has produced an extraordinarily cumbersome and inappropriate structure. Management has thus not been able to achieve overall coherence in its decision-making and much public money has been lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The report criticises the management of the Government Aircraft Factories for failing to respond adequately to constructive suggestions to improve efficiency. This criticism is fine as far as it goes. But one needs to ask: Where was the Minister for Industry and Commerce when all of these bungles were exposed? In particular, why has the present Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) failed to act to ensure that the recommendations of the management review , Project Phoenix, which cost taxpayers $1m and which was produced in 1976, were implemented? He has had since that time to do so. Unfortunately, it appears that conservative Ministers and bureaucratic tangles have given public enterprise a bad name. But what is clear from the report is that it is important to organise public enterprises on the basis of efficient principles of organisation and management. Thus, I agree that the Government Aircraft Factories and other Government factories should be formed into separate, independent, statutory corporations. However, I believe that such corporations need to be given broad guidelines and the maximum capacity to compete with private enterprise. They certainly should not be dictated to by various Government departments, especially as regards the area of industrial relations. One might mention that the report was very critical of industrial relations in the Government Aircraft Factories. But unfortunately, as the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) mentioned, this reflects the general attitude of the Government to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> Why was there such bungling in the area of industrial relations? The managers had to try to come to grips with a whole set of different departments which were supposed to handle these arrangements in the industrial relations area. Consequently, they were not able to make the sorts of decisions, including decisions about wages and conditions, which managers in private enterprise are able to make. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party would want to go further in developing a policy of organisation of productive public enterprises. We would seek to introduce an element of worker participation in determining policy and management of such enterprises. We believe that workers on the ground are much more equipped to assist management in streamlining such enterprises so as to minimise waste of human resources. It will be our aim in government to prove conclusively that productive public enterprises such as the Government Aircraft Factories, when properly managed, can match and surpass the private sector in efficiency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fifth Fraser health scheme is now seven months old. Its creator has already been consigned to the scrap-heap of history and his scheme is likely quickly to follow him. It has already had a damaging impact on a new inflationary spiral in this country. It is increasing social costs right across the community, particulary among the less well off, and is enveloped in bureaucratic confusion and ineptitude. Let me take each of those charges in turn .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The health changes of last year have given a significiant impetus to the renewed inflationary spiral in this country. The Government predicted that the health changes would lead to a 0.75 per cent increase in the consumer price index for 1981-82. As usual, it got its figures wrong. It was out by 90 per cent . The increase in the CPI attributable to health was 1.3 per cent in the December quarter and 0.1 per cent in the March quarter, a major impact on the renewed upward movement of inflation in this country. I quote the comments made by the economics editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, not just on the impact of the health changes on the CPI but also on the general ineptitude of this Government in health matters as related to finance. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> The startling rise in the Consumer Price Index during the December quarter-much of it caused by the latest round of Medibank changes-adds another chapter to the long and sorry story of the Fraser Government's health-care foul-up. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The latest Medibank funding changes, announced last May, top off the record of perverse decisions. The message of the Medibank muddle . . . is that there has got to be a better way to balance the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not just simply a matter of the impact on the December quarter or the marginal impact on the March quarter. The impact of the health changes on inflation is not yet exhausted. The Commonwealth Government has simply lost control of hospital charges yet the growing difficulties of the States will press hospital charges ever skywards well in advance of the rate of inflation. Hospital charges in New South Wales have been raised to $96 a day-90 per cent above what they were in August last year. That is well above the rate of inflation. Impending increases to at least $100 a day are in the wings in Victoria and South Australia. That is 100 per cent above the charges prevailing last August. These new charges must inevitably flow into increased insurance contribution rates-in New South Wales the increases have already occurred-and further fuel inflation in the course of this year. We warned the Government last year, as did the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals, that for the Commonwealth to abdicate responsibility for hospitals, to divorce responsibility for hospital charges from responsibility for health insurance, would open the inflationary floodgates . The inflationary implications of the present scheme will simply prove intolerable, making nonsense of the Government's anti-inflation rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally intolerable will be the impact of these hospital charges on health contribution rates for the ordinary Australian family. Private health funds contributions are simply a regressive tax paid not to government but to private agencies. Irrespective of their incomes, all Australian families but the very poor have to pay the same flat money rate tax to the private health funds for basic health insurance. As a result of the changes in 1981 that tax stood at an average of $10 per week per family across Australia. As a result of the further increases in New South Wales, the Medibank basic rate in that State is now $11. 86 a week. The increased charges already in the pipeline in Victoria and South Australia will mean that most families will be facing rates of $12 a week for basic health insurance by the end of 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no co-operation from working families in this country in the battle against inflation if the Government persists in undermining the social wage in this way. An editorial in the Australian Financial Review had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has effectively, in the latest of its series of unbelievably incompetent manoeuvres in the area of health finance, made sure that demands for cost of living adjustments will be louder than ever. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government is full of the rhetoric of the need for tough options, full of the rhetoric of self-sacrifice. But the toughness is always applied to poor and middling income earners. The self-sacrifices demanded are always of the less well off in this society. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's health plan, by reversing many of the disastrous health decisions of 1981, will reverse the impact of health changes on the consumer price index. The nation can be confident that the changes outlined in Labor's health plan will reduce the CPI by between 1.8 per cent and 2 per cent. Moreover, by designing our plan around an income related levy so that people contribute according to their means, we ensure that the broader shoulders bear the heavier burdens. Not only is this fairer and more equitable, but also it gives a Labor Government much greater opportunities to secure the co-operation of working people in the economic struggles that lie ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there have been rather pathetic efforts by the Government to impugn the costing of the Labor health scheme. Such efforts coming from this Government are simply derisory. It has never been able to get any of its health sums correct. Each of the four Fraser health schemes in the past four years were abandoned because the Government's sums were wrong. Either the impact on the CPI was grossly underestimated, as with the latest scheme, or the impact on the Commonwealth Budget was wildly out. The Government got its sums wrong and each of the previous four plans was abandoned. The same will happen to the fifth one because its calculations are incorrect. Nearly every estimate concerning the fifth Fraser health scheme--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nearly every estimate concerning the latest health scheme of this Government is proving to be wildly inaccurate. The impact on the CPI was nearly 90 per cent greater than the Government estimated. The calculations of expected income by State and Territory public hospitals are highly inaccurate. This has been established by every member of the Government side. For instance, in respect of calculations of revenue that the Commonwealth Government said the States would be able to raise through their public hospital charges, the Northern Territory estimate is out by $4m, an error of 36 per cent; Tasmania is out by $4m, an error of 20 per cent; New South Wales is out by $32m, an error of 25 per cent. The latest figures we can get from Victoria show that its estimate is out by $30m, which is an error of 38 per cent. This is one of the chief reasons why hospital charges will be going up in Victoria in the very near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The previous Minister for Health, the honourable member for Warringah, went even further. He confessed that the Treasury's estimate of the revenue foregone on the rebate was out by $130m-an error of 22 per cent. It is very interesting to find him making a confession that instead of the Treasury prediction of $600m set out in the Budget Papers, the amount should have been only $470m. Of course, that confession was simply made in a desperate effort to discredit the Labor scheme. Interestingly, nobody seems to have believed it. I note in a letter dated 19 April 1982 from Mr Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers' Association, usually a very reliable source in these matters, that he continues to insist that the Treasury estimate in the Budget Papers of $600m in respect of the rebate is the correct one. Certainly it is the one that he uses in his letter. He has not been much impressed by the strange confessions of the previous Minister for Health. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, we have now obtained the evidence of how the Minister secured that calculation. What he did was simply to cheat. He calculated by applying the charges in September 1981 to the insured population as revealed in the health survey census of March 1981. Any honourable member of this House and any member of the Press can get those public figures-that is, the charges of 1 September 1981 which are publicly available and figures from the health survey census of March 1981 which are also publicly available-and do the calculations. Of course, what his calculation ignores entirely is the major increase in the number of people taking out health insurance after 1 September 1981 as a result of the changes. Originally the Government made an allowance for these increased numbers . And I have little doubt that when the Budget comes down this year the original $600m estimate will turn out to be a relatively accurate prediction. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole shoddy act is typical of the way this Government has implemented and defended what the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian Financial Review describe as its incompetent, inept fiddling with health changes in this country. But perhaps symbolic of its latest scheme is the revelation that the printing, processing and posting of disadvantaged persons cards cost $3.18m. The whole process of stigmatisation of the disadvantaged is costing the taxpayer $3.18m. The Labor scheme will provide exactly the same cover for these people without the need for stigmatisation and certainly without these absurd bureaucratic costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, it has been revealed in the last week that the Government is now encouraging a massive advertising campaign by the private health funds with, of course, the Australian contributors' money, to clear up all the confusion over the health tax rebate. The private health funds are being advised in circulars from the Department of Health that they should have newspaper and television advertisements to explain to their clients the rather complicated health rebate; that there should be co-operative hot lines run by the various insurance agencies all, of course, at contributor's expense; and that there should be staff briefings and chemist briefings to explain this complex aspect of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Not that the private funds, the great beneficiaries of the latest scheme, have contributed that much to its successful operation; indeed, the behaviour of some funds was clearly under attack in some of the changes that were made in a Bill brought into this House last week. In New South Wales, the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd, and to a lesser extent the Hospitals Contribution Fund of Australia, have been slowing down their payment of hospital claims. The delay is now close to two months in the case of the MBF. Of course, this has increased greatly the cash flow problems of the public hospitals. Again, the MBF is refusing to pay outpatient claims over the counter. This is part of a wider dispute over entitlements under the latest scheme, but it further exacerbates the hospital cash flow problem. Furthermore, the Department of Health has found it necessary to send to all the funds information regarding the entitlement of disadvantaged people who lose the health care card. Some funds are informing people who lose their entitlement to health care cards that they must serve the normal waiting period before becoming eligible for basic fund benefits. Of course, the Government has found it necessary, rightly so, to correct that misinformation being passed across counters by insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to refer to the social costs of this type of scheme. The Achilles heel of any voluntary scheme is that many people will remain uninsured and not be covered by the disadvantaged scheme. For instance, of those 600,000 people who inquired after health care cards only 170,000 were given them. It is likely that many of the 430,000 who did not get cards will not have taken out health insurance for the very good reason in many cases that they simply believe that they cannot afford the weekly rates of health insurance. It is all very well for the previous Minister to suggest that they give up their television sets-black and white or colour-and listen to radios so that they can afford health insurance. Many of these people have already given up what many of us would consider to be the basic necessities of life. Of course, health insurance for them is becoming a new cheap form of gambling. But it is a gamble which, according to statistics, they are likely to lose. The evidence is that low income people are more likely to fall ill or be injured through their work and home environments, that the uninsured are simply bad debts waiting to be hit by a truck or injured by a poorly guarded machine. There are recurring problems, then, of bad debts, and people will be increasingly dunned for medical and hospital debts. One of the distinctive signs of the new scheme is that throughout the country most of the public hospitals have in recent months entered into contractural relationships with debt collectors to tackle what is becoming a growing problem. The Government has a simple choice. It will either remake this health scheme or be told by the Australian people, quite clearly and unequivocally, that this health scheme will not be tolerated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apart from today's tired performance by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), I should like to point out that he has raised this subject, since the Government gave notice of its new health scheme in April 1981, on no fewer than four occasions. He raised it on 13 May last year, on 26 August, on 24 February this year and on one other occasion when the matter did not actually come before the House. Honourable members in this chamber, and the Australian public, are tired of listening to this diatribe by the honourable member for Bonython, and I am sure that the public generally does not take any more notice of the honourable member when he raises this issue. He has no impact whatsoever. I begin to wonder why he persists with this subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's costings are correct. I can find no person or writer of any note who agrees with the honourable member's claim about the Government's figures being incorrect. I suggest that he is just whipping a tired old horse. The Government announced the scheme in April 1981. Part of the scheme became effective in July, when the tax rebate came into effect, and the scheme was fully in place by 1 September last year. I am amazed at the use of terminology in this matter of public importance, particularly the section which talks about bureaucratic ineptitude. I do not know what the honourable member means by that. I do not know whether he means that at present the bureaucrats are not able to implement the scheme properly or that the bureaucrats advising the Government were inept. It is the Government's scheme, and I do not see how the bureaucrats have anything to do with it. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the House to a media release from the honourable member for Bonython, as shadow Minister for Health. It is a four-page document, almost as long as the original Hayden health plan. I refer to the fact that it was the Hayden health plan because so much wrangling went on in the Caucus between the honourable member and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) that it did not come out as the health plan of the honourable member for Bonython, the shadow Minister, but the Hayden health plan. Let us look at some of the terminology. The honourable member was replying on this occasion to the then Minister's so-called-as the honourable member says-thorough analysis of Labor's health scheme proposals. He uses words such as 'a shoddy partisan stunt'. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement was a tissue of falsehoods and absurdities liberally mixed with ideology, contradiction and hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member also, I think in that same statement, went on to state that the Public Service was being prostituted. Unfortunately, we have come to accept such disgusting terminology from the honourable member so frequently now that it is just part of his make-up. </PARA>
<PARA> As health care is of fundamental importance to all Australians, the Government would have been seriously neglecting its responsibilities to the public if it had not called on the expert advice available to it within the Department when considering a proposal such as that put forward by Labor, which has such serious ramifications. That was the subject of another matter of public importance raised by the honourable member for Bonython when he talked about the misuse of the Public Service by the Government. Having in mind the experience under Medibank when health costs got out of control under the then Labor Government, obviously the Government would have been irresponsible if it had not turned to the experts to see whether this scheme would return us to the 1975 situation and result in a massive burden on the Australian taxpayer. Therefore, the then Minister obtained expert costings of the various elements of the Labor Party's plan from the appropriate government agencies-a very proper action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister subsequently gave factual advice on the results of the expert analysis and costings, which clearly demonstrated that the Labor Party's plan had been undercosted by at least $350m. I seek leave to incorporate a table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> (g) The Department of Health estimates that $30m would be necessary to provide 'free' pharmaceutical benefits to all unemployed persons. Insufficient details have been provided to enable a proper costing of all aspects of Labor's proposals in this area. However, up to an additional $30m annually could be necessary to provide drugs to the chronically ill, at a cost below the present level of patient contribution. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TE7">Mr HODGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I must emphasise that that analysis was in no way partisan. It was a factual presentation which all Australians are entitled to know about. At all times the propriety of the Public Service was observed. I believe the Government has a duty to protect the public by exposing the full consequences of the Labor health plan. The plain fact is that the honourable member for Bonython is embarrassed because he and the Australian Labor Party have been found out. They have been exposed as either having failed to cost their proposals properly or of attempting a confidence trick on the Australian public on an enourmous scale. Firstly, we hear the Australian Labor Party saying that the Government has contradicated the Budget estimate for the full year's revenue from the tax rebate. The Government's estimate of about $470m for 1981- 82 was calculated on the basis of current contribution rates and the number of contributors to basic hospital and medical insurance as at the end of September 1981. The September membership numbers are the only complete figures available at this stage. Samples that have been taken of the membership numbers at the end of November indicate a possible increase, but not sufficiently large enough to support the Labor Party estimate of $660m for the tax rebate. Another area of great concern to the Labor Party, and rightly so, is its inability to have estimated accurately the additional cost of extending pharmaceuticals. In regard to extending free pharmaceutical benefits to the unemployed and special beneficiaries, the Government estimates the cost at $30m, not the $10m as suggested by the honourable member for Bonython. This figure is arrived at by using an average of 15 prescriptions per year for each patient, as compared with the current figure of 22 for people receiving free pharmaceuticals. This will result from doctors prescribing more readily and greater patient use because they are free. Scripts would also be available free for items costing less than $3.20, which are not covered at present, because that is the minimum patient contribution. Obviously, the honourable member for Bonython and those who have assisted him with his costings did not take that factor into consideration. It must be remembered that the pensioner health benefit scheme includes additional items that are not generally available under the pharmaceutical benefit scheme. Experience in Australia and overseas points to increased usage, where drugs are provided free, of the order estimated by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party has not said specifically what it intends with regard to the chronically ill. It is about time that it provided a list of illnesses. I hope that the honourable member for Bonython is listening to me because this is a very important and costly aspect of his health plan. The Government would be more than happy to cost any proposal that the Labor Party is prepared to make available in regard to the chronically ill. The Government has estimated that the loss of revenue from the Australian Labor Party abolishing outpatient charges would be $140m, as compared with the Australian Labor Party's estimate of $80m. This estimate is based on the revenue potential advised to the States from a charge of $15 per service yielding $128m in a full year, plus some $12m being collected by the States for outpatient services prior to the changes in hospital funding in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that has been of concern to the honourable member for Bonython is the estimate of payments to the States for inpatients, which, according to Government estimates, is $112m underestimated. In arriving at this estimate, the Australian Labor Party appears to have completely ignored major components of the additional costs which would be payable to the States for public hospitals in relation to inpatients because of revenue reductions or extra costs. The Labor Party appears to have admitted the reduction which would occur in regard to the inpatient fee revenue from the professional service fee. The Labor Party also appears to have made no allowance for the additional cost of providing salaried and sessional medical services to patients who would drop health insurance and who would have to be treated by hospital doctors. The Government estimates that this would be $60m, based on over 1.7 million bed days. The Labor Party has also underestimated the loss of inpatient fee revenue resulting from the shift from privately insured to uninsured free. The Government's estimate is $110m and the Labor Party's estimate is a maximum of $80m. Those are some of the more salient points which have come out of the objective expert analysis which has been undertaken but which the ALP persists in questioning in the face of expert advice. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other features of the ALP scheme which give rise to concern. The impact on the individual has been very much understated. I am now dealing with the question of the levy. If the ALP is genuine in its intention to use the levy to recover the actual additional cost of health services under its scheme, it has been estimated that it may need to be set initially as high as 1.2 per cent instead of the Labor Party's claim of 0.75 per cent. The cost of hospital insurance has also been significantly underestimated. On the basis that there would be one contribution rate for private accommodation in public hospitals, a family in New South Wales may have to pay as much as $4.50 a week instead of Labor's estimate of $3. This is in addition to the compulsory levy. Labor's health scheme, if properly costed, would be more costly to the majority of the population who have demonstrated in the past that they want freedom of choice as to which doctor treats them and their families in public hospitals and, of course, for treatment in private hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of private hospital beds is very likely to decrease with the result that the community would lose the right to choose between a private or a public hospital. I challenge the honourable member for Bonython to prove that his plan would encourage the use of private hospitals. I suggest to him that it would see the demise of private hospitals and a great reduction in the number of private hospital beds available. Labor's plan has a heavy emphasis on access to public hospitals. In doing so, it encourages use of expensive public hospitals when efficient, economical general practitioner services are available in the community. Under Labor's scheme the resources of the public hospital system would be seriously strained, thereby delaying access and creating queues with the potential for reduced quality of care, unless the Labor Party were to provide the substantial additional funds needed to underwrite the expansion of the public sector its policies prompt. We all know of the capital cost involved in the provision of extra public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> The record speaks for itself. Health expenditure by Australians through taxes, premiums and charges increased by 31 per cent per year under Labor compared with about 12 per cent under the Government. Commonwealth health expenditure more than trebled under Labor whereas the Government has held expenditure increases to an average of about 9.5 per cent a year, which is slightly less than the inflation rate. Under Labor's proposals we would see virtually the demise of the voluntary health insurance funds. I ask the honourable member for Bonython: Where would the staff employed in considerable numbers by those funds go? The Labor Party's policy promotes bulk billing, which would facilitate fraud and over-servicing. I stress that point to the House. It would take out of the hands of the patient the knowledge of higher costs which would be associated with the Labor Party's health plan. There would be increased utilisation and, of course, doctors would not even know or care about increased service costs. The Government's health arrangements encourage those who can pay to accept greater personal responsibility for their health costs through the application of the user pays principle. Experience with the original Medibank showed that any scheme based on taxation fosters the notion that services are somehow provided free and this effectively diminishes incentives for restraint in the unnecessary use of those services. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to an article entitled 'Chickens come home to roost' which appeared in the April 1982 edition of the AMA Gazette. The honourable member for Bonython and his colleagues would do well to study closely this article, particularly the comments by Mr B. Freamo, the Executive Secretary of the Canadian Medical Association, relating to the Canadian health system, a system which the Labor Party wishes to inflict on Australia. Mr Freamo remarked that Canada's health insurance system, which generally provides medical and hospital services at no direct user cost, is sick; that waiting lists and waiting periods for the treatment of serious conditions, such as coronary disease, have grown longer and longer; and that patients are being discharged before they should be. Mr Freamo commented that the medical profession in Canada is quite certain that the problems in the system result from the concept imposed by the Government there that a health system should be provided which enables all Canadians to obtain all necessary services without direct cost and that the profession there firmly believes that some form of patient participation payment and hospital user fee is essential to the salvation of Canada's health system. Notwithstanding this sort of experience, the Labor Party would have Australians return to such a health system. The Labor party is prepared to place in jeopardy the present high quality of health care in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) incorporated in Hansard a table setting out figures which were first used by the previous Minister for Health. These figures have been discredited in public debate a number of times, but the honourable member is still clinging tenaciously to them. For example, on the question of pharmaceuticals, the honourable member made the claim that the Australian Labor Party's costing is inadequate because it has not taken into account the fact that there is an average of 15 prescriptions per person. That is true in respect of pensioners, but the average for the whole of the community is only five prescriptions per person. That is where the Government's figures vary from ours. The honourable member for Bonython dealt with the question of the rebate and quoted remarks by Mr Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association in support of Labor's argument, which is based on the data originally provided in the Budget but from which the Government has climbed down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Petrie spoke of an increase in the cost to the community because people will have to pay for the professional treatment of an increased number of people in public hospitals. I admit that the staff would have to be paid, but the staff would receive salaries, not the much higher fee- for-service rates which would apply to patients treated outside a hospital. At the same time, if the same number of patients shift from the private sector to the public sector and if this group of people in fact receives its medical care for less cost it would mean that there would be a much greater reduction in the amount of the medical refund which would have to be paid because the patients would not be being treated privately by doctors, bills would not be being sent and the patients would not have to pay bills. The honourable member did not equate those figures at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member asserted that Labor's figures are wrong and that the Government's figures are correct. Did he mean the Budget figures or the figures the Government brought forward afterwards to try to justify its arguments in criticising what we have said? He cannot have it both ways.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member does not come out with the full story, which is that the cost increase which did occur when Labor first came to power was a continuation of what had been occurring for the previous three or four years. Towards the end of the 1960s people noticed that the cost of health care was beginning to go up precipitously. In 1973, in 1974 and at the end of the financial year 1974-75, when Labor was in government, costs were continuing to go up. That is perfectly true.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="457">Dr CASS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Accelerating at the same rate as they had been doing before we even got into power and under a health scheme introduced by the Liberal Government in 1954. The Labor Government changed nothing about the health scheme until July 1975. Let us be honest about this. The Labor Party did not change anything until it introduced Medibank in July 1975. The rapid acceleration of the cost of health care services in this country was taking place under the voluntary health insurance system. I will tell the House why Medibank did not make a very significant change to that catastrophe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Both Medibank and the voluntary health insurance system before it are in essence insurance guarantees for the payment of private fee-for-service medical fees. It is the same the world over. Wherever costs for health care are guaranteed on a fee-for-service basis with insurance backing, costs go up. As doctors discover that whatever services they provide, they will be paid for, they take advantage of the system. The proof of my argument is the fact that last week the Liberal Government introduced a Bill to try to clamp down on fraud and over-utilisation. In his speech the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) representing the Minister for Health was at least honest enough to attribute it to the medical benefits system. He did not blame it on Medibank because he knew that would be wrong. Surprisingly, he chose to be honest about it and I am thankful for that. The real cost problem relates to this system of a fee-for- service reward to doctors for whatever services they provide. </PARA>
<PARA> Another assumption that the honourable member for Petrie makes is that under our proposal there will be a loss of freedom of choice in that patients will not be able to choose their own doctor and to use private hospitals if they wish. Nothing in what we are proposing in any way stops a patient from going to a private hospital other than, one might say, the increasing costs which are now taking place under the Government's scheme, irrespective of our plans. It has already been said that the costs of hospital care have skyrocketed. Already the private benefits funds are signalling that they will need to increase their contribution rates. The fact is that, under the present Liberal Government scheme, costs are continuing to run away from the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at a bit of history once again. Medibank was introduced not because the Australian Labor Party consisted of a mob of geniuses who could derive something out of the air, but simply because we observed what was going on in the community and particularly what was discovered by the Nimmo committee of inquiry, which was set up in the late 1960s by a Liberal government, not a Labor government, to look into the increasing problems associated with the private voluntary health insurance system. We now have basically that self-same system once again. The problems that the Nimmo committee discovered were: The gross inefficiencies of the private health care system, the bureaucratic bungling associated with the administration of the whole complex arrangement and the claim that, as a result of it all, a lot of disadvantaged people in the community received no cover at all; they just gambled on the fact that they would not get sick. Of course, the chances were they, coming from the disadvantaged sections of the community, would lose out. The way they live, the lack of nutrition and so on, meant that they were more likely to get ill-and they then suffered. Consequently, the hospitals had the problem of chasing around and trying to collect bad debts. The hospitals have now started to make arrangements with fee collectors to chase up the poor who cannot pay their hospital bills. We are back to 1969 or 1970, when Mr Justice Nimmo presented his report. For the very reasons that he set out, we took the hint and made changes. He said he could not argue against the private voluntary health insurance system and all the multitude of 100 funds or something like that. He saw they were inefficient, that their conditions varied and that people could not make their way through the maze. He proposed a government department to overlook the whole damn lot of them and to make sure that people could be properly informed about what they were getting if they contributed to any particular scheme. He proposed government supervision. We took the next logical step and established a national health insurance system to do it all for everybody. Immediately the burden dropped from many people's shoulders, in terms of the contribution rate. People were required to pay a levy. People have to pay whichever system is in use. There is nothing voluntary now and there was nothing voluntary before we introduced Medibank because, if no one belonged to a benefit fund, one could not claim any tax rebate in respect of the money that one had paid for medical and hospital benefits. People had to belong to funds. The fact is that, by the introduction of a national health insurance scheme, the inequity is removed and the size of the contribution one makes depends on one's ability to pay, not on a flat rate which hits the poor much more than the rich, as is the case now under the Liberal scheme. The contribution is related, under the Labor Party's proposal, to one's capacity to pay. So the poor pay less and the rich pay more, which is social equity. Automatically everybody is covered. The disadvantaged do not have to try to find out what they are entitled to, be discouraged, afraid to inquire and put off. They know that they do not have to worry about it. They will get what they are entitled to, namely, the medical treatment their condition indicates they should get without worrying whether they can afford to pay for it. The condition for medical treatment should not be the depth of one's pocket: It should be the medical need which indicates the need of the individual . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yet again the matter of the Government's new health scheme, as it has been described by the Opposition, has been proposed for discussion. Whenever the Opposition cannot think of a new matter for discussion as a matter of public importance, it brings on this issue. As the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) has already remarked, this will be the fourth or the fifth time in the last year that this issue has been brought forward. One can just hear the Opposition Executive speaking to the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) and saying: 'Have another go. It won't do any good but we have nothing else to put up.' Once again we have to face a regurgitation of the subject of today's matter of public importance which has been put in various forms. On each occasion, it seeks to suggest that what we have devised is not as good as the Australian Labor Party efforts of the past. This time, the Opposition claims:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inflationary impact, the social cost and the bureaucratic ineptitude of the latest Government health scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>In case any listener is misled by the Opposition's reference to the latest health scheme, it ought to be pointed out that the Opposition is referring to the scheme announced a little over a year ago and which, by now, is well accepted and understood by the Australian community at large with, it would appear, the exception of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that members of the Opposition wish to return to the failed policies of the years 1972 to 1975. It is Whitlam revisited. We all know that that policy simply did not work. The honourable member for Petrie has given a detailed dissection of the alleged and proposed scheme of the Opposition. It is worth reminding ourselves of that previous disaster. When this Government came into office, it inherited arrangements which had been made by the former Whitlam Government-as the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) said a few moments ago-characterised by rapidly accelerating health costs. At that time, there was no doubt that the open-ended 50-50 funding arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States simply did not work. It was characterised by a steady increase in costs of delivery of health services without an improvement in the quality of those services. The unsatisfactory experience led to the Government instigating the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals. The report of that inquiry left no doubt that the existing arrangements were totally unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that, when our arrangements are being criticised and when they have been contrasted with what are said to be new arrangements proposed by the Opposition, it is worth reminding ourselves of what the Jamison Committee found and held to be the position under the former arrangements. The report in part states:</PARA>
<PARA> Information provided to the Commission shows a general over-supply of hospital beds in Australia, significant differences in total provision between States, maldistribution of beds within the States and a close relationship between the supply and use of hospital beds . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The States have been encouraged by the hospital cost-sharing agreements in particular to devote a large share of their health budgets to hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . the attitudes and efficiency of some hospital administrations has not been impressive. The Commission has evidence of ridiculous and unsubstantiated demands for additional staff, inefficient allocation of staff and rostering of overtime, and reluctance to introduce measures with proven cost savings such as contract cleaning. Other examples of wasteful practices include rosters deliberately organised to ensure that certain employees had a guaranteed overtime component in their wages, whether the hours needed to be worked or not, and arrangements for payment of salaries and allowances in excess of award provisions, sometimes with authorisation from the hospital's board but commonly without approval of the appropriate health authority. The Commission regards these as manifestations of poor managerial control and of a total lack of appreciation of the managerial function in publicly funded institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . health authorities and hospital managements in general have not taken enough trouble to promote cost constraint-they must take more action; financial efficiency has taken second place to spending in many hospitals-this situation must be altered; the present system of funding encourages and promotes expenditure with little consideration of need-need must always be the main con- sideration; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They are remarkably devastating findings and are completely damning of the situation before this Government instituted a year ago the arrangements now existing. It is amazing that somebody from the Opposition should complain about inflationary tendencies when there is such a damning finding of a total lack of cost control and cost constraint, because in the long run the amount that we have to pay in health insurance, in taxes or in Government contributions to health is solely dependent on the real cost of the delivery of health services. It was because of that experience that the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States were altered to a system which required the hospitals and the States to have more regard to their costings. The States and the hospitals now have a clearer knowledge of the limit of the amount available to them and have to ensure cost control. The new system means that Australians have a health system which will be no less effective but far more cost efficient. It is interesting to note that even States such as New South Wales in recent times have taken decisions regarding hospitals. That shows that the message about cost constraint seems to be getting through. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the health insurance system also required significant changes . There had been a steady withdrawal from the health insurance system of people who could pay and should have paid for health services. The national figure of those with health insurance had dropped to around 60 per cent, and in one State down to 55 per cent. This was clearly unsatisfactory. It was contrary to the principle of the user pays and more particularly to the concept that those who can pay should contribute to the cost of their health care. It meant that those who had the greatest demand-they were typically the older people-were paying more because as fewer people contributed to the health insurance funds the community rating slipped and those who contributed had to put in more than their share. This new scheme has resulted in a much higher proportion of wage and salary earners contributing to health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA> The success of the new scheme can truly be seen by the fact that many people have now taken out private insurance. The proportion of those who have moved to health insurance cover is over 70 per cent and, combined with those covered by the Commonwealth and in some instances the States, it is clear that very few are not now covered. I am informed that approximately 97 per cent of all Australians are covered either by private health insurance or by some form of government cover. It is worth repeating that this scheme is not one which leaves people to their own devices when they are unable to contribute. The situation is quite the reverse. Pensioners, the unemployed, the newly arrived and those on low incomes have their health costs met by this Government. Those on low incomes are covered under a scheme which is clearly defined and which has a generous test. A man with a wife and two children can be earning almost 70 per cent--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member should just listen carefully. A man with a wife and two children can be earning approximately 70 per cent of average weekly earnings and still be covered by this Government. I was amazed to hear the honourable member for Bonython, I think it was, say that poor and middling income earners were not covered. I would have thought anyone earning 65 to 70 per cent of average weekly earnings would not be considered poor. Nonetheless, if they have two children they are still covered by these measures. If a person has not yet got himself covered but is without means, he will still have the opportunity 13 weeks after treatment to apply for cover. This means that inadvertent failure to seek cover will not disqualify him. Under these new funding arrangements, once the tax rebate is taken into account those who have taken out health insurance are in fact paying no more-indeed, it is sightly less -than they were prior to 1 September last year. The reality is that the present scheme much more fairly delivers health services to the Australian community and it does so in a way which ensures that costs are controlled and that the health delivery service is far more efficiently managed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that this debate be resumed today, 4 May. It is fitting also that I say a few words about the Battle of the Coral Sea, which we commemorate each year, and rightly so. This is the fortieth anniversary of that great battle, which took place between 4 May and 8 May 1942. It was, as many people will recall, the first action decided at sea in which the ships involved did not fire a shot. In view of the debate which surrounds some of the equipment that we are talking about today, that is an appropriate point. It was the first serious check to the Japanese advance upon Australia and, in the long term, it ensured the security of Australia during World War II. In the last few weeks we have seen commemorated in Australia the Battle of Tobruk-last Sunday; Anzac Day the week before; and on 24 April the Kapyong battle of the Korean War. They all serve to emphasise the vital importance of defence to this country. Some of the battles that I have mentioned were far away but the Coral Sea battle was close to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The prime responsibility of any government, in any country, must be to secure the nation's boarders, because without security we have nothing. Without secure borders all of the grand infrastructure that we have in this country would be meaningless. The Battle of the Coral Sea stopped a Japanese force that was assigned to take Port Moresby. Some 62 Japanese ships, 26 American and Australian ships and land-based aircraft took part in the engagement. The result was to some extent a tactical victory for the Japanese, but strategically they were forced to withdraw. It would not be right, when mentioning the Battle of the Coral Sea, to forget the debt that we owe to our American allies. It is one that we should acknowledge each year because it was they who stood by us in those very difficult days. To those who say that we should not stand by them when they need our assistance, I say that we will and we do. I pay tribute to all those who took part in that great battle of the Coral Sea. </PARA>
<PARA> To come closer to home and to take up the points of this defence debate, I say firstly that of all the members of this Parliament, past and present, the least fitted to criticise Australian defence policy are the members of the Australian Labor Party. In the years-fortunately few-that Labor was in office in this country, I was a regular serviceman. In the years 1973-1974 I commanded an infantry battalion in Townsville. I know only too well-probably better than anyone here-the disastrous effect that Labor's defence policies had on the Services and servicemen of Australia. I recall taking over a battalion when the Australian Labor Party had just marched out half of its strength by saying to the national servicemen: 'Go home boys, go home'. The Labor Government decimated the Services of this country by an irresponsible action, taken for short term political gain. I refer to its marching out half the strength of the units of the Australian Army. Yet the Opposition now claims that it has a responsible view on defence matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whether they were conscripts or not has nothing to do with the fact that they were manning units of the Australian Army. Yet the Labor Government said: 'Go home tomorrow; don't wait until we can phase this out; don't worry about the units you are manning; just go home'. They marched out in droves. That action decimated units overnight. Of all the actions that I can think of during those years when Labor was in charge of the country, that would have been the most irresponsible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not understand what liberty has to do with this. We are talking about the defence of liberty. We then engaged in a constant battle to re-form units. Having done that, we went through a constant battle to try to train them, to get them out of camp. In those days the defence policy of the ALP could be expressed in these terms: 'Keep everyone in camp. That will not cost much. Give them no training. They will cause no problem in camp. That is the best defence policy. We will just pull everyone back to Australia, put our heads in the sand and that will be the end of it.' I do not believe that the ALP was deliberately trying to disrupt or run down the Services, but its actions had that result because it did not understand how servicemen thought. It still does not. Labor believes that it is just a matter of having equipment and of keeping soldiers in uniform. It has no understanding of the mentality and make-up of servicemen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since 1975, the former Labor Government having decimated the Services of this country, this Government has reversed the trend. It has increased the strength of the Services by about 4,500 and, in percentage terms, capital equipment expenditure has increased. I can well remember the ALP concept of continental defence, which involved sitting at home and doing nothing. No one really knew what that statement meant. In 1974 I thought I would test it. I decided that we would run an exercise in the Gulf country. I then set about planning it, but no support was provided. I was told: 'No, you cannot go and exercise. What do you think this is? What are you training for?'. We were virtually kept at home. However, I was determined to get there and was prepared to walk, if necessary. Eventually, common sense came to the rescue and we got some support equipment and a few trucks and aircraft with which to run that exercise. Do not talk to me about ALP defence preparedness and policies. Labor has nothing to be proud of and is certainly in no position to criticise. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to one of the major points of the defence debate-the purchase of the HMS Invincible. There can be no doubt that it is a controversial purchase. I freely admit to having some doubts about it. But I think it is well to remember, as I have mentioned, the role that the carriers played in the Battle of the Coral Sea. It is even more pertinent to remember what is happening in the Falkland Islands. I ask how such an operation could possibly be carried out without a carrier such as Invincible taking part as indeed it is. I have some criticisms of the purchase, as do many others. One is that there are no present plans to provide fixed wing aircraft for the carrier. The Government has said that it has no such plans at the moment. I sincerely urge it to consider, as soon as possible, acquiring those aircraft-even if only a few of the existing generation-so that expertise can continue to be sustained while we are waiting for next generation aircraft to be purchased. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect that I believe has not been properly articulated is that the purchase of the Invincible probably does not make much sense in the context of continental defence, as members of the ALP understand it-to pull out from everywhere and sit at home. But if we look upon it as part of the equipment required by the defence policies of the 1980s, which Australia should be pursuing, the purchase of the Invincible makes a great deal of sense. I refer to the development of forces which can work in a regional context, which can work with our allies, which could be prepared-in the Pacific Islands, in New Guinea and in some of our own dependencies and off-shore installations-to take their place as part of our defence posture. </PARA>
<PARA> We are moving into an era of regional defence. This is not before time. It seems to me that the carrier is essential in this context. We have seen the folly in past years of not being properly prepared. We have seen the folly of holding and claiming ground when not only have we not been prepared to defend it but also we have not had the kit with which to defend it. I think it is fair to say that although the British Government has no alternative but to do what it is doing now in attempting to throw the Argentines out of the Falkland Islands, in hindsight it will be seen that these dependencies around the world cannot be held any longer by leaving 40 marines there and hoping for the best. Sooner or later someone will come along and threaten our dependencies or some of our allies. In that context it seems to me to be absolutely essential that HMS Invincible becomes part of the Australian defence scene. We should also move to acquire those extra helicopters and fixed wing aircraft as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian defence should not be a subject of fierce political debate. We hope to move towards some sort of political consensus. We cannot afford to be less than strong in this area. We need to be strong enough to deter any potential aggressors. What has happened in the Falklands and throughout history indicates that a threat can come very quickly from a direction which is completely unexpected. I recognise that some of the points that have been made previously in this debate-no doubt they will be made again by the Opposition-are valid, but I certainly do not regard them as being in any position to legitimately criticise this Government for the efforts which it has made in defence since it picked up that cross in 1975. I can well remember what it was like in the years between 1972 and 1975. I end this speech simply by urging that, when the Invincible comes to these shores, it be fully equipped so that we can take our place, as we should be doing, in the regional defence of this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday in this Parliament the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) bluntly declared that the Government's defence policy was tattered and in disarray. He confessed that, so far as the nation's defence capability was concerned, Australia stood naked and disabled. He outlined how flyers would not be allowed to fly, sailors would be kept on-shore and soldiers would be effectively reduced to polishing broomsticks . It was not a major statement on the national defence of the country but a national disgrace. We had from the Minister characteristic table thumping and hell raising rhetoric on the threat of the Soviet Union. We heard hard adjectives and hard nouns about military reach, strategic lodgments, footholds, world domination and awesome power. We were even warned of the seeping presence of the Soviet Union in our own region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The obvious question, as one listened attentively to the Minister's speech, was : What sorts of policies does the Government have in hand to counter this awesome sinister Soviet threat? We discovered a few pages later that the defence capability of the nation was to be gutted. That is the official policy of the Government. It has terminated the purchase of not five but 10 Fremantle class patrol boats. Just after the invasion of Afghanistan by Russia a statement was made that 10 extra Fremantle class patrol boats would be acquired. That number was reduced to five. That latter five represents the five whose purchase is now being terminated. So when in the wake of the Afghanistan invasion it was established in the Government's mind that it was absolutely essential to have 10 extra patrol boats, we now find that none of them were necessary. But nothing has changed. The Russians are still in Afghanistan, Afghanistan is safely forgotten and the 1980 election is in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> We discover that the destroyer follow-on program is permanently stalled. The acquisition of anti-submarine warfare helicopters is to be deferred; others are to be cut. I find myself nonplussed by this because now we find that exclusively the justification for the extraordinary expensive purchase of HMS Invincible is its anti-submarine warfare role. It was a cruel mockery of the Minister in his concluding comments to declare:</PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken today of the prospects for the nation's continued security. </PARA>
<PARA>The facts are that the defence capability of this country has now been effectively paralysed by the policies of the Fraser Government. The Minister for Defence is only one of the members of that Government. The centrepiece of the Government's defence program is the acquisition of a half billion dollar-that is , $500m-aircraft carrier which will carry between four and five helicopters. That represents a $100m parking spot for each of the anti-submarine warfare helicopters on this aircraft carrier which has a capability of carrying 16. The cost of that is that there will be no helicopters for the four FFG frigates. We will lose eight helicopters. Therefore, we will be down at sea by between three and four helicopters. The FFGs will, in the same circumstances, be extraordinarily vulnerable. Their harpoons have a range of 60 miles. Their radar system has a range of 20 miles. As a matter of simple arithmetic, it is clear that without the over-the-horizon radar capacity provided by the helicopters, the FFGs will be operating with only one-third vision. They are, I repeat, highly vulnerable. These are the sort of cockeyed priorities which the Government has. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole cost of this is further extended. There will be no fixed wing naval air power cover for the Invincible. If anything has been established by the role of this type of aircraft carrier, it is the absolute necessity-if a decision is to be made to buy this sort of equipment-to have fixed wing air power cover to protect, as an umbrella, the aircraft carrier, to protect the helicopters that operate from it and to protect the flotilla that operates in conjunction with the carrier. Not only will there be no fixed wing naval air power for the carrier, but also there will be no fixed wing naval air power of any sort. Admiral Synnot has declared that without that fixed wing naval air power the effectiveness of the carrier is demolished. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went on, after all this rhetoric of the threat which surrounds us internationally and in our own region, and comfortably confessed a wind-down in our resources, our capability, as our defence response. He then went on, equally comfortably, to talk about our commitment to regional defence co-operation. On the next page of his statement he admitted that the armed forces would be embalmed-that is, flying, sailing and training time would be slashed. Equipment repairs will be cut back. That is not a reassuring defence statement at all. It is a pathetic 'tour de farce'. It is the performance of an easy going paladin. On his record he has first claim to become master of HMAS Spurious. </PARA>
<PARA> What does this mean? It means not just paralysis this year but worsening paralysis in the years ahead. The payments for the Invincible and the P3Cs for this coming year are relatively moderate. There will be far larger payments made in the succeeding years. The Minister argues that the wages bill suddenly exploded. Well, the Government deserves to get caught on that. In the Budget the Department of the Treasury declared that there would be a 13 per cent average increase in wages for the community. In fudging the figures the Department of Defence declared that the average increase would be only 6 per cent for the armed Services. There would be a pay increase of 6 per cent for the armed Services when the rest of the community would receive an increase of about 13 per cent. This was at a time when there were flow-on arrangements and when an inquiry was about to report, as the Government well knew, on wages and conditions of the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to what I regard as the real heart of this matter. It is not so much the equipment aspect, which is serious enough; it is what the deferrals, the displacements and the terminations really reflect. The facts are that those things reflect that the defence of this country is confronted by an equipment cost crisis. It gets worse year by year throughout the current five-year defence plan. By the way in which it will develop, I expect the Minister will be glad if he can move out of his task. It is only two years since the declaration by himself and by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of the necessity for increased steaming time, increased flying time, increased training and so on. It is only two years since the Russian incursion into Afghanistan. Nothing has changed in that respect. Nothing has changed in the Indian Ocean area, in the troubled Gulf, down through North Yemen, into Mozambique or in any of the other areas which the Government declared itself to be concerned about. The Government now finds, with an election safely behind it and with Afghanistan almost forgotten from its memory, that it can put the whole system in reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is facing a cash chaos situation. The Prime Minister rightly declared in his weekend broadcast that there are commitments for equipment in excess of $6,000m. How will that be paid for? On all of the estimates I have been able to make it will not be possible for the Government, on its present programming, to pay for that sort of obligation. Over the next seven years it will have to establish an average of 16 per cent of the defence budget for equipment purchases to be able to meet that amount. But that is based on the assumption that there will be no new equipment and that the Government can neglect some very large and expensive items of equipment that have to be paid for within two to three years. This will, therefore, generate dreadful difficulties. It is also based on ignoring the fact that inflation has not been accounted for. Much of the costing input of that total figure of $6,000m was derived in earlier years. If an inflationary factor were allowed for, at least $ 1,000m more would be added to that figure in current day terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The $6,000m covers only major programs. In Appropriation Bill (No. 1) there is another section of the budget for defence which is described as 'Other equipment '. That covers 40 per cent of the total equipment outlays and represents another $4,000m. With $6,000m and $4,000m, $10,000m is the total commitment for equipment that the Government has itself locked into through the curious and confusing way in which it makes decisions on defence expenditure. With some more simple arithmetic, if we allow for inflation the figure really comes to between $11,500m and $12,000m. How will the Government pay for that? Will it run raffles , introduce work sharing into the armed services or resort to its traditional fall-back policy of crossing its fingers and hoping that somehow it will come out okay in the end. I am talking about a real equipment expenditure commitment of $11,500m to $12,000m currently, without allowing for new items which inevitable will have to be committed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of reasons for this situation but one matter I want to focus on is the implication of this for our balance of payments. Time and again I warned that inevitably the Government would get itself into serious trouble because it was not programming sensibly its defence expenditure programs. When it did make commitments, it did not stick consistently with them, apart from buying the wrong sort of equipment for this country. I have mentioned the total figure of about $12,000m for which the Government has committed itself for new equipment at this point. From experience, about 70 per cent of the equipment purchases come from overseas, so we are talking at this point about more than $8 ,000m being committed or inevitably to be committed for defence purchases from overseas. For the next seven years that will take on average each year an outflow of cash from this country in excess of $1,000m to pay for defence equipment. Currently service debts-that is, the payments on earlier foreign investment and the flow of capital out of this country for that purpose-are in excess of $2,800m. Does anyone genuinely believe that the economy of this country is now in a condition to be able to take that sort of strain or is likely to be able to do so in the foreseeable future? Of course not; neither would world conditions suggest that it is a possibility. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table in relation to the acquisition of new equipment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to the claims which have been made, the expenditure on defence equipment this year as a proportion of the defence outlay is in fact the lowest it has been since 1977-78. It is down to 13.2 per cent. Last year it was over 16 per cent, and that was a fall on the year before. In those circumstances it is nonsense for the Government to talk about increased real spending on defence equipment. In fact, in real terms, this year it is down more than 11 per cent. The Government gets approval to spend money on defence but does not spend it. It spends well below its entitlement. This year it will spend $100m less than it has approval to spend.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In those circumstances we can understand why the country is getting into trouble and why the economy cannot take the strain of spending on defence equipment. Too many items are being deferred and they are banking up to the point where there is a very large accumulation of cost which, frankly, represents a critical situation and will be beyond the capacity of the economy to bear. I want to ask questions of this Government, particularly of the Prime Minister who, fundamentally, is responsible for this mess today. I ask whether we are prepared for the defence of this nation. Where are the Macchi replacements, the Caribou follow-on, the stand-off weapons for the F111Cs, the air-to-air refuelling, the FFG helicopters and a range of other items which were declared in the 1976 White Paper as essential-items which it was declared almost exclusively would have been acquired by this time? They have been deferred or have slipped right off the drawing board. It is regrettable that one is entitled to only 15 minutes to discuss what is clearly one of the most crucial issues in this country today. In the circumstances, restricted as I am, I believe that I have made a case more than sufficient to justify the moving of an amendment. Accordingly, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to have the opportunity to follow the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and deny totally the whole thrust of the nonsense that he has just spread in this chamber and to the Australian people. To allege, as he and his party have done, that the defence capability of this nation is to be gutted and that projects which are being deferred are being terminated, is to demonstrate a lack of responsibility to the servicemen of this country and a lack of responsibility in his task as Leader of the Opposition. It is incredible that this man, knowing full well that the amount of money to be spent on defence this year will rise by about 20 per cent in the current Budget, has nonetheless come into this House and presented this false appearance of concern about non-existent cuts. There are no defence cuts; there are deferrals. Decisions have been made to bring forward existing commitments and commitments that were not due for implementation for some years. In exchange other commitments are to be deferred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has never been able to understand defence. We can see from its own achievement its genuine concern about defence! We hear great protest from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison). We hear that it is a disgrace that equipment purchases should make up only 13.1 per cent-I think that was the alleged figure- of the total defence vote. According to the Opposition, that apparently is disgraceful. When the Opposition was in government in its first Budget the percentage for defence was 7.3 per cent, roughly half of the alleged 13.1 per cent. In its 1974 Budget, the figure for defence dropped to 5.7 per cent as against the allegedly disgraceful 13.1 per cent. In 1975-76, the figure was 8.3 per cent. </PARA>

It is incapable of grasping the reality. It is incredible that the party opposite cannot say that one of the reasons why there is provision for a smaller proportion of equipment to be purchased in the defence vote is that there has been-and quite rightly-a big increase in the wages bill within the defence vote as a result of the $171m increase in the amount of money that the servicemen are receiving following the Government's acceptance of the report of the Coldham Committee of Reference for Defence Force Pay or Defence Force Salaries which, quite properly, substantially increased the rates of pay and the conditions of members of the defence forces. It is natural that, if we increase the amont of money paid to servicemen, there will be an offsetting decrease in the proportion that goes to equipment. But let us deal specifically with the realities.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In the seven years that this Government has been in power, every decision taken by the Government on defence has been criticised by the Labor Party. It is incredible, is it not, what politics will prompt people to do without any real concern or any real recognition of the need for morale or the reality of defence within the Australian environment. We have, for example, all these allegations now being made about how the Invincible is inappropriate and how it should not have been purchased when, in fact, on 9 September 1980 a decision was announced to this House that the Government proposed to replace HMAS Melbourne with a purpose-designed ship to be equipped with helicopters for anti-submarine warfare but with a potential also for operating short take-off and vertical landing aircraft. That decision was taken then. This House and the nation knew then that there would be a commitment to purchase this ship some time in the mid-1980s. I stress this to the House and to the nation to dramatise the point that what has happened is that this purchase has been brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of bringing it forward-Australia will get the ship much more cheaply , by the way-has been that other defence purchases have been deferred. The purchase of the 10 Orions, which are absolutely vital if there is to be any anti -submarine capacity around Australia has been brought forward. That purchase is absolutely vital. The bringing forward of these purchases is an opportunity that we must take but that action is being attacked by the Opposition, no matter what the consequences are of not bringing them forward. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the consequences of not bringing forward these purchases? That is what we would like to hear the Opposition discussing. The consequences are that we would not be able to purchase the Orions in this production run and, if we got them at a later stage, they would be extremely expensive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The expenditure of a mere $280m does not matter, according to the Opposition. It is only $280m. The fact is that when we bring forward these purchases, when we face an expenditure of an extra $280m because of the early purchase of the Orions, when we face the cost of $480m for the Invincible, instead, I might say, of a sum roughly double that amount had we waited until the mid-1980s to purchase the ship that we were examining, and by in fact increasing the amount going to service pay, naturally we have to face the reality that either we increase the amount going to defence by even more than the 20 per cent increase proposed this year, which means increasing people's taxes, or we defer some purchases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is self-evident that the allegations of cuts, the allegations that the defence capability of the nation is to be gutted, are arrant and disgraceful nonsense and are allegations which are aimed at causing disaffection and concern among the armed forces of this nation, and are having an impact on morale. There is no doubt that these deceptive and nonsensical allegations are having an impact on morale. There is no doubt that any fair, honest, person, who examines what is actually happening within the context of this 20 per cent increase in spending, will understand that there is simply a changing of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition can say that it does not agree with the priorities. Honourable members and people in the nation have the right to disagree with the priorities. They can say that they would rather, for example, have the present purchase of any of the items that have been deferred than those which we are getting. If that is the line they will adopt, let them argue it coherently. Let them not come into this House and deceive the people by claiming that there has been a gutting of our defence capabilities. What is happening is that the purchase of vital major and key items of equipment for our defence capability has been brought forward, thus delaying the purchase of various other items of equipment. Let it be clear that it is nothing more than that. </PARA>
<PARA> In the disgraceful contributions that have been made to this debate so far, we have not heard from anyone opposite any acceptance of the fact that there has been provision for a 20 per cent increase in defence spending this year. That is an 8 per cent real rise after we take inflation into account. Has the Labor Party ever achieved such a rise in defence spending in its period in office? What it did was to bring about a decrease in the proportion of budget spending going to defence to the lowest level. That is the position based on the figures available to the Parliamentary Library. Labor reduced Australia's defence effort to the lowest proportion of budget spending on record. Yet the Opposition alleges in this House that it is the protector of the defence forces of this nation. It is absolutely incredible. We see this kind of deceptive nonsense from the honourable member for St George who is reported at page 2080 of Hansard as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The Fleet Air Arm is gone and all we will have is a helicopter aircraft carrier without any helicopters. </PARA>
<PARA>A former Minister for Defence comes in and spreads that nonsense. I wonder whether he has heard of the six Sea Kings and the two more on order which will be available to go on the In- vincible when she arrives? I wonder why he would seek to deceive this House by saying this kind of nonsense? Those helicopters naturally are to be equipped-I am glad to see that the honourable member for St George has now entered the House-with sonar dunking devices which make them a very potent weapon against the threat of submarines. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of this House will note that rather than there being no sense of coherence about the Government's defence strategy, we have by bringing forward the purchase of the Orions and the purchase of this carrier, which was originally called a through-deck cruiser-that may in fact describe it more accurately-aimed clearly at providing an anti-submarine warfare capability and that surely is of primary importance to an island continent. The combination of those Orions and the anti-submarine warfare helicopters is, of course, obviously a vital part of a coherent defence policy which this Opposition is unable to understand. The Opposition wants to spend its money on more and more submarines. It obviously takes a much more aggressive approach to defence than does the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the allegation made by the Leader of the Opposition-once again falsely, and I stress that-that the FFGs would not be equipped with helicopters. The allegations against this Government's defence policy are false. There is an increase in terms of equipment becoming available. Let us have a look at the fact that 18 light helicopters, the purchase of which was approved in 1980-81 and the contract for which is expected to be let in mid-1982, are planned to be used for training on the FFGs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By mid-1982. They will not be anti-submarine warfare helicopters, nor is it accurate to refer to the Royal Australian Navy's FFGs as ASW frigates. The fact is that there is a capacity for these light helicopters to be attached to and to provide a degree of training for the FFGs. To hear the Leader of the Opposition allege that there will be no helicopters with over-the-horizon radar is to suggest that the only helicopter that has that capacity is in fact an anti -submarine warfare helicopter. I suggest that the training that can be gained on the FFGs by having light helicopters-I concede the point that they are not as warlike in terms of reality as an ASW helicopter-is nonetheless particularly meaningful. It may well be that the Navy, after evaluation, could decide not to put ASW helicopters on the back of these FFGs. Having made the decision that ASW helicopters are to go on the Invincible, the need for putting ASW-style helicopters on the back of FFGs will be significantly diminished. As I understand it, the priority of that kind of helicopter is very low now that decision has been made to purchase the Invincible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put it to this House and to the nation that any attempts by the Opposition to denigrate the Government's increased spending, its purchase of very important equipment and its bringing forward of these purchases and any attempts to suggest that this is a gutting of our defence capacity and to pretend that the 20 per cent rise in spending is a fall, are simply dishonest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) which I seconded. First I want to make just two points about the speeches made by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) and the honourable member for McPherson (Mr White) and then ignore them entirely as they deserve to be. The first is that it was not until 1980 that the expenditure of this Government on the defence program exceeded as a percentage of gross domestic product what it was during the period of the Whitlam Government. The second point I want to make-and this concerns the question of bipartisanship-is that in terms of the aggregates of defence expenditure, including each point of time when the Government has said it wishes to increase defence expenditure, the Opposition has said that it will support the aggregate increase. We have said that in circumstances in which Australian economic conditions have been extraordinarily difficult and when it might have been expected that the Opposition would give priority to housing, education or social welfare. Instead, the Opposition has accepted the need for increased defence expenditure. But we have reserved the right, on precisely the problems that are being raised here today-the questions of the priority of that expenditure-to offer critical comment, and that has been done most effectively by the Leader of the Opposition and by the Opposition spokesman on defence, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is deserving of condemnation because it has added incompetence on planning and confusion in strategic priorities to deceit in public presentation of defence policy. It has no conception of the relationship between strategy and doctrine and force structure and the relationship between force structure and a five-year rolling procurement program. As a result, it had permitted items to be brought forward, then deferred, brought forward again, and deferred again with consequent gluts and bottlenecks in equipment expenditure and expenditure on capital infrastructure. It has compounded the disastrous consequences of this process by dropping in an item such as the Invincible with no understanding of the impact that has down the line where Defence officials try to maintain some relationship between procurement and strategy for the defence of Australia. Thus, we have a situation in which the purchase of the Invincible requires deferral of the purchase of its escorts, of associated anti- submarine warfare helicopters, of fixed-wing naval air power, of installations required for its effective deployment and of aids to land-based air cover. Ironically, the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) himself recognised the inadvisability of his own current behaviour when in his Afghan crisis defence statement of 25 March 1980 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not judge it necessary at this time to make sweeping changes to the whole force structure planned for later in the decade. On the whole, there is not yet a case for the large additional emphasis upon equipment numbers that would commend measures such as off-the-shelf purchases, or other short cuts with attendant cost and other penalties in terms of suitability for the Australian environment. </PARA>
<PARA>We could not have put forward a better criticism of the Invincible purchase ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the change in our current strategic environment to justify this? As alarmist as the Minister was, he was nowhere near as alarmist as he was two years ago. Indeed, it must be said that those of us on this side of the House who are members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence are grateful to the Minister for his kind references to the report of the Committee and for his statement that he accepted the Committee's assement that in looking at our strategic environment we should be 'cautionsly optimistic '. I feel sorry, however, for those in the Department of Defence associated with the preparation of the Minister's speech. I would bet good money that they carefully worked their way through the Committee's report, looked closely at the strategic and doctrinal aspects of defence self-reliance and drummed up some document which did not indulge in the sort of hyperbole the Minister has indulged in about threatening environments, recognising that the measures he was announcing were wholly inappropriate to such alarmism. His advisers have had some frustrating months trying to hold this Government on course-a course which we supported when it was announced in the 1976 defence White Paper. Defence self -reliance has gone out the window. We have a bowdlerised form of the old forward defence with no place to be forward in. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has complained about allegations that he has cut expenditure. This is despite that fact-as the honourable member for Corio clearly pointed out-that his Government has never spent its entire defence appropriation in the period in which it has been in office. This year it will be about 84 per cent. If he feels that he is unjustly dealt with, he has been hoist with his own petard. Repeatedly this Government has presented dramatic statements to this House announcing dramatic new programs, which are in fact years down the pipeline, as though they could be implemented the next day. Nowhere has this tactic been more deceitfully used than at election time in my home State of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider the case of HMAS Stirling. Shortly prior to the 1977 State election, the Minister announced in a Press release that from early 1979 the Royal Australian Navy would be permanently based in Stirling-that two destroyers and two submarines would be deployed joining the two survey ships and a patrol boat. Then in September 1977, before the Federal election, as reported in Hansard for 22 September, the Minister announced that seven naval units would be deployed from there in 1980. By June 1980 this had been put back to 1985, and then last year to 1986. The Minister is silent on the matter in this statement, but he refers to cuts in facilities programs; so we may well anticipate that home porting will be put back further. I have absolute confidence, however, that HMAS Stirling will be back there on the agenda for the next election, and despite cutbacks in the follow-on destroyer program, we shall be told of an intention to utilise the base to its maximum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Derby airfield is another case in point. With mighty fanfare, in early 1980 we were told of an intended expenditure of $47m on upgrading it, so that Western Australian voters in the 1980 poll could feel secure. We find to date that only $190,000 has been expended on the base and that the Government will put back completion of it from four years to six years from this date. The Prime Minister ought not to be surprised when people talk of cuts when so much is promised in such a false atmosphere. We on this side of the House have often pointed out that those promises are incapable of fulfilment. For the reasons mentioned by the honourable member for Macarthur, these are expenditures which take place over a lengthy period. But that is not the impression that his party conveyed to the electorate. When we say those sorts of things to the electorate, we are accused of backsliding. </PARA>
<PARA> The cuts in the other part of the program, of equipment purchases-to answer the honourable member for Macarthur again-are greater than the expenditure on the Invincible. The Government has no clear understanding of its strategic priorities. This is at the heart of its failure to perform. This is what permitted it to get off track with the Invincible and to suppress some real priorities. I refer honourable members to the Australian of 29 March and to an article by William Pinwill, in which he quotes from a document on strategic priorities endorsed by the Chief of the Defence Force Staff. </PARA>

Suffice it to say that its accuracy has not been officially denied and it conforms to every assessment of priority that I have heard as a member of the Defence Sub-committee of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence when in public session defence spokesman have appeared before us. In that list of priorities, about which the honourable member for Macarthur is so keen, we find the sorts of priorities which would justify the purchase of the Invincible at the bottom. At the head of the list, in areas which are being very deeply cut in this defence statement, are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Intelligence collection and surveillance of areas of approach to our northern regions. </PARA>
<PARA> A strike capacity as a deterring influence and for strategic operations. </PARA>
<PARA> A capacity to combat air and seaborne operations launched against widely dispersed targets in northern Australia. Air defence of Australian forces, military and civilian facilities, population, industrial and administrative centres, particularly in the north, against air threat. </PARA>
<PARA> Initial and simultaneous defence by ground forces of a wide range of geographically dispersed civil and military facilities and population centres against airborne or limited seaborne assault. </PARA>
<PARA>These defence cuts hit hardest in those areas which are assigned the highest priority, in the north and the west. Let us look at them. The Government has announced a cutback in the purchase of additional patrol boats. Not only shall we not get the 10 extra promised in 1980, but also we shall not proceed with the five of the 10 already scheduled, and the suggestions of a patrol boat base in Western Australia's north-west has disappeared like snow in spring, despite its presence in the 1976 defence White Paper, in promises at subsequent elections in 1977 and 1980, and in the form of a budget for site acquisition in the 1980-81 defence budget-an amount that was not spent. Expenditure on the follow-on destroyers will be reduced. Anyone can see that additional ships are required and are necessary if home porting commitments at HMAS Stirling are to be achieved. They cannot be achieved from within the current force structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned delays in construction at Derby. The Minister, however , mentions cuts in other areas of the capital infrastructure program. We are therefore left to assume that, as much activity has been promised in this area, at Stirling, Pearce, Learmonth and Derby over the next few years, if cuts in installations are to take place, cuts will be taking place in planned expenditure in these areas. If I am not right about that, I shall be very pleased to hear the Minister in response, and in response to questions that I have placed on the Notice Paper about the matter. But there has been no indication to date that I am wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has deferred a second underway supply ship. It has justified having a second supply ship in the past as giving the Navy a 'two ocean capacity ' for long distance deployments in two oceans-in other words, an equalising of the Navy's activities in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Clearly, this decision will diminish or put back the chances of a permanent long distance deployment capacity from the Western Australian coast. The defence of our northern and north-western approaches will also be diminished by a reduction in training activities, flying, steaming time, storage and repair facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> When he made his statement in March 1980, the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Of fundamental importance to our military operations and defence preparedness is an improved availability of resources for such things as spare parts, maintenance and equipment repair, flying hours, steaming time, ammunition holdings and other stores, and higher states of training of skilled manpower. In these respects also we aim to broaden the expansion base and reduce the lead- time for movement to a higher state of operational readiness-</PARA>
<PARA>It is precisely these areas in which there has been announced a reduction of activities. In Western Australia, which is at the nether end of the training capabilities and deployment capabilities of the Navy and Air Force in particular and, therefore, at the most expensive end of exercises and deployments, we must expect-unless we are to be advised to the contrary-that deployment in our area will suffer the most. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the point I made earlier. It is not as though the Invincible were not useful. I would agree that if we wished to defend the Falkland Islands, the Invincible would be extremely useful. I would agree that if it were our intention in the near future to invade Fiji, the Invincible would be useful, and far more useful than the submarines, or whatever, to which the Australian Labor Party would prefer to assign priority. I would agree with all of that. But that is not the advice of the Government's defence advisers. That is not a sensible definition of priority in defence planning. All those items which have been cut back as a result of this purchase being brought forward lie at the very heart of defence self-reliance, at the very heart of solemn commitments and undertakings given to the Australian electorate by this Government which have been thoroughly supported by the Australian Labor Party right down the line. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we have never opposed an aggregate increase in expenditure. We have retained the right to criticise the priorities. In the light of our experience, in this statement made last week and in the presentations of honourable members on the Government side, it is just as well, for the sake of the defence of this country, that the Australian Labor Party has not agreed to a bipartisan approach on that particular question. </PARA>

<PARA> Since it was his intention, as I thought, to try to put some perspective into his remarks, let me seek to do so by mentioning four subjects which, I think, are of interest to us all. First of all, the objectives of Australian defence; secondly, the limitations that government defence planners face; thirdly, the present state of priorities and preparedness; and, fourthly, the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perfectly plain that the first aim of our defence policy should be to deter attack by any save a major power because that after all is the whole purpose of having a defence force; not to use it to attack but that it should deter an attack upon us. Secondly, in the event that the primary purpose fails, our aim should be to repel, irrespective of the level of attack, from, once again, any save a major power, be it a low level attack or a major attempt to attack the continent itself. Thirdly, our aim should be to act in concert with our allies-that the Australian Labor Party sometimes forgets, or praises and at the same time condemns-such as the United States and the United Kingdom, although it is far less present here than it used to be, and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the limitations and obstacles that face governments and government decision makers when deciding on priorities, and procurements. The first limitation is the fact that the objectives that we have to meet, that is the possible situations that we have to meet, put a variety of options before us . We may, for example, have to meet a low level of attack. On the other hand, we may have to meet an attack on the continent at some part of the coastline which is a long distance from major centres of communications. </PARA>
<PARA> The second limitation is that the spread of possibilities and the absence of a presently perceived threat to this country complicate matters. If a country is a land-locked European country it is a very much simpler thing to order one's defence priorities. One knows who is on one's borders and it is easier to make one's calculations. Here in this part of the world that we inhabit, without any perceived threat but with no assurance that the situation will continue, it is not as easy to order one's priorities because the options are greater. The third limitation is that we have the problems posed by our geography. We have a huge coastline with the concentration of population and material resources on the peripheries of this country. Lastly, there are the limitations inherent in any democracy, that is how it allocates funds between different domestic priorities such as how much it spends on social welfare, how much it spends on education, and how much it spends on defence. We have heard a lot of criticism from speakers on the Opposition side about the level of Government spending. We have not heard it suggested that the Opposition would increase spending or would match the present levels of Government spending. As well, one of the limitations we all face is the tendency, perhaps in this country and in other democracies in times of peace, to rely on others.</PARA>
<PARA> What are the consequences of these limitations? First of all, one can never be certain that one's force structure is right. The only way to prove it is when it has to be used and that of course is precisely what one always wants to avoid. Secondly, because of the difficulties that we face in having a variety of options, the different scenarios that this country might face in an unstable part of the world, we have to be even more cautious, more careful in our procurement decisions and in decisions affecting the force structure than other countries, other democracies, which are just as concerned as we are to defend themselves. If we are wrong and if we are tested we will not have time to go back to the drawing board. </PARA>
<PARA> What is our present and planned state of preparedness? First of all, there is an emphasis on maritime and air surveillance defence and attack systems. I have not heard any criticism of that. One might think for a country such as ours that it is the only rational policy we could adopt. As part of that policy we have had the recent decision to procure 75 F18 aircraft, HMS Invincible and to speed up the procurement of 10 P3C aircraft. The Opposition was hardly cordial in its reaction to the decision to purchase the F18s and of course that decision has not really been touched on in this debate since it makes rather farcical, does it not, the claims that the defence capacities of this country are being gutted, that they were in a state of wind-down and that there is a state of paralysis affecting the defence planning of this country. We are dealing with 75 of the top-line aircraft of this world, the highest state of the art available to us and that state of the art will constitute a very formidable weapons system, as everybody must acknowledge. The case in favour of the P3Cs has been conceded by the Opposition, reluctantly perhaps, so I will say nothing about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say something about the Invincible. The honourable member for Swan was kind enough in his balanced analysis of the defence decisions made by this Government to concede that if we were to plan to retake the Falkland Islands it might be a useful craft. One might think the honourable member in saying that was joining all other Opposition spokesmen who have said nothing in favour of the Invincible at all. I would be the first to agree with many honourable members on this side of the House that such an important decision must always raise doubts. One can never be utterly sure that one is making the right decision. But surely to God one would think the Opposition would have more to say on a subject so important to this nation than to direct to this purchase a tirade of abuse followed by a few smart cracks about retaking the Falkland Islands and put that forward as a measured, balanced and responsible reaction to the Government's decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at one or two things the Invincible can do and which have not been mentioned by members of the Opposition. First of all, it has a very considerable troop-carrying capacity. Secondly, it has a capacity to carry vertical take-off fighters. I am very glad that the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen), when he made his statement, made it clear that the Government entertained this aspect as an option, that is, he was not closing the door on procuring those fighters. Let us consider some of the kinds of problems that we might face. Nobody from the Opposition has mentioned our far-flung interests. The fact that the British have to fight many thousands of kilometres from Britain seems to the Opposition to be a matter of some slight amusement. </PARA>
<PARA> Has anyone from the Opposition stopped to think that the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are 2,700 kilometres north-west of Perth and even further from Darwin? Has anyone from the Opposition stopped to think that Norfolk Island is over 1, 600 kilometres from Sydney? Does anybody think that we can be certain that in 10 or 15 years we will not need the kind of capacity that the Invincible has to take care of some problem in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands region or elsewhere in the Pacific on islands which are near or far from our coast? For all the criticism that the Opposition has levelled how would it relieve the Cocos ( Keeling) Islands if an enemy force were there? Would it do that with a submarine ? The Argentinians tried that at South Georgia, and what happened? The captain and crew of one submarine came to dinner. One submarine is to be found on the shores of South Georgia. How was that submarine brought down? It was brought down by helicopters from an aircraft carrier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the honourable member of Swan has chosen to interject, how does he think that one patrol boat was taken out by the British and another damaged? That was done by a helicopter launched from an aircraft carrier. What would the Opposition have us do? I think it would probably have us buy a whole lot of these small-firing platforms, which, on one view of the equation, is sensible, and on another view, is highly dangerous because they are exceedingly vulnerable to just that sort of attack. Let us therefore accept that if the Opposition had intellectual honesty it would concede that there is a great deal to be said in favour of the purchase of the Invincible. It is dishonest and a disservice to the Australian public to say that there is nothing in favour of it and that the whole story is to the contrary. That is nonsense and dishonest, and that is known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Lastly, let me say something about the future. I think we would all agree that we live in unstable and dangerous times. I have not the slightest idea of what are the intentions in detail of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Mr Brezhnev does not talk to me nor to anybody else in this House that I am aware of. I include all members of the Opposition in that statement. But we can be certain of one thing; that is, that what the Soviet Union seeks is a radically different international balance of forces and one that all of us would find intolerable. So what should we do in our region? Clearly, we need to maintain our relationship with the United States of America. But that, in itself, is never enough. Next we need to continue with the building up of our forces. For my part, I would like this Government and the Opposition to agree that very much more money should be spent over the next 10 years on defence than the Opposition most certainly is prepared to spend. Thirdly, we have to develop our relationship with Japan. If one looks to a map of South East Asia and to the area between Japan and Australia, one is struck very clearly by one thing and that is that many of the countries between us have histories of governments which do not promote in our minds a feeling of stability and continuity. One thing that we can be certain about is that the Japanese defence capacity, which is now formidable, will increase over the years. It is in our long term interests that we work as closely as possible to secure a close defence relationship with that country. This may be many years away but it is something that we need to keep in the front of our thinking about defence and about the future of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). I think I should remind the House of its terms. The first paragraph deals with the failure of the Government to enunciate a clear defence strategy for Australia. I think that those people who have listened to the speeches of Government supporters in this debate to date will find it apparent that no clear strategy exists for the defence of Australia and that honourable members opposite have no idea what the aims of our defence policies are. Obviously the aims and strategies which were set out in the White Paper of 1976 have gone by the board. What, then, are our defence spending programs seeking to achieve? It is for the Government to make decisions on what tasks it expects the defence forces to be able to perform and what are the equipment needs to meet those requirements, and to follow through those programs once they are enunciated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the major criticisms which is levelled at this Government and which consistently can be levelled at this Government and its predecessors in office, which have a very similar record in the defence area, is that it has a long history of making snap decisions of major consequence which have subsequently not been carried through to completion or have been irrelevant to the long term planning about the capabilities and requirements of the Australian defence forces. The decision to purchase the Invincible fits clearly into this pattern. It is a decision which has more to do with the vision of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of Australia's international role in the foreign policy area than it has to do with the defence of Australia or the capacities and priorities for the establishment of the defence forces of Australia. This is the criticism. It might be easy to say that the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen), the Department of Defence or the defence forces have not carried through their planning roles or met the requirements of Australia's defence. But the facts are that collective Government decisions, especially those of the Prime Minister, have consistently undermined the long term planning and development of the Australian defence forces along lines which the Government clearly enunciated in 1976 and which it has not yet replaced by another set of criteria for the Australian defence forces. It may be that the Minister for Defence is responsible. However, it may well be, and is more likely, that he is the victim of Government decisions made in respect of financial and other commitments which act against the planning of our defence forces and the achievement of a position in relation to defence which would enable us to defend this country should it become necessary and to carry out those functions which we see as desirable and necessary for the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1976 in excess of 40 announced programs for equipment in the defence forces have been deferred, cancelled or substantially delayed. Some of these programs were announced in this House with a lot of trumpeting and great fanfare . Others have come and gone almost unnoticed. Unfortunately there is also a history of quickie statements-statements not properly thought through-being announced in this House when it has been obvious that they could not be carried through. It is now said that the purchase cost of the Orion aircraft is one of the reasons for the problems with the defence budget at the moment. It is one of the problems which has forced deferments and cancellations of equipment and the deferment of payments on items of equipment already in the pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA> In February 1980, the Prime Minister announced to this House that a modernisation program would be undertaken in respect of the P3B Orion aircraft. In March 1980, the Minister for Defence made a similar announcement in this House. This was despite the fact that the Australian Department of Defence some six years earlier had undertaken studies into the feasibility of modernising those aircraft and had determined that it was not cost effective and that it would be a better proposition to purchase new aircraft rather than seek to extend the life or change the technical capacities of those aircraft. It is not a case of a sudden problem relating to the P3Cs. It is a case of the Government making an announcement without first investigating the advisability of that announcement and subsequently having to go back on it because ultimately it came to the same conclusions as had been arrived at six years earlier. It was then decided to buy P3C aircraft. The advancement in the program was not caused by a sudden concern about additional capacity for anti-submarine warfare; it was brought about by the fact that the production run for these aircraft is about to cease. Because of procrastination and because of an incorrect decision back in early 1980 on a program which was not in the best interests of Australian defence planning, we are now caught in the situation where we place orders now and keep the production line going or the aircraft will not be available. That is the truth about the P3Cs. It is not that the Government has suddenly decided to advance that program; it has been caught by its own earlier mistakes in defence planning. </PARA>
<PARA> In a large number of areas the Government's advanced defence planning just does not add up. We have just heard that suddenly we will have a new capacity because helicopters will operate off the Invincible. One wonders in what way a helicopter operating off a highly vulnerable platform such as the Invincible is any better than a helicopter operating off an FFG. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) indicated that we would be dropping that capacity and would now be using the helicopters off a different platform. Let us not kid ourselves about the Invincible. An aircraft carrier is desirable in any defence situation, especially when a country has large reaches of sea to protect. It is not the desirability that matters; it is the priorities that are established for the expenditure of the funds available in the defence area that are important. Those priorities have to be questioned in this House because they do not fit into any pattern of strategic planning; they do not have any consequence for the defence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, if deterrence is the aim-that is what honourable members opposite have mentioned-we have reduced the deterrence available by purchasing the Invincible. It is a vulnerable platform that any country with the military capacity to carry out a major attack on Australia could plan to and know it could remove. It is not defended by any systems and the Minister has not indicated that systems for defence against missile atack will be incorporated. In fact, his statement earlier indicated that they will not be. It is to have its radar capacity, vital to the defence of any weapons system, reduced by 50 per cent by the replacement of its existing radar capability with the totally obsolete system which will be removed from the Melbourne. It has no fixed wing air defence and none is planned . It is a very expensive toy which will add little to the defence capacity of Australia but which will reduce other capacities significantly. </PARA>
<PARA> What we want to know, and what we as a parliament are entitled to know, is what is the strategic aim of the purchase of this piece of equipment when we see displayed no urgency whatsoever to produce equipment which will add to and provide for the actual defence of this country. The Australian defence forces have no surface-to-air missiles available at all. In fact, the Chief of Defence Force Staff some time ago made a rather alarming statement to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. He said: 'I understand we used to have one missile but we gave it away.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what he said, and the Minister knows it. We have no modern defence against an aircraft attack. I instance how vulnerable we are. At one stage, being half smart-which is not unusual for the Prime Minister-and trying to score political points, the Prime Minister spread the fact that Backfire bombers operating from bases in Vietnam could now operate over Australian soil. The statement backfired because the Prime Minister-who did not pursue the matter once he saw he was in trouble; for that I give him credit-found out that Australia had no defence capacity whatsoever in any shape or form against a Backfire bomber. Our fighters could not intercept it and the missiles with which the Mirage aircraft are equipped could not catch it; in other words, if the Russians decided to put a Backfire bomber over Australia we would have to sit by and hope they missed their targets, which they would not. We have no surface-to- air missiles and no interceptor or fighter aircraft capable of dealing with that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The planned update of the Mirage aircraft has gone by the board. So has the planned re-equipment of the F111 planes with electronics that would enable them to deal with precision weapons. So has the re-equipment of the Oberon submarines with Harpoon weapons-a program announced some time ago with a lot of flair but which has not been carried out. As the Minister well knows-certainly his advisers do-the F111 is one of the best aircraft in the world for obtaining and getting to a target. In its present capacity, with analogue computers, it lacks the ability to use precision guided weapons-the types of weapons that honourable members opposite will be telling us have been so successful in the Falkland Islands. The only capacity Australia's F111s have-even with the modified update taking place-is to drop iron bombs. It is a waste of a very sophisticated weapons system but there is to be no re-equipment in this program; it has gone. That would be one of those things which would help to provide a deterrent, to provide Australia with an adequate defence capacity. But there is no planning; there is no program. What there is is a series of announcements made by the Government whenever some crisis occurs-announcements which have no connection whatsoever with long term defence programs. There is no strategic aim; there is no development plan for the Australian defence forces; and there are no directions to the defence forces on what capacities they should plan to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA> Apparently we have only one aim and that is to provide Australia with the greatest capacity anywhere in the world to find submarines. I say 'to find' them but that is not a defence capability. It is to provide ourselves with knowledge. After we find them, we must have the capacity to destroy them. The honourable member for McPherson (Mr White), who spoke first in this debate today, made a lot of noise about the problems the Australian Army faced because conscription had been withdrawn. It might interest him to know that even now the Government cannot meet its recruitment programs. It cannot fulfill its stated recruitment aims. This is at a time of massive unemployment. If we are about defending liberty, we are entitled also to acknowledge that people in the community are entitled to that liberty, something the honourable member does not understand. </PARA>
<PARA> Most important to Australian defence-critical, in fact-is a capacity to get to the place where one is required to engage in action. A notable feature of major exercises in Australia is that logistic movements are excluded. They are simulated, not performed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to take part in the debate on the statement on defence last Thursday by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). That statement demonstrated the continuing commitment of the Government to the sound defence of this country. It included an announcement rescheduling the acquisition of certain items of equipment. This became necessary because of the opportunity to acquire HMS Invincible and the P3C Orion aircraft-items of equipment which I remind the House, were at all times times part of our defence program but which, happily for Australia, became available sooner and more cheaply than expected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is doubtful whether a statement has ever been so completely misrepresented as was that of the Minister. I take this opportunity to answer some of those misrepresentations. It has been said that defence cuts have taken place. The fact is that there have not been cuts in defence spending at all. This year defence spending has increased by 19 per cent in money terms, or about 8 per cent in real terms, which is an enormous increase. Also, it is clear that next year there will be a further increase in real terms. Indeed, defence spending should then reach an amount equal to about 3 per cent of gross domestic product. Unfortunately, the rescheduling of our defence purchases has been characterised as making cuts. This is simply not correct. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) stated, last Thursday I believe:</PARA>
<PARA> Deferred payments are not payments forgone. They are not payments which reduce their impact into the defence equipment budget. </PARA>
<PARA>Deferring some payments is part of the rescheduling which was referred to earlier in the Minister's statement on Invincible. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . though some rescheduling is unavoidable, this act should be measured against a background of other recent decisions involving substantial expenditure . </PARA>
<PARA>Rescheduling within the defence program takes place all the time; it is not new. It is part of the very nature of managing a large program, one that must be alive to changing circumstances and opportunities. The chance to buy Invincible was a rare opportunity, one of which the Government sought to take advantage. The opportunity arose quickly and the Government believed that its purchase should be given priority. I have no doubt that decision was correct. Further, the recent P3C decision was also taken against shifting circumstances, circumstances such that if we had not acted we would have had to wait many more years and eventually pay a vastly greater sum to get the aircraft. The honourable member for Corio, who is the Opposition spokesman on defence matters, seems to misunderstand the situation completely. Last Thursday he said amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA> The price to the Navy of the Invincible is to be . . . a substantive reduction in capacity, including a total loss of naval air power. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that he said 'total'-</PARA>
<PARA> But there is no suggestion that that power will be retained or that naval air power will be restored. There is to be no fixed wing aircraft on a carrier . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . only the British Navy, of all major navies, in fact relies solely on carrier-borne aircraft for naval air operations. </PARA>
<PARA>I will certainly return to the last sentence of that statement. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister . . . released a statement which indicated that a committee would be established to study the future of naval air power. The terminal date of the Melbourne has been known for five years. It was mentioned, as was an inquiry into the future of naval air power, in the 1976 White Paper . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate cost . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the purchase of Invincible--</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will be a reduced anti-submarine warfare capability in the Australian Defence Force . . . We are losing a capacity in pensioning off the Tracker aircraft. We will have no fixed wing aircraft on the Invincible. That fact has been announced. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Sea King helicopter depends on a dunking buoy sonar operation which is not of significant anti-submarine value in view of the numbers which can be operated from the Invincible. </PARA>
<PARA>It is instructive to consider these statements by the Opposition spokesman and then see just how much they are out of touch with reality. The fact is that the cost of purchasing Invincible, with initial support, is $475m. The cost of alternatives, such as the amphibious assault ship, LPH, of the United States Navy, would almost certainly be double this amount. Of course, the program has always included a ship of this type. The Government has simply taken advantage of an opportunity to get such a ship earlier and at a better price. Further, alternative platforms would not be available for some years following our acquisition of Invincible. Savings will be effected as a result of paying off Melbourne early and cancelling the proposed 1982 refit, lower running costs until Invincible arrives and in manpower over the life of the Invincible. The proposed expenditure on Invincible represents a very minor component of the total equipment expenditure in the defence program. In all, it amounts to about 6 per cent. It is not true to say that there will be a total loss of naval air power. Helicopters will remain in the Royal Australian Navy for both anti- submarine warfare and other tasks. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) referred also to other uses, including anti-surface action, to which helicopters can be put. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of embarked ASW helicopters was a major influence in the Government's decision to acquire a purpose-built ASW carrier. The British Navy relies not only on ship-borne helicopters and Harrier short take-off and vertical landing aircraft, but also aircraft of the Royal Air Force. Apparently, the honourable member for Corio did not know that. Shore-based aircraft include the Nimrod maritime surveillance aircraft, Nimrod air defence early warning aircraft and Tornado multi-role combat aircraft. Indeed, the suggestion by the honourable member for Corio that the Royal Navy alone, of all the major navies, relies solely on carrier-based aircraft is an extraordinary one. To my knowledge France, the United States, Spain and Italy-when its carrier has been completed- Brazil and India use a similar combination of land-based and carrier-based aircraft. It may be that Argentina does not have land-based aircraft dedicated to maritime support, but, if so, it is the only navy with a carrier, that I know of, that does not. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall now deal with some of the honourable member's other observations. There is to be, not a committee to study the future of naval airpower, but a working party to examine the position of the Navy's existing fixed-wing aircraft. This is a most important difference. In the short term, naval air power will be vested in helicopters, while maritime air power will additionally include appropriate aircraft of the Royal Australian Air Force-the P3C Orions, the F111s and the FA18 Hornets when they arrive. In the longer term, the question of the use of short take-off and vertical landing aircraft by the Navy will arise. No decision in that regard has yet been made, but I hope that eventually we will acquire Harrier types of aircraft to make full use of the capabilities of Invincible. </PARA>
<PARA> The terminal date for Melbourne, to which the honourable gentleman referred, has been quite flexible. Recent planning has been based on retaining her in service further into the 1980s. The 1976 White Paper stated that Melbourne's life 'can be extended to 1985'. The Government, in a sensible piece of rescheduling, has decided to be finished with Melbourne and obtain Invincible earlier. The decision not to pursue options to acquire a conventional aircraft carrier was a sensible one; even if an appropriate design had emerged the cost would have been excessive. Invincible can embark and operate up to 22 aircraft, including Sea Kings with dunking sonar. This would be more than adequate for ASW operations and, in fact, is more than can be carried in Melbourne at present. In this regard, Invincible has considerable spare capacity, which will be available for future generation ASW helicopters, with sonics for sonobuoys such as the BARRA, which was developed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short term we will be operating our existing Sea King ASW helicopters, with dunking sonar from the carrier, We have six in service and two are on order . Other helicopters, such as the Wessex, can be carried for embarked search and rescue purposes. The prospects for the purchase of additional ASW helicopters are under review. The Minister stated that 'planned expenditure for additional helicopters has been deferred', not that 'there would be no more ASW . . . helicopters', which is what I believe the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) alleged. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that, at a time when defence matters are more in public consciousness because of the Falklands situation, the announcement made last Thursday should be misrepresented as representing defence cuts. Let me remind the House that since the mid-1970s we have obtained for the Defence Force- specifically in this instance the Army-Leopard tanks, Rapier missiles, fire support vehicles, Land Rovers, other vehicles and Nomad aircraft. Equipment which is in the pipeline includes communications and electronic warfare equipment, medium 155 millimetre guns, light 105 millimetre guns and a large number of trucks and other vehicles. </PARA>

It is also worth reminding the House of major defence decisions taken at the time of or since the Budget last August. They include: The tactical fighter; the new basic trainer; 10 P3C aircraft-this has already been mentioned-Invincible; long lead items for the first follow-on destroyer; the modernisation of the guided missile frigates and a whole range of other items such as tactical teleprinters, laser airborne depth sounders and the like. Work is also proceeding on improvements to various of the defence facilities such as airfields and the Garden Island dockyard. When considering a major defence purchase, or indeed the construction of a major defence facility, it is worth remembering that such equipment or facilities will have to last for 25 years or more. This is well beyond the period where any sensible person could make precise predictions as to the future course of international events. It is desirable, therefore, to get weapons and weapons platforms which are the best, contain the greatest capacity for expansion, and are the most flexible that we can afford. The purchases in the current program meet that need.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My good friend the Minister for Defence raises an objection. I remember quite clearly stating in this House in August 1975 the announcement of the decision to purchase the 15 patrol boats. I am sure that the Minister for Defence, who was then in the Opposition, clearly and adequately recalls that event. Throughout these years all the major decisions that the Government has had to take on board were decisions that were made in that period of the Labor Government. I will grant to the Minister that his Government added two FFGs. It also added some more Leopard tanks. That proposition came to me as Minister for Defence from the Department of Defence and I rejected it. It came to the current Minister who, as we all know, is the long-serving Minister for Defence, although I understand that that period of tenure may be coming to an end. I regret that, but I hope he enjoys greener and more lucrative fields in the future. He ordered them and, of course, what happened was that they all went into mothballs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of observations have been made during this debate of the Australian Labor Party's administration of defence. We set out very clearly and concisely the defence doctrine, of what Australia's defence was about. I was delighted to see in the 1976 White Paper that all the propositions that we had put forward in the period 1972-75 had been accepted by the Government. The only real difference is that, having accepted them, it has proved a monumental incapacity to implement them. Time after time great promises have been made but time after time the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) have come into this House and had to regret sincerely their incapacity to carry out the plans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition moved an amendment recently in relation to the aircraft carrier. One of the points of that amendment-I will read it because it is very relevant to what we are discussing tonight-was the proposition that the matter should be considered by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in order to study the effects of the purchase of an aircraft carrier on future defence procurement programs. It is very important and it is very necessary in making any decision on defence to ensure, firstly, that it happens to conform with the strategic analysis of the situation; secondly, that it happens to complement the force structure-not just the Navy, the Air Force or the Army, but the defence structure-and, thirdly, that it should happen to play some part in a sensible and rational defence financial program. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has not been able to meet those three important criteria. The five-year rolling program is something that it has never been able to understand . When an item comes in at year five it is not a decision to purchase. It enters that five-year rolling program as part and parcel of a defence planning exercise . The idea of having a five-year rolling program is to iron out the humps and drops in defence expenditure so that we have a sane and sensible defence program . But, unfortunately, this Government has not been able to do that. With the purchase of the Invincible and the accelerated purchase of the P3C aircraft- again items that we had originally ordered and that the Government has added to over a period-has had a tremendous impact on the budgetary arrangements, or the financial arrangements, and the Government's whole program is in tatters. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the documentation that has not been referred to in this debate. I think it is important that we should refer to it. I refer to the explanatory notes of the Department of Defence about the estimates of expenditure in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). These were provided-I think that this is something that we as members of the House of Representatives should keep in mind-to our colleagues in the Senate but were not provided to us. The estimates provide for an expenditure this year of $81.6m on the aircraft carrier. If we look at the total program of expenditure for 1981-82 on naval construction, as provided for in division 234.1.01, we find that the program was estimated at $ 202.9m. If we add to what was agreed upon by this Parliament in the discussion of the Budget the figure of $81.6m, which is what the cost of the aircraft carrier involves this year, we come up with a figure of $284.5m. But when we turn to the revised estimates put forward by the Government we find that, instead of asking for $284.5m, it has asked for only $238m. Therefore, the Navy' s program-not the program of the Air Force or the program of the Army-has been effectively cut by $46.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is not all. If we look also at the documentation from the Government in the form of the statement of savings expected in the annual appropriations we find some more interesting figures and facts. A felicitous word, 'savings', is used. If one looks at division 234.1.02, which relates to aircraft and associated equipment, one finds that expenditure on this item has been slashed- admittedly it is covered by this lovely word 'savings' but it has been slashed nonetheless-by $62.7m. If we turn to division 234.1.04 we find that expenditure on other equipment and stores has been slashed by $73m. Let us get rid of this nonsense of the Government that the expendture program has not been slashed. These documents prepared by the Government show in the vital area of defence equipment that the program has been slashed. So let us not monkey around with these phrases that the Government has put forward. It is an effective cut in the most sensitive area of our procurement programs-the area of equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> This means that there has been, to use the new lexicon that the Minister for Defence has developed, a deferral, a rescheduling and a termination of the major programs of the Air Force and the Navy. So we come to the basic consideration that expenditure on the aircraft carrier is not only distorting the Navy's force structure but also reducing the force structure of the other Services. There was a lot of talk this afternoon about the effects and priorities and so on. But what is happening is that this impetuous decision has distorted the financial program. That is what this debate is all about; this is what we are discussing tonight; this is why we are discussing this matter. Not only is it distorting the financial program but also it is effectively distorting the force structure of the Navy as well as the Air Force and the other service. That is what we are considering; that is why this statement is being debated in this House today. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reference in our motion is to the persistent failure of the Government to maintain its announced defence program. It is a long, sorry sad history of persistent failure. It goes back to 1971 when Prime Minister Gorton announced a decision to cut $75m of Government spending; and, of that $75m, $21. 5m came from defence. Who do honourable members think was the Minister for Defence in those days presiding over these cuts in defence expenditure? It was none other than the present Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> What is interesting is the rationale. It was said: 'There will be, however, some slowing down of a large range of purchases and delays'. This was the rundown in the period 1968 through to 1972. Observations have been made about the Australian Labor Party's defence expenditure. But all of those cuts were made in the period prior to 1972. Before that year, there was a substantial cut in the expenditure on defence equipment. In 1968-69, actual expenditure on new equipment amounted to something of the order of 25 per cent of the Budget. By 1971-72, that figure had dropped to 11.5 per cent. For anyone who wants to seek to contradict me, this information is contained in the annual reports of the Department of Defence. We had to pick up the shambles in 1972 to 1975. We made a very conscious decision that what was needed in the Australian defence forces was a greater emphasis on equipment. We can analyse each expenditure on equipment from 1972 to 1975 and onwards. We do not pay for all of these things in one fell swoop. The whole program of capital equipment that we initiated in that period is still continuing. We are still paying for some of the decisions. But when it came to decisions on FA18 aircraft and decisions on the aircraft carrier-the seaborne air platform-this Government got itself into a monumental mess because it did not understand-and I fear it still does not understand-the requirements of defence planning and the real meaning and real intent of a five- year rolling program. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the performance of the Labor Party. Despite all the rhetoric of the Liberal Party, all the pomp of the statements made in the 1976 White Paper and the statements made in the fervour of Afghanistan, the expenditure in terms of gross domestic product of the first six years of the Liberal Government was exactly the same-that is 2.6 per cent of GDP-as that which the Labor Government achieved in the 1975-76 Budget. So it is preposterous for the Government to criticise the performance of the Labor Party, because the whole basis of what this Government has done over the last five years has been what was laid out by the Labor Party. But tonight we are faced with a dismal statement, a statement that is a confession of mismanagement by the Government. It cannot manage its defence procurement programs and it has not brought forward a consistent line on defence doctrine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Shortly before the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) sat down, he used a somewhat pejorative phrase-'the fervour of Afghanistan'. I remind him that there are still some 100, 000 Russian soldiers in Afghanistan. I remind him of the occasion when, at the Congress of Vienna, there was a break up of the Napoleonic Empire and the news was brought to the great Austrian statesman Metternich that the chief Russian delegate had died. Metternich said: 'Died, has he? I wonder what can have been his motive?' I should like to ask the honourable gentleman, who tosses off such smart phrases as 'the fervour of Afghanistan': What is the motive of the Russian presence in Afghanistan today?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I first came to the Department of Defence, seemingly a long time ago, I had but two high hopes. The first was that it would be possible to introduce some rationality in defence debate throughout this country. The second was that it would be possible to find some measure of bipartisanship in defence considerations. After the period that I have spent as Minister, I must confess that I am sharply disappointed. I should have thought that it would be at least possible for men and women of clear conscience to agree upon facts and then to interpret facts according to their prejudice or according to their political philosphy-but at least to agree upon facts. </PARA>
<PARA> I find myself somewhat dismayed, looking at the packed Press Gallery, that during the last few days some of the lamentations about the statement I put down last Thursday have been directed towards the fact that I did not hold a Press conference after making the statement. This is no mere sentimental grievance. I strive in this world to observe good manners towards everyone. In the 27 years in which I have been in this Parliament, I have placed in high priority the observance of good manners towards this Parliament. It is an institution that I value very highly. I should like those in the Press Gallery, principally from the Australian and the Age, to understand but one thing: I was elected to this Parliament, not elected to come here and to answer to Press conferences. </PARA>
<PARA> I would regard it as an insult of the highest order if I delivered a speech and walked out of the House without listening to the member who followed me, and I would regard it as a gross offence to my friend the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), who moved an amendment, if I had sailed out to go to a Press conference. The amendment was seconded by the honourable member for St George, and I felt under the clearest obligation to stay and listen to him. After having listened to both of my honourable friends-disagreeing vigorously, I assert-I was then under an obligation to introduce the Defence Force Discipline Bill, a Bill that had been hanging around this country and this Parliament for some 37 years. I am prepared to face the Press of this country at any time, but it will be a time of my choosing, and I do not propose to be instructed in parliamentary behaviour by any political columnist or by any editorial writer. My obligation is to this Parliament and to the people I represent, and I hope that is clearly understood by the Press. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I noticed that one of the papers was invoking a non-journalistic political commentator. Who is he? Anonymity or accusation! Has this House got to the stage where it feels inured to this? If the writer has qualifications, let them be paraded. Let us find out who he is, if he has any bias, if he has any competence. I appeal to honourable ladies and gentlemen on both sides of the House to understand the importance of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I congratulate the honourable member for St George on what I must describe as an almost virginal display of moderation because this evening he went to the very heart of the difficulty in defence planning, namely, the fact that it is not something which is static, something which is immutable. I am under heavy obligation to my honourable friend for having reminded the House of that salient , that singular, that solitary dominating fact-that defence planning is not inflexible. But I want to invite honourable members to agree on one fact and that is-use what figures they may like-at the end of the day they must come to the conclusion that this year in money terms, as against last year, there is a 19 per cent increase. I am prepared to listen to argument as to whether or not it is in real terms. I am duty bound to listen to argument and I have a heavy preference to listen to argument provided it is honestly, cleanly and directly delivered. But when I find in a newspaper like the Age language such as 'Massive defence cuts', I want to ask my distinguished friend Creighton Burns: What would he say if he had a 19 per cent increase in salary? Would he face the board of directors with equanimity and say 'Oh, it has been a cut'? Would he say to his board if his circulation had increased by 19 per cent 'Oh, but I would like to say to you, Mr Ranald Macdonald, and to your colleagues that the circulation has gone up by 19 per cent but you tell me it is a cut'? It is the language of Alice in Wonderland: When I use a word it means what I choose it to mean, nothing more , neither less. </PARA>
<PARA> The central feature of this defence debate-I am indebted again to my honourable friend from St George; it is a pity that the debate could not run on for several days-is the question of priorities. I do not gainsay it in any shape or form. My honourable friend may seek to impeach me, to rebuke me; but I use the language of deferrals. I am not conscious of having used the language of cuts. This is precisely one of the conspicuous features of the five-year defence rolling program in this country. It is not, as the honourable gentleman says, something static, something immutable. It is something that changes-changing according to technological advance, changing according to strategic circumstances, changing according to contractual opportunity. At the very Mediterranean of this argument we find two things, and I am prepared to discuss them. The program has been disturbed by two things. One is the purchase of the helicopter carrier, the HMS Invincible, and the other involves the P3C aircraft. I do not wish in any way to lacerate my friend the honourable member for Corio but I say this to him: He is the only person I have heard to offer any complaint about the program of the P3C Orion aircraft. I do appeal to my honourable friend to come to the Department of Defence and get his facts right, not according to me but according to the neutrality of professional officers. My friend has confused his mind with the installation in the 1970s of Barra equipment in the P3Cs and the possibility of installing Barra equipment in the P3Bs. It was decided against going the P3B way for a variety of reasons. Today that judgment has been reinforced because the fatigue life of the P3B would be shortened considerably. In 1995 very special measures would have to be taken to carry it through to the year 2000 but the life of the P3Cs would be much longer. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the Invincible. This is where we differ. When I put down a statement in this House announcing the Government's decision in September 1980 about the acquisition of an anti-submarine warfare capability by the way of a helicopter carrier for this country, I was astonished; there was very little public debate about it. For a variety of reasons, not the least of them being that the United Kingdom found itself in financial difficulty, we got the bargain-priced offer of the Invincible. I will go on to argue about whether the Opposition thinks the acquisition is merited. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hear my honourable friend say: 'It is not'. One editorial writer asked: 'Where is this submarine threat to this country?' I think it is time the country was told this. A bit of gleaning from Janes Fighting Ships alone, quite apart from any other source, will produce the information that in Littoral countries in our region there are some 300 submarines, and the preponderance of those are held in the Soviet Pacific fleet. That is the threat. People may dismiss it and say: 'This is of no account'. But I want to say to the House that when the opportunity was presented to this country for the acquisition of Invincible the Government was under the clearest obligation to consider it, and to consider it earnestly. I can find any number of my Service advisers who do not share the judgment which was made. But this judgment one can find altering from one piece of defence equipment acquisition to another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not seek to make mean points. This is my twenty-seventh year here. I do not propose to stay another 27 years. I am interested in this Parliament and I am interested in this country. I am interested in my family and I am interested in my friends. The mean points no longer interest me. But I cannot recall a debate on one piece of heavy defence equipment that has met opposition approval. I can take my honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) through some of the speeches which he made upon the acquisition of the F111 in which he described the aircraft in harsh and rather rugged terms. I could point him to debates held in this House and in another place on the acquisition of the FA18. To what point? What does it serve? The fact is that we are under an obligation to consider these matters as objectively as we can. I believe that this nation was clearly charged with the responsibility of finding for itself a significant ASW capability. As I say, there may be differences upon this great issue. We could not find that capability by using P3Cs. We could not find it by using the FFG helicopter which, I am sorry to say, is still far out there. The technology in that field sweeps at a pace which fills me with both awe and, indeed, a sense of horror. But this opportunity came our way. If we were to acquire this ASW capability seaborne there was the opportunity. We would never find it through the other two carriers made available, the Iwo Jima or the Garabaldi class carriers. There was the opportunity and the judgment had to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not seek to take any mean point, because my great complaint about contemporary Australia is that there are occasions when we seem to concentrate upon those matters which divide us rather than attending to those things which should indeed unite us. If we could have the opportunity of a more extensive debate upon these issues in this House-I would seek the first such opportunity-I believe that we would find a greater measure of commonality. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing I want to say to the House, and through this House I trust to the country, and please God into the hearts and minds of Australians, is that I referred in my statement to what I regard as being the dire threat that faces the whole of civilised mankind-no, the whole of mankind, even though he be uncivilised-and that is the nuclear holocaust and the great gathering of nuclear strength now possessed by the two super-powers. This is the outstanding commitment which must be addressed by every man and every woman interested in the preservation of the species. I can understand the fretful anxiety of some of my honourable friends opposite who seek to take some advantage out of this. I have not yet abandoned my conviction that given the time, given the opportunity, we will find a greater measure of agreement than they have now paraded before us . </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill and the Radiocommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1982, which I will introduce shortly, vary the basis on which radiocommunications licence fees are charged. The intent of these Bills is to allow for radiocommunications licence fees to be determined on a basis other than solely the recovery of the costs of administering the radio spectrum. In future, regulations made under the Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill 1982 will set out the fees applicable. At present, licence fees are determined by regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905. This Bill also includes a provision to ensure that all Commonwealth and Territory authorities are required to pay fees. In addition, it provides for transitional arrangements to exempt licencees who have already paid licence fees under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 from payment of fees under the new Bill, in respect of the grant or renewal of licences during the period 1 July 1981 to the date of commencement of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA> Other matters connected with the implementation of these measures are included in the Radiocommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1982. Honourable members will be aware that section 55 of the Constitution requires that no matter other than the imposition of taxation can be validly dealt with in a tax Act. The costs of providing radio frequency management services relate, among other factors, to the amount of spectrum space needed to accommodate the service , to whether the service is in a valuable part of the spectrum, to the service's potential to interfere with other services and to the power allocated. Each assignment complicates the task of succeeding assignments as there is less spectrum available for allocation. </PARA>
<PARA> All these factors were taken into account when setting radiocommunication licence fees for 1981-82. As this financial year was the first year in which full cost recovery was implemented, there was an overall increase in most categories of fees of the order of 12 per cent. However, some categories of licences increased by much greater percentages as these categories of licences were previously charged at levels well below the costs associated with them. The licencees, in some cases, faced increases in fees of the order of many thousands of dollars. The television industry was particularly affected due to its extensive use of wide-band fixed links. Let me explain that many television stations introduced their television services and the translator adjuncts to them largely because of the concessions that are available in this area. While at that stage full recompense was not sought for the connection of these links, it is felt that there should now be a redistribution of charges. It was with that in mind that the charges were changed at the time of the last Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> These fixed links are essential to the operation of many stations, especially to those stations serving a viewing population spread over a wide area. The links are used to distribute programs to remote transmitters and for studio to transmitter links. These facilities were established at great capital cost at a time when the licence fees for these radiocommunications links ranged from $40 to around $300. Accordingly, the cost of a radiocommunication licence for these links was very low in comparison with the costs involved in establishing and maintaining them. I might point out that, because they were low, many of these stations were able to provide an extension of services that otherwise the higher cost-the cost that is now to be imposed-might well have precluded. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1981-82, with the implementation of full cost recovery in the radio frequency management area, the cost of licensing these links increased dramatically with the fee liability of two stations now exceeding $30,000. Most other existing licence fee categories were not affected to the same extent as the fees paid by them in previous years were relatively close to the cost recovery related fees introduced in 1981-82. The Government's attention has been drawn to the problems that these increases have caused some licencees and, following reconsideration of the matter, the Government has decided that some adjustment in fees is necessary. The Government remains firmly committed to full cost recovery in the area of radio frequency management but acknowledges that a period of phasing in of these fees is appropriate and that the measures should be retrospective to 1 July 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been advised that it would be appropriate for its objectives to be achieved by the introduction of legislation providing for the imposition of licence fees as taxes, with the actual levels of fees being established in regulations made under the new legislation. Accordingly, licence fees would cease to be prescribed in the Wireless Telegraphy Regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905. </PARA>
<PARA> In introducing these Bills, I wish to make three things clear. First, the Bills do not indicate an intention on the part of the Government to increase immediately and substantially radiocommunications licence fees. The appropriate levels of these fees will be determined by the Government in the light of all relevant factors. Of course, this significantly includes the cost of providing the administration of the spectrum itself. Second, the fees to be imposed by these measures do not apply to normal television and broadcasting receivers. There is no suggestion that they should do so. Third, commercial television and radio stations are licensed under separate legislation in respect of their broadcasting activities-that is, transmissions intended for reception by the general public. Fees imposed under this legislation will not apply to those activities. Radiocommunications licence fees apply to the transmission and reception of private and business radio communications conducted via two-way radios and microwave links. In fact, the charges under this Bill will provide for an extension of three years within which full cost recovery will be implemented. I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have mentioned previously, the Radiocommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1982 implements measures that could not be included in the Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill 1982 because of Constitutional requirements. The Bill amends the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 by omitting from it the existing provisions relating to the payment of fees for the grant or renewal of licences, as these are now provided for in the Radiocommunications Licence Fees Bill 1982. It also authorises fees to be prescribed for other matters relating to the administration of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has also been made for any fees already paid to be refunded or offset against future payments if they are greater than fees payable under the new legislation. In addition, the Bill repeals that part of the Overseas Telecommunications Act 1946 which exempts the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia)-or OTC as most of us know it-from the payment of licence fees. Consequently the Commission will be required to pay radiocommunications licence fees for its use of the spectrum. I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill (No. 1) 1982 is one of a series of general statute law revision Bills. It amends 39 different Acts of Parliament and contains 237 clauses. We are pleased that the Government has accepted the suggestion of the Opposition, made in November last year, that these Bills should be titled and numbered as this Bill is. Honourable members can imagine the difficulties for practitioners in trying to find out what amendments have been made to legislation when it is put in a package which amends so many Bills. The only point I make is that modesty forbids me from saying which member of the Opposition made that suggestion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill involves the responsibilities of 10 different shadow Ministers. If each of them were to speak on the Bill the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) would have a haemorrhage because we would be here for many hours. Basically it is a non-controversial Bill. I suggest to the Government that while we do not disagree with the introduction of Bills of this kind, it would be a useful idea if, in future, they were referred to legislation committees where the detail of the Bills could be discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already made comments about legislation committees. I believe that if amendments are made in a legislation committee it is neither a win to the Opposition nor a victory to the Government: It is Parliament and, in particular, this House exercising its right to scrutinise legislation. I believe it is unfortunate that when legislation such as the Customs Amendment Bill 1979, which dealt with narcotics, is substantially amended by virtue of amendments proposed by the Opposition the Press chooses to see it as a defeat for the Government. I can understand why the Government has felt reticent about sending legislation to committees since that date. However, the Customs Amendment Bill established important principles in terms of civil liberties because of the amendments then passed. Bills such as this, I believe, are ideal for sending to legislation committees and I hope the Government will consider that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe there is much point in rehashing the points made in the second reading speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) who represents the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). The most important of the amendments are concerned with the companies and securities law and my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) will be dealing with these. Those amendments were fully debated in the Senate. They relate to the Companies Act in a number of ways which he will fully elaborate on, namely, investigation, the question of interim orders and the question of declaration pursuant to section 60. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act go some way towards mitigating provisions preventing the disclosure of the giving of reasons for decisions which we in the Opposition have objected to in the past. Whilst they do not go as far as we would like, we welcome the reforms. The amendments being made to the Acts Interpretation Act relating to regulations have been the subject of recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, and the Opposition supports them. We also think it appropriate that the title of the Australian Capital Territory's highest judge be Chief Justice rather than Chief Judge, which puts him on par with the Chief Justices of all State courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Many other amendments are being made by this Bill. A quite important one is the amendment to enable royal commissions to function in foreign countries. Again, we support that provision. Many of the other amendments are purely of a drafting or correctional nature. Some of them are to previous statute law revision Acts, however they have been called, but we would be the first to concede that parliamentary draftsmen, particularly when they are dealing with laws as detailed as these types of Bills, may make mistakes. We do not object to that and we do not object to correction of those mistakes in Bills such as this. I said on the last occasion when a Bill such as this was before the House in November 1981 that it would be far better if matters of substance were not dealt with in these statute law Bills. I think that is important. I regard matters relating to the companies, securities and takeover laws as being matters of substance. I think it would have been better had they been dealt with by separate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Last time we were debating a Bill such as this we dealt with 29 Acts of Parliament. This time we are dealing with 39 Acts, and I hope we will not see any increase in that number unless we are dealing with amendments of a purely drafting or technical nature. I hope that the Government will take up this suggestion that in future these Bills be dealt with by a legislation committee so that the details of the Bills can be discussed. The very fact that we are in this Bill amending two previous statute law Bills ought to be testament enough to the fact that we ought to spend more time discussing these Bills in that way. Accordingly, the opposition supports the legislation. My colleague will be elaborating on those provisions relating to the companies and securities Acts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to concentrate in my remarks on the amendments which are provided in this Bill to three of the codes of the national Co-operative Companies and Securities Scheme. At the outset I wish to register my objection to the burying in an omnibus Bill of these important amendments. Many of these are of substance and are, if not in themselves controversial, at least related to issues and problems which have been considered controversial by sections of the business and legal communities. This so-called omnibus Bill contains amendments to 39 different Acts. Therefore, it is very difficult to draw appropriate public attention to the changes involved in any one area and subsequently to use the printed statute in an easy and efficient manner. Moreover, this is just a further means of reducing the effective scrutiny of company law in this Parliament-scrutiny already taken from us to a great extent by the dictates of the co-operative scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, notwithstanding this objection, the Opposition supports the Bill. Indeed, it welcomes its provisions which in general clarify and enhance the powers of the National Companies and Securities Commission in ways which we as an Opposition have previously sought. The amendments represent a reasonably speedy response by the Ministerial Council to the weaknesses which a number of Supreme Court decisions earlier this year revealed in the original statutes, particularly weaknesses which were revealed in the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act which deals with the takeovers code. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I make more specific comments about the amendments which are proposed, I would like to make some brief comments on the rather quaint legal decisions which have made this amending legislation necessary. Quite frankly, the Opposition was astonished and dismayed at some of the Supreme Court decisions. For instance, the decision by Mr Justice Sheahan in the Queensland Supreme Court in many circumstances effectively prohibited the NCSC from conducting hearings into company takeovers. Surely that is what the whole of that legislation was all about. In my view, narrow and mistaken legal interpretations in that case severely weakened the clear intention of the legislation expressed in section 36 of the National Companies and Securities Commission Act, which gives the NCSC a general power to hold hearings. In my view, this extraordinary decision pointed to one of the fundamental flaws of the co-operative as distinct from national approach to company law. Clearly, it is open for each of the States supreme courts to adopt a different interpretation of the law and, in so doing, make a mockery of the concept of national uniformity. </PARA>
<PARA> We can only wonder at how often we will find ourselves debating in this national Parliament, amending laws made necessary by disparate and disjointed legal interpretations adopted in any of the States' courts. How often can we be assured that quick Ministerial Council responses will be forthcoming under the cumbersome decision-making processes of the scheme? How many important cases in which action is required will be swept under the carpet while such amendments are awaited? Already we have seen the unsatisfactory deal between Ron Brierley's Industrial Equity Ltd and the Sydney Stock Exchange. This became necessary following a decision in the New South Wales Supreme Court. The deal did not involve a compulsion on IEL to complete a takeover, thereby giving fair and appropriate opportunities to minority shareholders. But rather it merely led to a partial divestment of the IEL shareholdings in Hutton Ltd. The deal lost sight of the original intention of the takeover code-the protection of the rights of minority shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to be hoped that the amendments provided in this Bill will rectify these immediate problems. The amendments to the Companies Act include the insertion of a new section 16A which provides specifically for investigations by the NCSC where the Commission has reason to suspect that a person has committed an offence under the Act. This strengthening of the investigatory powers of the Commission is welcomed by the Opposition. We note that this power extends also to the acquisition of shares codes. I suggest that that would appear to be where it is most needed. Most of the other amendments to the Companies Act are not controversial or of great significance, and all are supported by the Opposition. They will, I hope, assist the Commission in the administration of the Act when it commences. </PARA>
<PARA> As we understand it, it is currently planned to bring the company law into effect on 1 July this year. I understand, however, that the necessary legislation has not yet been passed by one of the State parliaments owing to the Tasmanian election. It seems quite possible that Australia will therefore still not have a uniform company law after July. It is already over seven years since the conservative political parties in this country rejected Labor's National Companies Bill and almost seven years that we have awaited the completion of the cumbersome hybrid that is the co-operative scheme. I wonder whether the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), who represents the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack), would be able, at the conclusion of this debate, to inform the House as to what the Government now expects will happen in relation to the commencement of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Act which forms part of the companies scheme and which is amended by this Bill is the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act, which sets out the law in relation to takeovers. I have already indicated the Opposition's reaction to some of the cases which have been dealt with under this code. The amendments proposed are of considerable importance. The courts are given the power to make interim orders; that is, orders which may secure the rights of certain parties before a full hearing has been completed and a decision given. The NCSC is also to be given the power to make orders in a new provision, proposed new section 60A. Where the NCSC has declared an acquisition of shares or other conduct to be unacceptable pursuant to section 60 the Commission may now make orders regarding acquisistions, disposal and transfer of shares. This provision should greatly enhance the Commission's powers under this code, and brings them more into line with the greater powers which had already been conferred under the Securities Industries Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions in relation to section 60 are also amended in other ways. The Commission is now to have 90 days, instead of only 14, in which to make a declaration. In another change, it is intended that target companies and their members may apply to a court for orders to protect the rights of any person affected by unacceptable conduct. Each of these amendments is clearly sensible. </PARA>
<PARA> Very briefly, I mention also the Opposition's support for the changes to the Securities Industry Act. These include provision for interim orders by the supreme courts in relation to sections 14, 83 and 147 of the principal Act. Once again, these streamline the powers available under the legislation and shorten the reaction time of the authorities. In an industry in which speed and flexibility are of paramount concern these amendments must be welcomed, and we in the Opposition do just that. </PARA>
<PARA> It remains for me to make only one further point in relation to the companies and securities package with which this Bill deals. As I have indicated in relation to other areas of the administration of law which are the responsibility of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, it is going only half way to ensuring that the statute is well drafted and effective; equally important is the quality of the administration of the law. The National Companies and Securities Commission has already done an excellent job, given the extreme constraints which have been placed on it. We in the Opposition applaud the efforts the NCSC has made to this time. But unfortunately it has to work, largely on the basis of goodwill, with a mixed bag of corporate affairs commissions which are maintained by the States. At the same time, it continues to suffer from a staff ceiling which is ridiculously low, indeed significantly below the levels which had been anticipated as necessary by the Ministerial Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The work load at present, of course, is largely associated with only the securities industry and the acquisition of shares codes. In July, or soon after, the companies code will be added to the responsibilities of the Commission. One shudders at the thought of the work pressures that could arise if a heavy period of company failures or other problems arise later this year as the recession in this country deepens. I appeal to the Government to reconsider its entire attitude to the provision of resources to bodies such as the NCSC. There is absolutely no serious controversy about the need for effective companies and securities regulation. This is not an area which can be sensibly considered as being subject to de-regulation or small government rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> The health and strength of the private sector depends on the confidence that the investing public has in it. That is what companies and securities regulation is all about-maximising disclosure, security and confidence in relation to the investment of funds in limited liability enterprises. It is the Opposition's strong hope that when the Fraser Government finally appoints its sixth Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs he will demonstrate a responsible attitude by reinforcing the staff and resources of the National Companies and Securities Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Albury-Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill seeks to vary the conditions under which certain financial assistance is provided pursuant to the Albury-Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) Act 1973 and to repeal section 10 of that Act. The sad thing about this Bill is that, although it has far reaching implications, the second reading speech of the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) and the explanatory memorandum fail to explain the tragedy of the lack of action and support by this Government in relation to the Albury-Wodonga concept. Section 10 of the principal Act provided Commonwealth moneys for the States of New South Wales and Victoria to acquire land and to carry out public works programs in a planned decentralisation proposal for Albury-Wodonga. It was an historic experiment and an historic decision. It involved three governments, two conservative State governments-that of Victoria and of New South Wales-with, of course, the Commonwealth Labor Government of 1972-75. Moneys were made available to those States at the long term bond rate to be repaid over 30 years. No interest was to be paid in the first 10 years. It was to be deferred, capitalised, and repaid over the remaining 20 years of the loan. The conditions were set to allow the Development Corporation to get the Albury-Wodonga project under way, to give it time to allow it to generate income and to pay off its long term loan which, of course, within a year or two, would have been coming forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 3 of the amending Bill will repeal section 10 of the original 1973 Act. Clause 4 ensures that, except in the case of loans for municipal works, the States are now relieved of any obligation to pay interest that may have accrued on loans prior to July 1981. But, in lieu of repayments to the Commonwealth, it was agreed that the Commonwealth would have access to the funds generated from the development activities. The proposed amendment to the 1973 Act will enable the new agreement to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I examine why the Commonwealth has taken this action, let me outline briefly some of the aspects of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation proposal. Albury-Wodonga was first proposed as a selective growth centre in 1969 by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Whitlam. He proposed it, spoke about it prior to the 1969 election and developed his arguments during that election. He again brought it forward in 1969 when I became spokesman for the party on urban and regional affairs and developed the arguments in support of that concept. Mr Whitlam again brought it forward, on behalf of the Labor Party, in his policy speech of 1972. One of the early actions of the Whitlam Government when elected in December 1972 was to seek a conference with the New South Wales and Victorian State Liberal governments. A meeting was held in Albury on 25 January 1973. Arising out of that historic meeting, the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Whitlam, issued a Press statement. It is a very historic document and I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ALBURY-WODONGA</PARA>
<PARA>Introductory Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr E. G. Whitlam, Albury Civic Centre, 25 January 1973</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This is an historic meeting. It is the first time on which the Governments of the two oldest and most important States have come together with the Commonwealth to plan the development of a new city. I trust it will signal the beginning, not only of similar regional development projects, but of a new spirit of common enterprise within our federation. The Murray River, once the symbol of colonial separation and interstate rivalries, may yet come to stand for a new era of interstate co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA> All three Governments represented here are committed to decentralisation. New South Wales and Victoria have worked towards this goal over many years. But my Government believes that only with the active participation of the Commonwealth, in a scheme involving all three Governments as well as the local authorities, can real decentralisation be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> This enterprise is therefore a challenge to our energy, our ability to work together, and our determination to ensure the success of a pilot project which may one day convert our former dreams and theories into living and concrete reality. On the outcome of this task, the whole future of decentralisation in this country may stand or fall. </PARA>
<PARA> My Government is committed to the concept of building new cities. In my policy speech last November, I announced that at first we would concentrate our initiatives and endeavours in the Albury-Wodonga area. In making this choice, we were conscious that as a national government our involvement would benefit two States, and ease the pressure on our two largest cities-Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, we regard this project as only the first of several new cities with the development of which we will be involved. We are determined, therefore, to use our full resources to ensure its success. We believe that the chances of success are high. Its location on the transport corridor between Melbourne and Sydney will be attractive to industry. It has an adequate supply of water. It is convenient to major recreational areas, and its natural environment provides a beautiful setting. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me outline briefly what the Commonwealth hopes to see happen at Albury- Wodonga. We look first of all, for a significant acceleration of population growth. Much of this increased population would, we hope, be made up of people who would otherwise have gone to Sydney or Melbourne. We want to see Albury- Wodonga achieve the status of a major city. We set no limit to its growth, but believe that if the new city is to achieve its major purpose it should have at least 300,000 people. And this growth will be planned to ensure a quality of life at the highest level. Pollution will be controlled: The environment protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic benefits of this development must pass to the people of Australia. Large sums of public money must be spent. We believe that this can give a good return but we must ensure that the return is to the community at large and is not tapped off to provide an unearned gain to land speculators. We want land to be cheap and its use to be controlled in such a way that the new city is both beautiful and efficient. We also want home ownership in the new city to be less of a burden to families than it has become in the major Australian cities. To this end the Commonwealth believes that the leasehold system must prevail. </PARA>
<PARA> From the beginning of this major project, we want local people to be involved in its planning and operation. We hope that the machinery which is devised to develop and operate this new city will, in at least some respects, become a model for future local and regional Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government has available-in the National Capital Development Commission and the National Urban and Regional Development authority-the fund of technical expertise which has conceived, planned and built in Canberra, the only substantial new Australian city of our time. For historical and constitutional reasons we have had a particular connection with the Murray River. The Commonwealth will be associated with supplying the quantity of water required by the new city through the Snowy Mountains Authority and the River Murray Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me outline now the steps my Government has already taken to ensure the success of this centre. </PARA>
<PARA> The Postmaster-General's Department has been instructed to prepare a report on the cost of recognising Albury-Wodonga as an extension of the Metropolitan area of both Sydney and Melbourne, for the purpose of keeping telephone and telex charges at a suitable level for industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Universities Commission and the Australian Council of Advanced Education have, as I have already indicated in my letters to Sir Robert Askin and Mr Hamer on the 15th of December, been instructed to confer and report on the provision of tertiary education facilities in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the recommendations of Sir Henry Bland on the Victorian Land Transport System, The Bureau of Transport Economics has been instructed to investigate the impact of inter-system rating practices on rail traffic from the Riverina. </PARA>
<PARA> All Departments in the Federal Government have been asked to investigate the possibility of locating divisions of the Public Service in Albury-Wodonga. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Department of Tourism and Recreation has been instructed to investigate tourist development in Albury-Wodonga and to recommend a program for increasing it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as you are aware, my Government is committed to amending the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act to give local authorities access to the Commission. We propose to encourage all relevant local authorities in the Albury -Wodonga area to consult and co-operate in preparing such a submission on a regional basis. The new Department of Urban Affairs and Regional Development will make its expert advisers available to any co-operative effort among the local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to anticipate the detailed decisions that will flow from this meeting, but I trust we will reach common agreement on our objectives, and set in motion a feasibility study of the project. I hope we will reach agreement upon the general structure and essential powers of the tripartite development authority, on the structure of consultation and supervision at Ministerial level , and the procedure for involvement of local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> I am grateful to the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria for their generous co-operation in this scheme and for the valuable work they have already done to ensure its success. Let us bend all our efforts to work in harmony together and achieve our aims. None of us here is indifferent to the present sprawling growth of our major cities, with all the waste, the pollution, the inefficiency they bring, and the baneful effect of their unchecked growth on the living standards of our people. Here is a chance, in the most literal sense, to build for tomorrow and improve the lives not only of the people of this region, but of other cities, today and in times to come.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE4">Mr UREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. I might say that on that day I learned a great deal because for the first time as a Minister I attended a conference at which State governments representatives, Federal government representatives and representatives of local government authorities met. I saw the tension that existed at that time. I was concerned that it might seem that we had come from a foreign land to take over and lay down demands. Certainly, I believed that the only real way that we would develop Commonwealth-State relations on that project was to do it in a gentle way. On that day maybe I realised the sensitivities that I still hold as a politician, even though I have been around for a long time. I felt that I did not want to try to force on to the States our new Commonwealth-State programs. I wanted to do it in a spirit of co-operation. Certainly, that was the way that Ministry functioned during those years when I was Minister. With great pride I must say that the bureaucrats who worked with me then were able to carry out my instructions. I told them things in nice quiet terms. Maybe it was in those male chauvinist days, but I said that I did not want to see any hairy chested Federal bureaucrats from my department going to the States laying down the law. I wanted to make sure that when they went there they discussed the arrangements with the States in a gentle, persuasive way. The only way we can solve the problems of decentralisation and the problems of the cities is with a spirit of co-operation between State, Federal and local governments together with the private sector. There has to be a spirit of co- operation. That is how we did it in the Department of Urban and Regional Development between 1972 and 1975. We will do it in the same way in the years from 1983 through to 1986. There is no doubt in the world that there will be a change of government in this country. We will be developing and carrying out our programs during those years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As part of the Albury-Wodonga proposal it was agreed that a study would be carried out in an area bounded by a circle with a 55-kilometre radius. This was measured from the centre of Union Bridge, a bridge linking Albury and Wodonga. It was determined that within this area a new complex would be developed and a study would be made. It was also an area to which land price stabilisation legislation would be applied in respect of the land acquired for the purposes of the growth complex. Subsequently, the area of land was reduced to that finally agreed to by the three governments. The matter was finalised by 30 June 1974. The land purchases were based on the land stabilisation prices of October 1972. The concept was to create a city where people can live in harmony with their surroundings, where dearly loved townscapes are preserved, where landscapes make full use of our natural trees and shrubs and where the planning process is flexible and spontaneous. </PARA>
<PARA> The Albury-Wodonga area was a very gentle area. It was cleared to the snow fields. It was a very pleasant place where people were able to bring up their families. We wanted to create a city with an environment which would allow people to acquire a block of land at a reasonable price. It was agreed by the three governments that when the outline of the development area was completed all the land that was not zoned non-urban would be publicly acquired by the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation. Residential land would be sold freehold but development rights would be retained by the Development Corporation. All other land-commercial, industrial and recreational-would be leasehold land. The principle behind that was that if enormous capital were put into the infrastructure for the development of that area the people themselves should benefit from the capital appreciation of the land as those improvements added to the wealth of the land. We drew on the Canberra experience and agreed that we would create Albury-Wodonga along similar lines.</PARA>
<PARA> Credit is not often given for one of the few things that Menzies did in his era , the development of the National Capital Development Commission from 1957 onwards. The great development of Canberra, as we see it today, really reflects the imprint of Menzies and the Commissioner appointed at that time. A planned city has been built here in Canberra. One can still buy land here at about one- third or one-fourth of the price payable in many cities of Australia, particularly Sydney. We wanted to create the same concept in Albury-Wodonga. In fact, if we did it in more places I am quite sure that young people would be able to purchase land at a much more reasonable price. The Albury-Wodonga development area was located in pleasant surroundings on the Murray River and we purchased land. It was on the main road and rail transport corridor between the major cities of Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> In the years between 1949 and 1972 Australia's population grew at an average rate of 1.9 per cent per year. In 1972 Australia had a population of 13 million. Most of the increase in the population from the end of the Second World War until 1972, through both natural growth and immigration, had settled in our capital cities. The overwhelming majority of people resided in Sydney and Melbourne. It was proposed that by the turn of the century both of those capital cities would have a population of five million. </PARA>
<PARA> In introducing the National Urban and Regional Development Authority Bill in October 1972 Sir William McMahon, the Prime Minister of the then conservative Government, argued that Australia would have a population of 23 million by the turn of the century. That would mean that from about 1972 through to the turn of the century there would be an increase of 10 million in the population through both natural growth and immigration. At that time, in debating that Bill in this House, I argued on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that such a population growth would be madness. Let me tell honourable members why I think it would be madness. Even if we could slow down the growth of our cities by locating one million people in selected growth centres, the remaining nine million people would be located in our capital cities. That would create chaos. Most of those people would move into Sydney or Melbourne. I argued that we must slow down our population growth, both natural and through immigration, to 1.1 per cent. That meant by the turn of the century the population would have been about 17.5 million, an increase of 4.5 million during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> If we slowed the growth in our capital cities by one million, which was equal to what was happening in the new town commissions in Britain-I might say that was done between 1945 and 1970 and that was the best record in decentralisation of any nation in the Western world-if we could still equal that by getting about one million people to go into our decentralised areas, we could then rationally accommodate the remaining 3.5 million in our capital cities and lift the standard of living of the people in those cities. That was the plan of the Labor Government from 1972 to 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> We planned for a population of some 300,000 for the growth centre of Albury- Wodonga by the turn of the century. Then Professor Borrie, in a report to the Parliament in 1974, estimated that Australia's projected population by the turn of the century would fall from the 23 million that Prime Minister McMahon predicted to 17.5 million because there had been a fall in natural births and the intake of migrants into this country. As I have said, Labor's program for Albury-Wodonga was based on a projected population of 17.5 million by the turn of the century. We are now confronted with the latest estimate by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) who, in his statement in 1981, projected that there would be a population of approximately 19.5 million by the year 2000. That projection is made because in the last few years, particularly the last four or five years, there has been an increase in the immigration intake and an upturn in the natural growth. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the situation. Our program for Albury-Wodonga was based on a projected population of 17.5 million. Now, with this projected population of 19.5 million, we ask: What are the prospects for the future? There seems to be no planning. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is a man of compassion. He has shown some thought and concern about planning. I must say that he is the only Minister who seems to give some thought to this matter. It is not much good just one person being involved; we have to start to look at the real policies that are involved. We have to look at what is happening in the western and south- western suburbs of Sydney. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) comes from an area which has the fastest rate of growth of population in the whole of metropolitan Sydney. We can look at the western and the south-western corridors of Sydney. We can look at some of the growth centres in New South Wales where there will be a growth in population, in areas such as Wallerawang and Lithgow, of something like 8,000 in the next few years because of an upturn of concern about the energy problem and, hence, the need for exports of coal. We can look at the Hunter Valley. We can look at the LaTrobe Valley. My colleague the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham), who will follow me in the debate , will speak of the problems that are occurring there. </PARA>
<PARA> We can look at the centres around the Brisbane area which have grown because of demographic changes. Within the next few years the real problems of housing and the pressures on housing in the Brisbane metropolitan area and in the south- eastern part of Queensland will be enormous. Yet nothing is done by this Government about planning. There has been no work in co-operation with the Government of Queensland and the councils in those areas. We can look at the situation still further north where we see the chaos and the growth in Gladstone and the awful lack of social and physical planning which has occurred. This is an utter disgrace to all governments. It is certainly a disgrace to the Australian Government and the Queensland Government. The burden has been thrown on to local government representatives, so much so that the people have revolted against any further growth in the area until the social infrastructure is improved by the governments. We must look at what has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine what the Federal Government has done. For the first time in Australia's history we have a Federal Government that has no regional development policies at all. Federal funds for urban and regional development programs have been cut by 90 per cent under this Government. A small allocation in the 1981-82 Budget was made for the winding up of former programs. The growth centre program is now defunct. In April 1981 the Federal Government terminated the decentralisation assistance program and abolished the Decentralisation Advisory Board. The Government has dismantled former regional development programs. It has pursued policies which have had a dislocating effect on the lives of many people and a disruptive effect on the viability of regional economies. This Government has failed to bring any co-ordination into the process of industrial restructuring that has been occurring over the past six years. When the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill 1973 was introduced it received the support of all colleagues in this Parliament. The leader of the then Opposition-which is now the Liberal-National Country Party Government-who is now Speaker of the House, Sir Billy Snedden, said when leading for the then Opposition that the Opposition supported the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill. He talked about the imbalance in the cities and the real problems in the growth of the cities. I quote from the Hansard record of the debate of 29 November 1973, page 4104, on the Albury-Wodonga Development Bill and associated measures. Speaking on the Bills the then Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA> They will be supported by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Consideration needs to be given to the circumference and also to developing regional development centres so that the pressures on the circumference or the inner city are relieved by the development of the regional development centres. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to support this scheme and to talk about the necessity for the development of such areas. But, somehow or other, they seem to be empty words. I could mention what was said by other members apart from the present Speaker. The present Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), who at the time was the spokesman for the National Country Party on these matters, greatly praised the Bill. But somehow or other when they came to government in 1976 there seemed to be very little support for the legislation. As I said, I could quote what was said by many other members, some of whom are now Ministers in the present Government. But they have since given this scheme little support. </PARA>
<PARA> The record of this Government in respect of decentralisation has been appalling . Its record since 1976 is even worse than the record between 1950 and 1972. It has been opposed to any real planning at all. There has been no real contribution to planning. The Government, of course, believes in market forces, or what it calls 'free market forces'. In other words, it believes in the law of the jungle, in the survival of the fittest. It is not much good the Government claiming anything because it does not really believe what it says. The Government really wiped all of Labor's long term programs. Labor provided the initial stimulus. We thought that we could build that stimulus in the early stages of the development of Albury-Wodonga by transferring Commonwealth public servants to that area. We thought that industrial development would occur in later stages of the development of this area. Although Commonwealth public servants were not transferred to the area, the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, to its great credit, was in fact able to attract industry which to a great extent has been extremely successful. To give the House some idea of the sincerity of the Labor Government in its proposal to transfer Commonwealth public servants to the area, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a Press statement I made on 22 October 1975 entitled 'More Public Servants for Albury/ Wodonga'. </PARA>

<PARA>MORE PUBLIC SERVANTS FOR ALBURY/WODONGA</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has decided to transfer more of its public servants to the Albury/Wodonga growth centre.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Urban and Regional Development, Tom Uren, said today that the Central Office of the Australian Housing Corporation with about 300 staff would be transferred from Canberra to Albury/Wodonga as soon as practicable.</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Government has also approved in principle the transfer of the Central Office of the Bureau of Meteorology from Melbourne to Albury/Wodonga', he said.</PARA>
<PARA> 'The timing of this transfer which will involve approximately 900 exployees is subject to further study.</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Australian Government has also initiated negotiations for the leasing of office space in Albury/Wodonga for a regional taxation office with about 90 staff.</PARA>
<PARA> 'This office will supply local services for the people of Albury/Wodonga and north-east Victoria. It will also administer the tax instalment scheme for Victorian country districts.</PARA>
<PARA> 'It is significant that a number of tax staff have already volunteered to transfer to Albury/Wodonga.</PARA>
<PARA> 'Transfer of each of these units will create employment opportunities for support staff in Albury/Wodonga.</PARA>
<PARA> 'Where possible, vacancies resulting from the decision of public servants to opt out of the transfer program will be filled by local recruitment'.</PARA>
<PARA> 'Detailed timing of the transfer will depend on further consultation with the units involved, with staff associations, and with the Albury/Wodonga Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> 'We would hope that those personnel seeking voluntary transfer will be moved to the growth centre as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Uren said that the Government had also decided to set up joint consultative machinery for the transfer of Australian Government employees to growth centres.</PARA>
<PARA> A Joint Consultative Committee would be set up with representation from the Public Service Board, the Councils of Australian Government employee Organisation, the Council of Professional Associations and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee would recommend general conditions of employment to apply to staff transferring to growth centres.</PARA>
<PARA> A re-location co-ordination committee would also be set up for the Albury/ Wodonga growth centre.</PARA>
<PARA> It would include representatives of the Public Service Board, staff groups, the units to be transferred and the Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Government is conscious of the human factors involved in re-locating its public servants to growth centres'. Mr Uren said.</PARA>
<PARA> 'We want any disruption to be kept to a minimum.</PARA>
<PARA> 'In particular, we want to ensure that those involved in transfers are given the maximum opportunity to take part in making decisions on the transfer program .</PARA>
<PARA> 'These two committees will provide a forum to consider how the transfers should be implemented, in particular the timing of specific transfers, the special facilities that might be required, and any special conditions to apply to staff transferred to Albury/Wodonga'.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Uren said that the latest transfer decisions demonstrated the strength of the Australian Government's commitment to Albury/Wodonga.</PARA>
<PARA> 'We are backing the growth centre with our money and with important units of our administration'. he said.</PARA>
<PARA> 'We believe that the association with State Government transfers, these moves will give a stimulus to the growth centre and encourage the private sector to switch staff and functions to Albury/Wodonga.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. As I said, we proposed to transfer Commonwealth public servants to give that area an early stimulus. But this Government did not want anything to do with planning when it came to office. Therefore this plan was scrapped. The Government dismantled the machinery that was set up at that time to encourage decentralisation. Although this Government had some decentralisation programs for a short while for the purpose of window dressing, these programs have been completely obliterated. For the first time in the history of this country, a national government has not committed itself in any way to any regional or decentralisation programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Despite the negative approach by the Government, the Albury-Wodonga project has been successful. I pay credit to the people who have worked so hard and so long under extremely difficult circumstances. On the one hand, Federal funds have been withdrawn from the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation-as I say, the Commonwealth has scrapped the program-and, on the other hand, the States have not been able to put money that they should have into Albury-Wodonga for the reason that they have been starved of funds. Unless the Federal Government gives the project moral support, I think Albury-Wodonga will go. I can give the House an example of what should be happening. As I pointed out earlier, Canberra until 1957 was never a goer. It was never a success. Nobody had any real faith in the future development of Canberra until Menzies made a decision in 1957. It is when a government makes that decision to develop a decentralisation program that decentralisation can take place.</PARA>
<PARA> As we need what we call balanced development in this country, it is surprising to me that we cannot get agreement on both sides of the House. I do not know why there are not more sane men, such as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, on the Government side. He is a fairly lonely petunia in an onion patch . I do not know why we cannot get agreement across the spectrum. When the original Bill was introduced in 1973 everybody applauded the program. We had been told what the growth of the cities would be. As I said earlier we planned on the basis of a population of 17.5 million people by the turn of the century. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs now projects that the population will be 19.5 million by that time and that that will throw an enormous burden on our major capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA> For the three years during which I was Minister for Urban and Regional Development I was responsible for the National Capital Development Commission. Canberra certainly went ahead during that period and some radical changes certainly took place. We upgraded the density of housing along the major transport corridors which is so necessary in this city. We need a better public transport system in this city. Many errors were made by the Menzies Government, but to its great credit it did something decent in Canberra. I am saying that what was done in Canberra could be done to make humane and beautiful cities in other parts of Australia if the Government had the will to do so. The Whitlam Labor Government of 1972 to 1975 had the will to do it.</PARA>
<PARA> We have come together to support and develop Canberra, and we should do the same in other parts of Australia. We should look at other regional areas. We should be working together to achieve a balanced development. We should stop the current over-centralisation because it is not in the people's best interests. We have to decentralise our population and decision making and give more power to the people. When we put faith in people and carry out some planning we can be successful in these regional areas. I suppose that it is with some joy that the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation does not have to carry this debt burden with it, but it is a great pity that we are not uniting to a greater extent to make decentralisation and regional planning so much more successful. I think if both sides of the House got together we could do so.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and in dealing with the Albury-Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill I wish to go over one or two things concerning Albury-Wodonga and its development under the program introduced by the honourable member for Reid in his former capacity as Minister for Urban and Regional Development. The concept that he talked about in the initial planning stages was accepted by the Liberal Party when in opposition. But, unfortunately, like most of the operations introduced by the Whitlam Government it went ahead in the usual spend -without-concern attitude. That may not have been-I would like to think that it was-the responsibility of the honourable member for Reid. As he said, the Whitlam Government moved parts of the Public Service to Albury-Wodonga and that was the green light to spend without responsibility. We saw the situation develop in which, as the honourable member for Reid would well be aware, farms in the area were bought willy nilly. He is walking out of the chamber because he knows that I am speaking the truth. The top price-in fact over the price-was paid for these farms in order to get them at any cost. Then we had the most ridiculous situation in which the farms were actually handed back to the former owners on the basis of a long term lease. That, of course, meant that they were instantly very rich people with the same properties to run, on exactly the same basis as previously with a very small outlay. That was not really to the benefit of Albury-Wodonga, because most of the land is still waiting to be developed. If the State Government concerned and the Federal Government carry out of the operation there to its fullest extent, they should have a good look at what can be done to return that land to the private sector, on a purchase basis, and recall some of that money. Perhaps it could be used in other areas for development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is nothing wrong with the concept of development. I well recall when I became a member in 1972, the honourable member for Reid was the Minister for Urban and Regional Development, that I asked him what was to happen about Bendigo. But of course, he politely told all of us in Bendigo that we were not in his considerations so we were not going to be considered for his development program. Bendigo was one of the leading provincial cities in the State of Victoria; but no, we were not considered at all, and the honourable member knows that. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the honourable member for Reid had a dream that he tried to achieve, albeit he thought that one could do it by spending money, which was typical of the Labor philosophy. I do not blame him for that, that was the way in which Labor thought. It forgot that one had to be accountable for money. But let us not get into that argument. I well remember the headlines one day, which created a little humour around the place, when the honourable member for Reid was Minister and he was in Melbourne. The people of Melbourne encouraged him to get carried away with his philosophy of development and returning over-pressed countryside to nature, and so on. Not worrying about areas such as Fitzroy and the overcrowded suburbs of Melbourne, he picked on the beautiful Dandenongs and suggested he would buy them all back and return them to the native bush. It was a magnificent dream. That was the philosophy going on. It was a total waste of money which could have been well used for the development of more country areas.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Reid restricts himself. He mentioned the area of Gladstone. Those of us who have been there will probably recall Gladstone-one could almost say, I suppose, with due respect, and certainly with no insult intended-as a nice, sleepy, coastal fishing village and a very nice natural port . But of course, it has gone ahead like wildfire and, as the honourable member for Reid has rightly said, it has been planned badly and all sorts of things are going wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to bring to the House another point of view, but before doing so, I return to another point made by the honourable member for Reid. He said that this Government has no philosophy for helping the country areas or areas outside the metropolitan areas. When we talk about the metropolitan areas, we are talking basically of only Melbourne and Sydney. When the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) plans immigration operations and where people coming into the country should go-it is beyond his control, and I think it would be accepted that it is beyond his control-those people generally centralise in Melbourne and Sydney. They do not know where else to go. They are not directed anywhere else or, if they are directed, it is not done very forcibly. The problem is not only that. The people of Australia in the country areas see the wealth and the lights of the metropolitan areas, and young people see the attraction of going there, albeit again because some have to go there from country areas to try to obtain work. That is an unfortunate circumstance, too. But whatever the circumstances, there is a magnet attracting them to those two cities, and we see the awful spread and conglomerations of buildings going up in those areas. There appears to be very little that we can do about it. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the point I was going to raise. The honourable member for Reid has left the chamber. He said that this Government has no policy or planning, or anything else. That is nonsense, because it was this Government that introduced the federalism policy which provides a lot more--</PARA>

<PARA> This side of the House believes that there should be development throughout Australia and that it must be balanced. Firstly, people cannot go into the areas that are so far undeveloped unless there is some attraction for them. We are trying to help development in the mineral resource areas. As those areas develop , they will give rise to the development of new towns, cities, industries and so on. We have to try to push that development further. More importantly, we have to make a very firm decision somewhere along the track to ensure that people who wish to immigrate to this country are given a challenge as was given to our forefathers, the pioneers who came to this country and who took it on themselves to go into the undeveloped areas and develop Australia. There are people in the world who would gladly come to this country, given the opportunity and whatever assistance is necessary to help them, to go into the areas which so far are not properly developed. There are many thousands of square miles of undeveloped land . We could see the development of towns and cities away from the sprawl of one or two cities in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the aim that honourable members on both sides of the House should have, as the honourable member for Reid said. It is something we should all be trying to achieve. We should not be trying to push development into one or two areas. I believe that Albury-Wodonga is a success to the extent that it has developed. It has developed very nicely. It has all the opportunities. Everything has been set up for it. There is no need for governments--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no argument about that. I said that right at the start. This Government accepted the planning. The philosophy was right but the application was terrible. If the philosophy had been applied in a proper managerial sense the Albury-Wodonga centre could have possibly developed even more. But it has developed well. There is no argument about that. That is due to the efforts of three governments-the two State governments concerned and the Federal Government. The development could continue in other areas but it must not be done by pushing public servants into an area to try to make it develop or by pouring millions of dollars into it, buying land and not using it. That is not development. The way to develop an area is to bring in industry by creating the opportunity for industry to want to go there. We should encourage people who want to come to this country. We should say: 'If you want to come to Australia we will give you the opportunity, but we want you to live somewhere outside Melbourne and Sydney'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, who is at the table, is nodding his head. I know he really believes that is a dream and a goal which we would all like to achieve, but it is not easy. Unfortunately, many of the people who come to Australia as immigrants have relatives or friends who are already established in those areas. It is a very difficult problem but it is a challenge to the Minister, the Government and the Parliament as a whole. We must try to develop Australia as a whole nation, not in isolated sections simply because they have magnets and all the attractions to draw people into those areas. Equally, we must try to encourage Australians all over Australia to take opportunities. I wonder why we do not offer the incentives we used to offer. I know it was brought about through the unfortunate circumstances of a war, but a program called the soldier settlers program allowed people to take, under very generous terms, the opportunity of developing undeveloped land. That was a challenge to them. One of my colleagues in this House ventured from New South Wales to Western Australia to take up that challenge and became a very successful farmer, and there are others. </PARA>

By all means let us look at a concerted effort from both sides in developing areas away from Melbourne and Sydney. We should make that our goal. That is what we are all about in trying to achieve a balanced development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not being overcritical of the honourable member for Reid. He started off with a dream of development that he wanted to achieve. I give him full marks for the initial planning of the Albury-Wodonga program, which was accepted by the then Opposition. In its initial phase the planning was good but, as I have said, the application of the planning and the manner in which the development was sought went bad because it was simply a case of spending money. I have been there and I have met the people who work there. The people who have worked in the development program have certainly put their hearts and souls into it. Strangely enough even when this Government properly pruned the overheads, staff, et cetera, the Authority still worked very effectively and in fact I think more efficiently as time went by. There is no doubt that governments collectively can achieve things but they cannot achieve them simply by spending money. Goals are achieved by determination and planning. The goal that we are after is to spread population throughout Australia instead of allowing development to take place in one or two spots. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In opening my remarks I want to make it clear that we of the Opposition support the Albury-Wodonga Development (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill. This Bill will relieve the debt on the Albury- Wodonga Development Corporation. As has been clearly espoused by two previous speakers, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier), this has been a successful enterprise. The Albury- Wodonga Development Act was proclaimed on 21 December 1973. In accordance with the agreement between the Australian Government and the State governments of New South Wales and Victoria the Corporation was established as an Australian Government statutory authority charged with planning and developing a regional area of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth looking at the first report of the Corporation, which was handed down on 30 June 1974, and reading to the Parliament and to the public what the Corporation sought to do. The report states that the Corporation sought to build a new and vigorous city in which there would be a high level of physical and social planning; that social planning would be tailored to meet the particular needs of different social categories, by age, income and lifestyle; that where possible the lifestyles of the existing population would be capable of continuing with minimal intrusion; that planning would proceed from a full understanding of the historical, social, ecological and geographical uniqueness of the development region; that all citizens would have the opportunity to be informed about and share in the shaping and planning of the new community; that planning would avoid excessive strain on existing resources and facilities as the population grew; that planning would ensure that the advantages of the growth were shared by existing residents and newcomers; that there would be adequate compensation for land acquired for development by the Corporation; that every possible care would be taken to protect the local ecology; that places of historical interest and importance would be preserved; that planning would ensure that future trends and possibilities were adequately prepared for; that planning would allow for maximum flexibility, both physical and social, to adjust easily to changes of need and desire; and that planning would respond to all these requirements with as new and as fresh an approach as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The report went on to state that the Corporation recognised that the achievement of dynamic growth would depend upon the provision of incentives to existing and potential residents. It stated that these incentives would include real opportunities in housing, employment, education, health and recreation and should extend as far as possible to the total quality of life within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that is a goal well worth achieving. The previous speaker from the Government side, the honourable member for Bendigo, criticised the running of the program to develop Albury-Wodonga because the Labor Government supposedly spent a lot of money. It amazes me that Government members, who espouse a free enterprise philosophy, appear to lack the expertise necessary in government to carry out that philosophy. In the last 10 years I have not met anybody who has regretted investing money in land. Yet we hear Government speakers saying that a Labor government wasted money by investing in land around Albury-Wodonga. Any money invested in land in the last 10 years has not been wasted. It is capable of being recovered and can be used again. Investment in land is a normal process of good business management, but the Liberal Government lacks the expertise of good management. There is nothing wrong with the approach ; it is the management by the Government that seems to be at fault. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time in Australia, with the exception of Canberra, a new city was planned in conjunction with the settlement of its people. Even given the Fraser Government's cut-off in resources and its failure to decentralise Government employment to Albury-Wodonga, it has been a successful project. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives set by the Ministerial Council on the Development of Albury- Wodonga in 1974 and revised by it in 1977 has meant that the growth centre project has progressed in a most satisfactory manner. The generation of employment, particularly in the private sector, has been the key to the success of the project. The Federal Fraser Government, by cutting off resources and failing to decentralise government employment, has limited growth considerably. However, the private sector development has guaranteed stability and a sound base for growth in all sectors of the economy of the area. The Corporation has devoted a major part of its resources and efforts to the encouragement and expansion of already established industry as well as to the attraction of new industry. Its aim has been to build on employment through the growth of basic industries-those industries which market their goods and services outside the Albury-Wodonga area. Basic industrial growth is essential to the economic development of the area. This has been followed by real development of the service sector. This, in turn, has strengthened the ability to promote the area still further. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the planning of the area. Short-medium term plans to fit in with the principles of urban design and development established for the growth centre continue to be revised. These five to 10-year plans are developed to provide a clear idea of phasing to both the private and public sector. During 1980-81 a significant study of the needs and priorities of the community for the provision of social services was carried out. This indicated major concerns with youth, particularly youth unemployment, housing, public transport and isolation in new areas. Appropriate programs are now being developed in association with the local and State agencies responsible for these services. Further work is being carried out on examining and seeking ways to ameliorate the effects of border anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that between 30 and 50 per cent of newcomers arriving in the growth centre are welcomed through the Development Corporation's arrivals program. People receive information and advice on settling into the area and are introduced to existing residents who could help or who have similar interests. The program is gradually being extended, with the use of volunteers, to welcoming newcomers. A children's services program aims to increase understanding of existing family support services in the Albury-Wodonga area and to make people more aware of them so that people who need them make better use of them. Groups and services approached as part of the program include play groups, school support groups, pre-schools, church groups and single parent groups. The principal aim is to encourage development of community-based services in areas of high need. </PARA>
<PARA> On economic planning, the financial implications of the longer term development continue to be monitored, with particular attention being given to the implications of the State and Federal governments in respect of land costs and returns. Further investigations and discussions on rates and charges for municipal head works have taken place. The location computer model has been used to assist companies and firms assessing the financial implications of relocating part or all of their operations in Albury-Wodonga. Some adjustments have been made to the model to improve its overall suitability. </PARA>
<PARA> On structuring planning, the new structural local and environmental plan for the New South Wales section of the growth centre has been gazetted and is now in operation. A number of local development plans have been prepared for those areas that remain in private ownership but are obviously located where development no longer could take place. Discussions continue with Albury City Council and Hume Shire Council to ensure that as far as possible procedures and zones are compatible. Two new interim development orders have been introduced in Victoria and each covers the Baranduda township and the West Wodonga areas. The remaining rural areas within Wodonga have now been incorporated as the rural cities interim development order. The rural areas in the Yackandandah and Tallangatta shires will likewise be transferred once the shires in question have new orders. Let me now turn to the area which I represent and also the area the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) represents. This is the Central Gippsland region of Victoria. This region includes the resource rich Latrobe Valley. I would like to compare the totally different approach that a Liberal Government has taken in Victoria to planning as against the Federal Labor Government's approach to Albury-Wodonga. In 1973-74 a statistical district was established by the Australian Bureau of Statistics around Albury-Wodonga in order to more correctly identify the growth rate. These figures show the Albury- Wodonga district as having a population of approximately 78,000 persons. The Central Gippsland area has recorded a population in the vicinity of 130,000 persons. During the last five years the population has increased by over 10 per cent. These figures are now available from the 1981 census and can be obtained from the Gippsland Region Information Unit, which is located at the Gippsland Institute at Churchill. The main increase in this population growth has occurred in areas most affected by energy developments. What initiatives of a similar nature to the Labor Party's approach to Albury-Wodonga were taken by the Liberal Government which was in government in Victoria? Further, is there a need to take a planning approach to the area?</PARA>
<PARA> The major source of change in the Latrobe Valley has been the development of the area's brown coal resources, first for the traditional purpose of electricity generation, and secondly for possible conversion to other energy forms. The potential scale and character of future use of coal for electricity generation has been illustrated by the discussion paper on future power station siting, released by the State Electricity Commission in May 1980, which indicated the possible need to build a number of new power stations at least equivalent in size to the current Loy Yang project. A further major impact could result from programs to use brown coal resources to supply alternatives to petroleum based products or to provide a substitute for natural gas. Plans are already well advanced for the establishment of pilot plants to convert brown coal to oil. </PARA>
<PARA> Closely related to the question of protection and development of the brown coal areas is the issue of providing for futher urban growth in the area. This is where planning comes in. Development of the brown coal resources has been the principal factor leading to urban expansion in the region. On the other hand, the large areas of land needed for brown coal extraction, electricity generation and other uses, together with factors such as transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines and transport corridors, will impose significant constraints on the possible scale and or location of urban development. It may even prove necessary to consider moving all or part of some existing urban areas to make way for coal -winning operations. Because these constraints will not apply uniformly throughout the region, there have been significant conflicts over the most appropriate land use policies for specific locations. Urban development policy in the region needs to consider both the possible overall scale of development- which will be determined mainly by future population growth-and the closely related issue of the distribution of urban growth, including rural residential development. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing development in the Valley needs to be directed towards both overcoming current unsatisfied housing needs and providing for the people coming to live and work in the region. A housing policy for the region should be concerned with those four main issues: The number of houses to be built, including those required to overcome the current backlog; the type of housing needed to meet the needs of preferences of residents; techniques for providing and financing an increased supply of housing; and locating housing within reasonable access of jobs and community facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> New power generation projects have increased direct employment in electricity production and related operations by more than 1,000 jobs over current levels of about 8,000. Important changes in the distribution of work places will also occur, as old power stations are phased out. Similarly Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd expansion of its Maryvale Mill has increased direct employment in paper and pulp production from 1,100 jobs to around 1,400. The building of new power stations, the APM extension and coal conversion projects will involve quite dramatic increases in construction employment, which currently exceeds 3, 000 persons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To this we must add the service industries. A most important requirement is the need for a strategic plan to ensure that whatever scale of development takes place maximum opportunity is provided for individuals and groups to achieve fulfilment and to live in harmony with their fellow citizens. Achieving this objective will require consideration of many social factors. For example, rapid population growth in the Valley has necessitated the extension and/or upgrading of many social facilities in the area. Secondly, in making decisions about, for example, the location of urban development of power stations, the attitudes of the local community and the possible capacity of the different settlements to accommodate rapid change should have been taken into account. Thirdly, a range of programs is needed to assist the integration of newcomers to the Valley into the existing community. These are all factors which are already present in the Albury-Wodonga area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It will be necessary to implement programs to maintain and improve the quality of the area's physical environment. Policies are required which balance demands for improving environmental quality against the cost of attainment and which recognise that the effects and the cost of many environmental changes and protection measures will not be felt only within the region. Developments in the Latrobe Valley have clearly required considerable additional public expenditure. Quite complex questions relating to the financing of those expenditures need to be addressed, including both the ability of the governments at the Commonwealth, State and local levels to raise the necessary funds and the appropriate assignment of responsibilities for the expenditures among the different arms levels of government and the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> We now need to have a direct look at what has been done in that area in comparison with the approaches of the Labor Party in Albury-Wodonga some seven or eight years ago. In October 1980 a discussion paper was put out by the then Victorian Government. The paper was headed 'Latrobe Valley Strategy Plan' and it was based on a concept similar to that for Albury-Wodonga, including a ministerial council. The forward of the paper states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Ministerial Council, through its Strategic Planning Advisory Group, is establishing a Task Force to produce an initial co-ordinated plan of development by June 1981.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember that this paper was produced in October 1980. It took Liberal governments in Victoria a long time to learn from the planning lessons that the Labor Government initiated in Albury-Wodonga in 1974, but even at this stage the Government put out propaganda stating that an initial co-ordinated plan of development would be available by June 1981. Let us see what happened in that regard. I have another document here which is quite well presented. It is entitled 'Towards a Strategic Development Plan for the Gippsland Energy Resource Area: Progress Report No. 2' and it is dated December 1981. There was no such thing as a plan by June 1981. This paper is just another strategic development plan. We need to look at the foword of it to see how much planning had been done under a Liberal government in Victoria. The forward states:</PARA>
<PARA> This report presents further progress by the Task Force towards a strategic development plan for the next 20 years; sets out some options and suggests, for the scenarios considered, appropriate courses of action and policies which could assist strategic planning in the area.</PARA>
<PARA>Next comes the crunch line.</PARA>
<PARA> Readers of this report are reminded that the figures on employment, population, housing, industrial development, water use, etc., are hypothetical and are not presented as predictions of anticipated future activity. The future level of development in the area is currently uncertain and to provide some basic information to assist work on the strategy plan, development scenarios have been prepared from which these hypothetical figures are derived.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it any wonder that the Victorian State Government was turfed out when this is all that it could produce eight years after the Albury-Wodonga experience? It definitely has been conceded at times that Albury-Wodonga was part of a learning process, a new process, and that some mistakes were made. But there is no doubt that the concept initiated by the Federal Labor Government at that time was correct. It was endorsed as correct by the two State conservative governments at the time but it still has taken an enormous amount of time for even the slightest move by the Liberals in Victoria to come up with anything like a plan for the Latrobe Valley area, an area which has 130,000 people as against about 80,000 people in the Albury-Wodonga area. So there is every reason for Victorians, particularly the people in the area that I represent, to be now looking to the Labor Government to develop some of these policies, and develop them to suit people within the area rather than the vested interests who work on the free enterprise principle and the user pays concept.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to what the honourable member for Bendigo said. He conceded that Albury-Wodonga has been successful, but ridiculed the Australian Labor Party for the amount of money it spent in Albury-Wodonga in 1973-74. I put it to him that there is such a thing in government as government investment. Investment should not always be left to private enterprise; there is a need for government to take the initiative at times and to make investments on behalf of the public sector. That has been done in Albury-Wodonga and I would defy anybody to say that investment in land anywhere around that area will in the long term result in a loss to any government. Any such investment in land must be an asset. We must control the price of land if we are to keep inflation under control.</PARA>
<PARA> I am very happy to support the concepts put forward by the honourable member for Reid. We do not oppose this Bill. We support the Bill and look forward to the day when members of the Liberal Party and Liberal governments realise that in today's society we have to plan to get anywhere. Perhaps one day they will learn the lesson.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Customs Tariff (Anti- Dumping) Amendment (Countervailing Duties) Bill is to amend the Customs Tariff ( Anti-Dumping) Act by introducing to its subsidies and countervailing measures provisions the concept of reciprocity. Before examining the provisions of the Bill it is appropriate to provide some background to it. The anti-dumping law in Australia embraces two of the codes of conduct which were negotiated in the 1970s under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. These codes are the Anti-Dumping Code and the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code. The underlying rationale and purpose of these codes is to ensure that international trade occurs on a fair basis, and in particular countries do not use their powers over trade either to subsidise exports or to provide back door methods of restricting imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is universally accepted that where imports of goods at dumped subsidised prices cause injury to home industries they are undesirable and should be prevented by countervailing action by home governments. However, it is also vitally important that such interventions by home governments should not go beyond the strict meaning of the anti-dumping and subsidies codes. To do so is likely to lead to mutually defeating retaliations, the obstruction of trade and the resurgence of protectionism. It is also likely to lead to inconsistent industrial policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia acceded to the Anti-Dumping Code in 1980 and the anti-dumping law was amended accordingly in 1981. The amendments also provided in effect for the application of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code even though Australia had not at the time become a signatory to that code. The Government's hesitation in signing the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code was caused largely by the problem of the Export Expansion Grants Scheme. This scheme, whereby increases in the value of Australian exports are rewarded by grants by the Government, would appear to be in direct breach of the GATT code. Clearly, signing the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code would put this scheme at risk. However, as it turned out the Government decided to accede to the code, apparently in order to prevent the United States from imposing a duty on lamb imports from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On 23 July 1981 the United States Department of Commerce made a preliminary determination that Australia was subsidising its lamb exports to America. The Americans proposed to impose a countervailing duty of 6.81 per cent on those exports. The American action was almost inexplicable, because Australia's lamb exports were valued at less than $6m a year. They would hardly have been noticed on the American market, and certainly could not have caused any injury to American lamb products. However, following complaints and submissions from Australia, the American lobby groups which had sought the action withdrew their allegations. Accordingly, the case was dropped. Frankly, I believe that this demonstrates just how flimsy were the allegations in the first place. The remarkable thing is that, having won the battle, the Government then agreed to become a party to the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code. In effect , the Government had been intimidated by a flimsy threat to impose duty on a minuscule export trade. The threat failed to stand up to examination and was withdrawn, yet Australia signed the code. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the merits or otherwise of the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code, this episode is a clear example of the bias and incompetence of this Government. Its policies are conducted on an entirely ad hoc basis. In April the Government announced the extension of the Export Expansion Grants Scheme for another year. Then, in September, the Government became a party to a GATT code which prohibits such a scheme. Of course, the explanation for this obscure behaviour is the fact that Cabinet is run by its National Country Party members and its country-based Liberals. How could our trading relations be anything but dictated by country interests when the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Anthony), the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street), all of whom form the core of our foreign and trade relations, are also the rural confederacy which dominates Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be fair to say that Australia is run by a coterie of agrarian bolsheviks. They are not even accountable to the Parliament. I might instance the behaviour of Ministers and former Ministers, members of the National Country Party, who saw fit not even to explain to the Parliament their mismanagement of departments when Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd and the ruination of the meat export industry were discussed in the Parliament. That demonstrates the point I have made, that Australia is run by a coterie of agrarian bolsheviks- arrogant enough not even to explain their actions to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the main thrust of the Bill, I say that the Government, having obtained satisfactory arrangements for the continued export of primary products to America, and in the process creating great uncertainty in other sectors of industry, has now determined that it still has not made life totally secure for our exporters. The Government, having signed the GATT code in order to avoid unfair and unwarranted American actions, announced on 18 November 1981 that the United States itself was not following the code. Apparently the United States often failed to apply the injury test at all. Also, it used a broad definition of export subsidy in determining the amount of countervailing duty. Therefore, the Australian Government announced that it would breach the GATT code if Australian exports were dealt with by foreign countries in a way which breached that code. Surprisingly, this approach was taken just seven weeks after Australia signed the code. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings us to the Bill that we are debating, whose purpose is to introduce this principle of reciprocity into our anti-dumping and countervailing measures law. Reciprocity means, essentially, that we treat other countries in the way in which they treat us. The concept is currently a subject of heated debate in the United States. As many as half a dozen Bills providing for various versions of reciprocity have been introduced in the United States Congress. One of these Bills, for example-it is sponsored by John Dingell of Michigan-requires the President to retaliate against any country which fails to give United States businesses substantially equivalent opportunities to those offered to that country by the United States. The American arguments are based upon their perception that they pursue free trade, whereas other countries do not. This is thought to discriminate against the United States. It is thus argued that reciprocity practised by America will force or encourage a freer trade attitude among other countries. In America, there is doubt among economists and trade negotiators whether reciprocity is likely to cause a positive, free trade response or a negative, retaliatory and protectionist response. It is the latter problem, of course, which led to the development of the GATT codes in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> From Australia's point of view, the problem is compounded. First of all, there is little doubt that the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code is stacked in favour of the industrialised countries. The code operates to make it very difficult for small or less developed countries to encourage exports of manufactured goods. More importantly, certain primary products are exempt for the normal injury and subsidies provisions of the code. This enables the heavily subsidised agricultural producers of the United States, Japan and Europe, particularly the European Economic Community, to cause unfair competition against more efficient primary producing countries. On the other hand, it is very much in Australia's interests to encourage expanding world trade, as our own prosperity is very dependent, due to our small size, on a large and growing traded goods sector. For this reason there may be net benefits in our supporting a code which is not entirely to our liking. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also acknowledge that ours is not a perfect record when it comes to free trade. Motor vehicle and clothing imports to Australia are strictly controlled by volume quotas. If the principle of reciprocity were to be extended indefinitely our position could be extremely weak. Already we are seeing difficulties in the United Kingdom where it appears that objection will be taken by the British to the export of Japanese designed, Australian built cars. Where do we stand, given the restrictions we impose on British vehicle exports to Australia?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If they listened they might learn something about their failings- particularly the free traders. All of these considerations point to the need for a very clear and well thought out trading policy for Australia. Clearly the National Country Party, which runs this part of our national economic policies, has not been able to devise a rational trading policy. I was interested when I picked up the Sydney Morning Herald this morning to see an article by John Short entitled: 'Grass roots attack on Anthony'. Even the National Farmers Federation, which I would have thought would have been happy with the present Minister for Trade and Resources, finds his lack of policies almost unacceptable. The simple fact is that we have signed codes that we do not support. We are now introducing amendments which effectively allow us to breach the code in question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have complete uncertainty regarding the future of export incentive programs, which in any case have been arbitrarily halved without any assessment of the economic effects of such action. We have tied at least one of our industries-the motor vehicle industry-into an export facilitation scheme which is inevitably subject to severe pressures due to our own heavy restrictions. The trade policies of the present Government are in an absolute shambles. The administration of trade by the Minister adds to the list of disastrous and incompetent performances by National Country Party leaders in this Government. I note that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), who is one of the National Country Party Ministers, is sitting at the table. He is not to be excused from the same accusation. It is no wonder that confidence in this Government of business, and increasingly of the rural community, is sharply declining. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in this context that the Opposition believes that the legislation now before us is inadequate. We support the Bill itself because, in the narrow confines of the particular code of trading conduct to which it relates, it deals in an appropriate way with the unreasonable attitude which certain countries have occasionally adopted. In particular, it appears to us to be less severe a form of reciprocity than that being advocated by many United States congressmen. The reciprocation we are advocating is confined to the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code. It does not do any more than provide for common trading rules between Australia and any other nation in this narrow field. In contrast, some proposed American laws would involve reciprocity which goes beyond the area of immediate complaint. For example, the Bill proposed by Missouri Senator John Danforth would authorise trade retaliation by the President in any area he might choose. A breach of the Subsidies Code by one country, for example, may lead to retaliatory United States breaches of the Dumping Code, import licensing or any other area. </PARA>
<PARA> If the United States ever adopts such extreme measures the Bill we are now debating will be virtually useless and it should be seen in that light. Accordingly, it is essential that while we safeguard our basic rights through legislation of this kind we must continue to support as far as possible the principles of multilateral trade negotiation, and the ideals of the Kennedy and Tokyo rounds of the GATT. In order to effectively do this, the Australian Government must devise a coherent and responsible trade policy. It must stop the deceitful double talk which has characterised its pronouncements on trading issues. The Prime Minister for one must stop this regular practice of talking free trade in international forums and unbridled protectionism to local industry audiences. Our international credibility and hence effectiveness in pursuing and promoting more open and mutually beneficial trading relationships depends on a significantly more consistent approach to trade by this Government. With this vital qualification, I wish this Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that the Crimes Amendment Bill 1981 was before the Senate in October last year and my colleague Senator Evans on that occasion moved amendments which the Government accepted. Of course they are now in the Bill which we have before the House. I also notice that the Government appears to have changed its mind, and now says that amendments will be moved in this House which will remove the amendments which were inserted in the Senate. We cannot see the logic of that position; we wait to hear the Government's explanation. I quickly remind the House of what was said in the Senate when the matter was debated there. The point that was emphasised-we all applaud it-is that the Bill is important because it brings about innovative changes to the law governing the sentencing of Commonwealth offenders. The Bill must be seen in the context that it flows from a report of the Australian Law Reform Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) indicated, apparently in his second reading speech, the question of sentencing Federal offenders was a subject of a reference to that Commission in August 1978. Mr Justice Kirby was assisted by Professor Duncan Chappell, an internationally known criminologist. They completed a rather large report. It was called an interim report although I notice it contained 636 pages. It was available in January 1980. The report was tabled in the Parliament. It contained two draft Bills as well as 129 specific recommendations. Let me deal with the proposals which were deemed to be urgent. There was the question of the establishment of an adequate Commonwealth victims' compensation scheme, which I understand is still not before us, provisions to give guidance to the use of imprisonment in the case of convicted Federal offenders and also the facilitation of the use of non-custodial sentencing options where appropriate. It is that latter part that we now have before us. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who have been involved in the legal profession know full well the problems in society that are brought about by people who break the law. It is clear that courts, when sentencing, are really trying to give some justice to the community for wrong-doings that might have been perpetrated upon it and are also anxious that there should be some deterrent to guarantee that the offender is not likely to commit further offences. The point made by Senator Evans is that it is very important to see some uniformity in sentencing, because it does not always happen. If we leave what is called a wide discretion in an area of reform we will get a multiplicity of results, and the community itself will be none the better for that. Senator Evans, in his speech in the Senate, said about this Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> The most important thrust of it is in the direction of alternatives to imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA>The largest prison in Australia is in my electorate, and I am well aware of the problems associated with crime and of the problems that are not satisfied by imprisonment. Society always assumes that a person who is committed to prison will come out of prison a much better person. Prisons basically were a creation of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and many of those built in the nineteenth century are still in the same condition. We can imagine that if we treat people like animals in a zoo we will get the results of that sort of treatment. The point is that most people who are sent to prison are not rehabilitated; in fact they deteriorate. That fact ought to be clearly mentioned when we are talking about reform. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, in fact it is intelligent, in future to look at the ages of offenders before the courts. We would notice that many first come to the notice of courts under the age of 14 years. That is the time for society to look quickly at the obvious crime potential in a person before the courts. If we look at an analysis of the problems of people who are in prison we find that they are there because of a broken home life-no mother or father, or because of an alcohol problem or a violence problem in the home-and that certainly they have had no love and affection and no education. That does not cover the whole spectrum, but it covers 99 per cent of the people who come to the notice of courts at an early age. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from learned law reform commissions such as this which point out the difficulties of imprisonment and the alternatives to it, some of which are suggested in this Bill, I would like to add that it is about time society recognised that when a young person comes to the notice of the courts the mere placing of that person in an institution results in a failure to remedy the defects in that person's life of a lack of affection, care, concern and education. Surely those defects must be remedied by society immediately. In other words, it might be more appropriate to start by giving some financial contribution to a person who might be able to care for that child to guarantee that the child gets all the care it needs and gets as good an education as other children would get. If we did that, in my view, we would cut the crime rate by a massive amount. </PARA>
<PARA> At present it must be costing at least $400 or $500 a week to keep a person in gaol. We can see how counter productive that is. Everything that happens prior to that-police officers trying to find out who the offenders are, the processes of the courts, the cost of paying judges and magistrates and such things-can lead to an enormous expense on the community. Then we get the dreadful problem, which all of us who have been through prisons know about, that prisoners are deemed by themselves and by society to have reached the bottom of the barrel. Very few people want to employ a person who has been in prison. There is some worry about their honesty or integrity of such a person. Again, a person who has been in prison recognises that society has now reduced him or her to the lowest rung of the social ladder. So what more has such a person to fear? Such people are no longer worried about shame. They have been shamed to the utmost of degradation. Therefore, they readily lapse into committing further crime on release from prison. Honourable members should bear in mind that society always knows that the person sentenced to prison will return to it within a period. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, it must interest you to find that most sentences are less than six months in duration. So these people come back into society within a very short time. Analyses show that they come back to society in a much more anti-society frame of mind than when they went into prison, much more prone to commit further crime than when they were first committed to a penitentiary. They learn more about crime in penitentiaries than when they are outside in society. They meet people in penitentiaries who are prepared to assist them in further crime because that seems to be the only hope that they have of obtaining a living if society treats them in that way. I know, by the process of age, that if one lives long enough one might reform from being a hardened criminal to one who takes the straight and narrow. But that is not likely. We find that most people in prison are under the age of 25 years. We exempt from that the people who are guilty of the offence of murder which certainly is a different offence and, in most cases, basically a crime of passion. All of these things would form the thrust of what has been said by the Law Reform Commission. It said that we should try to find a more intelligent way to deal with offenders. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Evans moved a number of amendments in the other place. In particular, he moved an amendment to proposed new section 18B to make provision for an application by an offender for further time to pay. Let us look at a person who has been sentenced and see whether we cannot get some justice as to whether he or she should be given further time to pay. I note that that amendment is about to be removed from the Bill by the Government. I do not see what advantage that will achieve. Apparently it might have caused inconvenience in State courts on the basis that there was to be a plurality of applications for continual time to pay. But if the alternative was to send a person to gaol one would probably find that the Commonwealth and the State would then have to dig into their pockets to look after the wife and children of the person in gaol . It causes society no end of trouble. Surely this could be looked at, certainly from the point of view of seeing whether the person has any assets that could be acquired rather than saying: 'I have given you time. You have not complied with the time; so off you go to the penitentiary'. The Opposition-I think the Government also obviously accepted this-thought that that was a rational proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not delay the House for too long. This is a matter of what could be called definite debate. However, Senator Evans moved a further amendment to insert a new section 18C. To use my colleague's words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a new section . . . to provide that where there is a default in payment of a fine, the court is enabled to impose, even at that late stage, a non-custodial penalty, as well as further time to pay or as well as a custodial penalty in respect of that default, and, more importantly, proposed new section 18C imposes an obligation upon the court not to allow the imposition of a custodial sentence for default in payment of a fine except where there is wilful and unreasonable default on the part of the offender. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly if a person is not going to make any effort at all the court has no alternative but to impose a custodial sentence. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is important that we, in our society, particularly at a national level, set a few examples. In my view, one of the things that we want to see is a report giving the reasons why so many people are committed to prison, and stating whether there is any alternative. I am anxious to emphasise, as one who has taken an interest in this matter for a number of years, that the most important thing is to keep people out of incarceration. We should certainly penalise them, but get them back to their place of employment as quickly as possible and perhaps direct them to make weekly payments of compensation to their victims out of their earnings, thereby clearly indicating to them that they have an obligation to society. To commit them to a penitentiary with hardened people, many of whom have no interest in reform, is an animal-like behaviour. Many young people, particularly at the age of 18 or 19 years, are destroyed if incarcerated in a cell with two or three others. The behaviour is beyond belief; more crime and more sexual assaults are perpetrated. There were no reasonable amenities in the penitentiary I mentioned. I hope it has improved now. It catered for 1,500 to 1,600 people and there was, I think, one education officer. This is the sort of problem we face. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who have the responsibility of caring for the inmates will quickly tell us that there is continual violence in the close confinement of a large mass of people who feel that society has offered them nothing except incarceration and who are prepared to take it out in any violent act towards anyone who has the difficult task of trying to care for them. The continual assaults and further crime inside the penitentiary make a laughing stock of the suggestion that society will be better off by the incarceration of these people. Certainly, we have to protect society from those convicted of murder-violent people who are against society to the extent that they will take violent action against others. </PARA>
<PARA> But we have to look closely at where the problem first arose. In most cases it arose under the age of 14 years. Certainly, teachers at school would quickly know whether a child was neglected or unable to get care and attention. Teachers should be able to alert the responsible authorities, both State and Federal, as to whether that child should be getting some immediate attention. If the parents are delinquent the odds are that the children will be too. But we should not accept that because the parents are delinquent the child has to bear the burden and society cannot do anything about it. I hope that when people talk about law reform they clearly understand the position that has developed in society and realise the failure of gaols-I know they have to be there-in the sense of reforming people or returning a better person to society. That failure is obvious now. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to keep people in their right environment. If they have a job, leave them in the job unless there is some real reason why they should be incarcerated. If they owe money to society, guarantee its payment. If there is a victim of a crime, guarantee complete compensation to him. That was certainly attempted by those in the Senate who moved amendments which relate to the application for time or further time to pay and the enforcement of orders for imprisonment covered by section 18C of the legislation. There should be some opportunity to consider an alternative to a custodial sentence.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope the Government will not press its proposed amendments to remove clauses from the Bill. It is about time we had a twentieth century approach to this problem. I know it is not an easy one to solve. If we accept these institutions, as the States seem obliged to-there is great media interest in people being punished-that is fine, but let us have a look at the results and the follow-up. There is plenty of evidence to show that there should be alternatives to imprisonment. I hope the Government will not press the amendments it proposes to move. </PARA>

<PARA>The remarks that I am about to make apply also to clause 7 of the Crimes Amendment Bill, which the Government will seek the approval of the House to omit from the Bill. Acceptance of the amendment and the omission of clause 7 will give effect to the matters to which I now refer. By amendments made to this Bill in the other chamber last year, the provisions dealing with the enforcement of fines contained in the original Bill were significantly altered. There is a question as to whether the new provisions are workable. Apart from this, strong complaints have been received by the Government from a number of State Attorneys -General as to the additional work that would be created for State officers involved in the enforcement of fines for Commonwealth offences and as to possible confusion and inefficiency due to different procedures applying in Commonwealth and State matters. Suggestions have been made that the matter should be considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Having regard to the matters raised by State Attorneys-General, the Government accepts that it would be desirable for the Standing Committee to examine the need for changes in procedures for the enforcement of fines, both Commonwealth and State, and the form that the new procedures should take. Therefore, the Attorney- General (Senator Durack) will ask the Standing Committee to examine this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Bill provides for a number of very valuable reforms, apart from those relating to enforcement of fines. The Government believes that there should be no further delay in giving effect to these reforms. To this end the Government proposes to amend the Bill by deleting the provisions dealing with enforcement of fines, which were amended in the other chamber, but otherwise to proceed with the Bill. The Government accepts that present procedures for enforcement of fines require review to ensure that they are fair and reasonable for those affected. When the Standing Committee has completed its examination of the matter, the Government will introduce any legislation required to give effect to the Standing Committee's conclusions. </PARA>

<PARA> I note that proposed new section 18B seeks to make provision for an application for time to pay, or further time to pay. My colleague Senator Evans told me that this proposed new section was to be dropped without warning. He said that that decision must have followed negotiations with the States. He was disappointed that the Attorney-General did not see fit to discuss the matter with him. However, he makes the point that he hopes the reform will come back in very soon because we are not confident of winning the division that will follow. The Law Reform Commission noted that where there is default in the payment of a fine the Commission regarded it as important that an application of a non-custodial sentence could be made in that situation. So that basically was the thrust of proposed new sections 18B and 18C. I will not go over that again. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the alternative, unless we can seriously look at the problems of the people? If we do not give them a chance to make a further application, by removing the particular clauses we will deny them their rights. We are only looking at the person going to gaol. That is a very retrogressive step and one that even the senators obviously thought had merit. This is now being delayed because the States are objecting or the Attorneys in the States feel that way. I do not think that is the way to go. We ought to be helping the States, giving grants to the States and talking about alternatives to prison. We should be doing more about it. The Opposition is disappointed to think that the Government has now been put in this situation because State Attorneys-General have indicated to the Federal Attorney-General that they do not agree with the Bill. We agree with the Bill. We do not want to see it slip back to where it is likely to go and then not have any more initiatives or innovative ideas which obviously were in the mind of the Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me pay tribute to Justice Michael Kirby and Duncan Chappell. They take an interest in people. That is what society is all about. It is not about brick walls and penitentiaries. It is about people being able to be helped, many of them need help particularly, as I say, in the formative years. This is a bureaucratic approach to the situation that one has always assumed has been successful. Prisons have been an abject failure and the most costly propositions to society and governments, even in human terms and certainly in financial terms . It is about time society realised there was an alternative. The propositions here were a very small step in the right direction. I am disappointed that the Government has caved in to the pressure from the States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to clarify a speech I made in this House last week. I refer in particular to page 1882 of Hansard. In that speech I dealt with the cost of tax cuts. I stated that to lift the tax free threshold to, say, $5, 000 so that everyone earning that sum or less would pay no tax, would cost around $1,680m. That would represent a reduction of $15 a week in taxable income for most taxpayers. However, the actual reduction in tax paid would depend on the tax rate which applied to the taxpayer. Therefore, it would not represent a tax cut of $15 a week but rather a proportion of that. For example, someone paying tax at the rate of 32c in the dollar would receive a tax cut of around $ 256 or $4.92 a week. I trust this clarified the comments I made last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to raise a matter which is of great concern to me and to South Australians. South Australia saw some fairly major changes under the Dunstan Labor Government. Unfortunately, this cultural revolution was at the expense of our industrial base. No doubt Dunstan would, in medical terms, suggest that the operation was a great success. However, the problem was that the patient died. Dunstan's socialist policies resulted in business and industry leaving the State and we soon had a large unemployment problem. Fortunately for South Australia the Government changed hands and industry is now starting to return to the State . An example given recently was that of a Sydney firm which moved to Adelaide and now employs between 200 and 300 people building parts for the off-shore oil and gas industry. However, the Australian Labor Party has learnt nothing from its past failures. The minutes of the ALP special convention held on 27-29 November last year indicate that if the Labor Party were to gain power in South Australia the emerging and fragile confidence which has been built up in our manufacturing industries could evaporate overnight. </PARA>
<PARA> I give just a few examples of the sorts of policies adopted by the ALP which, I believe, threaten the future prosperity of the State and the people in it. Not satisfied with a lean, efficient Public Service, the ALP policy talks of an increase in public sector spending. It will, of course, fund that extra spending by 'raising tax rates rather than cutting public expenditure programs'. After its disastrous exploits into the manufacture of clothes and a food factory, it has learnt nothing. It is going to press on and 'marshal capital to finance an expanded public role in the development of selected industries'. It will set up a statutory corporation as a merchant bank. It will not only supervise the development of the Cooper Basin but also nationalise it. I must say that that would really provide a great incentive for industry to come to South Australia! Further in the resources area, long term agreements will be subject to renegotiation where, in the view of the socialists, they are not in the best interests of the people. Any industrialist who runs the race of nationalisation and the renegotiation of contracts and actually survives and makes a profit has a few hurdles yet to come. The ALP states that:</PARA>
<PARA> The making of super normal profits should not be allowed. </PARA>
<PARA>However, it does not define what is its idea of a normal and super-normal profit . </PARA>
<PARA> The ALP, not content to increase the public sector, increase tax rates, nationalise certain industries, set up more Government-run industries, including a Government-run merchant bank, and renegotiate some long term contracts, then went on to set down a totally unrealistic wages and conditions policy. There is no doubt that, apart from the Public Service, there would be few left in jobs to enjoy the spoils. These Labor Party policies are a blueprint for business failures, unemployment and individual bankruptcies. In short, they are a disaster for South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -With consideration of the 1982-83 Budget under way by the Government, I want to make a special plea for the Australian wine industry against the possible imposition of a sales tax on our domestic wines. Any decision by this Government to impose taxes on the sales of domestic wines would have a proportionately more adverse effect on the industry than the financial benefit which might accrue to the Government. This is confirmed by market studies over a recent 20-year period which indicate that the demand for wine has a high price elasticity. This is especially so for table wines, which account for over 50 per cent of total wine sales in Australia. In fact, the elasticity measure indicates that the reduced demand for wine is likely to be in excess of 30 per cent greater than the percentage increase in its price.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The expansion of the wine industry over the past 20 years in the Pokolbin area of my electorate and the adjoining electorate of Paterson has played an important and necessary part in broadening the economic base of the region and in providing greater economic stability. This expansion was extremely important following the dramatic decline in the relative importance of coal mining in the area during the 1950s and early 1960s. The wine industry has also been the basis of the growth in the tourist industry in the lower Hunter and throughout the Hunter region generally. Already tourism helps to employ over 5,000 Hunter Valley people full time and it earns between $125m and $150m annually for the region. If present growth is sustained, within 10 years tourism will be employing almost 9,000 people and earning at least $215m each year for the region. The vineyards are of vital importance in this regard. In 1972, 270,000 people visited the Hunter vineyards. In 1981 there were half a million visitors.</PARA>
<PARA> The wine industry has gone through a period of difficulties and the people involved in the industry have responded with energy and initiative in adjusting to changing circumstances. The industry must be given time to consolidate. Hunter Valley vignerons have had to absorb the financial setbacks of successive drought vintages in 1980 and 1981. After a record vintage of 23,000 tonnes in 1979, the droughts of 1980 and 1981 cut production to 14,000 and 11,000 tonnes respectively. The industry has shown considerable restraint in its pricing policies. In recent years there has not been an occasion when the percentage increase in wine prices has exceeded the all groups index of the consumer price index. From 1977 to 1981 the cumulative CPI increase was about 49.2 per cent while the increase in the price of wine was only 26.2 per cent. Although that has been partly due to conscious restraint by the industry, it has also been affected by a general oversupply of grapes and grape products. To a large extent this has resulted from changes in consumption and taste patterns over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has been very strong on rhetoric about allowing the market to operate freely. If it follows up this rhetoric in relation to the wine industry, the industry will be able to complete the adjustment process, reach a new level of stability and enter a new stage of growth. If the Government chooses to compound the problems of the industry with further cost imposts, the capacity of the industry to adjust and restructure will be seriously imperilled. The claim may be made that in addition to its revenue potential, which I have already shown may be self-defeating, a sales tax on wine may discourage the consumption of alcohol. The fact is that alcohol consumption in Australia has stabilised at about 9.6 litres per capita for the past eight years and the trend in the market for wine in Australia indicates a clear movement towards lower alcohol wines. Any forced increase in the price of wines must cause a shift in demand to higher alcohol content beverages. One very serious implication of the economic problems of the wine industry has been the effect on the quantities of stock held for matur- ation. The result is that our wine producers are not always able to sell their wines at peak quality. This has a detrimental effect on the competitive position of the industry as a whole and a sales tax would only compound the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to this matter I seek the support especially of those honourable members with significant wine production in their electorates. I refer to the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles), the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter), the honourable member for Kingston (Mr Chapman), the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron), the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Fisher), the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde), the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O' Keefe) and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks). Five of them are members of the Liberal Party and three are members of the National Country Party . They all sit on the Government benches. I may be the only Opposition member with a significant wine producing activity in my electorate, so I expect the other eight members to prevail on their respective parties to respond rationally to this question. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>EMBASSY OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN, CANBERRA</PARA>
<PARA>27 April 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Press Communique</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 1. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has from the very outset denounced the subservient Camp David Accord and regards its implementation and the replacement of Israeli soldiers as a plot to stabilize imperialism and exploitation in the region and to trample the rights of the people of Palestine.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The deployment of forces replacing Israel in the Sinai, including a division of the Rapid Deployment Force, is designed to prepare ground for implementing the greeds of imperialism that supports the forces illegally occupying Oods. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The object of plans like the ''Camp David Accord'' and the ''Saudi Plan'' is to allow the zionist state a free hand to continue the stabilization process in the occupied territories and to annex these territories to her illegitimate domain and to continue committing tyranny and crimes against the innocent people of Palestine and the Muslim nations. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. While, simultaneously with the exit of their soldiers from the Sinai desert, the rulers of Israel are emphasizing the annexation of occupied territories to the Jewish state, the western mass media has been striving to paint the occupier as an oppressed and aggrieved party and, in concert with the hypocritical policy of the zionist state, has been giving wide publicity to the demonstrations and trumped-up resistance of the ursurpers of the occupied territories and the crocodile tears of the Israeli soldiers. For quite some time the western mass media has been preparing ground to show zionist as the oppressed people and Muslims as the aggressors. An example of this pre-planning is the timing of the televising of the films like the ''Exodus'' and the ''Hijack to Mogadishu'' during the last two weeks. The involvement of western mass media in this pre- planned drill is quite obvious to the informed. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The propoganda of zionism and its supporters will not be able to conceal the facts of history and in the circumstances the only way to fight the aggressor is through resistance by the Muslim people and the oppressed and by continuing to struggle for the restoration of their rights. Truth is always triumphant in the end. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8L7">Mr McLEAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This communique is nothing but a bigoted, hypocritical and venomous attack not only on Israel but also on Australia and her allies. I do not know the protocol regarding such matters, but it is probably better for the Government not to take action against the Embassy here concerning the communique ; it should simply stand condemned and ridiculed by its own words. I hope that the Embassy will realise that in a country such as Australia it has the freedom to release such statements, whereas if the position were reversed and people in Tehran expressed opposite views in similar cheap rhetoric they would be lined up against a brick wall and shot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What does the communique say? The first two paragraphs basically accuse Australia, by its participation in the Sinai Multinational Force and Observers, of 'stabilising imperialism and exploitation in the region' and preparing the ground for 'implementing the greeds of imperialism'. I find that a strange interpretation indeed of our helping to return Arab land to Egypt in the cause of a peace negotiated between Egypt and Israel. The rest of the communique attacks the peace process and anyone who believes that Israel has a right to exist. The authors of the communique claim that Israel will have to be destroyed by force. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most ridiculous part of a very ridiculous statement is their comment that Australia has organised all the media and television stations, in their comments and programming, to undertake a 'pre-planned drill'-to use their words-in 'preparing ground to show Zionists as the oppressed people and Muslims as the aggressors'. What a quaint interpretation of democratic life and what an admission of their own perception of governmental power that is. All of this self-righteous rubbish on behalf of their 'oppressed' Muslim people comes from an embassy representing a regime which rejoiced in the detention of American hostages in Iran for over a year, a regime which has wiped out the members of the Baha'i faith in Iran and a regime which, according to a recent report from Amnesty International-an independent human rights organisation-has executed more than 4,000 opponents of Ayatollah Khomeini, including suspects hanged after they died under brutal torture. Similar comments on this regime have come from the International Commission of Jurists, a Geneva based commission comprising prominent jurists from some 40 Western and Third World countries and which has consultative status at the United Nations. This commission has said, in reference to the growing number of executions in Iran, that the country's Islamic revolutionary courts are 'in violation of all international covenants on civil and political rights' to which Iran was a party. As if this communique were not enough, a similar war-mongering message from the Embassy of Iran in Canberra landed on our desks today stating that war, not peace, was the only acceptable approach towards the State of Israel. That communique states:</PARA>
<PARA> The message written in the blood of Iran's martyrs is that the occupied territories and the sacred places of the Muslims cannot be liberated from the yoke of international Zionism and imperialism through any plans and intrigue- based agreements--</PARA>
<PARA>I presume that is referring to the Camp David Accords-</PARA>
<PARA>but by sustained resistance and struggle. </PARA>
<PARA>The embassy officials conclude the communique, their schoolboy diplomacy, by wishing for victory over the agents of imperialism whom, they say, 'it would not be diplomatically expedient to name here'. This is a direct abuse of Australia and our role in peacekeeping activities in the region. What an insult that is to this Government and to the people of Australia and what an appalling standard of diplomatic behaviour it shows. I simply say to the Embassy of Iran officials in Australia that they happen to be living in a free and civilised country and such communiques will be condemned and discarded by Australians simply as hypocritical, bigoted and hateful garbage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two matters. The first matter, which is of concern, was raised at Question Time this afternoon and passed off, I think rather lightly, by the Treasurer (Mr Howard). As a result of inflation and the failure of the Government to move upwards the level at which incomes become taxable, the current base level at which income is taxed is equivalent to an age pension plus the rent allowance which is paid to an age pensioner. Under the means test which exists at the moment an age pensioner is paid the rent allowance only if he has no other form of income. In other words, it is the strictest social welfare means test which is applied. The rent allowance is paid to assist such a person to pay rent. At the present rate of taxation the $8 rent allowance which is added to the pension takes that pensioner's income into the tax brackets. However, because of the cumulative effect of a 12-month operation that income will not in fact be subject to tax this year. But the fact is that the tax exempt amount is very close to the current level of pensions and far below what one could reasonably suggest is an equitable level of tax exempt income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over a period and especially with the abolition of the indexation of the tax scales, we are seeing a massive transfer of income and other tax liabilities from those people in our society who are best able to afford to pay taxes. I draw attention to the comments of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) and others about super profits. We are transferring the liability from the highest areas of income to the very lowest areas of income. The burden of taxation, as a percentage of income, is increasing in respect of those people on the lowest tax brackets while it is reducing for those people with the highest levels of earnings. That situation is not equitable and it is not something which can be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise another matter which is of concern I think to every member of the community. It also relates to the means test. The present operation of the means test in respect of the unemployment benefit and invalid pensions, especially as they affect those people who are disadvantaged, is a disincentive and is creating significant hardship for people in these categories. The levels of income which are allowed for unemployment beneficiaries and for disabled persons who are working in sheltered workshop situations are far below those which would apply if the standards which had been set some years ago-surely by this time they should have been improved anyhow-had been kept in real terms. In the case of the unemployment benefit, $6 is the allowable weekly income. This is hardly a form of encouragement for people to seek some form of employment so that when they apply for a further position they can say that they have had some experience. Such people are in fact told that they should be totally idle: If they undertake any form of training to fit themselves for work, they are liable to have their unemployment benefit terminated because they are deemed to be not available for full time employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise also the matter of the income of people working in sheltered workshops. Extreme difficulties are being created for sheltered workshops in that they are unable to pay the disabled people who work in them a respectable wage without interfering with the pension entitlements of those disabled people who should be given special consideration and should be encouraged, if for no other reason than their morale, to take such work as is available to them within reason. They should not be discouraged by having placed on them financial penalties which are unreasonable at this time and which do not take account of the changes in costs that have taken place over a considerable period since those allowances were altered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Wednesday, 28 April last, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the preliminary labour force estimates for March 1982. The figures show employment growth in Australia of 71,000, or 1.1 per cent, over the 12 months to March 1982 and 217,900, or 3.5 per cent, over the two years to March 1982. Whilst the figures indicate substantial gains in employment, I am concerned, as is the Government, about the moderation in the rate of growth of employment which has been apparent since late 1981. The developing weakness in the labour market is a cause for deep concern for me and I hope for all honourable members. The easing in the pace of employment growth has not permitted the progress made by this government's policies in 1980 and 1981 in cutting back unemployment to be maintained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst it is disturbing that the economic achievements of recent years are now at risk, the important question is why, and what can be done about it? There are two basic reasons for this recent trend in our employment situation, namely, the continuing depressed state of the international economy and the recent escalation in claims for higher wages and reduced hours of work, supported by a higher level of disputation. Developments in the international economy are important to Australia, because, as a trading nation, we rely on overseas markets to enhance our domestic real wealth. Fluctuations in the international economy affect our exports and consequently limit our opportunities for economic growth. America and our major trading partners in Europe have recently experienced a period of slow growth, and this has had consequences for Australia 's exports. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus recent employment trends must be seen in the light of international experience and the difficulties we face in trying to isolate ourselves from international events. While we should recognise that the level of unemployment and inflation in Australia is below that of many Western countries, this cannot justify complacency. We must, as the present Government is doing, continue our efforts to achieve further reductions. It is, however, a sombre thought that unemployment in the area of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is likely to rise to an expected total of 28.5 million by the end of 1982. During a period when the international economy is slack, such as at present, we should be encouraging increased investment to establish the foundations for future growth in domestic output, exports and employment. This is necessary so that we can reap the benefits in export markets, as and when sound growth in the international economy is restored. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to what I believe are disturbing developments in the industrial relations arena. These developments are also contributing to the rise in unemployment, and they cannot be ignored. In recent months there has been a resurgence of claims which are far in excess of the capacity of the economy to pay. These claims not only concern higher wages but also seek reductions in working hours, which substantially increase labour costs of employers and costs to the Australian consumer-in other words, the wage earner and the taxpayer. Of course, none of us can ignore the compounding effect of strikes taken in support of such claims. In the three months to January 1982 almost all measures of industrial disputation showed a serious and significant deterioration. The number of workers involved in disputes was 169,600-more than twice as many as in the three months to January 1981. The number of workings days lost increased to a level of almost three and a half times higher than that for the three months to January 1981. This is hardly a record of which we can be proud, particularly when one considers the damage to our international reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> This level of disputation reduces the ability of companies to expand and to increase their work force. As a result, all Australians suffer. How can we expect business to be confident about the future with this worsening situation of wages and industrial relations? If labour costs rise too quickly and production declines, not only are jobs for unemployed people in jeopardy but also many existing jobs are lost. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. On 1 July 1978 the Northern Territory (Self Government) Act vested executive authority in certain matters to the Northern Territory. This transfer of powers from the Commonwealth included mining and the environment. Ownership of uranium was reserved to the Commonwealth. Under working arrangements agreed between the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory has responsibility for the regulation of uranium mining in so far as it has applicable legislation. The Minister for Mines and Energy, through the Department of Mines and Energy, has the prime responsibility to regulate and monitor the activities of the uranium mining companies in such a manner that health and the environment are adequately safeguarded.</PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy has advised that it has some twenty-two establishment positions with a major involvement in the environmental aspects of uranium mining. These positions spread across the policy aspects of uranium mining, the physical control of mining activity, the preservation and protection of the environment and the health and safety of mine workers. Other positions within the Department oversight general mining and industrial safety in the Alligator Rivers Region. Each area of administration is inter-related and co-operatively shares its expertise in the provision of regulatory services. Recently, new appointments have been made to positions with prime responsibility in these areas. A brief resume of each follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Uranium Policy (Engineer Class 5)-A Fellow of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, a Fellow of the Geological Society, Chartered Engineer (UK) and an Associate of the Royal School of Mines.</PARA>
<PARA> Over 20 years involvement in mining and geological exploration across the world . Recent high level government experience in major development proposals, particularly in environmental impact assessment, including mining projects in the Alligator Rivers Region.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Mines Inspection (Engineer Class 5)-Bachelor of Science (Engineering) in Mining, Associate of the Royal School of Mines and a Member of the British Institute of Management.</PARA>
<PARA> Over 30 years experience in overseas mining, including underground operations. Almost 20 years involvement at all levels of mine management and company administration.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Environment Protection (Engineer Class 5)-Bachelor of Science (Chemical Engineering) and a member of the Institute of Chemical Engineers. Substantial experience as a project engineer with private mining concerns. Last 10 years in government service with an involvement in environmental impact assessment and pollution control, including a long period at senior management level.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Occupational Hygiene (Science 4)-Diploma in Applied Chemistry, post- graduate Diploma in Occupational Hygiene, Fellow of the Royal Australian Chemical Institute and Member of both the Australian and British Institutes of Occupational Hygienists.</PARA>
<PARA> Over 20 years experience as a development and research chemist. Recently spent 12 years as chief chemist and industrial hygienist for a large mining company.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I understand that the Northern Territory Government has made no decision to confer the environmental and regulatory aspects of uranium mining on the Northern Territory Conservation Commission. The Commission is a Supervising Authority under the Uranium Mining (Environment Control) Act and has a continuing involvement and input to those physical environmental aspects of uranium mining within its sphere of interest.</PARA>
<PARA> (3)The Chairman and Director of the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory is G. A. Letts, C.B.E., B.V.Sc., M.A.C.V.S. The Commission's staff structure is outlined in Appendices 5 and 6 of the Commission's Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has provided the following information on the qualifications and experience of its staff directly involved in fulfilling the Commission's obligations as a Supervising Authority under the Uranium Mining (Environment Control) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Executive Officer, Land Conservation (Scientific Officer, Class IV)- Bachelor of Agricultural Science, Chairman N.T. Soil Conservation Advisory Committee, Member Australian Standing Committee on Soil Conservation, and Delegated Commissioner for Soil Conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> Over 20 years experience in resource surveying, and research administration under tropical conditions. Eight years experience in oversighting environmental requirements for mining operations for copper and uranium.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Senior Soil Conservation Officer (Scientific Officer, Class III)-Eleven years post graduate experience in soil conservation and environmental studies, including five years direct involvement in mine rehabilitation work in Australia and overseas for government, a university and as a private consultant. Convenor of the 1979 North Australian Mine Rehabilitation Workshop. Northern Territory experience includes published rehabilitation research at Gove and Rum Jungle.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Soil Conservation Officer, Jabiru (Scientific Officer, Class II)-Bachelor of Agricultural Science. Three years post graduate soil conservation experience in Alligator Rivers Region. Has undergone post graduate training in hydrology, design and specialised rehabilitation and stabilisation techniques.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Soil Conservation Officer, Jabiru (Scientific Officer, Class I)-Bachelor of Science. Three years post graduate experience in measurement and evaluation of run-off and sediment movement. External consultants utilised for program establishment and review as required.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Soil Conservation Officer, Jabiru (Scientific Officer, Class I)-Bachelor of Agricultural Science. Three months post graduate experience in the job.</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) Soil Monitoring (Scientific Officer, Class II)-Bachelor of Agricultural Science. Six years post graduate experience in resource surveys and interpretation of soil analyses.</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) Soil Monitoring (Scientific Officer, Class I)-Bachelor of Natural Resources (Hons.). Three years post graduate experience in resource surveys, and soil sampling in the Alligator Rivers Region. Experience and in-service training in computer programming.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes. Dr Letts is also a member of a sub-committee of the Uranium Advisory Council especially concerned with environmental aspects of all uranium mining projects in Australia, including those in the Alligator Rivers Region.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Dr Letts' long experience in environmental and community matters in the Northern Territory is of considerable value to both organisations and I see no potential for a conflict of interest to arise.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) I am not aware of any specific studies by universities or colleges of advanced education on the possible exclusion of low income earners from undertaking further degrees and diplomas consequent upon the limited reintroduction of fees for such courses.</PARA>
<PARA> It is possible nevertheless that some of the findings contained in a general study relating to the effects of fee abolition ('Students in Australian Higher Education: A Study of their Social Composition since the Abolition of Fees', D. S. Anderson, R. Boven, P. J. Fensham, J. P. Powell, ERDC Report No. 23, 1980) could apply to low income earners undertaking additional degrees and diplomas. Although the study was undertaken immediately after the abolition of fees and may not have allowed sufficient time for any underlying trends to show up, the report concluded that the effect of fee abolition on the social composition of students had been small. The report did comment, however, that large numbers of individuals are affected by the presence or absence of fees and those who are so affected are from the lower socio-economic and other under-represented groups.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) For the purpose of exemption from tuition fees a student would be regarded as having obtained an initial tertiary qualification if he or she had completed the requirements for a degree, or an undergraduate diploma, or an equivalent overseas qualification, or an approved combined course. Initial tertiary qualifications would also include: a graduate diploma following a first undergraduate diploma; and a postgraduate diploma following a first degree.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The DPRK has not asked the Government of the ROK for moves to reunify Korea as a confederation.</PARA>
<PARA> At the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, held in Pyongyang in October 1980 DPRK President Kim Il Sung proposed the founding of a 'Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo'. The DPRK's proposal was much recently repeated by Vice President Kim Il, in a speech broadcast over DPRK radio on 26 January 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> In making this proposal, however, the DPRK has consistently refused to acknowledge the existence of the Republic of Korea, the legitimacy of which it does not recognise. Indeed the DPRK went over the heads of the ROK Government to name those it wished to participate from the southern side in a conference to advance its proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There now exists-and have existed for some time-on the Korean peninsula, two separate states and two separate governments, both of which are widely recognised internationally, including by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It is for these two governments to enter into negotiations. The ROK is prepared to do this and has made a number of proposals for discussions between representatives of the two governments. The ROK has indicated that it would be happy to see the proposal for a Confederal Republic of Koryo discussed in such meetings. In contrast, by ignoring the existence of the ROK and refusing to discuss the question of reunificatoin with the ROK government, the DPRK has indicated a desire to set its own terms for the future of South Korea.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of reunification is one for Koreans to determine. As it is not a party principal, Australia's role in the settlement of the long-standing differences on the Korean peninsula is necessarily limited. However, judged on its merits, the ROK's approach seems the fairer and more realistic, and more likely to achieve a satisfactory and peaceful solution to current difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA> In all these circumstances, I do not see the point of our urging the ROK to consider a DPRK proposal which the ROK has already said it is prepared to consider in fair and equal discussion with the DPRK. We have, on the other hand, made clear to the DPRK that we are not prepared to consider the re-establishment of Australia-DPRK relations until the DPRK enters into real discussions with the ROK.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZS7">Mr Thomson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Of the 90 staff at the Kingston headquarters of the Antarctic Division on 26 March 1982, the following numbers were recruited in the Hobart area:</PARA>
<PARA> 21 permanent officers</PARA>
<PARA> 6 temporary officers</PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, two persons were employed under the National Employment Scheme for Aboriginals and 14 under the Special Youth Employment Training Program ( SYETP). Salaries for these two categories are not paid by the Antarctic Division but by the respective schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Antarctic research programs are subject to examination and recommendation by the Antarctic Research Policy Advisory Committee (ARPAC). In its Initial Report to Government, ARPAC supported an earlier Government decision to contract out the Antarctic Division's research programs in Upper Atmosphere Physics, Cosmic Ray Physics and Glaciology, but recommended that the resources released by such action be reallocated to develop studies in marine science. Under existing arrangements, the Glaciology program is accommodated in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Melbourne but is fully financed by the Antarctic Division. Small components of the Division's cosmic ray physics program are carried out by the University of Tasmania. Unfortunately, difficulties have been encountered in attempts to contract out the three research programs, and it appears that the programs might have to continue as at present. ARPAC has accepted this outcome, but has recommended that additional resources be provided for the marine science program.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the development of the Antarctic Division as a Centre of Excellence in the Study of Southern Ocean marine biology, progress was made with the successful completion of a major research cruise in January/March 1981. However, delays in resolving the contracting issue with the expected release of staffing positions, together with current budgetary constraints, have forced the deferral of the continued development of this research program within the Division. A major proposal is currently under development within the Department for consideration by Government which seeks adequate resources over the next several years to allow the Antarctic Division to meet both its logistic obligations and continue the development of the Antarctic scientific programs under its responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As part of the normal process of examination of options under the general policy of financial constraints being exercised by the Government, the Department examined a range of options for operating within current levels of expenditure. These options included the possible closure of a station and/or a reduction in scientific programs. However, the option of closing a station will not be pursued and additional resources will be sought to enable programs to be continued at the current level pending the major review of Antarctic programs referred to above.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Antarctic Division only became fully operational in the Hobart area for the latter few months of the 1980-81 financial year. In that period $575,677 worth of goods and services was placed with Tasmanian suppliers. It is inappropriate however, to express these figures in terms of a percentage, since most of that year's funds had been committed during the earlier part of the year in Melbourne. The corresponding figure for 1981-82 is $2,677,056 paid to Tasmanian suppliers. This amounts to 41.6 per cent of the total amount available to the Division for expenditure on goods and services ($6,433,800).</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Modular accommodation units in the form of converted shipping containers are used to provided temporary accommodation for summer construction personnel employed on the rebuilding program. Such temporary accommodation is necessary to provide for the increased number of personnel on site during the initial stage of construction of the new station facilities and was included in the original rebuilding program proposal ultimately approved by the Parliamentary Public Works Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> One of these containers at Mawson, and an additional one at Davis are used to provide winter sleeping accommodation for one expeditioner.</PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, 22 containers, converted as required are used to provide temporary office space, laboratory space and storage at the three stations, pending the completion of replacement permanent facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> Insulated shipping containers were used as the basic module due to their appropriate size, inherent strength and durability, ability to be transported to site and comparative cost. The completed modules are lined and fitted out as bedroom and bathroom units, and are equipped with necessary services such as power, heating, ventilation, fire protection, water supply and waste disposal.</PARA>
<PARA> The rebuilding program is proceeding according to schedule and is presently in Year 1 (1981-82) of the 10 year program as recommended by the PWC. Civil works funds were appropriated in 1981-82 to undertake construction work on site, as scheduled until the end of 1983. Further funds are to be sought under this civil works vote to allow the program to remain on schedule.</PARA>
<PARA> Additional funds are also being sought in the operating budget of the Antarctic Division to provide for the logistic and operational support of the rebuilding program.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4U4">Mr Killen</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In responding to representations by Dr Cass, the Member for Maribyrnong, Victoria, on behalf of the firm I advised, in July 1980, that material provided by Slipstream Aviation was being examined along with information on other existing aircraft and proposals in a study of options for the replacement of the Royal Australian Air Force basic trainer aircraft. This was the extent of my undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Later, in October 1981, in responding to further representations by Dr Cass , I advised that none of the options considered, including the Slipstream Aviation concept, fully met the Air Force basic trainer aircraft requirement. I also advised that a further and separate examination was being conducted of the Slipstream proposal. This further examination was intended to supplement the earlier and wider study.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Slipstream Aviation's proposal has now been subject to three separate but complementary considerations by my Department. Taken together these examinations represent an extensive study of the proposal. Briefly these three examinations were:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Between March and June 1980, a comparative analysis of Slipstream's design concept was undertaken as one of a list of several aircraft. Each was processed through a standard performance assessment program. The study purposely avoided the use of brochure information or other claims by the aircraft designers.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) In June 1980, a separate examination of the Slipstream proposal for financial assistance was conducted by the Government Aircraft Factories and the RAAF. It was concluded that the proposal was unlikely to satisfy the Air Force's requirements and recommended that financial support not be given to Slipstream.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Between August and October 1981, a further examination was conducted by Air Force and other Defence authorities, based on Slipstream's responses to a detailed questionnaire. The questionnaire sought further information regarding engineering competence, areas of specialist engineering support, production capability and other aspects.</PARA>
<PARA> The examination showed that Slipstream would be unable to comply with Air Force requirements for the award of a design authority and that it did not have the engineering and support capabilities needed to develop and prove its concept in accordance with standards and practices recognised by the Air Force. It re- affirmed that the proposed aircraft configuration was not consistent with the RAAF requirement and would involve high technical and cost risks.</PARA>
<PARA> In consequence of these examinations and findings, the Department advised Slipstream Aviation, on 27 October 1981, that its proposals were considered not to offer an acceptable solution of the Defence requirement.</PARA>
<PARA> Officers of my Department have a knowledge of Slipstream Aviation's capabilitites, its workshop facilities and of the activities in hand to construct an aircraft. My Department judged that a visit to examine the partly constructed aircraft would not affect the conclusions of its evaluation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr Anthony</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) The 'export and grow' campaign consists of a group of films designed to alert manufacturers to the benefits that can be gained from export and the range of services from Government and other sources which can assist them in developing overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The 'export and grow' films were first shown on television in December 1981 . The campaign started on the initiative of the Trade Development Council and my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The total cost of the 'export and grow' films was $186,740.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) There is no advertising agency handling the campaign. The films have been approved by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal as 'Community Service Announcements' and are broadcast free of charge at the discretion of the management of each station. Twenty-four television stations have agreed to telecast them. The physical distribution of the films was effected by my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) There is no set duration for the campaign. The films will continue to be shown depending on the scheduling by television stations of no-charge time slots .</PARA>
<PARA> (f), (g) The 'export and grow' films campaign is one of the measures adopted by the Government to stimulate individual manufacturing firms to develop their export trade. The films were not aimed at specific Australian industries or specific overseas markets. Accordingly their impact on individual firms in respect of specific export markets would be difficult and costly to evaluate.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The expansion of Australian exports can be of considerable benefit to the Australian taxpayer. It provides direct assistance to the balance of trade situation, and generates employment opportunities, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, in many industries, a move into the export market is accompanied by increased production and hence a reduction in unit costs, usually to the direct benefit of the Australian economy.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) No. As I pointed out in a news release of 4 March 1982, I considered that protection measures already imposed by the Queensland Government on the proposal to develop coal deposits at Redbank Plains were sufficient to protect environmental interests, and that an environmental impact statement was not required. In making this decision I took particular account of the protection measures embodied in lease conditions imposed by the Queensland Government, as set out in response to Senate Question No. 2016 which appeared in Hansard on 20 April 1982 (p. 1329-1330).</PARA>
