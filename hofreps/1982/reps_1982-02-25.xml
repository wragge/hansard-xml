<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. How does the Government reconcile the statement on page 42 of the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Economic Strategy released by the Treasurer last year that 'Since 1975-76 . . . the overall burden of taxation (as a proportion of GDP) has increased' with the statement by the Prime Minister on 21 August 1981 to the Tasmanian Liberal Party State Council that 'Statements that the overall burden of taxation on Australians has increased since 1975 are totally misleading.'? Is the Government being misled by its top level advisers? If so, what does it intend to do about the source of such misleading advice?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have sought to make the point on a number of occasions that if anyone were to judge appropriately the full burden on the people of Australia as a result of the Government's expenditure decisions, it would be necessary to take into account not only the burden of taxation but also the deficits that have to be paid for. Therefore, a very real measure of the burden that governments are imposing upon taxpayers and upon the citizens of this country comes when we look at the cents out of every dollar produced that are spent by respective governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the six years of this Government we have reduced by around 2 1/2 cents in every dollar produced the proportion of national income-gross domestic product- taken by government. If we put that into current day terms, it would amount to $ 3,700m in the course of a year. In other words, if we were spending the same proportion out of every dollar produced as Labor did in 1975, we would be spending $3,700m more and that would be about $600m for every taxpayer.</PARA>

It is no good honourable gentlemen looking just at the tax burden when the tax was just not meeting the bills of government. The deficits have to be paid for and it is the claim on the total resources of the nation made by governments that is of concern to individuals in this community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TITLE>NATIONAL INQUIRY INTO WAGES AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for Industrial Relations inform the House of the reasons for the decision at last Friday's Premiers Conference to abandon the national inquiry into wages and industrial relations? Is the Minister negotiating with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, employer groups and State governments to resolve difficulties which would have been discussed at such an inquiry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="587" SPEAKER="Viner The Hon R.I." NAMEID="EE6" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="STIRLING" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EE6">Mr VINER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform the honourable gentleman that a great many discussions went on with the employers, through the Confederation of Australian Industry, and with the unions, through the ACTU, in advance of the Premiers Conference held last Friday. In fact, the last of the discussions that I had with the employer and the union groups was at the National Labour Consultative Council meeting on 5 February. I am sure the House would appreciate that if the national inquiry was to have been a success then it would have needed the full-blooded co -operation and support of the principal parties involved in industrial relations -the employer groups on one side and the unions on the other. Of course, the States have a very direct role to play through their constitutional responsibilities in this field of industrial relations and one of the critical questions would have been the division of constitutional power between the States and the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we know, the ACTU said publicly, following an executive meeting late last year, that it was directing its affiliates not to participate and that the ACTU itself would not participate. Of course, that was a matter of great concern to the Government. I held private discussions and continued my discussions with the ACTU at that last NLCC meeting. The employers had said that they would participate, but they had always had reservations about the inquiry's practical outcome. When the matter came before the States last Friday the States recognised the long-term nature, of necessity, of the inquiry. They recognised that we could not hope to get a report within, say, two years, that there would then have to be another process of consultation and that then the political consideration of it would have to be gone through. So everybody was facing the prospect that it could be three or four years before any meaningful outcome could be seen. Anyone who has worked in this field of industrial relations knows how difficult it is to get change and reform in the system.</PARA>
<PARA> So the Premiers decided that they would look to more immediate proposals that could be examined to produce more immediate changes. The States and the Commonwealth have agreed to look at demarcation disputes, which I think everybody recognises are matters of grave concern to the community; at the maritime and waterfront industry, where we need to get together with the parties directly involved to see whether we can improve in a much more immediate and direct way the state of industrial relations; and at the divided jurisdictions between the Commonwealth and the States in a way which would produce a complementary industrial relations system in Australia where there is much more consistency and cohesion between the Federal and the State jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA> On that basis the Premiers, in an atmosphere of a much greater sense of urgency -if I might say so-than we have experienced before, have asked the State Ministers for Labour, together with myself, at their next meeting on 4 March to tackle these problems urgently, to appoint a working party and to report to the Premiers Conference in June. I can inform the honourable member for Kooyong that a great deal of discussion went on before the decision was made at the Premiers Conference to abandon the inquiry and that there is a sense of urgency being brought to bear on key areas of industrial relations to bring about some immediate change.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Prime Minister. It follows the answer he gave to the question from the honourable member for Macquarie a few minutes ago in which he claimed that the most reliable guide of government's claim on resources is the level of taxation plus deficit. Is it a fact that as a proportion of gross domestic product the level of taxation plus the deficit under Labor was 25 .6 per cent, but under the present Government has been 26.3 per cent-much higher ? Is it, however, more significant to recognise that under his Government there have been massive transfers of responsibilities from the Budget to government authorities and to the States? Is it therefore, in a sensible economic way, more proper to look at the total public sector size under the Fraser Government compared with that under the Labor Government? If one does that, is it a fact that the average public sector proportion of gross domestic product under Labor was a little over 35 per cent, that under the Fraser Government it has averaged 38.6 per cent, and that documents supplied with the Budget make it clear that it will be nearly 40 per cent this year? In those circumstances will the Prime Minister more accurately and creditably address himself to reliable economic indicators rather than manufacturing spurious claims?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs aware of the sometimes unfair disparity in the price of petrol in the States of Australia? Realising the difficulty in overcoming this problem, will the Minister be in a position to release the findings of the committee set up by him to look into this real problem facing the motorists of Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="588" SPEAKER="Moore The Hon J.C." NAMEID="EI4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="RYAN" MINISTERIAL="BUSINESS AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EI4">Mr MOORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Franklin is a great supporter of the industry and is a person who has taken a considerable interest in it. In fact, of all the members in the House, he is one who takes a particular interest in this industry . Because of that, I have here this morning the figures in relation to the States' taxes that are applied to the justified price by the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority. They are probably worth noting because they add to the consumer price: Sydney, 2.0c a litre; Adelaide, 1.33c a litre; Perth, 1.60c a litre; Hobart, 1.75c a litre; and Melbourne, 2.05c a litre. These prices add considerably to the consumer price to which the honourable member referred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On top of that, because of the anxiety among many motorists as to the pricing policies pursued by the oil companies, the consumer affairs Ministers in Australia have asked that a report be prepared to see whether some rationality can be brought to prices in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> It is well known to all honourable members that the Commonwealth has no control over retail prices. We have an influence over only the wholesale price, and that is the price to which the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority directs its judgment. I hope that when this report is made available-it certainly will be-it will be considered by all State Ministers and we will be able to see what we can do in relation to helping the vexatious problems.</PARA>
<PARA> In the short term I can say only that the variations in prices of petrol in Australia depend very much on the competition from site to site. In some areas competition is keen, which brings about discounting, and in other areas where competitors are few and far between a very high price is frequently charged.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Prime Minister aware of the harsh and cruel treatment by authorities of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of the Jewish minority in the Soviet Union? Is he aware that the Soviet Government is deliberately discouraging Jews from leaving the Soviet Union? What action can the Australian Government take in regard to this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="589" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is aware of and is deeply concerned by the Soviet Union's continuing violation of human rights in its treatment of its Jewish population. A particular cause for concern is the very marked decline in the number of Jews allowed to emigrate. It has declined from an average of over 4,000 a month in 1979 to several hundred a month recently. Those figures do not reflect any significant change in the numbers of Jews wishing to leave, but rather a deliberate obstruction by that government of Jewish emigration. This obstruction has been accompanied by intensive harassment of Jews applying for exit visas and the number of rejected applicants has increased considerably. Some have been tried on false charges and sent to prison and labour camps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a time when the Soviet Union is participating in international conferences dealing with the Helsinki Accords, this violation of human rights is even more noteworthy. There is a continuing suppresion of Jewish religious and cultural expression. This occurs against a background of hostile propaganda in the Soviet media. The Government is in full accord with the United States Government's strenuous efforts in negotiations with the Soviet Union to allow free emigration of Jews and others who wish to leave the Soviet Union. The Soviet Government's actions in this regard are totally unacceptable to everyone concerned with human rights and, indeed, must be condemned. They are among the factors inhibiting an improvement in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States and its Western allies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that over the last six years Commonwealth recurrent grants to the Prime Minister's old school, Melbourne Grammar, have increased threefold from $180,000 a year to over three quarters of a million dollars this year? Has the Prime Minister been personally responsible for the fact that funds going to wealthy schools such as Melbourne Grammar have increased at twice the rate of those going to the most needy Catholic schools?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="589" SPEAKER="Fife The Hon W.C." NAMEID="CG4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="FARRER" MINISTERIAL="EDUCATION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr FIFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The basis of the honourable member's question is quite inaccurate. The question that he has put this morning in relation to the funding of non- government schools indicates that he is not aware of the basis on which the Commonwealth provides recurrent funds to the non-government schools. So I take this opportunity to inform him of the facts. The Commonwealth Government has a firm policy on both needs and freedom of choice. We believe that a parent should have the right in this country to determine to which school he or she sends his or her children. We believe that in relation to needs schools should be appropriately funded. So in the schools where the resources are greater than they are in other schools-that is, what we call group 1-the Commonwealth provides a basic grant of 20 per cent of the average cost of educating a child in a government school. I emphasise that figure. The Commonwealth provides only 20 per cent of the average cost of educating a child in a government school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the next group, which is group 2 covering schools with lesser resources as measured by the Commonwealth Schools Commission and not measured in an arbitrary way by the Government, the Commonwealth provides 30 per cent of the average cost of educating a child in a government school. In the lower resource levels are the type of school to which the honourable member referred, the Catholic parish schools. I emphasise that some 85 per cent or 90 per cent of children attending non-government schools are grouped into the group 3 area. Those schools will receive this year 38 per cent of the average cost of educating a child in a government school. Next year, 1983, the Government will increase its support for those children to 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> So it is quite wrong to suggest that the children attending schools in group 1 are receiving more support than are the children attending schools in group 3. I have indicated that for group 1 it is 20 per cent of the average cost of educating a child in a government school and that this year for group 3 it is 38 per cent. I wanted to make that point very clear. I also take the opportunity to indicate that the Commonwealth and State governments throughout Australia accept full responsibility for educating children in government schools. On average it is costing the taxpayer about $1,700 a year to educate a child in a government school. Commonwealth and State governments together provide roughly only half that amount on average to children attending non-government schools.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand from Press reports that the Victorian Government has given effect to a proposal to grant trustee status to investments in permanent building societies in that State. I will make only two comments on that. It underlines the fact that this is essentially a matter for the States and that the control and responsibility for building societies, which are major home lenders, are in fact State matters and State policies can have a very direct bearing upon the operation of institutions of that kind. I believe that the conferring of trustee status will have some beneficial effect on the permanent building societies' capacity to lend for housing. It is difficult to put a figure on it but I do not think there is any doubt that it will have a beneficial effect. Quite obviously, if that is the case other parts of Australia , including those States that do not have trustee status, which I understand to be Queensland and New South Wales, might well examine the matter. That is, of course, a matter for those States to determine. I say also to the honourable gentleman that I understand building societies in the Australian Capital Territory do not have trustee status. As a result of the honourable gentleman's question I will have a talk with my colleague, the Minister for the Capital Territory, about that matter-without, of course, wishing to pre-judge it.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BU4">Mr ANTHONY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The high consumer prices, plus the intervention subsidies, have been a major incentive to increasing production within Europe. The situation has changed so much over the last 10 years that today Europe, instead of being an importer of many agricultural commodities, is one of the largest exporters of many major agricultural commodities. It is the world's largest exporter of dairy products. Last year it was the world's largest exporter of sugar and a major exporter of beef and grain. It has completely distorted the world trade pattern in agricultural commodities. Just recently the Commission of the European Communities recommended to the Council of Ministers that there be approximately a 9 per cent increase in domestic prices and an increase of about 6 1/2 per cent to 7 per cent on cereals, cereals being the one exception. However, France has proposed that there ought to be a 16 per cent increase in domestic prices. This is contrary to the point of view of the Commission and certainly some of the other member countries. Yesterday I had the opportunity of talking to the British Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. He assured me that Britain would not go along with the suggestion of a much higher price which is being recommended by the Commission because it could see the deleterious effect that was resulting from the ever increasing consumer and intervention supports being given to agriculture and from the accumulation of surplus stocks. So I have to say that I think the only way in which we are ever going to get any changes to the Common Agricultural Policy of accumulating these surpluses is by airing our points of view, registering concern and hoping that that might place some moral persuasion on them to try to alter policies that are having such serious effects on many countries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the Premiers Conference last week the Commonwealth put the point of view that there are two sides to the present problems of people paying off home loans or wishing to gain a home loan and to establish themselves in their own houses. One involves the availability of money for house lending and the other involves the price at which that money can in fact be lent. It is important to understand the nature and the extent of the problem. It is a very important one for a number of people within the Australian community. People who took out home loans five or six years ago and have been paying them off ever since are, on the figures shown to me, better off than they would have been when they first took out the loan. People who have taken out a loan within the last two or three years could be in a quite different position because their houses have not appreciated in value so much and they have been hit more by the higher interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In discussing these matters with the States it became apparent that the States had not given a great deal of consideration to the implications of the report of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System for State savings banks and for permanent building societies. These are two traditional avenues of substantial lending for home purchasers, as the honourable gentleman would know. Therefore, the Commonwealth put it to the States that they should see what they would want to do or thought should be done to achieve a greater flow of funds for house lending purposes. This is what the States are meeting about today.</PARA>
<PARA> I also indicated to the Victorian Premier yesterday that it is my understanding that some of the building societies lend for purposes other than home purchase and that merely restricting permanent building societies to lending for home purchase would in part increase the capital flows available for that purpose. I would be expecting to hear from the Victorian Premier, and I suspect from other Premiers, after today. I do not know what they are going to put forward but I hope they will have some positive and constructive proposals and suggestions to make. I think the matter had better rest until we have heard from the Victorian Government or from other Premiers, if they wish to tell us what they believe ought to be done about instrumentalities that are established under State law and within their charge.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to my colleague the honourable member for Fadden, I think it will be interesting if I repeat to the House something of the way in which Telecom has been expanding its capital program to meet the very real needs , not only in the honourable gentleman's electorate but also in the adjacent area of Queensland, in which I am told the population is growing possibly at an even greater rate than it is in the honourable gentleman's electorate. Indeed, this year Telecom plans to spend about $5m more than it spent last year on capital works in that region. It has increased its staff by some 34 per cent. On the technical side, in that part of Queensland it has increased its staff by 44 per cent. In addition, an engineering group comprising five engineers and nine support staff controlled by a supervising engineer is moving to the Gold Coast to try to ensure that that region of Queensland does get an improvement in the services which, regrettably, seem to have suffered both from growth in traffic in the Telecom system and, of course, growth in demand for new phones as a result of the population explosion. Knowing the interest of my colleague the honourable member for Richmond, I do not doubt that that demand will spread south of the border as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a problem in particular areas of Australia. That is one such area. There are other areas on the western side of Sydney and in some regions north of Brisbane where there are greater than normal demands. Telecom is endeavouring to meet those demands by expanding its capital program wherever it feels it desirable to do so. For that purpose the Government has reconsidered the available capital funds that should be spent by Telecom this year. The Government has decided that from the available funds of Telecom, without increasing its demand in the public area generally-that is, its borrowings-it will permit Telecom to spend on capital works an additional $20m above that which it had previously allocated. It is hoped that, as a result in the honourable gentleman's electorate and, I might add, other electorates around Australia, there will be an improvement in telecommunications services for the Australian people.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid we still have a lot to learn from the EEC regarding restrictions on trade. As to the reference to the submission that was made this week to the GATT Council, this is a result of a protest that the EEC lodged against certain import safeguard arrangements that we have implemented for motor cars and footwear. It is not a new issue. It has been going on for a substantial period. It is a matter of interpretation of Article 19 of the GATT regarding the application of safeguards. We have been defending our approach and we believe we have support for the action that we have taken being quite legitimate under the GATT. The Council of GATT decided-in the interests of harmony, I suggest-that the matter be deferred for another month to see whether the contesting partners could come to some resolution. I might add that we are also engaged in another action in GATT regarding the EC policy on the dumping of sugar on third markets.

If I may address myself to these points, the first thing I would say is that Question Time, like just about every other aspect, if not every other aspect, of parliamentary procedure has become debased to the stage of being pretty much meaningless to the administration of the affairs of this country. One feels some discomfort in acknowledging that, but if one is candid one has to. What is happening is that in this Parliament very little information is transacted between either side of the House at Question Time. In the course of debate, I have yet to recall an instance, in more than two decades in this place, where the opinion held by either side has been altered. The nature of the political debate has reached a stage now where it is more important to make a point and to establish it to the public. I suggest that, if that is what the parliamentary chamber now is, as I believe is the case, it would be better if we respectively, in our parties, set up our own communications booths and spent most of our time there trying to communicate to the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If, on the other hand, we take the potential of this chamber seriously, as I do -I believe that it can be reformed in important ways-there is an overwhelming case for demanding that, with the greatest urgency, we proceed to explore ways in which we can improve the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, obviously you harbour concern about this because I noted this week in the newspapers an account of an address which you delivered. Although I do not agree with the conclusions that you have arrived at, vis-a-vis a change in the nature of the political institution to something more akin to a presidential one, I do acknowledge nonetheless very big changes are taking place and a momentum developing more by default than otherwise, and therefore lacking direction, which I suspect could take us into altogether the wrong sort of area, the wrong sort of system of operation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that the institution of Parliament is a Samson within the democratic system. I suggest that we have shorn the hair of that Samson by the way in which this institution functions. For my part, I genuinely extend to you considerable sympathy, in spite of the rather terse observations I have made from time to time. You do have difficulty in handling the proceedings of this House because of deficiencies in the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> I focus my attention very quickly, therefore, on the motion that I have put before the House. It is restricted to an area which, at least at the moment, is the most vexatious. I refer to Question Time. The first point I put forward is the need for definition of relevancy. I suggest that perhaps it ought to be in accordance with legal definition. Perhaps it should not be. Perhaps that is too precise, too rigid and stultifying for the more free flowing exchange and expression that should take place here. However, I think we could do without some of the robustness that we have seen in recent times. Some of that robustness comes forward in response to the irrelevancy of answers given at Question Time. What the deuce is the good of asking a very seriously contrived question-contrived in the sense of representing some serious research-about, say , taxation and then getting an answer about jam? That is about the level of many of the answers we obtain in the Parliament. Cheap point scoring in the course of giving answers bearing no relationship to either the question or indeed to the facts of a particular set of circumstances is calculated to provoke reaction and to interfere with the processes of business in this House. I think we need collectively to explore the relevancy of questions. </PARA>
<PARA> The length of answers should be subject to a time limit. I recognise that that would be extraordinarily hard to define and administer but we have now reached the situation where some Ministers are notorious for their dinner-bell type answers. As soon as they start answering a question members get up and walk to the dining room because that is more of a diversion than the tedium of listening to these endless dissertations that produce very little. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention, then, the need for a clearer definition in the Standing Orders about the practice in relation to supplementary questions. I believe that should be seen in association with my fifth point, which is the appropriateness of setting down specified sitting days as days on which questions will be directed to Ministers about particular departments. I believe there is a need for supplementary questions. That does not necessarily mean consecutive questions from one side of the House and not one question from this side of the House, one from the other side of the House and then a different question again from this side, as we have now, but a question and a supplementary question from this side of the House where the person who has asked the question in order of call declares that he wants later to ask a supplementary question. That is a much more effective way in which to extract relevant information which is of benefit to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Another role of Question Time in this institution is to ensure that Ministers are in fact in charge of their departments, that they do know the business they are conducting as administrators. That is important to the Parliament and to the public. It is no less important to the Prime Minister who must be assured that his Ministers are in command of the responsibilities which have been allocated to them. So, I suggest as a critical part of a strengthened parliamentary proceeding that, if my proposal were accepted, on certain specified sitting days questions would be directed to Ministers about particular departments, because then we would be moving somewhat akin to the House of Commons procedure in relation to Question Time when there are a series of follow-up questions. Nothing is more directed towards establishing the competence of a Minister and the degree to which he is in charge of his department than that. Honourable senators who are Ministers ought to attend the House to answer questions. It is unproductive to ask questions in this House about departments which are administered by Ministers in the Senate. I believe this House is as much entitled to information about departments administered by Ministers in the other House as we are entitled to information from Ministers who are seated here. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the sixth point concerns the duration of Question Time being a minimum of 45 minutes. I do not believe that the length of Question Time is a matter that should be dependent on the mood of the Prime Minister or the Leader of the House on any given day. I do not believe, for instance, that if a Prime Minister -God forbid that this should be in any way interpreted as referring to any living person-were in a surly mood on one occasion because Question Time had not been going his way and he withdrew like a pained Mr Ichabod, that Question Time should immediately fold up. I do not believe that at all. I believe it is a right of the Parliament, not of one or two people, even if, for the time being, they happen to be the Prime Minister, the Leader of the House, or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, this motion is put forward in the spirit of constructiveness. It is a response to the tensions, the controversy and the disruption which have occurred in the Parliament since this Parliament resumed. It has sat for merely a fortnight. The experiences, however, are not isolated to this parliamentary session. They have been evident over the past several years. More than that, it is clear that the sort of resentment that has been evident-the tempo and level of it-has been welling up to much higher pitches in more recent times because of the way in which Question Time is falling apart. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat, Mr Speaker, that this is in no way directed as a criticism or a censure of you. I repeat what I said earlier: You preside over, often, an extraordinarily difficult situation and in circumstances in which Standing Orders do need considerable shoring up to give you indisputable authority to direct the course of the affairs in this House most effectively and efficiently.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I second the motion. I think everybody in the House would agree that there is room for much improvement in Question Time. That is no reflection on anybody. Questions are not answered and there is a great deal of difficulty in getting this definition of relevance. I just address your mind to the fact that if questions are to be asked there must be criteria to be followed. There are 12 inhibitions or restrictions placed on the asking of questions. For example, questions must not contain arguments, imputations, epithets or ironical expressions. But we can get all of them in the answers. The school children's judgment of this House last week was that 'it is a disaster'. They are right, not because of attempts that were made to obtain information but because of the low grade vaudeville which often takes place to score points. For example, questions asked last week might have been related to tax or inflation but we got answers about what happened under the Whitlam Government, what is happening in New South Wales or what should happen in Tasmania. They had nothing to do with what was asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very clear that we can get a definition of relevance. It has a legal definition. It is a question of facts being related to each other. If there is to be some clear ascertainment of what is sought in the question, the answer ought to relate to the question and to nothing else. Other parliaments are able to do this, and I think it can certainly be developed here. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not be difficult to allow the asking of supplementary questions. They would be asked immediately after the answer was given. This happens in other parliaments. They must relate to the previous answer and, of course, there would have to be an allowance made by way of discount so that honourable members on one side did not keep asking supplementary questions all the time. One supplementary question could be asked from one side but then two questions would have to be asked from the other side if that were the way it was to be done. Question Time should certainly continue for 45 minutes. But if the time allocated for Question Time is rationed, then also the time for the question and the time for the answer must be within reasonable limits. Usually 12 questions are asked in the 45 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these things can be readily looked at. I think the matter just requires an understanding that we are here to seek information and also to give it to the public and to the media. It does us no good to have nothing but disarray. In the period I have been here, in my view, the disarray always eventuates from the fact that in the answers to questions Ministers are anxious to score political points. I know that is a natural aptitude of politicians, but it does nothing to help the business of the House. I think the House of Representatives Standing Orders Committee would agree that there is room for improvement. I think what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has moved is very worth while. I think it could be readily brought into operation and that it would assist you, Mr Speaker, in the administration of this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the Government does not oppose the reference to the Standing Orders Committee, any such support for the reference does not necessarily endorse the contents of what either the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) have said or of the motion itself. I think that if Question Time has been debased, it is not peculiarly the fault of the Standing Orders. I think that to the degree to which the behaviour of members on both sides of the House- interruptions, disruptions, refusal to comply with your directions, Mr Speaker, and so on-is not a matter which is specified within this motion, some of the cause, at least, of those schoolchildren's remarks the other day can be sourced to that, rather than to any deficiency, if such exists, within the Standing Orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the contents of this reference, there are a couple of things that I would say. First, quite obviously, within this place there is a range of members with different views and attitudes as to the nature of the Standing Orders and what they should contain, particularly concerning Question Time and the procedures of Question Time. The procedure of questions without notice, as it exists in this Parliament and others around Australia, is different from those that exist in other Parliaments. It is suggested that we move down the track outlined in the motion, that is, allow supplementary questions in a form different from that now specified in Standing Order No. 151. For those honourable members who perhaps do not recall that Standing Order, I will read it out:</PARA>
<PARA> Questions may be asked without notice. At the discretion of the Speaker supplementary questions may be asked to elucidate an answer. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is already within our Standing Orders the procedure and the capacity for supplementary questions to be asked. But the concept, as I understand it, being advanced by the Leader of the Opposition, relates in part to what is now specified under item 5 of this motion-that is, the appropriateness of setting down specified sitting days as days on which questions will be directed to Ministers about particular departments. In other words, there is to be a different concept of our Question Time, when questions without notice are asked, from that which is now in practice. I think it is well worth while the Standing Orders Committee and this Parliament debating that matter, and if it should be that honourable members on both sides of the House feel that that is a preferred form, so be it. But I think that we need to recognise that the concept of questions without notice, as it now exists in this Parliament, has traditionally been seen as an Australian extension of the Westminster system, with as many pluses as there are negatives. Indeed, it is worth commenting, for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition remarked on the number of questions that are asked at Question Time, that in terms of the time allocation, both when the Labor Party was in government and when the coalition parties have been in government, the Clerks religiously hand to the Leader of the House a time which gives the three-quarters of an hour which is accepted as the present limit for Question Time, or thereabouts, and the Leader of the House brings it to the Prime Minister's attention when that three-quarters of an hour has expired. Indeed, since we have been in office there have been very few occasions on which there has been less than 45 minutes allocated on any particular day for questions without notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, in regard to the actual form of answering questions, I know that the motion sets down some restraints, and I think that the Government of the day inevitably is concerned about any interference that there might be in the discretion which it is believed Ministers should exercise. Indeed, when in opposition the coalition parties were concerned about the then Government's responses, as the Opposition today is concerned about the present Government's responses. If one looks at the number of questions that were asked over that period, one finds that Question Time permitted far fewer questions than has come to be the practice in recent times. So if anything, the present length of ministerial answers is shorter, and perhaps the questions too, than in those earlier days. But it is not a matter of comparing past with present. It is essentially a matter of referring to the Standing Orders Committee a series of specific changes which the Leader of the Opposition has identified. The Government accepts the reference. It would hope that if honourable members on both sides of the House have other areas where they would suggest change, they will also refer those for consideration by their representatives on the Standing Orders Committee. The matter will in due course be returned from a report of the Standing Orders Committee to this place for consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is no laughing matter. Let us look at it. Under the Standing Orders we have a right to have General Business dealt with every second Thursday . Why has the Government suddenly decided to take the initiative and give Notice No. 19 precedence? There is nothing wrong with Notice No. 19, except that there are 18 notices ahead of it. The other factor is that this happens to be General Business day and it is set aside for specific purposes. That is the point. Surely honourable members on the Government's back bench who had a General Business motion which they could move would want it dealt with. Is it because it is an Opposition motion which is to be moved by the honourable member for Wills that it is to be done away with? Is the Government so fearful of what happened last Thursday that it does not want to see it happen again this Thursday?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue is: What is wrong with the administration of the business of this House? It is pointless for us to refer matters to the Standing Orders Committee when we disregard Standing Order 104, which states that General Business shall be called on on the day specified, that is, every second Thursday. The Government has now decided to do away with that Standing Order and no explanation has been given. We would have been delighted to hear the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) clearly indicate why Notice No. 19-I notice that it has been on the Notice Paper since December 1980-will now have precedence all of a sudden because the Government wants to have it dealt with as against a notice relating to unemployment. We would have had enough time to deal also with a motion to be moved by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) relating to technology and foreign investment and control. Are they not very important matters? The Government is going to do away with the lot. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown) would be anxious to discuss unemployment. He is here, ready and willing to go but nobody will allow him to do so because the Government has decided to move the suspension of Standing Orders. Which members of the Government decided this? Did they decide it in the party room? Surely not. They would have been done in their own party room. Government supporters would not have allowed the Government to do this. Certainly we do not mind the Government giving more publicity to the honourable member for Wills. It will just mean more support for us in the electorate. It clearly indicates the Government is so worried about these matters that it does not want to discuss them here but they will be discussed outside. </PARA>

The Government does not believe that Poland is sufficiently important for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) to make a statement on it. It does not believe that it is important to devote Government time to it when the Government has no business. It has decided to play political tricks and to seek to embarrass the Opposition by having the Opposition support what is its right in this Parliament, and a very limited right. Looking at the Notice Paper, we see that in the fifteenth month of this Parliament we are up to General Business Thursday No. 6.

I have no objection to the House debating Poland and neither has any other member of the Opposition. In fact we would welcome the opportunity on the proper basis, that is, a full scale debate on a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs or, if necessary, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who takes a leading role in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Surely the subject is important enough for this Parliament-if the statements which are being made by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister outside the Parliament are sincere, and I would hope they are-that the Government should not play tricks on the Parliament and use its numbers for a subterfuge of this nature purely so that it can prevent an item of business which is important to the Australian nation and economy coming forward in the Parliament. No one in the Parliament knows when we last had for debate an economic statement or a statement on unemployment made by a Minister of the Parliament. The Government is seeking to pretend that unemployment does not exist. Matters relating to technology are vital to the future of this country and at the moment they are restricted in debate in this Parliament to a series of slogans, sayings and cliches. There has been no serious debate, in fact no debate at all, on these important matters. The Government motion is a fraud designed to achieve a very low-grade political purpose. If the Government is serious about wanting to debate Poland, the Opposition will facilitate it at any time the Government wishes. I suggest to the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) that he might treat the Parliament seriously by doing it in Government time. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, the Parliament languished for six weeks purely to go through the exercise of meeting because the Government had no business. If we look at the Notice Paper now, it still has no business. It has no legislative program. The Government is rudderless. It does not know where it is going. Now it is resorting to subterfuge in seeking to use the Parliament to try to improve its almost desecrated political image. If the Minister is serious and if the members of the Government are serious, they will protect Government business by refusing this motion and will demand that the Government bring on debate on Poland with its proper status and importance as a Government initiated debate. It is within its competence at any time merely by changing the order of business on the Notice Paper over which the Leader of the House has total control. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a piece of hypocrisy by the Government to bring on this particular motion on this day. No one denies the importance of a discussion on Poland. But let us look at the date when notice of the motion was given. It is 2 December 1980 and the motion concerns events to that point, commendation of Solidarity and noting the failure of the Press to report the Opposition's attitude; that is fair enough. But would not one think a few things had happened in Poland since 2 December 1980 that we should be talking about? Are we really to take the view that the last event in Poland of which we can reasonably take notice happened 14 months ago, and that nothing whatever worthy to be the subject of debate has happened in the last 14 months? I think the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) would be the first to concede that his motion, which was absolutely appropriate on the date when it was given, is now a bit of a period piece 14 months later.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think both sides of the House would welcome an opportunity to take part in a very serious debate on it. But is shows contempt not just for the Opposition but contempt for the people of Poland to resuscitate this motion 14 months after the events it describes. The Government ought to be ashamed of itself. But given the thick hide of the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair), who is sitting at the table , I doubt whether he would feel ashamed about anything. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to amplify some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). There are in fact about five other motions on Poland on the Notice Paper all more recent than the motion proposed by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren). One was moved last week by me dealing with the contemporary situation in Poland. That motion calls on the Government to do something about food aid. Also on the Notice Paper is a motion by the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) which also deals with Poland and asks the Government to do something serious about the Polish refugee problem in Austria. There is a motion from the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) in similar terms to mine, though not asking the Government to do anything specific, but again condemning the actions of the martial law regime. These three motions deal with the contemporary Polish situation and it is that situation which ought to be discussed.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would have to say: 'I cannot get anything out of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) in this House on Poland; I cannot get anything out of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in this House on Poland; I cannot say anything to you about the Government's intentions on food aid'. </PARA>

I would welcome an opportunity for all this to be brought together in some sort of coherent statement because what emerges from it might be very good and very satisfactory not only from the point of view of the Polish people in Australia but also the Polish people in Australia and Poland. We desperately need a discussion in this House on the question of Polish refugees. A very serious problem is developing in the Austrian camps. I have at least a couple of submissions before the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) to try to get people out of those camps. Those submissions have been before the Minister for three or four months but nothing has been done. I occasionally phone that area to find out whether or not the refugees have been interviewed. They have not been interviewed. There are clearly problems about processing the cases but they are not being dealt with. We cannot debate this matter if we are to stick to the terms of the motion that we will be allowed to discuss if the Government's motion is carried because that motion refers to events of 15 months ago and is related to the inadequacy of Press coverage of an Opposition protest on the question. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important that the public in Australia-this is broadcast day so they do have an opportunity to hear what is being said-understands that this is part of a shabby trick to deny the Opposition its rights during the General Business debate of a Thursday. Some of us in the Opposition and on the Government side have motions down the line listed for hearing on general business Thursday. I have a motion on the Notice Paper that is concerned with the question of establishing a select committee to look into the question of injurious affection for citizens disadvantaged by the development of Commonwealth installations such as an installation at Perth Airport. This is a matter which has received considerable attention in a number of other countries. In Britain they have established compensation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> I have absolutely no chance of having that motion brought on for discussion in this House, even though I know that a large number of honourable members on the other side of the House would be interested in the matter because they have airports in their constituencies and that every now and then they attempt to adopt a responsible attitude in relation to airports on behalf of their constituents. The motion also relates to problems confronting the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott). I will never be able to have that motion brought on for discussion. Whenever the time to debate General Business matters arrives on a Thursday the Government has one manoeuvre or another to remove from the agenda the various motions of which Opposition honourable members have given notice and to bring on for debate, piecemeal, as it feels like it, other notices of motion appearing on the Notice Paper. This is not the appropriate motion under which to discuss Poland. There are other far more appropriate motions. This would be an appropriate time to discuss the motion of which the honourable member for Wills gave notice. Although he gave notice of the motion some time ago, the matter is still current. The situation to which it refers is even more serious now. I hope the motion before the House is defeated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As none of the honourable members on the Government side of the House are prepared to support or defend the proposition which has been put up by the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair), I take this opportunity to point out the hypocrisy of the Government on the issue of Poland. On 16 February the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) gave notice of his intention to move a very appropriate motion dealing with the death in police custody in South Africa of Dr Aggett. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) did not even let the honourable member conclude his notice of motion before saying that his side of the House agreed with the motion and the motion was passed unanimously. On 18 February I gave notice of my intention to move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House expresses it solidarity with the Polish people's struggle for human rights and freedom. </PARA>
<PARA>When I did that I thought that the least the Government could do, the least the Prime Minister could do, was to say exactly the same thing as he said about that issue in South Africa. I thought that he would be prepared to say that every honourable member agreed-whilst we might disagree on practical points-that we should express solidarity with the Polish people's struggle for human rights and freedom; not just the Polish people's struggle, but all people's struggle for human rights and freedom. However, on that occasion we saw an exhibition of the utter and complete hypocrisy of the Prime Minister and those who sit behind him. They are prepared to use the issue of Poland for party political purposes but are not prepared to associate themselves with us on this side of the House on the basic point that the people of Poland, through the Solidarity trade union movement, quite clearly showed that they wanted to overthrow a dictatorial regime, that they wanted to participate in running their country. The Prime Minister is not prepared to associate himself with that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Today the Government-I assume the Prime Minister is involved in this-is prepared to bring on a motion, with which I completely agreed when some 14 months ago the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) gave notice of his intention to move it. He basically criticises the media of Australia, which ought to be criticised in this case, because it suppressed coverage of a resolution which was signed and supported by the vast majority of Federal Labour parliamentarians . On that aspect it is interesting to note that a full page advertisement which was published in the Australian on Solidarity Day, 30 January, expressed the view which I expressed in my notice of motion No. 155, stating:</PARA>
<PARA> That this House expresses its solidarity with the Polish people's struggle for human rights and freedom. </PARA>
<PARA>I was associated with obtaining signatures for that advertisement. It was signed by a great variety of people, ranging from Santamaria to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr Ian Robinson) and the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent). I think that most of us who are interested in Australian politics will know that that covers a fairly broad spectrum of people in the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition definitely opposes this motion. The proposition that the Government is now putting forward is that we should now discuss Notice No. 54, which expresses concern about Poland but has nothing to do with the relevant position in Poland. We would love to discuss Poland on the basis of the continuing trade with the Soviet Union. Today we are running something like Fraser's lotto-if you cannot get No. 19 up, pick another number. The issue is what is to be the General Business matter. If it is to be a debate on Poland-we would love to have a debate on Poland for a number of reasons-we would be discussing why it is that this Government is prepared to fight the Soviet Union to the last Pole. It does nothing about helping Poland. It has refused Poland trade credits. It is continuing to sell wheat, wool and everything else to the Soviet Union, but it is denying the trade credits of $ 110m which have been sought by Poland. This motion has nothing to do with the current position in Poland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order to avoid wasting further time, I will move an amendment to the motion to give us a chance to talk about Poland. It would give the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) the opportunity to make a statement on Poland. We will do it now by moving an amendment to the motion. Notice No. 54 views with concern the mounting evidence that the Soviet Union is going to invade Poland. We have had that in our minds, but is it not hypocritical to have a supplementary debate because the Government has failed in its attempt to bring on another Notice? What has happened to the Minister for Foreign Affairs? Why has he made no statement at all in this House on Poland? If the Government is so anxious to debate Poland let us have a statement now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendment. The importance of the question of Poland should by now have come home to the members of the Government . It requires a little more than a back bench motion which was put on the Notice Paper in April 1981 for the Parliament to discuss the matters that have occurred . If, for instance, it is the belief of the Government, on the information that it has to date, in February 1982, that the Warsaw Pact allies have grouped on the borders of Poland ready for an invasion, this Parliament ought to be told. It should not come as a result of a motion submitted by a back bench member 12 months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We would also like to know, as part of the ministerial statement, what is to be the Government's attitude to the increased pressure for Australia to take more of the Polish refugees in the camps in Austria. Many honourable members on this side have been concerned that although there have been increasing numbers of applications by Polish refugees to come to Australia we are unable to take them. On Tuesday of this week I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) whether the refugee programs were also subject to expenditure cuts, as announced, and he was not able to answer me. It is my understanding, in spite of what he told the House on Tuesday about the Polish refugees, and in spite of the sentiments that he has expressed on behalf of the Jewish people of the Soviet Union, that at the moment the Government is cutting its expenditure and that this will restrict the entry to Australia of both Soviet Jews and Polish refugees. They are two of the questions that arise. </PARA>
<PARA> The third concerns what is happening internally to Poland that this Parliament ought to be told about. What is the most up to date information that has been given to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about what is occurring internally there? Is it the opinion of the advisers of this Government that martial law will be in operation there for a long time to come? Or is it the opinion of the Government that perhaps Poland will return to a Communist Party government? What is to occur as far as the Polish economy is concerned? What is the best way in which Australia can exert pressure on the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact countries in order to bring about self-determination in Poland?</PARA>
<PARA> No one in the Parliament is running away from a discussion on Poland. We all beat our chests about what a great thing it was that Solidarity was established and what a great thing it was that challenge was being made to the rule of the Soviet Union throughout Eastern Europe: But where is the Minister in regard to all this? It is a great pity that in the Government party room a discussion of these matters was not insisted upon.

Government supporters have not been told of the tactics that were to be adopted by the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) concerning what was to receive priority in the national Parliament. We say that Poland possesses priority, but that the total question of Poland should receive priority. Mr Speaker, if you or the Deputy Speaker were to confine the debate that the Leader of the House is attempting to bring on to what is contained in Notice No. 54 it would be absolutely ludicrous. The honourable member would be telling the Parliament about what was happening in March or April 1981. The Government has already been defeated in regard to Notice No. 19 and it is just as ludicrous to put forward Notice No. 54. Government supporters have been led down the track by the Leader of the House, who is determined to ensure that the Parliament does not discuss unemployment, particularly in terms of the motion proposed by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke).

<PARA> That, in light of the Government view contained in the 1980-81 Budget papers that there will be no improvement this financial year in the already disastrously high level of unemployment and the consistent glossing over of this fact by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, in the opinion of this House, and as a matter of urgency, a joint committee should be established to inquire into and report on unemployment in Australia, with special reference to-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the House. The information contained in the table shows clearly that the extent of the unemployment, according to official Australian Bureau of Statistics survey data, has increased considerably during the 1970s and that over the six years of the Fraser Government there has been little improvement. During the last six months of 1981, for example, unemployment averaged more than 386,000 or 5.7 per cent of the labour force, compared with unemployment rates of 4.9 per cent in 1975-76 and 1.7 per cent at the start of the 1970s. This situation is unacceptable in a society that supposedly is committed to the ideal of full employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unemployment is likely to become even worse during 1982, primarily as a result of the continuation of this Government's policies of reduced public spending and tight controls over money supply growth. The major forecasters are united in this gloomy assessment. The Melbourne University's Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research predicts unemployment of around 460,000, or 6.6 per cent, during the second half of 1982. The Victorian Chamber of Manufactures has recently predicted average unemployment of over 480,000 persons during 1982-83 and a post-war high in the unemployment rate of 7 per cent during that period. This is bad enough, but we have only one set of official unemployment figures on which to base our analysis-the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey data. It is generally acknowledged that there are deficiencies in the data base. Early last year the Government terminated the collection of Commonwealth Employment Service data on registered unemployment, which removed the only alternative perception on the overall dimensions of unemployment in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course not. Quite apart from the magnitude of recorded unemployment , there are other aspects of the unemployment situation in Australia which add further disturbing dimensions to the real extent of unemployment but which are afforded little attention or about which we know relatively little. The long term nature of unemployment has arisen as a major feature of the unemployment situation during the second half of the 1970s. The average duration of unemployment has increased dramatically over this period. During 1981 the average duration of joblessness was almost 33 weeks and over 76,000 of our fellow Australians had been out of work for more than a year. In August 1975 the average duration of unemployment was only 13 weeks while at the start of the 1970s unemployed people, on average, could expect to be jobless for no longer than seven weeks. This situation is unlikely to change much even if job prospects improve. A recent pioneering analysis by economists Gregory and Stricker and others at the Melbourne University Institute has indicated that the major part in any increase in job opportunities is normally taken up by people coming from outside the labour force rather than from the ranks of the unemployed. The need for a further analysis of such movements is essential to an understanding of the dynamics of the labour market and in particular to the nature and magnitude of employment policies required to make substantial inroads into existing levels of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The uneven incidence, the burden of unemployment, also appears to be falling increasingly on certain social, occupational and regional groupings. Unemployment rates amongst teenagers, females, migrants and older job seekers have been disproportionately high during the 1970s. Let us consider teenagers. On an average annual basis, the rate of unemployment amongst 15 to 19-year-olds has been consistently over 15 per cent since 1975 and over 17 per cent amongst teenagers looking for full time work. Young job seekers with relatively little work experience or developed skills are typically not in a strong competitive position in the full time job market. Despite existing youth employment policies designed to improve this competitiveness, employment opportunities for teenagers have slumped dramatically since the middle of last year. Against a background of a general slowing in employment growth, employment amongst teenagers was actually falling in absolute terms on an annual basis during the second half of 1981. In November and December the annual rate of decline was of the order of 20 ,000 jobs, mainly in the full time area. On an occupational basis, available evidence suggests that the incidence of unemployment is falling on the lower skill categories and most of the analysis of the impact of technological change points to this trend. </PARA>
<PARA> We know precious little about this important influence on current and future levels of unemployment and it is imperative that more detailed and ongoing investigations be undertaken at an official level. At a regional level, in conjunction with a number of other less comprehensive surveys which have been conducted at this level over the past few years CES data provided an important insight into the local and geographical characteristics of unemployment until their termination in April of last year. Such data indicated the existence of strong geographical variations in unemployment. We now have little official information on this important phenomenon. I refer to the phenomenon of hidden unemployment because official figures relating to unemployment levels do not take account of this. Over the past couple of years increasing attention has been focused on the growth of this factor. Hidden unemployment basically refers to people who want to work but who have withdrawn from active participation in the labour force or have declined to attempt to enter the labour force primarily because of the persistent lack of job opportunities. It also includes workers in part time employment who would prefer to work longer hours if such employment opportunities were available. </PARA>
<PARA> Studies have been conducted by members of the Melbourne University Institute and by the Social Welfare Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. The results indicate that by the start of the 1980s, hidden unemployment was as high if not higher than recorded levels of unemployment. Sheehan and Stricker from the Melbourne University Institute, in their recent book on the subject, estimate that in August 1979 hidden unemployment was 340,000 persons compared to the recorded unemployment level of 374,000 persons; that is, total unemployment of over 710,000 persons or an unemployment rate of, effectively, around 11 per cent. The Social Welfare Research Centre has estimated that by September 1980 the level of hidden unemployed had risen to about 445,000, which was actually larger than the official level at the time, of just over 400,000 persons. </PARA>
<PARA> These studies have provided orders of magnitude only. However, they point to the probable dimensions of the problem and the fact that it has arisen almost entirely as a result of the prolonged stagnation of the labour market since the mid-1970s. For instance, Sheehan and Stricker estimate that hidden unemployment was virtually non-existent prior to 1974-75. We, as a community-not as an Australian Labor Party or as Government parties but as an Australian community- need to know a lot more about this phenomenon than existing official resources allow. From a policy viewpoint, the possibility of a massive re-entry into the labour market of these hidden unemployed when job prospects improve must be accounted for. In relation to mothers, for instance, renewed participation in the labour market will have important implications for the provision of child care facilities as well as for employment policies.</PARA>
<PARA> I will not spend a great deal of time on the grave social implications for the viability of this free society because my colleague the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) will speak in more detail upon that aspect in seconding the motion. I simply say that it would be a matter of common ground between all honourable members-with the one possible exception-that this issue of the social implications, the way in which this phenomenon of unemployment is affecting the personality of the people concerned and matters permeating into the society, is a matter of concern for everyone who is worried about where this country is going. I look forward to the remarks on that subject by my colleague. </PARA>
<PARA> Coming to the question of policy implications, I suggest it is incumbent on any government with a sincere interest in achieving full employment to undertake a thorough appraisal of all policies and strategies which are proffered as potential solutions to the problem of unemployment. In the current situation the role of a more enlightened set of macroeconomic policies needs to be seriously investigated. This Government continues to rely on the traditional concept of a short run trade-off between price stability and full employment, and the belief that control of inflation is paramount and must be pursued through tight macroeconomic policies which depress employment growth. Quite apart from the obvious failure of this strategy judged in its own terms since 1975, adherence to such a strategy ignores the relevance of a growing body of analysis which suggests that inflation and unemployment can be tackled simultaneously with an appropriate reorganisation of macroeconomic affairs. There is enough work about from our own economists in this country on that. I refer to Sheehan's work, Crisis in Abundance, and Perkins's work, The Macroeconomic Mix to Stop Stagflation. There is enough work about to show the truth in regard to what I am saying about this. There is also growing support for a broader policy framework to be invoked in the dual fight against unemployment and inflation; namely, the use of more expansionary macroeconomic policy in conjunction with an incomes policy to maintain wage-price stability.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the basis of either ideological aversion to Government expenditure or the fact that such schemes are ineffective and too costly. In particular the Government has repeatedly used these arguments to criticise the operation of the Labor Party's Regional Employment Development Scheme of 1974-75. Such attitudes ignore some pertinent facts which I should like to bring to the attention of honourable members, including the jackass on the other side. Job creation schemes are widely used in Europe as a major means of reducing unemployment. The 1978 report of the United States National Commission for Manpower Policy, after analysing the European experience in this area, concluded that if well designed, such schemes are worth that cost. Hoping that my remarks may permeate even some thick minds, I say this: The evaluation of the RED scheme conducted not by the Australian Labor Party but by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations under this Government in 1977 concluded that when viewed in a broad social and economic framework the scheme's benefits outweighted its costs. It is important to remember that job creation schemes can be specifically directed to alleviate severe examples of unemployment in certain regions or amongst particularly disadvantaged groups of unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Community based programs, labour intensive and directed at urgent social and community needs, are extremely useful in short term alleviation of unemployment. My party has a well developed set of job creation proposals which would seek to create an extra 100,000 jobs per annum in both public and private sectors, with a number of programs aimed specifically at groups experiencing abnormally severe unemployment. These proposals are continually being refined in the light of changing labour market conditions and have been carefully integrated with our general economic policies. What we should also do as a community is to investigate the applicability of overseas experience, extensive as it is, to the Australian situation, undertaking a thorough cost benefit appraisal of particular schemes. Specifically, the costs in terms of Government expenditures must be carefully pitted against the benefit arising from increased production, income and taxation and reduced unemployment benefit payments. </PARA>
<PARA> A good practical example of this type of approach is the cost benefit analysis used by G. T. Harris from the University of New England who has conducted a thorough investigation of the New Zealand experience with job creation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, when we are talking about this fundamental subject, that we recognise the nature of limitations on the rate at which an Australian Government, committed to achieving full employment, can proceed towards that goal. Even with the adoption of more progressive enlightened macro-economic policies and the use of specific job creation schemes, we cannot expect to move immediately to an ideal situation. The reasons for this are obvious but need to be appreciated. They include the fact that productivity growth and normal labour force expansion will require economic growth of at least 3 per cent per year just to avoid a worsening of the unemployment situation; the problem of a more rapid expansion in the labour force as job opportunities expand and the hidden unemployment re-enter the labour market; and the existence of structural forms of unemployment, that is unemployment caused by a mismatching of the supply of and demand for labour on a geographical, skill or occupational basis. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me, very briefly unfortunately in terms of time available, to the role of manpower and training programs in reducing unemployment. Where structural changes are occuring at a relatively rapid rate and major alterations are emerging in the occupational and regional demands for labour, appropriate manpower policies are crucial in ensuring that adjustments to such change can occur with a minimal amount of labour market dislocation. The existing set of manpower policies has evolved on an ad hoc reactive basis. The programs do not form a co-ordinated integrated approach to easing problems of labour market dislocation and do not appear to be based on any planned appraisal of longer term market trends. Rather, they largely constitute an ill conceived mixture of trade training subsidisation-the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme-subsidies for temporary work experience-the Special Youth Employment Training Program-and school to work transition programs which are designed primarily to delay the entry of school leavers into the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> The programs have inherent deficiencies, while the overall strategy has some serious shortfalls, namely, the overriding emphasis on youth when there are other labour market groups with problems of similar magnitude and little importance is placed on the need for improving the geographical and ocupational mobility of the work force. There is an urgent need to consider the applicability of training, retraining and relocation assistance programs which are capable of dealing with a broad range of problems. I conclude by saying this : Naturally my duty is to criticise this Goverment in areas in which we think it is properly subject to criticism. But I hope that I have conveyed that, beyond that, we see this as a problem which transcends party considerations, that we want to join our resources with the best resources on the other side of this House in a joint committee to look at the economic and social reality of these problems and together, all of us in this Parliament to do what we can together to look at the problem, see its dimensions and then unitedly bring our combined best talents together to see, together, how we as responsible Australians can help our underprivileged Australians who are suffering from this problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. If society is able to blame the unemployed for not having jobs, it tends to exonerate itself from any responsibility for the fact that job opportunities have almost disappeared. It focuses attention on the disabilities of the unemployed rather than the disabilities of society. It focuses attention away from the need for social change and job creation. A society which is based on the ideology of laissez- faire requires a deprived population which is allegedly unwilling to work or to work hard. Not only does this attitude to the unemployed reduce the moral pressure on the present Government to do something concrete about unemployment but also welfare measures can be kept to a minimum if those who will benefit from them can be described as dole bludgers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I was here in 1974 and 1975, this philosophy was constantly put forward by the then Opposition. I quote from a speech by the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr McVeigh) recorded in Hansard of 3 September 1975 in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The number of people receiving unemployment benefits has jumped from 32,009 in June 1974 to 162,000 in June 1975 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I might add here that the number of unemployed has now jumped to 437,200 while the hidden unemployed, as my colleague the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke ) has so aptly shown us, number many hundreds of thousands more. Mr McVeigh went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> This is a disaster and it is featherbedding to bums and slackers in our society . These people are abhorred by all thinking Australians. We on the Opposition--</PARA>
<PARA>As the Government then was-</PARA>
<PARA>side of the House are totally opposed to paying benefits to people who will not accept employment when they are physically capable of doing the job and a job is offered to them. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the opinion of the then Opposition, and that was the philosophy it sold off to the media and the people of Australia-the dole bludger syndrome. The Government has done a great disservice to Australia, to the Australian community and to the unemployed by reinforcing this community attitude. Divisions have occurred in the Australian society and will continue to multiply unless government-backed job creation policies are developed. Without a comprehensive policy for youth, an increasing number of young people-this unfortunately includes more girls than boys-will end up on the dole. At present one in every six young lads is unemployed, but one in every four young girls is unemployed. The implications of a generation of young people on the dole have really horrifying overtones for the entire community. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy of the middle aged unemployed is equally horrifying. The social implications of unemployment will engulf us all. The danger is that Australia will remain a generally wealthy country, but it will have a growing number of people who do not have jobs and who do not feel able to play any useful part in society. To some extent, this danger has already struck. Though young people are not the only ones hit hard by unemployment, they have the highest rate and many of them face a workless future. For Australians this is a new and extremely difficult social situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few years the idea that a higher education will get a person a better job has taken quite a battering. Faced with the fact that the extra schooling has not always produced better job opportunities, young people, and particularly those in lower income families, have reacted by leaving school earlier than they did a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Predictably, employers and governments have reacted by blaming the schools for not making the young people more employable. To blame the schools for general unemployment is irrational. Neither employment nor unemployment is created by schools. The general economic conditions, the Government's strategy, loss of public confidence and the savage cutback in public spending have all contributed to the highest rate of unemployment that Australia has experienced since the 1930s. One could almost say that the only growth industry in Australia is unemployment. The burden of the Government's misdirected economic strategy is being unfairly borne by one section of the community-the unemployed, young or middle aged. These are the victims, and the Government seems determined to cast them into the role of culprits. I wonder how many honourable members opposite have really looked at the results of unemployment-the effect on the individual, the effect on schools, on families, on industry, on retailing, and on the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> Robert Kosky, the psychiatrist superintendent in Western Australia, points to the astonishing lack of reseach into the mental health of young people who experience long term unemployment. From the few results of studies that are available, he draws the following conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA> A South Australian study shows that juvenile delinquency was associated with unemployed status of offenders and offenders' parents. </PARA>
<PARA> A Victorian 1977 report says that the rate of attempted suicide in unemployed persons in a large Victorian country town was 12 times the average area rate. </PARA>
<PARA> In Blacktown municipality of New South Wales, it was estimated that 30 to 40 per cent of the people attempting suicide were unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Of 15 to 24 year olds who were treated for the first time by the Victorian mental health authority and who were unemployed, 11 per cent were diagnosed as alcoholic. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the 15,000 people under 25 years estimated to be homeless in Melbourne, the majority were said to be unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> A South Australian study showed that unemployed persons have consistently reported more respiratory illness, more migraines, more blackouts and more irritability than employed persons. </PARA>
<PARA> Twenty-one per cent of CYSS and 35 per cent of CES clients report that they often suffer from depression. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Kosky adds that none of these studies assesses personal mental health adequately; nor do they decide between cause and effect, because despite unemployment being a major social phenomenon over the past eight years, there has been negligible research into its effects on mental health. </PARA>
<PARA> A leaked report by the Victorian Department of Community Welfare Services- another report that fell off the back of a truck-urging the Federal Government to act on unemployment, acknowledged a link between suicide and the jobless. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Russell Meares, head of psychiatry at Melbourne University, has pinpointed suicide increases to suburbs where there are high rates of unemployment. He has said that the number of young men committing suicide has jumped from 50 a year in 1976 to 75 a year in 1977-79. He has said that a study of the depression years has shown that suicides peaked in 1930 at the height of the unemployment crisis. While a lot more research needs to be done on the health of unemployed people, I believe that we should take note of the signs now before the problem deteriorates. </PARA>

All of the members here must have had constituents in the 45 to 55 age group who have worked hard for years, reared a family, and battled to keep a home going and educate their children, and who suddenly were told that their services were no longer needed; redundant at 45 to 55. There are no jobs for breadwinners in this age group. Their despair and hopelessness is tragic to see. They spend their days looking for work and becoming more and more despairing as the weeks and months go by. Family life suffers; tensions increase. The father feels that he has failed. He does not see that we have failed him. He loses his self-respect, his dignity, and his will to fight on. His plight is multiplied in thousands throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The school leavers have their own problems. Even during school years the talk is now on whether or not they will get a job when they leave school. With some the whole attitude to their school work suffers as they become fearful of their future. Some years ago when I was speaking to schools about unemployment, no one in the groups to which I was speaking really believed that he or she personally would be unemployed. It is a different ballgame now. All too many know that they will not get a job. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, they start on their search for work reasonably confidently. As unsuccessful attempts to find a job follow more unsuccessful attempts, they get a bit nervous. But then, when their friends start finding work, this tends to make them feel even more uneasy. 'What is wrong with me?' they start asking themselves. They do not ask what is wrong with a society that has no jobs, or what is wrong with governments that do not take enough interest to put up some job creation schemes. They ask 'What is wrong with me?', and that is the whole core of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Over succeeding months of applying for jobs and being rejected, they get angry, resentful and bored. They feel powerless to help themselves. They cannot keep up with their friends who are working-not on the dole that we pay. They start to feel like failures. If they are living at home, they have parental pressure on them-'Why don't you get a job? Joe Blow's son got a job.' They sit around feeling bored, lonely and frustrated. It is at this stage that some become depressed, and some start abusing drugs and alcohol in an attempt to escape the feelings of despair. </PARA>
<PARA> The longer the period of unemployment, the more difficult the problem. Long term unemployment sets up psychological trends that are hard to reverse-loss of interest in appearance and in looking for a job, and eventually, even if work is obtained, there is no enthusiastic commitment. They tire quickly of it, and they hanker for a return to aimlessness. </PARA>
<PARA> This is one scenario; there are many. As is usual, the burden falls heaviest on the poor. In the low income family, with father and mother unemployed, it increases the difficulties that young people suffer. It makes it harder to cope, and under these circumstances the poor, who have already been penalised by this social system, continue to be punished throughout their lives. I brought with me a book called The School Report which gives the experiences of seven young people in the dole queues. One of the tragic things is that they have no experience when they go to apply for a job but everybody wants somebody with experience. Young people cannot get experience if no-one will give them a job. It is the chicken and the egg situation all over again. </PARA>
<PARA> The social results of unemployment will be with us for a long time. Britain had Brixton. Australia does not want a Brixton; but nor does it want increased petty crime, vandalism, hopelessness and despair. We do nothing to avoid the anger that unemployment engenders. We cannot expect the young people not to be angry. Youth unemployment could be the greatest future source of social instability in Australia. Governments must take the initiative in planning an overall policy for youth. The most constructive approach would be a total plan which gave all young people a choice of three alternatives-work, subsidised study or a mixture of work and study. At the moment, if they go on the dole they cannot study. It is a case of the chicken and the egg again. They cannot study without the dole because they cannot keep themselves. </PARA>

It also robs them of their self-respect and hope for the future. The social cost of this Government's policies falls too heavily on the shoulders of those least able to bear it.

As she quite rightly said, it is a vicious circle: People cannot get a job without experience and they cannot get the experience without a job. That is the very reason why so much of our effort and funds has been put into training and work experience programs-to provide a subsidy and make it easier for employers to take on young unemployed people who do not have experience. The evidence, such that there is, shows that very many thousands of young unemployed people who have worked under the Government's work experience and training programs for young unemployed people, having obtained that experience, find it far easier either to stay with the same employer and be economically supported or to obtain a job with another employer. So we agree with her to that extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must, however, inject a note of some concern at this early stage. If the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) wants bipartisan support on this matter-I am very ready to give it-I would urge him to reconsider what he said with respect to the Government's manpower programs. Honourable members will recall that the view was expressed that one of the faults of the Government's programs was that-I am probably not quoting the honourable member correctly but this is the substance of what he said-there was a shortcoming and that part of the shortcoming was that they had an overriding emphasis on youth. I think that is an extraordinary position to take. Australia has high unemployment because of its high youth unemployment. It does not have high unemployment across the board because of its adult rate of unemployment. Its adult rate of unemployment is comparatively low. The problem we have is with the comparatively high rate of youth unemployment. That is where the problem is. That is where the emphasis has to be placed. That is where we have to tackle the problem. To say that an overriding emphasis is placed on the youth programs and to say in some way that that is something which is a defect in the Government's programs is very unfair, quite wrong and a shocking indictment of the Australian Labor Party's position on the support that is necessary for young unemployed people in this country. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I am desperate, let the honourable member repeat the words he said because I believe that in substance I have stated the view he has expressed . I think it is a reprehensible view. The substance of the issue before the House at the moment is that the honourable member for Wills has moved that a joint committee should be established to inquire into and report on unemployment in Australia. The Government's reply is that we do not need such an inquiry because the Government knows, the country knows and, indeed, as I will endeavour to explain later, the Opposition knows what the problems and causes of unemployment are and what the solutions to unemployment are. We put it that a joint committee on unemployment is not necessary and that to establish one would be to do nothing more than provide a diversion from tackling the problem. By setting up a joint committee to investigate unemployment we would simply be deluding ourselves that we were doing something constructive about the problem. It would be doing little more than putting off the evil day of facing up to the real causes of unemployment and tackling them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before we go any further let us look at what the honourable member wants to investigate through his joint committee. The honourable member wants the committee, firstly, to inquire into the extent of unemployment. But we do not need an inquiry into that. We know that the full time unemployment rate is 6.4 per cent. We know that it is too high. We know that in January 1979, however, it was 7.1 per cent. The following year, in January 1980, it dropped to 6.8 per cent. In the following year, in January 1981, it dropped to 6.6 per cent and it is now 6.4 per cent. Therefore, we know that it has dropped in each of the last four years but the rate is still too high. We also know that at least the rate is better than it is in comparable countries overseas. We know that the rate is better than the 8.9 per cent in the United States of America, the 11.5 per cent in the United Kingdom and the 6.7 per cent which is the average of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We know also, as I have already said, that the rate of youth unemployment in particular is far too high and that it is a major economic and social problem. We do not need an inquiry to tell us any of these things. We know them only too well. Indeed, the Government is continuing to impress on the people of Australia that they must acknowledge the unpalatable facts about unemployment and face up to the real causes of it. The real cause of unemployment in this country is that it is no longer as profitable or as economic to employ people in the same numbers as it used to be. If we want seriously to tackle the problem of unemployment we must seriously tackle the major cause of it, which is the large impetus given to unemployment by reason of excessive wage demands. Its parallel cause, of course, is the shorter working hours which are being forced on to the community as a result of excessive demands by certain sections of the trade union movement, those shorter hours not being matched by increases in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member wants the committee, secondly, to see whether unemployment is a long term problem. Of course it is a long term problem. We do not need an inquiry to tell us that. Unemployment will remain a problem until it becomes profitable to employ the unemployed and until the unemployed can offer the skills and abilities that employers want. What we need is not an inquiry but an acknowledgment of this basic cause of unemployment and a resolve to tackle it at its root to bring about an environment in which more people will want to be employers, in which employers will need to employ more people and be able economically to employ more people and in which the unemployed will have more to offer. The House need not take my word only for this. The honourable member for Wills, without the benefit of the findings of a joint committee to aid him, has told us what he believes the cause of unemployment to be and what we must do together if we are to alleviate it. In July last year, when the unemployment situation was much healthier than it is now, the honourable member said, in a prophetic statement on Radio 3UZ:</PARA>
<PARA> If you want what I think is the real answer, it really follows from what I have been saying. I think that if I were in charge-</PARA>
<PARA>That is not the prophetic part; that comes later. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>if I were in charge, I'd be saying to the Government Departments 'now look, we' ve got to sit down with the trade union movement and with the employers and really try and explain to them what the state of the economy is, what capacity there is for wage movement, what sort of adverse circumstances are there going to be for everyone-including workers, if wages explode too fast.'</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say-this is the prophetic part of his statement because it is a prophecy that has come true:</PARA>
<PARA> Because there's no doubt that (if) wages do explode too quickly, it can have adverse economic impacts on unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>There it is in a nutshell. The honourable member for Wills was absolutely correct. It is with no joy at all that we can now record that his prophecy came true. We have had substantial wage increases and shorter working hours without increases in productivity to match those conditions. That combination of factors has given rise to unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> But we know all of this. We do not need a select committee to tell us any of it . What we need is a conviction to tackle the cause of unemployment already identified by the honourable member for Wills. There is no argument as to the cause. It has already been identified by the honourable member, and presumably on behalf of the Australian Labor Party as I do not notice any dissent coming from the other side of the House. That should mean that the Labor Party should use its considerable influence in the trade union movement to persuade the trade unions to lessen their wage demands, to defer their claims for reduced hours and to try to do something about increasing productivity in this country. Until we do that, and until we have the trade union movement on side-the Labor Party can do more about it than we can-we will continue to have decreasing profitability and a situation in which it is simply not profitable to employ more people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member wants a select committee to see whether unemployment bears particularly upon certain industries, regions and sections of the work force. We do not need a committee to examine those things. That is the proper area of research of the Bureau of Labour Market Research which exists for that purpose and is engaged on that work. The Bureau was established expressly for that purpose. Let us look at some of the areas of research already under way by the Bureau and the subject of papers published or about to be published by it. There is an investigation into the review of information on the labour market for tradesmen, an investigation on the pattern of youth employment in the 1970s and a review of the operations of the relocation assistance scheme. There is the first phase of the study of the effectiveness of Commonwealth manpower programs for young people, particularly unemployed young people. There is a case study of the professional labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Labour Market Research, the universities, the Government, advisory committees of departments of labour and other academics whose job it is to investigate these things are pursuing these matters and they are matters of legitimate inquiry. But we should not stop tackling unemployment and put it off until all research is concluded. We know substantially and essentially what is the root cause of unemployment in this country. What the Government says is that we must face up to the situation. There is no point in convincing ourselves that by a select committee or a joint committee the problem can be put off. We will not be solving it in any way. The expertise is in the Bureau of Labour Market Research and in the universities. It is those people who should be investigating labour market problems. There is not one word-this is a matter of very great concern-in the motion which indicates that there might be some connection between the excessive wage demands of the unions and rising unemployment. We must face that. </PARA>

On those rare occasions if we were to check it up, it usually was not Gordon's fault.

Gordon had managed to arrange all the plane bookings for some 190-odd people when somebody, obviously on the Liberal-Country party side caused a disruption that went on for two hours. Suddenly, Gordon had to produce plane tickets and seats for people to leave Canberra. He did it and without at any stage losing his cool.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this is a sad day for many of us in this building. Gordon Pike has been a very great servant of the Parliament over a very long period. He is one of the people who has given the Parliament its atmosphere. He is one of the people who has made the workings of the Parliament possible. In a sense, it will be hard to imagine a parliament without Gordon Pike. He always said: 'Leave it with me; I will fix it' and he always did . If he had a dollar for every time he said that over the past 40-odd years, it would be nice to imagine as a retirement allowance. It is Gordon Pike's phrase and he should have copyright in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember in earlier days-there are not too many of us who do but certainly you, Mr Speaker would be one and the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) another- when transport was not as good as it is now. This was not Gordon's fault; the aircraft were not so good. We would be booked on a DC4 or a DC3. Viscounts were introduced on the route. We would say: 'Gordon, can we get a Viscount this week? ' When we had a Viscount aircraft it was a great benefit, it was a boon-we thought we would never get anything better. The difference between a DC3 aircraft and a Viscount was certainly remarkable. But that, I suppose, just emphasises the length of time, which I am sure is too much for some honourable gentlemen in this House, that you, Mr Speaker, I and the Minister for Defence have been here. </PARA>
<PARA> Gordon has always conducted his task in a very friendly way. He has gone beyond the call of duty. Honourable members might like to know that his service to government and the Parliament has taken a span of more than 50 years-51 years to be exact. It was in February 1931, about six or seven months after I was born, when Gordon began a six year apprenticeship as a compositor with the Government Printing Office. In November 1940 he joined the Joint House Department. Then for 10 years, from 1941 to around about 1950 or 1951 he was an attendant with the House of Representatives. From 1951 to now he has been the officer-in-charge of transport, firstly as a transport assistant, then as transport officer and now as transport manager. That is an enourmous lifetime of service to a great variety of members of Parliament who have passed through this place over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether Gordon is intending to write his memoirs. But bearing in mind what Gordon could say about a number of us, I hope he treats us kindly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it seems to be a habit these days, Mr Speaker, for people to retire and write. I do not know whether or not that is in Gordon's mind, but knowing his personality I am sure he would treat kindly members of Parliament and make us all appear better than we are. That might be an incitement. Gordon Pike has been active in many other areas. He represented the Australian Capital Territory in hockey on and off over 20 years between 1934 and 1954. He has coached and managed many junior hockey teams. He represented the Australian Capital Territory in cricket as a wicket keeper and has been an Australian Capital Territory cricket selector from 1971. He is an A grade table tennis player. I understand he still plays a pretty effective game of table tennis. He was honoured by the Queen in 1969 with a British Empire Medal and in 1982 he was made a Member of the British Empire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not going to be possible to replace Gordon Pike. I suppose it will be possible to find somebody who will attempt to book members of Parliament on planes, who will attempt to get them where they want to go. I would not be surprised if we hear complaints in the next few weeks about members thinking that they had got on to a plane to Sydney and finding they are on a plane to Adelaide, or wanting to go to Brisbane and ending up on their way to Tasmania. Gordon has managed to point us all in the right direction over a long time. Gordon, on behalf of the Government and all members of this place, thank you very much for a lifetime of service.

He is a very fine man in his own right. He is a man of considerable character and firmness, which, because of the nature of his work, he has controlled in fairly obvious ways. I have noted in the period I have been here that when it has been appropriate for him to establish his own self-respect and independence he has done that with a firmness which has been impressive and convincing. In the selective but appropriate way in which he has done that he has elevated the respect of all of the reasonable members of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a remarkable situation that a man who has served as transport officer in this Parliament is held in such extraordinarily high esteem.

We are grateful to him; we are greatly indebted to him. </PARA>
<PARA> He was a cricketer of considerable note in his younger days. I guess it is appropriate, therefore, to use a cricketing analogy and say that we regret that now is the time when he takes his bat from the wicket for the last occasion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join with the very fine tributes that have been paid to Gordon Pike here today. I doubt whether in my period in this Parliament I have ever heard a more affectionate or more sincere tribute paid to anybody associated with this Parliament. I think that says a tremendous amount. At the end of each year when we give our seasonal greetings and pay tributes, Gordon's name comes up regularly. People wanted to express their appreciation for the service that he had given during the year. On this occasion we all want to say thank you to Gordon for his timeless efforts in trying to make transport arrangements for us under the most difficult circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not needed the service of Gordon for a good many years because I have had a ministerial staff to help me. But I recall when I was a private member just how vital he was for me and the great respect I developed for him. In the 1960s as the Minister for the Interior I had administrative responsibility for the cars and facilities used by members of Parliament. Occasionally complaints would be lodged by a member of Parliament regarding services or the behaviour of a car driver or that something did not go right. I used to make it a habit of referring to Gordon to get judgment as to just where the fault lay. I found that mostly, or nearly always, it was with the member of Parliament. I think that sometimes late at night some of our members become a bit irascible and tend to be a little bit uppish. I want to thank Gordon for the help he gave me in making decisions because I wanted to see justice done properly. </PARA>
<PARA> Gordon is a remarkably courteous, patient, tolerant and dignified person. That is why he is such a popular figure. That is why we all wish him the very best in his retirement and hope that he has many years of happiness. All the political parties have held small ceremonies to wish Gordon Pike well. My party held a small function yesterday, when we gave him the highest accolade we could possibly give him. For the past 20 years every member of my party who has departed from this Parliament has been presented with a silver jug, suitably inscribed. Gordon was invited to accept one of those jugs, the only person other than a member of this Parliament ever to have received one. That shows the high esteem in which he is held by members of our party. Gordon Pike, thank you for being such a great servant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in what has been said by other members about Gordon Pike. I speak not only on behalf of myself but also on behalf of all those honourable members who will not have a chance to say in this Parliament what they think of Gordon Pike. It is great to see him in the chamber . All of our dealings with him have been successful. The outstanding thing about Gordon Pike is that he likes members of parliament. Very few people do. We have a lot of acquaintances but very few friends and Gordon is one of our best friends. In fact, when I was talking with him last night he said that what he will miss most is us. I can understand that he might miss us in other terms, but he means that he will be sad in missing us. I think we will be very upset not to have Gordon at the airport every morning when we arrive, with his very small book containing all our names, where we are going, where we will be picked up and every event during the week. It is a remarkable effort. If he ever goes into the private field and decides to run a hire car business he will put everybody else out of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say this to him: He has been a great Australian. He is a great credit to this country. We cannot praise him too highly. I hope he writes his memoirs because obviously we will get a good rating from him. That is important because we try to serve our people. Transport is essential to our doing that. A remarkable thing about Gordon Pike has been that when everybody working for the airlines said that we could not get a seat on a plane, we could just ring Gordon Pike and get a seat. That is an incredible way of doing things. I think he has an outstanding ability. I know he is interested in capital gain of a minor nature- that is, system punting. Like all punters, he systematically goes broke. It is great to see him here in the chamber, having been so successful and so interested in the things that matter in life; that is, people and their families -the things that are worth while. He has taken an interest in all of us and our families when they have come here. On behalf of every one of us I wish Gordon a great retirement. I hope it will be a long, healthy and very happy one. To your good wife I also extend every good wish. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Due to the limited time available, on behalf of Government back benchers I join with the sentiments expressed and extend all our best wishes to Gordon Pike in his retirement. He is an amazing man. All sorts of accolades have been paid to him. From my point of view, it is his competence, his charm, his sheer unruffled nature and constant cheerfulness when dealing with all the dreadful problems he has had to deal with during one week that are most worthy of mention. I am quite sure that members of parliament and indeed Speakers are very easy to get along with because by and large they fly on scheduled flights; they arrive at the beginning of a week and leave at the end of a week. But when one considers the sheer petulance and difficulties which, in my experience, are created by Ministers from both sides of politics, let alone the members of their staff, some of whom really think they are God's gift to Parliament-that affects the mere back bencher-one can imagine the difficulties Gordon Pike has had to deal with over his period of service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He has had a very difficult week. Not only political parties have been farewelling him but also the airlines. Thinking of Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans Australia Airlines, one ponders on whether Gordon Pike does not go back to the pre-computer age. That could account for the fact that he can still beat the computer and get us on aircraft from time to time when that seems impossible. Over the years Gordon's mind has been a computer. It has had to be. How rarely has he taken notes but how rarely has a mistake been made? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), mentioned that Gordon Pike likes members of parliament. I have a little query about that. I would say that he has an amazing capacity to give the impression that he likes members of parliament. We will know in due course whether that is so if he puts pen to paper. </PARA>
<PARA> Concerning his sporting capacity, I think all honourable members know of his great interest in training youth and helping them in their sporting endeavours. He even had an effect on me. Very early in my life here I got involved in a cricket match against the Press. At that time we had no Tony Street as slow bowler so I was made the slow bowler for the parliamentary cricket side. Gordon Pike was the wicket keeper. History does not relate that the two of us got the late Jack Fingleton out twice in two overs. It is not for me to mention who dropped the ball and who did not succeed in stumping him at a key moment. My knowledge of Gordon goes back to that time. In all seriousness, I think the best accolade I could give Gordon Pike is that in the days when I occupied the Whip's office we never asked the Parliamentary Liaison Officer or, indeed, the Leader of the House, either Labor or Liberal, how long the session would last or when the Parliament would rise. On a day to day basis, or indeed on a month to month basis, we instead asked Gordon Pike for that information because on balance he was much more likely to be correct. We wish him well in his retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this passing parade where parliamentarians and Prime Ministers come and go it is interesting to see this exceptional tribute being paid to Gordon Pike. We have seen parliamentarians of great distinction leave the Parliament without words of admiration and congratulations conveyed in the way in which they are being conveyed here to Gordon Pike today. Of course, that is an indication of the fact that he has rendered exceptional service to this Parliament. He is known as the greatest empire builder that Parliament has ever known. That is because it is said that he has put more bums in Commonwealth cars than all the bureaucrats and fat cats since Federation. That in itself is a very great achievement. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles), said, Gordon knows everything. He knows when the parliamentary session will end, when the day's events will conclude. He knows all. He hears all and he sees all but he always has been a perfect diplomat. He never discriminates between people. He treats everyone with respect. If you like, all men count but none too much with Gordon Pike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) indicated, we have known him as a resourceful backstop, the man who has a spare razor in his pocket or a spare tie if we have a visitor who is unsuitably dressed for the precincts of parliament. He will find a member of parliament a babysitter or a hairdresser for his wife at the drop of a hat. In that sense he was the Parliament's magician over the decades. Mention has been made of his sporting prowess in hockey and cricket. It might not be known that he is an outstanding wicket keeper. His proudest boast is that he has never let a 'poli' slip through his fingers. He has been able to dig them out of the precincts, down in the dungeons, where they sleep and where they have been over-celebrating. He gets them all back to their berths in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> What I remember him best of all for is his great capacity to look after people when travelling with committees. I remember an occasion years ago when we were travelling to Maralinga to witness the explosion of an atomic bomb. We departed in the late hours of the night and Gordon was there with the coffee urn. We came back, I think at 5 o'clock in the morning, and tea and toast were made for the great contingent. I remember another occasion which we have often joked about. The Joint Committee on Public Works travelled to Manus Island and we were accommodated in the officers' mess there. The officers were not terribly keen about being displaced from their quarters by parliamentarians. Our first obligation was to meet the commanding officer at a reception. Being in the tropics, we desperately needed a shower, but they had taken all the towels from us-we had no towels to dry ourselves. Gordon, once again the resourceful backstop, was able to find the linen press. We each were equipped with a sheet to substitute for a towel. They are little things indeed, but they are certainly things that make life more tolerable for parliamentarians. We thank Gordon for his unfailing courtesies. I notice he has been talking on the side to the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). The Deputy Leader of the Opposition mentioned Gordon's interest in racing. I hope that with the aid of the Minister for Defence it will not be long before Gordon will be down there at a race meeting in Canberra, perhaps getting long odds on Pay the Purple or Wellington Lodge. Good luck to you Gordon; many years of health and happiness in the years ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The efficiency audit report of the Auditor-General on Commonwealth administration of nursing home programs is his second efficiency audit report. It is also the second such report the Expenditure Committee has examined. Nursing homes are one type of program that provide accommodation and care for the aged. Commonwealth outlays under the various Acts which relate to nursing homes were close to $300m in 1978-79, so the efficiency audit has covered a fairly important part of government expenditure. The inquiry objectives of the Committee were to assess the substantive content and quality of the efficiency audit report and examine departmental responses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In various areas of the report, such as control of fees, deficit financing, and standards of nursing homes, Audit has addressed problems and issues related to improving the efficiency of administration. Most of the suggestions are worth while and should improve the quality of departmental administration. For example , in the area of fees control which applies to private nursing homes-55 per cent of the total number of beds-Audit has identified what we perceive to be the weakest area of departmental administration. The Department of Health has appointed a consultant to advise on fees control and the Committee is of the opinion that Audit has been a catalyst, perhaps an important catalyst, in this appointment. Health has accepted the thrust of the majority of the Audit suggestions for change. It is important to note, however, that a significant number of Audit's suggestions for change have been set aside by Health as being policy matters for consideration by government. </PARA>
<PARA> Other parts of the report go beyond an examination of administrative efficiency . One particular aspect that gave Audit cause for concern was that 'a lack of an integrated approach to care of the aged appears to be leading to increasing Commonwealth financial support to high cost institutional nursing care and to a mismatch between the real care requirements of individual patients and the types of care provided'. The Audit concern with an integrated approach to care for the aged has led the Committee to discuss, without reaching any conclusions, the advantages and disadvantages of efficiency audits being extended into reviews of the effectiveness of programs. The Committee has again recognised the classic problem of distinguishing between policy and administration. Whilst examination of efficiency could lead to consideration of policy, it nevertheless believes that reviews of the effectiveness of programs are a separate and particular type of policy analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> The advantages of Audit extending its work into the review of program effectiveness are more information for the Parliament and the identification of what are termed 'big savings' in an area somewhat outside efficiency of administration. The disadvantage is the danger of the Auditor-General becoming a policy analyst. This can lead to the politicisation of his Office. For example, we find it difficult to see how auditors can comment on the quantity of policy advice public servants give Ministers without commenting on the policy itself. It also raises difficult questions of accountability: Of who is accountable to whom and for what in this expanded role of efficiency audits. It is not difficult to imagine a situation in which a Minister has to defend policy in the Parliament as a result of that policy having been questioned in an efficiency audit report. I must reiterate that in raising these issues the Committee has reached no conclusions. The Committee does however urge the Government to clarify the position of the Auditor-General in this area. It may then be appropriate that the House debate these matters after the Government's response has been made. </PARA>
<PARA> In his 1980-81 annual report, the Auditor-General estimated the net benefits of this efficiency audit at a potential of approximately $26m. This is not so. The potential is significantly below this figure, and is heavily dependent on the States' agreement on uniform funding of nursing hours. The Commonwealth has not been successful in such endeavours in the past and if these particular savings are not realised the audit will not achieve any quantifiable savings and will even result in additional costs. To sum up, when compared with the first report the second does represent an improvement in quality. Audit has made many worthwhile suggestions for change in respect of administrative efficiency. I trust the inaccurate audit figuring will be a one-off incident and I do hope that the Government and Parliament can give efficiency auditors some guidance in the discharge of the efficiency audit function. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee inquiry has been one into a complex and interesting subject. I thank the members of the sub-committee for the important contributions they have made. These members are: My Deputy, Mr Leo McLeay, Bob Brown, Harry Edwards and James Porter. I also extend my appreciation of the assistance given by the secretariat-by Dr Don Stammer, the new general adviser of the Expenditure Committee, by Mr John Howard, whom I hasten to add is not the Treasurer but who is on secondment from the Department of Finance and by Mr Malcolm Aldons, the Secretary of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-First of all, I endorse the remarks generally which have been made by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher), the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, particularly his comments about the work of the members of the Committee, the work done by Dr Stammer and the work of the Secretariat. The original report would have commended itself to members of the Parliament and the people within the community generally who are concerned about care for the aged and, in particular , the operation of nursing homes and the participation of the Commonwealth itself in the operation of nursing homes. I would commend to honourable members the report of the Expenditure Committee in connection with that efficiency audit report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have no intention of canvassing at this stage any of the matters concerning the administration of nursing homes. But I would like to make reference to a part of the Committee's report to which the honourable member for Hume has already drawn attention. I refer this section of the report to those members of the Parliament and those members of the community who may be interested in the process of efficiency auditing and its place in the whole audit continuum. There is a section of the report which is headed 'Scope of the efficiency audit report '. Although, as the honourable member for Hume has indicated, the Committee raised issues in connection with the appropriateness of the nature of investigations by the Auditor-General in connection with efficiency audit, it did not reach any conclusions. But we have pointed to some of the issues involved. The easiest definition of 'audit area' is in connection with financial auditing or compliance auditing. But as soon as one moves into the area of efficiency auditing it becomes difficult to determine an appropriate boundary between efficiency auditing and an assessment of program effectiveness. The process of efficiency auditing is intended to review the efficiency of administration and the efficiency with which, in fact, the resources available in the pursuit of any particular policy, or the implementation of any particular program, are being used. One enters a grey area along that continuum when one starts to question policy itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned, in this regard, about the capacity of the Auditor-General's Department or any other authority to determine an appropriate boundary- particularly in light of the fact that the claim is made, quite correctly, that intrusion into areas of policy is perhaps not an appropriate role for an efficiency audit. But I am concerned about the definition of 'policy'. I do not think there is any doubt, for example, that the terms of actual legislation do themselves indicate the Government's policy in the pursuit of any of its objectives or programs. Perhaps the details of a Minister's second reading speech would adequately and correctly indicate the Government's policy. But when we go further down the line I am not sure at what point matters cease to be government policy. For example, is a Cabinet decision in connection with any program which is then communicated to the department or the authority by the Minister in fact government policy to the same extent that the wording of the Act or the second reading speech statements would be? To go further, is a direction initiated by the Minister himself to his Department an indication of policy? To go further again, if an aspect of policy is determined within the Department and the Minister gives it his endorsement or approval, does that become government policy?</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, during the course of the inquiry by the Standing Committee on Expenditure there was a particular instance, the details of which I need not go into, where we were advised by the Department of Health that one of its practices was government policy. On further inquiry and investigation by the Department itself it became apparent that that was not so; that the policy had been determined within the Department many years earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that if, for example, a Minister, in applying himself to matters of detail within his Department, issues directions concerning administrative procedures those directions will be interpreted as policies of the Minister and the Government. Of course, if one were to go that far it would reduce the whole exercise to an absurdity. It would mean that, the Minister having made determinations on matters of detail and their then being accommodated by this policy area, the Auditor-General or any other authority responsible for efficiency auditing would, in effect, be precluded from investigating them as matters of administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also be concerned if at this stage, because such concerns had been expressed, the Auditor-General and his officers became too inhibited in moving further along that audit continuum. As they quite correctly have said, the big savings are to be made within perhaps that marginal area between efficiency auditing and determining program effectiveness. Again, as with the initial inquiry by the Standing Committee on Expenditure-into the efficiency audit by the Auditor-General's Office-I personally found the exercise interesting and stimulating. Quite apart from the detail concerning the nature of the efficiency audit itself-related to administration and perhaps to some aspects of policy incidentally-the particular question that needs to be resolved and to which the Chairman quite correctly has drawn attention is for the Parliament itself eventually to determine where the boundaries lie. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that I would be very concerned if undue obstacles and hurdles were to be placed in the path of the Auditor-General's Office in pursuing matters which, hopefully, would not be embarrassing to this or subsequent governments but about which the Auditor-General should perhaps quite correctly indicate some degree of concern and thus achieve what he has described as some of the more significant, or big, savings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I have been a member of the Standing Committee on Expenditure, which has dealt with both this report by the Auditor-General on the administration of the Commonwealth nursing home programs and the previous report on the property function of the Department of Administrative Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a strong advocate of efficiency audits in the lead-up to their introduction to Australia, I believe there is an urgent and continuing need to ensure the efficient administration of programs which have been implemented by the Government and the Parliament. Quite frankly, I am surprised that efficiency audits were not under taken much earlier and I do not just mean years ago but rather decades ago. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear to me that, from time to time, the running of Commonwealth programs ought to be reviewed by an outside body to ensure that they are being efficiently administered. The process is used a great deal in the private sector . There is no reason why it should not be used in the public sector. I do not want to deal with the details of this report, as they are clearly set out for all to read. However, I would like to make a couple of general comments about, firstly the role of the departments which are under investigation and the role of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> So far, the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of Health have given evidence to the Expenditure Committee in relation to the findings of the efficiency audits which have been undertaken within their Departments. When they were giving their evidence it became clear to me that they believed one of their major roles was to protect the Department and, as such, they were extremely reticent to acknowledge examples of inefficiency which were thrown up by the Auditor. Often they would claim that audit-suggested changes were, in fact, in the pipleline before Audit made them. On occasions it was necessary for us to drag out of the Departments the fact that Audit had made a useful contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I can understand departmental officers being protective of the administration of programs within their area, I believe it would be helpful for administrators to have a more open mind to suggestions for change which lead to greater efficiency in their departments. Both Departments accepted that the efficiency audit was useful. Indeed, the Department of Administrative Services had invited the efficiency auditors in when the Department was reviewing the administration of the property function. Therefore, some of the suggested changes may have already been considered by the Department, however, there still seems to be a reticence to acknowledge shortcomings in the administration. This reticence was probably more noticeable in the case of the Department of Health which has appointed a consultant to consider the implementation of many of Audit 's suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the role of the Auditor, this latest report makes it clear, as is evidenced in our report, that he is indeed fallible. However, I do not believe that this detracts from the thrust of his role as an efficiency auditor. The efficiency audit has come up with many useful initiatives in the administration of the nursing home program. Most of these are subject to consideration for implementation by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem in relation to the Auditor-General which our report raises is the question of how far he can go in reviewing the efficiency of the administration of a department without getting into a review of policy. This matter has been raised by the previous two speakers and clearly the Auditor- General must take care not to venture too far over the fine dividing line between examining the efficient administration of a program and its effectiveness. If he does so, he runs the risk of becoming involved in a political discussion which I believe he would do well to keep out of. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe this second report is an improvement on the first. I look forward to many more such reports from the Auditor-General so that we, the Parliament, can be satisfied that our programs are being efficiently administered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave -As the previous speakers have said in regard to this statement, the Standing Committee on Expenditure looked at the functions of the Auditor-General just as closely, in fact, as it looked at the report in relation to this inquiry. I would like to make a comment on two areas of the report. The first is the Department of Health's submissions both to the Auditor- General and to the Committee and the second is the area of activity of the Auditor-General himself. There is no doubt that the nursing home function of the Department of Health very much needed to be looked at. I commend to members of the House that they should read the report of the Auditor-General and the report of the Expenditure Committee on that particular function. There is no doubt that some of the changes that the Health Department made since the Auditor-General began his investigation and since the Expenditure Committee began its hearings will be beneficial. There is also quite drastic need for more changes to be made and for more accountability of that particular program. We are now looking at a program which will expend approximately $680m for this financial year; a program that has been running without much amendment for nearly 30 years. There is no doubt that some change is needed in that area in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One particular area that needs dramatic change is that of who has the right to commit people to nursing homes and who has the right to authorise extensive care benefits. Evidence was given to the Committee that the Health Department felt that as far as the nursing home function was concerned, there should be no interference by government doctors in value judgments on other doctors' professional feelings. I think that this is quite a mistake when we consider the large sums of money being expended in this program. No one would suggest that any doctor should certify a person for an invalid pension and not have that decision reviewed by a Commonwealth doctor; no one would suggest that any doctor should certify a Commonwealth public servant as unfit for work and fit for retirement without that person being checked by a Commonwealth medical officer; and no one would suggest that a local general practitioner should certify that a Commonwealth public servant should be paid worker's compensation without a test being carried out by a Commonwealth doctor. </PARA>
<PARA> We find the nursing home function is the only area of Commonwealth responsibility in which the Commonwealth's own servants do not cast a professional opinion upon the professional opinion of their medical colleagues. When such huge amounts of money are involved, I think that the Commonwealth's expenditure is being too loosely organised in this area. I see no reason why Commonwealth Department of Health doctors should not make a professional judgment on other doctors in the nursing home area as they do in all other areas where doctors make submissions to the Government on behalf of their patients. I think that is an area of which the Health Department and the Government should take particular note. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area I would like to commend to the House for investigation is the accountability of the Auditor-General himself. In this particular inquiry the Auditor-General has extended his inquiries into the areas that he has said are areas that could be classified as policy areas rather than administrative areas. There is no doubt that in the conduct of efficiency audits the line between policy and administration must be very carefully drawn indeed and the Auditor- General has a great responsibility to ensure that his people make these investigations correctly and properly. The interesting thing is that the Parliament cannot choose the Auditor-General because once he is appointed he is really appointed for life. I doubt whether anyone would be able to get a vote of both Houses of Parliament to remove the gentleman. We do not have a chance to choose who the Auditor is and I think he should be careful about the inquiries he makes when conducting efficiency audits. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the Auditor-General's report the Expenditure Committee took the decision to examine the substantive quality of the efficiency audit report because it believed that such audits were necessary. But I would not like to see in Australia what has happened in Canada, where the Auditor-General has got somewhat out of control. In Canada the Auditor-General is said to have a new de facto power to certify policy or the substance of expenditure decisions in addition to the traditional comment on the probity of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises several important issues for this Parliament as well as for the Government to look at. One of those important issues is who or what controls the office of the Auditor-General in his quest to bring the Government to account. I think the accusation made against the former Canadian Auditor-General was that he wanted to entrench the program evaluation function at all levels of government so as to push big government into becoming small government. Whilst that might be attractive to many members on both sides of the House, the Canadian Auditor-General has not shown that that in fact has occurred. This Government has not been able to do that with efficiency audits, either. We must take quite a close look as the Auditor-General moves out of his traditional area and into a new field of activity. We should ensure that an officer who is a statutory office holder does not start to exercise more power than this Parliament exercises and make sure, in particular, that he does not attempt to exercise some of the authority that this Parliament should be exercising. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The terms of the matter of public importance proposed by the Opposition are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The urgent need for the Government to oversee diamond marketing and pricing arrangements in order to protect the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Most members of the House would agree that very few countries are blessed with natural resources in the way in which Australia is. The resource that we are speaking of in this case-that is, the Ashton joint venture resource at Argyle in Western Australia-is unique in terms of its size. Of course, it is part of a larger diamond bearing area in which another substantial diamond pipe has been identified, at what will be called Ellendale. So far as we know the Australian Government expressed no preference nor proposed any option for the marketing arrangements for diamonds. So far as we are aware no study has been undertaken as to whether De Beers or any other marketer should be utilised in the service of marketing Australian diamonds. The Government has never raised the matter in a public way and the only attitude expressed at Commonwealth level has been by the Opposition. This is despite the fact that it was well known that marketing arrangements and options were being considered by the companies involved. </PARA>
<PARA> While the States have the undoubted responsibility for mining developments, the Commonwealth has clear responsibilities in respect of trade and trading arrangements. One has the distinct impression that the first the Commonwealth heard of any proposed marketing arrangements was when Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd revealed the parameters of its proposed arrangement with De Beers to the Government last week. That is hardly the attitude that should prevail from a government looking for national development from the resources sector. Frankly, without the concern expressed by the Opposition, one could speculate about the climate within which these arrangements have been negotiated. Certainly the Central Selling Organisation of De Beers felt there was no pressure for any exception to be made in its trading arrangements with Australia emanating from the Australian Government. If it were not for the Opposition and the media pursuing this matter, the Australian public would be none the wiser of the real potential of Argyle nor of the issues involved in the marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the question put by me to the Minister for Trade and Resources ( Mr Anthony) on Tuesday last week, was the first indication by the Government that it was concerned with aspects of the pricing arrangements. This is at least heartening, given the previous indications by the Minister that he regarded this as a purely commercial matter and not one for any Commonwealth Government involvement. I know that the Department of Trade and Resources is doing its best to be in a position to provide the Government with valuable advice on the issue of diamond marketing. But no department can really be in a sound position to proffer advice if the Government does not encourage or permit it to gather intelligence. At this stage the Department has no diamond valuing expertise. This is not a criticism because there has been no previous requirement for this expertise to be developed. But there is now and there has been in reality for about 12 months. So it is becoming critical that the Government has this capacity in respect of pricing questions which are the central issue in any marketing strategy for minerals and which, of course, in respect of valuations and pricing, is the critical issue in the Argyle development strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Bulletin of 2 March an article was published by Trevor Sykes about De Beers and the marketing of Ashton diamonds. On page 92 he states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Botswana and Namibian Governments have appointed diamond experts, usually members of the Diamond Producers Association, to check and, where necessary, query CSO valuation of diamonds. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>it takes a minimum of three years to train a sorter to a level where he or she can be considered experienced. Some take less time, and if Australia is to sort its own diamonds and thereby derive the benefits of the added value, it should begin training sorters now and in large numbers. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, on those two counts there are, in the case of those two governments mentioned in Mr Sykes article, indications that diamond experts have been appointed for the purpose of CSO valuations. He points to the fact that without trained sorters in Australia, we would probably need to rely upon CSO sorters. Earlier in the article he says, and there is not much news in this but I suppose it is worth repeating, that there are 5,000 categories into which diamonds are sorted by size, shape, quality and colour, et cetera. So there is obviously a pressing requirement upon the Government to see that there is a level of competence in sorting and that there is a level of competence, in particular, to protect the revenue in respect of this question of pricing. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issue gets back to pricing and valuations, and the Government's capacity to have an effect upon them. Last week Conzinc Riotinto of Australia announced this arrangement with De Beers and mentioned that an average price it would expect for its produce would be around $US9 per carat. I have said, and I will say again, that the Opposition finds this figure very low. CRA backed its claims yesterday with a statement indicating the valuations of a number of other independent valuers who do support its claim. The point was made by another person interested in the trade that some of the people who value the diamonds are customers or potential customers. The valuations also depend upon whether they come from a firm of industrial valuers, who tend to undervalue gem grade stones because they are not certain what they are looking at, or gem grade valuers who tend to regard industrial diamonds as rubbish. While one could be impressed by the fact that a number of other valuers seem to substantiate these figures, I think one would need to check on exactly who values them. It has been said that if any substantial firm in the world which is competent in the valuation of either gem or industrial diamonds were to attempt to assist the Ashton joint venture or to lend its prestigious name to valuations, it would have its sites removed by De Beers. Quite obviously these people will not be involved in this calculation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question is that of Endeavour Resources and Northern Mining Corporation. Northern Mining, of course, owns 5 per cent of this joint venture. It is no news to honourable members that Northern Mining is being taken over by Endeavour Resources. Endeavour Resources is owned by Alan Bond. I think it would also be no news to honourable members of this House that the price which the Bond Corporation is offering to Northern Mining tends to substantiate the claim that it believes that this project will produce much higher profits and that the diamond values will be much higher than does CRA or Ashton Mining. In fact, it is common knowledge that Northern Mining and Endeavour Resources believe the average price per carat to be somewhere around $18 to $20 which is about double what CRA believes. They are putting their money where their mouths are. They are offering a price for the shares in Northern Mining which substantiates their belief in the value of the product. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question involves the type of contract involved. At first indication it would appear that De Beers would offer what is virtually a fixed price contract for a certain period with a standard set of diamonds as the grades. As Sykes pointed out in the Bulletin yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA> Prices paid by the CSO are also guaranteed, against a master sample of the diamonds from the producer's mine. The producer's interest is guarded by an independent expert or experts which he appoints as virtual auditors of CSO valuations. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is a sort of fixed price. There is some movement within those prices. There is a standard set of diamonds with which to compare other products and prices are paid accordingly. But we find out now, after the Opposition has pressed this issue, particularly in the media, that CRA is now saying that it will be paid prices commensurate with London prices at the time of production, which would seem to me to be a departure from the normal style of a De Beers' contract. </PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of indicating some concern about the values, I have done some simple calculations, a copy of which I will make available to the Deputy Prime Minister so that his Department may analyse them. Let us take a 100 carat sample and use CRA's $US9 figure. That would be $900 for the packet of 100. If we deduct the commission of 7 per cent, it equals $63, and the figure comes back to $8.37. Then we take away CRA's estimate-not anybody else's-of 10 per cent gem grade stones, which would be 10 carats out of the 100. At CRA and De Beers' price of $50 per carat-and one would deduct from that $500 for the gems-that would leave a balance of $337. If we take the boart out, the industrial grit-17 per cent at $150 a carat-that would amount to $26 which leaves a balance of $311 . There are 73 industrial stones left which, when we divide 73 into 311, brings up an average price per carat of $4.26 for the industrial stones. </PARA>
<PARA> I have just had a price comparison from Henry Polak Diamond Corporation of West 48th Street, New York, a large diamond marketing firm in the United States which specialises in industrial diamonds. Let us look at the prices it is charging on its official price list for the various industrial stones: hardness testers, $ 115 to $130 a carat; die- stones, $80 to $225 a carat; maccle, $10 to $130 a carat; emery wheel dressers for  1/2 carat, $5.50 to $165 a carat; emery wheel dressers for 1 carat, $6 to $190 a carat; emery wheel dressers for 2 carats, $8 to $230 a carat; tool stones, $10 to $45 a carat; and drilling material $8.50 to $45 a carat. Even if one deducts 40 per cent from that price for an ex-mine price-in other words, allowing 40 per cent of profit between the ex-mine price and the wholesale price-there is no price, barring the poorest of the dresser stones, the things that are called congo cubes, the lowest-priced dresser stones , which gets anywhere near the residual price that I indicated of $4.26 per carat, after one does that calculation. The other important point about it is this: That is at CRA's $50 price per carat. If that happened to be wrong-and many believe it is, because we think the gem grade stones are being underrated- if that happened to be $100 per carat, that would mean that all the industrials went to De Beers for virtually nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth repeating that across the 49 million carats of production of diamonds in the world last year, the average price was $265 per carat, and yet the average price according to this arrangement will be only $9. It may well be, after analysis, that that figure is correct. We are quite prepared to see that. But the Government should be in a position to be able to establish that. If we reach a position in which diamonds are sold on the London exchange at prices at the time, the rest would become to some extent a calculation of the potential of the project. But I think the expectations about Ashton are being lowered. I am not sure whether they are being reasonably lowered. I think the Government must be in a position-bearing in mind that it has this responsibility for its own revenue and for exports-to take this sort of information aboard. </PARA>
<PARA> The gem grade diamonds of course will all go to De Beers. Under the arrangement 75 per cent will be sold through De Beers, and 25 per cent will be marketed by Australia. I cannot see why, if De Beers was prepared to make that concession to CRA and the other joint venturers, it was not 25 per cent through the whole run of mine production. De Beers says that the quantities or values of the gem grade stones are too small. If that is the case, why does De Beers worry about that? Why does it not let CRA and the joint venturers market 25 per cent of the lot? At least then we would be in a position to get some sort of price comparisons with what will be paid by De Beers. As well, Northern Mining, as a joint venturer, is likely to take its 5 per cent of the run of mine produce, and sell it independently. In fact, Endeavour Resources is in Japan now with that in mind . That would also give us some independent measurement. </PARA>
<PARA> I seriously put it to the Deputy Prime Minister that he should give his Department encouragement to be able to offer the Government good advice on diamond marketing, that there should be close government scrutiny of the marketing strategy, and that the Government itself should undertake, with valuers appointed by itself or taken from within the Department or developed within the Department, competent valuations of the Argyle deposit in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assertion made in the matter of public importance raised by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) is that the Commonwealth Government is not sufficiently interested in ensuring that the public interest is being protected in regard to the development and sale of diamonds from the potential Argyle mine. I hoped that I might have corrected that feeling of the honourable member by the answer I gave to a question from him on Tuesday, when I assured him that we were concerned about the whole question of valuation, which I think is the key point as to whether the public interest is being sufficiently protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Up to this point in time there have been assertions made as to the value of the diamonds. It is very difficult for anybody to know accurately just what those valuations are. No actual sales have been made from the mine to this point of time. Some packages of diamonds have been presented for valuation and it is on those valuations that there seems to be some conjecture at present. But I was interested to read in the paper today some comments by Conzinc Riotinto of Australia refuting some of the allegations made that it has been undervaluing the diamonds which have been valued at this point in time. I should like to come to that question a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think there is any difference of opinion in the House that there is a very keen desire to see the Argyle mine developed. It is obviously a diamond mine of great significance and it will be of importance to the general mining and resource developments of this country. For Western Australia it has great significance. I visited the Argyle mine only a week or so ago. It struck me what an impact it will make for regional development in the north-west of Western Australia. This is a very remote area of Australia, particularly where the diamonds have been found. The whole of the Ord River area and Kununurra has been plagued in its development because of its remoteness and costs of transportation into the area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle that it might have been before its time, but from what I saw the other day, there are good prospects that the agro-economics of the area are changing and could be quite satisfactory. But if a mine is developed-and it will be a substantial mine-the community of Kununurra will increase very substantially and make a large settlement. I think from that settlement we will see all sorts of development taking place in that part of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ashton joint venturers started as a consortium of five companies that got together in 1972, and it was in 1976 that CRA bought into that consortium. I think it is fair enough to say that it was their exploration techniques that led to the discovery of diamonds at Ellendale on the Fitzroy River and now at Upper Smoky Creek and what is known as AK1, which is the kimberlite pipe. The kimberlite pipe was discovered only two years ago. It is hoped that mining will start this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Very few people realise the tremendous costs involved in the exploration for and the evaluation of diamonds. De Beers people had been across this country scanning it for diamonds previously and had not discovered them in economic quantities. It was really CRA that was successful in assessing it as a commercial diamond mine of some significance. When in full production it will have a capacity to reach about 20 million carats a year, which is about 40 per cent of world production, so that will have a profound impact on the diamond market around the world. But the success of this venture will basically depend upon the marketing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The marketing of diamonds is a complex matter. It has largely been managed-and I say 'managed' in a cartel term-by the Central Selling Organisation of De Beers , which has promoted diamonds as something of value and has also promoted their worth as an industrial product. By managing the supply on to the market and also being largely in control of the production of synthetic diamonds, it has been able to maintain stability in prices around the world. There have been one or two countries, such as Zaire, which have tried to sell independently of the CSO, only to find that they run into considerable difficulty. For many years the Soviet Union used De Beers for selling most of its gemstones. Although it uses an independent organisation for selling now, I am told that independent organisation is closely linked with the De Beers organisation. So it sees the value in working co-operatively to sell diamonds to ensure that the best price is obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> If this mine is to be developed to its full potential, the first stage being $ 300m and the second stage being in excess of $500m, the developers will have to get a degree of bankability to be able to borrow the moneys for the development of the mine. That means undertaking arrangements with people who can give an assurance that they can market the diamonds. To the best of my understanding there is nobody around the world who can handle the quantity of diamonds involved in the immediate future other than CSO. I think the question that the honourable member for Blaxland has brought forward as to whether we will get proper value for these diamonds is quite a correct one. I informed the honourable member in an answer to a question asked the other day that I believe the arrangements that are now falling into place-I say falling into place because they have to be developed, and they are being developed, between the Commonwealth, the Western Australian Government and the company-will ensure that there will be a number of checks and counterchecks to ensure that the proper values are being obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> All diamonds will have to be sorted in Western Australia. That is a requirement of the Western Australian Government under its mining lease arrangements. It also requires that unless a gem processing industry is developed in Western Australia certain additional penalties will be imposed. I think we have to acknowledge that Western Australia has certainly done its utmost to see that Western Australia's interests are protected, in which case the national interest is being protected. It is concerned not only to have the industry in Western Australia but also to obtain the best revenue it can from the development of these diamonds. The royalty arrangement with Western Australia is that it will obtain 7 1/2 per cent of the free-on-board price of the diamonds or 22 1/2 per cent of the profits of the mine, whichever is the greater. I think it is anybody 's guess at this point in time as to which will be the greater. But certainly Western Australia would be falling down on its job if it did not ensure that it will get the proper and best value for the diamonds that will be sold from that State. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the honourable member that the commercial mining has not started. The project is still in the evaluation stage and only packets of diamonds have been prepared. What CRA has done in the initial stage-again, this is what I have been informed-is to give a package of diamonds to the Central Selling Organisation for it to give an assessment of their value. The package is a sample of the mixture of diamonds-the cheap gem, the industrial diamonds and the boarts that come out of the mine. An evaluation has been done of that package of diamonds. That package-it could be a similar package; I am not sure on that point-has been given to four other independent valuers around the world for assessment. CRA has also given that package or a similar package to the Northern Mining organisation and Northern Mining has sought four independent valuations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of all of those valuations seven are very much in line with the valuations made by an AJV valuer. The only one which is at variance is the one given to Mr Albert Joris for evaluation. Up to this point in time seven of the people have given valuations which are very similar to the valuations given by the AJV valuer. To ensure that the Commonwealth undertakes its responsibility of protecting the national interest I informed the honourable member for Blaxland the other day that I see it as being necessary, even though the company will have its own independent valuer watching all the time and even though Western Australia will have valuers permanently within the sorting house, for the Commonwealth periodically to do spot checks of the valuation of diamonds to ensure that everything is taking place in a proper manner. I think that with the two governments and the company involved in these valuations we should get an accurate assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to emphasise that the problem still lies ahead. It is early days. It is a major mining operation. In the first stage something like 2 1/2 million tonnes of material a year will be moved. When one realises that the diamonds make up about one part in one hundred million parts one can see that it is a tremendous separation job to extract these diamonds and a costly job in the first place. That is why the exploration and the evaluation was such a costly business. Up to this point in time $60m has been spent on deciding whether it is worth while going ahead with the project. But we know from the initial valuations that the diamonds from this mine are basically industrial diamonds. Something like 10 per cent of them will be gemstones of reasonable quality. But 60 per cent to 70 per cent will fall into the boart, grit, industrial diamonds category. The price for those will have to relate very closely to the price of synthetic diamonds, which are produced for something like $1.50 a carat. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of gem diamonds also has to be examined. The price can be influenced by the colour, size and texture of the stones. All of these things come into consideration. Certainly on the initial valuations it looks as though the value per carat by comparison with the world value for diamonds is low. Whilst there is some minor variation-a dollar or two-in all the valuations, there is certainly not a major variation. I think it is important that we be able to sell these diamonds and that this great mining project proceeds. I give an assurance to the House that my Department will be doing its utmost, firstly, to give encouragement to the project and, secondly, to ensure that the public interest is looked after. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Subject to negotiations of details the Government has decided that Australia is to purchase the aircraft carrier HMS Invincible from the United Kingdom to replace HMAS Melbourne.The plan is to take delivery of the ship in late 1983. On commissioning into the Royal Australian Navy, the ship will be renamed. The purchase price of the Invincible is #175m sterling, which at the August 1981 exchange rate was $285m. This was quoted as a firm price not subject to escalation. The total project costs, including provision for spares, test and training equipment, necessary modifications and other support, but excluding missiles, is estimated at $478m at August 1981 prices and exchange rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The acquisition of this ship will enhance our manifest capability to deter aggression in our neighbouring regions in the decades ahead. Air power is fundamental to maritime operations. This can be provided by either, or both, shore-based and sea-borne aircraft. The value of shore-based aircraft to Australia's maritime defence will remain of particular importance for as far ahead as one can see. The carrier will provide the Government of the day with additional options, particularly in areas further from our shores and remote from our military airfields. The importance of this cannot be over-emphasised for a country like Australia surrounded on three sides by vast oceans, and dependent for its very livelihood upon trade carried in ships. There is no single scenario or contingency for which this ship is being acquired. In fact our Defence Force as a whole is not structured to meet one particular threat. There is a wide variety of circumstances which could occur during the lifetime of this ship. Our manifest ability to deter threats from developing into a conflict, and, if necessary, our ability to win out in a conflict, if it were to result, must remain of prime importance to Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of Australia's being able to stand on its own feet and fend for itself in regional defence matters has been emphasised and generally accepted for some years now. There is nothing singular about this. It does, however, involve a heavier burden than earlier policies such as forward defence. The Government freely acknowledges this and believes it is a burden which we must be prepared to pay in this very unsettled world. The decision concerning this ship follows the decision taken in 1980, and announced by me in this House at the time, to acquire a purpose-built ship to replace HMAS Melbourne. I also announced that contracts would be let for funded studies of three designs-the Sea Control ship, the Italian Garibaldi class helicopter carrier and a variant of the United States Iwo Jima class. The Invincible class design was not selected for further study because of its relatively high cost. However, following a British decision last year to retain only two of three Invincible class ships for the Royal Navy, the British Government offered HMS Invincible to Australia at a lower, and more than competitive, price. </PARA>
<PARA> The early availability of HMS Invincible will also allow the refit of HMAS Melbourne, scheduled for 1982-83, to be cancelled. The Melbourne will be paid off as soon as practicable to save refit and running costs. This will also enable retraining for the new ship's company. The acquisition of a purpose- designed ship provides a basis upon which to retain and further develop a core of skills which could be used in response to an emergency or a contingency; it provides both flexibility for response and a basis for expansion. Later options for expansion would not be confined to the acquisition of purpose-designed carriers, but could include the conversion of merchant ships for limited roles. This was done with good results in World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> The acquisition of the Invincible should not be seen merely as a replacement for Melbourne. The Invincible is a very modern ship with a wide range of capabilities quite beyond those now available to us. Firstly, the ship is particularly suited to operating and maintaining large anti-submarine helicopters. Investigations have shown that to counter a submarine threat a combination of weapon platforms is necessary. This combination includes land- based maritime aircraft, ASW helicopters and warships. There is no simple solution. While one or two anti-submarine helicopters can operate from a specialised destroyer, examinations have shown it is more cost effective to group a number of helicopters together in a larger ship with centralised command and control, maintenance and support facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is a need for a ship capable of planning, commanding and co- ordinating operations by a group of ships and aircraft. Melbourne is no longer adequate for this task and other ships lack the means. About 25 personnel will require living and working space for planning and control with extra communications and dedicated command displays. Thirdly, the ship has the capacity to carry for a short period a Royal Marine commando-the equivalent of an Australian battalion group. This could be a very useful adjunct to our amphibious ship, HMAS Tobruk. Further, the ship is capable of operating short take-off and vertical landing aircraft of the Harrier type, although at present it is intended only, I repeat only, to embark ASW helicopters. The ship is fitted with a ski jump to improve the performance of Sea Harrier types, but could not operate conventional carrier aircraft. The decision of whether to acquire this type of aircraft will be made at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to some details of this ship. The complement, including the air group, of about 950 men should be at least 300 fewer than the Melbourne. The precise number depends on the composition of the air groups. The ship is driven by Olympus gas turbine engines. These are not used elsewhere in the Defence Force but will be serviced in an existing facility for maintaining Olympus industrial engines in Victoria. Unlike steam propulsion systems, a defective gas turbine engine can be changed by a ship's staff in about 48 hours. The Invincible is fitted with the Link II command data exchange system. It is fully compatible with that fitted to our guided missile destroyers, our P3C Orion aircraft and planned for our guided missile frigates. The ship is suitable for commanding an Australian task group and has already been proved in this role with United States and other Northern Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces in the Atlantic. </PARA>
<PARA> A limit of cost of $50m is to be allowed for RAN modifications. These will include adding 450 tonnes of fuel to increase the ship's operating range to meet our basic requirement. Whilst the living accommodation is of a very high standard and air-conditioned for tropical service, space, weight and power provisions exist to up-rate this accommodation within the modifications limit if tropical trials later this year should show this to be necessary. There will also be other minor changes, for example to communications equipment, to transfer some items from HMAS Melbourne and the removal of unwanted items. The question of whether or not to retain the Sea Dart area air-defence missile system will be the subject of a special study. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to lay at rest some popular misconceptions about the ship and aircraft carriers in general. The alternative of getting a ship for operating conventional carrier aircraft, such as the FA18, now on order to replace the Mirage, is not an option for us. Modern aircraft of the weight of the FA18 require a large deck with catapults and arresting gear. There is no ship available and even the smallest practicable would be far beyond our means both to acquire and man. Vulnerability is an oft quoted concern of many. I reject this. A ship of this nature normally operates as part of a group exploiting the principle of concentration of force. Such a group has an integrated and mutually supportive range of offensive and defensive systems. The precise composition would depend on the perceived threat, but in any case would be very formidable. The ship itself, being purpose-built, has a good degree of system redundancy and water-tight integrity. The design has specifically addressed minimising the effects of battle damage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often asked: is one carrier enough? In present circumstances the answer is yes. Our Defence Force must be properly balanced; one carrier is adequate for lower-level contingencies and, like the rest of our capabilities, would provide a sound basis for expansion. In a diverse maritime threat, for instance, shore- based air would be used where it could be most effective and our one carrier used further afield where its special capabilities were needed. Our Defence Force must be one coherent whole. I entirely reject the concepts sometimes espoused of all submarines or all patrol boats. Each weapon system had advantages and each its limitations. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement would be incomplete without mention of Australian industry participation. As the ship is already built, clearly opportunities are naturally restricted. However the United Kingdom Government has given an offset undertaking amounting to #Stg17.5m. Australian industry will also be given opportunities to participate in ship support work to the value of 25 per cent of orders placed. I wish to assure the House that the costs of the carrier will not be at the expense of our program for the development of the Defence Force, although it may be necessary to do some rescheduling. Taking all factors into account this almost new ship-one of a class of three-is a very cost-effective method of meeting Australia's defence needs. </PARA>
<PARA> It remains for me to express the Australian Government's appreciation of the assistance and patience shown by Her Majesty's British Government in the consideration of this considerable project. For myself I am deeply grateful to my colleague the Rt Hon. John Nott, the British Minister for Defence. Finally, may I express my personal thanks to the many officers within the Department of Defence who have worked long hours over a long period in advising on the project . I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The long running serial of the purchase of HMS Invincible has come to a rather unsatisfactory end with the statement of the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). Regrettably the Minister's statement does not contain the types of information the Parliament is entitled to expect on a purchase which has the long term consequences for defence planning that this vessel will have. I do not accept the Minister's assurances that the aircraft carrier is not vulnerable. It has no defensive mechanisms of its own in respect of skimmer-type missiles. It is incapable in the form in which we are purchasing it of defending itself against long-range bombers of the Backfire type if it were to operate, as the Minister suggests, at long range from Australian land- based airfields.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The aircraft carrier has a lack of electronic equipment and is not necessarily compatible, as is said, with aircraft and our frigates. In fact the first three FFG-class vessels do not have data linkages because they were removed at the request of the Australian Government as a cost-saving exercise. Therefore, if the data linkage on the Invincible is adequate that certainly does not make it compatible with vessels which do not have adequate data linkages. I would question the adequacy because of statements which have been made that the British Navy was forced to use the Bristol, a destroyer escort vessel, in order to provide data links in exercises which were performed with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces. The carrier itself did not have these data linkages.</PARA>
<PARA> The range of the carrier is below that which the Navy set out as being required although I know it now has changed that requirement to accommodate the range of the Invincible. The cost of the aircraft carrier on a basic design factor basis is obviously cheap. But nothing is cheap if it is not what one requires. To sell a pensioner a Rolls Royce at $5,000 would not be cheap if that person could not afford to maintain that vehicle but could afford to maintain a vehicle which may have cost the same amount and is more closely allied to his needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity costs for Australian defence in the longer period and the effect on rescheduling, as the Minister has said in his very quick slipping-over of that matter, could be devastating for the overall availability of Australian defence capacity. I accept the Minister's figures because we have no other basis on which to make any assessments. The information which has been made available to this House and to the community in general is nil plus nothing. The total cost is $478m. This includes the cost of the aircraft carrier, spares, support, and some minor conversions which are mentioned in the Minister's statement. I understand that the figure does not include helicopters, the cost of which would add about $110m to $120m to the project cost. I would assume if we are buying an aircraft carrier we are intending to use it as a platform of some description as a minimum. Earlier statements indicate that at least it is intended to include helicopters. Therefore we are talking about $116m for helicopters. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be ludicrous to suggest that a carrier could carry out some of the tasks mentioned by the Minister without fixed-wing aircraft. It is necessary then to look at the availability and cost of fixed-wing aircraft. In this regard there are two potential purchases. The first is the Harrier aircraft which is available but which has a limited military capacity and certainly would not enable the carrier to defend itself in a military situation. It is not an aircraft which could operate against any land-based or carrier-based aircraft which would be likely to be in the region of its operations. The Harrier aircraft has limited range. </PARA>
<PARA> Documents indicate-this is not referred to in the Minister's statement-that it is intended to transfer HMAS Melbourne's radar units to the new carrier. Those units are of a Dutch design which I understand were quite good at the time of fitting. However, they are currently out of production and therefore they are moving into the obsolescent stage at the moment. The units have an operational limitation of a 100-mile radius which will place the radar capacity of the new vessel below that of any attack weapons system which may seek to threaten the carrier. The carrier is extremely vulnerable. It is vulnerable to weapons of the harpoon missile type. It has no defences whatsoever. Although that is not stated in this ministerial statement, one would expect that at a future stage we will be told that phalanxes or similar defensive mechanisms would be fitted. That has not been included in the price. I should think that is because the price was reduced to a minimum for the purpose of selling the commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the aircraft. The American AV8B, which is in the development stage and probably is the aircraft that will be looked at, is a strike aircraft. It has about twice the capacity of the Harrier but it totally lacks radar and also would have great difficulty in providing adequate defence, given the numbers of aircraft that can be carried, the extreme vulnerability of the aircraft carrier and the carrier's lack of electronic support systems which would enable it to integrate operations. As I said earlier, its integration-its use as a command vessel, its use as a military weapons system-would depend upon support vessels being available at all times in order to provide a total capability. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister mentioned task forces. It is likely that at least three vessels will become necessary in order to provide protection for the carrier. I repeat that it has no protection of its own. If we purchased aircraft at currently estimated prices, the cost of the AV8B type would be in excess of $500m, on a project cost basis, for about a dozen aircraft, which would be the absolute minimum that could be purchased with any justification. We are really talking about a program involving a minimum of $1,000m plus if we are to have in operation a weapons system which utilises to at least some extent its full capabilities. Where does that fit into the defence budget without there being major deferrals, without damaging the program of re-equipment of the present defence forces?</PARA>
<PARA> We are already committed to a major program in respect of the F18. We have an announced program for Orion P3Cs. At this stage that program is at least subject to some doubt because of the situation of the United States of America relating to future orders for that aircraft. But assuming that program is to go through and assuming that the costs do not escalate in the manner suggested in some quarters-I know there are denials of that as well, but usually predictions of cost escalations turn out to be true-is that program to be interfered with? Is it to be subject to slippage? What is the current state of the follow-on destroyer program? Fairly obviously, it will suffer from slippage as a result of this expenditure which does not fit readily into the budgetary projections for defence expenditures. We have not been given by the Minister-unfortunately, we are not given at any stage-a projection of defence expenditure over a number of years so that we can examine what moneys are available to be expended during that period. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a vague statement. Whoever wrote it was wearing the most rosy coloured glasses one could imagine. It is designed to place at ease those who are ill at ease and to provide the minimum possible information. The carrier purchase has not been justified as a defence purchase by this statement or by any argument which has been put before this House or, to my knowledge, has been put publicly. It is in the Rolls Royce-the prestige-category. What purpose does a carrier which does not have the capacity to defend itself against land-based aircraft serve in projecting our foreign policy aims-that has to be what is meant by the Minister's statement-outside the immediate regions of Australia? Where will it be utilised and for what purpose?</PARA>

The Government has decided to go for large, spectacular items of equipment and to ignore the smaller, more essential items of equipment which our defence forces are totally lacking and which are not even in prospect. No surface-to-air missiles of any capacity exist in Australia. The only surface-to-air defence missiles are the Rapiers with which the Army is equipped. In fact, before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence the Chief of the Defence Force Staff said: 'We used to have one but I think we gave it away'. We used to have one surface-to-air missile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this day and age of precision weapons, of electronic warfare, of bombers that fly faster than fighters, where do our defences stand when not only do we not have surface-to-air missiles but also we do not have any intentions of purchasing surface-to-air missiles?

The Army's artillery is, to say the least, out of date and currently is subject to slippages of at least a further two years. In fact, it has been stated that the Citizen Military Forces will not receive new medium guns before the end of this decade. There are practically no guns which would stand up to utilisation in warfare at the moment . </PARA>
<PARA> However, the proposal to buy a carrier can sail through all the committees in the Department of Defence and all the political machinations, and we can have it acquired in a few months without any rational or reasonable explanation being given to this House. The question is: Why is that so? I think it is up to the Minister to come into this House and give us a detailed and comprehensive reason for purchasing a carrier and an indication of where it fits into our projected or anticipated defence needs. At the moment it will be an absorber of defence capacity, not an extender of defence capacity. If, as the Minister said and as we accept, Australia is responsible and must accept responsibility for its own defences, as stated in the Guam document-if we must depend on our own capabilities-this is not a purchase which meets that criterion. I quote what one of the Government members said on this matter this week. I refer to Senator MacGibbon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for the opportunity to follow the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) as he is the person whom I take to be the spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on defence matters. I say 'take to be' because he failed to repeat some of the promises made by the Labor Party about the Invincible. He failed to repeat the promises made by his leader that the Labor Party would sell this ship if it were acquired. I think the Labor Party owes it to the nation and certainly to the defence forces to state clearly once again whether it will carry out its promise to sell this ship if by some misfortune the Labor Party happens to gain office. I challenge the Labor Party to make such a statement. It was all very well to make it some time before the purchase. Let us see whether the Labor Party has the stomach to destroy Defence Force morale by repeating that promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is intriguing to hear the Labor Party lecture this Government or any other Government on the proper conduct of defence spending. This Opposition, when in government, was responsible for the reduction of defence spending as a proportion of Budget expenditure to the low level that figures available from the Parliamentary Library show. Defence spending went down to 8.5 per cent of Budget spending. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Mr BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am only too willing to table the bits of paper that the Parliamentary Library presented to me. The defence group of the research service has gone back into the figures as far as it could go. For example, in the days of the honourable member for St George as a Minister in the Labor Govenment defence spending dropped from 12.8 per cent to 12 per cent, to 10.8 per cent, to 9.1 per cent. It dropped to the abysmal level of 8.5 per cent in the Budget presented by the man who is now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). That was the record of the Labor Party in defence spending. It is a record of a party which is now lecturing us about the proper sort of equipment. It is a party, which if approval were required before any defence purchases took place, would have our Defence Force bereft of any major item of equipment. Look at Labor's record on the F18 aircraft or the F111 aircraft. If in fact this nation depended on the agreement of the Labor Party for Defence Force decisions this nation would be defenceless. The campaign of denigration of this ship that has been persisted in by the Leader of the Opposition and by the honourable member for Corio is incredible. We have heard such massively intellectual contributions to the debate as that from the Leader Opposition who said that this ship 'is no more useful than an admiral's barge'. I wonder whether the Leader of the Opposition has bothered to inform himself of the way this ship performed in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation trials. This ship performed in conjunction with American forces in a simulated war situation and achieved outstanding results. Yet all we get from the Opposition is a campaign of continual denigration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard once again from the honourable member for Corio this nonsense, these non-facts which are listed as complaints, about this ship's alleged incapacity. In fact this ship, particularly after a modest $5m worth of modifications meets all the requirements of the Royal Australian Navy that have been listed in the replacement program for HMAS Melbourne. Yet we have heard continually from the Opposition that this ship is totally inadequate in terms of range, that it is a sitting duck, that it needs a fixed-wing aircraft to be in any way effective and that almost everything is inadequate. The facts clearly demonstrate that in every particular these accusations are totally false. The ships range with the addition of a 450-tonne tank certainly is within the requirements of the Navy. Its speed is faster than the Navy's requirements. It is in fact certainly not a sitting duck, as the NATO exercise shows. It has the capacity to intercept all manner of attack on it. The significant thing that emerged from this exercise is that its Sea Dart missile system, which has been denigrated by the Opposition in this House, in fact performed so well that now, as I understand it, there is serious reconsideration of the original proposition that perhaps this system should be removed. As I understand it, the Navy is now looking very seriously at the possibility of retaining this very effective missile system. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the nature of the attack on the Invincible and the style of the comments that have been made one can see that there has been a concerted policy of denigration of this ship, of denigration of the role of the fleet air arm, of denigration of the Navy itself. I wonder what sort of comfort that kind of denigration gives to our potential enemies. I wonder what kind of support and succour that gives to the members of our Defence Force who listen to this kind of attack against the basis of the savage cuts in the defence spending as a proportion of total Budget expenditure during the period that the Labor Opposition was in power. When one puts all these factors together one genuinely wonders what is the Labor party's approach to the whole question of defence. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just put at rest some of the nonsensical propositions that have been put about this ship by the Opposition. In the first place we have heard it said that it is in fact totally inadequate and unreliable in a sense for Australian conditions. The fact is that it was designed for world-wide operations, not just for the North Sea and the North Atlantic. Since its commissioning in June 1980 the ship has been undergoing trials appropriate to any new class of ship. It has not yet undergone its tropical trials; there is no doubt about that. These trials are scheduled to take place later this year. There is no doubt that while some of the requirements, such as water temperature, of the Royal Australian Navy may be more stringent than those applying to the ship at the moment, the ship's air conditioning is likely to prove quite satisfactory to our environment . In any event, there is space and power to add increased air conditioning if necessary. The aviation facilities of Invincible are very comprehensive and are determined to be adequate for the Navy's needs. The Invincible can carry up to 22 aircraft consisting of a mix of ASW helicopters and short take-off and vertical landing aircraft. By comparison, HMAS Melbourne can accommodate 13 aircraft in a hangar with a further seven on deck. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed initial RAN modifications to be made to this ship on delivery total not more than $5m. I thin it is absolutely essential to keep reminding this House and to keep reminding this House and to keep reminding the Opposition that the continued allegations that it would cost us a fortune to convert this ship to our needs, that there would be an escalating price factor, once again repeated here today, are absolute nonsense. The proposed modifications include the installation of radar interrogation equipment which will be removed from HMAS Melbourne and which is totally adequate, despite what the honourable member for Corio has said. Let us face it, it is difficult to reply in debate to a spokesman on defence matters who repeats statements which are totally untrue, which are assertions of fact without any substantiation whatsoever and which set out to denigrate this ship and to diminish its standing in the eyes of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the other things which will be done to this ship in this $5m conversion program include the installation of aircraft navigation equipment which is to be removed from HMAS Melbourne and the removal of the submarine protection sonar which is already on the ship because, in effect, it appears that it may well give more of a lead to attackers than act as a safety device. There will be an increased fuel capacity of 450 tonnes to provide an additional 1,000 nautical mile range and there will be minor communications changes to achieve compatibility with existing RAN systems. The essential point is that after these modifications have been made there will be compatibility with the communications systems of the Australian fleet and, more importantly in terms of joint exercises, with the American fleet whenever we are involved in such exercises or in effect in a wartime situation if the Americans are our allies.</PARA>
<PARA> It is nonsense for the honourable member for Corio to repeat the allegation that this ship needs another destroyer or frigate travelling alongside to translate her messages for her. That is absolute and arrant nonsense. It is clearly evident that the systems in the ship, when it is the lead ship in the Australian Navy, will be adequate to cope totally with communications within our Navy and, in fact, with the American Navy. That is provided for by the adjustments and modifications to which the $5m figure refers. Invincible has some excellent warship qualities which would not have been available in alternative ship designs under consideration as a replacement for HMAS Melbourne . These include extremely flexible and versatile propulsion and electrical generating systems, a high level of automation, special communication facilities , a very effective degaussing system and a citadel for gas tight and nuclear fall-out protection. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to escalating costs, there is no doubt that, when one orders a ship or a plane from a builder, one runs the risk of incurring escalating costs. Honourable members of this House know that. They have seen it occur on many occasions, but to put up that Aunt Sally among all the others that the honourable member for Corio put up is absolutely nonsensical in this situation. The ship has been built. It is at sea. It has proven itself in North Atlantic Treaty Organisation exercises as an effective war machine. We know the sail-away price. It is #Stg175m. It cannot be increased. This ship will cost only about the same as a destroyer. The other costs involved, which lift its total price in Australian dollar terms to about $480m are related basically to expenditures which are to be met in Australia. They relate particularly to support systems, say at HMAS Albatross where, for example, the aviation support will certainly be provided and where, I hope, there will be a requirement for additional expansion and upgrading in order to cope with the special needs of HMS Invincible. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt these other costs will be highlighted by the Opposition but elements of these principal initial project costs would include the refit and trials that the ship must go through, the purchase and manufacture of spares, the establishment of support capacity, the cost of training and the cost of assisting Australian industry in establishing capacity for support. It is vital to recognise that any analysis of the through life costs of running HMS Invincible along with the very cheap initial capital costs show that Invincible is a far cheaper acquisition than any of the alternative designs which were under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> For the benefit of Australian manufacturers who may have been concerned that the purchase of an existing ship would diminish their capacity to be involved in defence contracts, I think we should recognise and be grateful for the fact that the United Kingdom Government has accepted an offset undertaking amounting to about #Stg17,500,000 after the event of purchase. Australian industry will be offered opportunities to participate in ship support work to the value of 25 per cent of orders placed pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. </PARA>
<PARA> The key point about this ship is that currently it is in Royal Navy service. Her characteristics and performance are known to be outstandingly successful. For any member to come into this House and denigrate the ship when it is evident that her performance has been so outstanding is to set out upon a course which denigrates, I believe, the capacity of our service to operate her effectively. This is an outstanding ship and has been proved to be so. The campaign of denigration by the Opposition is, I believe, a disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, we are discussing a very large acquisition for the Navy, a quite expensive undertaking. Therefore, there seems to be some appropriateness in having just heard from the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume), one of the great parliamentary windjammers of our time. What is clear for those of us here who have some interest in, and certainly some knowledge of, the subject of defence, is that the honourable member for Macarthur's knowledge and interest in that subject is exclusively related to the defence of the electorate of Macarthur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of his contribution to the debate-I am in a rather generous frame of mind today-he claimed that Invincible had proved its capacity for worldwide operations and had met all trials. That is nonsense and the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) nails that nonsense because in his statement he pointed out, among other things, that the vessel had yet to undertake its tropic trials. The honourable member lauds the capacity of the Dart missile. The Minister is so confident of the Dart missile that he acknowledges that the Government might well remove it. The honourable member is not even aware that the ramp on Invincible is inadequate for operational requirements of AV-8Bs and in the event of those sorts of fixed wing aircraft being supplied to the vessel the ramp would have to be replaced at considerable cost. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the heart of the more substantial misrepresentation by the honourable member. In the course of his early comments he claimed that expenditure on capital acquisitions under the last Labor Government decreased and quoted some statistics. In the course of that observation he imputed that the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) who was one of Australia's best Defence Ministers, was responsible for that run-down. The facts are that expenditure on capital acquisition programs at any given time reflects decisions made in earlier years. Of course there was under the Labor Government a run-down of expenditure on capital acquisitions because the preceding conservative government had allowed defence orders to run down. Under the honourable member for St George, as Defence Minister, new orders as a proportion of spending, increased. There was, in fact, a substantial amount of capital equipment acquired by the Government succeeding the last Labor Government because it was ordered by the honourable member for St George and Mr Lance Barnard who preceded him in the office of Minister for Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to acquire HMS Invincible is a serious blunder. It proves that the wrong people won the argument and that Australia will get the wrong defence equipment. HMS Invincible is the 'Spruce Goose' of the Australian naval defence force. The 'Spruce Goose' was, of course, Howard Hughes's military aviation museumpiece that could never become airborne. HMS Invincible will never be adequately operational for Australian defence needs in peacetime and will be totally inappropriate and quite inadequate in the event of conflict. What this boils down to is an extravagant $2,000m-plus status symbol for the gold braid at the top of the Australian navy. They do not even comprehend the developments that have been undertaken in recent years in weapons technology at sea. If they did, they would never have fought to obtain this piece of naval equipment. Only a badly managed rich country with no real defence threat could be so blimpishly indulgent as to make this disastrous decision. It proves that war and defence are too important to be left in the hands of admirals. </PARA>
<PARA> In fiscal terms this purchase will have devastating consequences. The Fraser Government issues the orders for these items of equipment but succeeding governments will have to pay for them. They will not be conservative governments . The outlay for new capital equipment on our external account over the course of this decade will exceed $10,000m. That will occur in a decade in which there will be serious strains on the balance of payments. I forecast that in speeches in this House some two years ago. I reminded the House of this last year when the decision was made to buy the new tactical fighter aircraft and I remind the House of it again. These sorts of blindly undertaken decisions inadequately thought through either in terms of their appropriateness for the defence requirements of this nation or their implications for fiscal strain on the Australian economy will have serious consequences for Australia in the future. The Invincible does not project sea-air power. The Minister made that claim but it does not stand up in fact. One of these aircraft carriers will not be enough for the defence needs of this country. It is too vulnerable, it will tie up too much surface equipment, it is too slow and it will result in Australia losing some $70m in Australian industry programs, which should have been available for Australian industry and to provide jobs. It is a tragic decision that will stifle future defence development and which will expose the potential defence requirements of this nation-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;'Deliberate deception' says the honourable member for Macarthur, who is a master with his literary skills in this field. He is the only millionaire in the Parliament who has made his money through deceptive literary skills. At least two carriers would be required for a one coast effective force and three would be required if we were to have an effective force on both the east and west coasts. I said before that the Invincible cannot effectively project air power. The Minister's speech does not even commit the Government to having fixed wing aircraft attached to the carrier. The only available aircraft, the Sea Harrier, has strictly limited capabilities-450 nautical miles for reconnaissance , 280 nautical miles in an anti-ship role, 90 minutes in carrier air patrols and only three minutes combat capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are being sold a pig in a poke. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr Holding) referred to it as being more appropriately called HMAS Colonial Queen. One would have to be a sucker to buy something like this. The aircraft have very poor radar, covering only about 20 nautical miles. They will be totally dependent on the carrier's radar, which is apparently to come from HMAS Melbourne. It has a range of only 100 nautical miles. Many modern anti-ship missiles have a range well beyond that. I recall, from being on HMAS Melbourne not so long ago, that the radar facilities are vastly outmoded. The Harrier, therefore, is dependent on the carrier for radar, interception and guidance. It has no data link and has only very vulnerable voice communication. It has subsonic performance only. I will not go into all the details. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has already given details of these deficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA> The aircraft carrier is gravely inadequate in an operational sense for any defence requirement of this country, even in the specific role which it is supposed to fulfil. I repeat that that role is not an appropriate role for Australia's defence. It is vulnerable. Certainly it is designed to operate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation fleet in the North Atlantic but with land based air cover, with airborne early warning systems and large numbers of other naval units, none of which it will have here. Since the Navy apparently is not installing the Phalanx point defence system, it will be exposed to skimmer missiles such as Cruise missiles launched from submarines. In the 1976 Defence White Paper it was declared by the Minister for Defence that only submarines can successfully operate when local air superiority cannot be established. The Harrier cannot do that in circumstances of serious attack. To protect our long range trade routes we should rely on not one highly vulnerable, highly expensive item of equipment which, when it is sunk, will leave a very big gap in our defence capability. We should rely on the development of strategic stockpiles and the fact that most of our cargo is carried in foreign bottoms. Closer to home, submarines and land based air power is the most cost effective way of establishing our defence. In any event, the mercantile vessels which come to this country can travel well to the south and avoid the problem of hostile naval vessels, surface or sub-surface. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not been given the full facts on the cost. The full facts are that the total cost of this program will exceed $2,000m. The Harrier aircraft will exceed $700m, the carrier will cost nearly $500m, the helicopters which will have to be acquired will cost nearly $100m and there will have to be additional vessels, such as a fleet replenishment vessel, which will cost $100m. At least three to four frigates will be required at a cost of $750m to $1,000m. So, it becomes a splurge of between $2,100m and some $2,400m. </PARA>

The operating costs will be the same as those for HMAS Melbourne; that is, $14m a year. At least the Melbourne has the virtue of being clapped out. It cannot avoid the high costs of operation. An Iwo Jima carrier would operate at about $ 8m a year, a saving of some $6m or nearly 50 per cent. Where is the cost effectiveness that the Government is always rubbing in?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will tell honourable members of the options we prefer to look at. Two squadrons of Orions, at 10 to a squadron, would cost $250m a squadron. An Oberon class submarine or something similar would cost about $80m. The Germans now have a prototype which I understand is superior to the Oberon; it has more fire power , more range, more speed and fewer crewmembers. We would use corvettes of about 1,500 tonnes, with a speed of up to 30 knots an hour at a cost of $200m to $250m each, in a maritime attack role. They would have small helicopters and a full blue water capability. All that can be put together for much less than the cost of this particular aircraft carrier with the attendant commitments that are necessary. We could get two squadrons of Orions, four corvettes and 10 submarines for about $1,700m. We would then have a far more flexible, more numerous, more adaptable and certainly much less vulnerable naval force using far fewer crewmembers than is proposed now. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some figures in the Minister's speech which, frankly, have a rubbery quality about them. The Minister declared that this particular vessel has a range of some 7,000 nautical miles at a speed of 18 knots. That is rather curious because Jane's Fighting Ships points out that at 18 knots it has a range of only 5,000 nautical miles. To persuade Government members to support him, the Minister circulated a document which claimed that HMAS Melbourne at 24 knots had a maximum range of only 7,000 nautical miles. If one looks at Jane's Fighting Ships, again it is apparent that there must be some reservations as to the accuracy of those claims. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's tragedy is that its defence planning does not proceed according to a coherent doctrine. Strategic thinking is threadbare and is based on antiquated assumptions. There is no clear and consistent exposition of why extraordinarily expensive acquisition programs are undertaken; of how acquired equipment fits into a balanced defence doctrine in which phased responses to different levels of threat can be adequately met and, least of all, whether there is optimum cost effectiveness in what is being done. What is abundantly clear is that too often the defence chiefs behave as if they were out on a shopping spree, spending on the brightest and the best to keep up with the defence Jones's of the world. That is inappropriate and we reject it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1981-82 statement is a post-budget analysis of Commonwealth expenditure listed by agency, Ministry and by socio-economic objectives. Its aim is to provide a sound and comprehensive basis for analysing changes and trends, and for formulating policy. The 1981-82 statement contains research and development statistics covering four years. Direct Commonwealth funding of research and development increased from $620m in 1978-79 to $940m-projected-in 1981-82. This is about a 10 per cent increase over the four years in real terms. This significant real growth over the period has been shared over many areas. These include those concerned with energy research, funding directed towards manufacturing objectives, mining, health and agriculture. These figures, in times of severe financial constraint, demonstrate the Government's continuing commitment to research and development as an essential factor in national economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Highlights</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In the past year there have been a number of important developments in science and technology. The Department organised a successful biotechnology symposium, concentrating on the commercial applications of recombinant DNA techniques. The symposium brought together international experts and representatives of Australian business, academic and Government communities. An amended Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act took effect in July. The amended Act incorporates considerable changes and improvements, including higher ceilings for both project and commencement grants. In December, my Department released a discussion paper entitled 'The Bases for Science and Technology Policy' which examines the possible roles for Government in this field. The paper is an important step in developing a concensus on the concepts underlying science and technology policy. On another front, a Technological Change Committee has been established as a standing committee of the Australian Science and Technology Council. This was recommended by the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Private Sector Research Development</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The ratio of private sector to Government funding of research and development remains a matter of concern to the Government. In real terms, R and D expenditure by private enterprise fell by nearly 50 per cent between 1973-74 and 1976-77. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). There was a small growth of 5 per cent in real terms between 1976-77 and 1978-79. However, in the same period manpower effort devoted to research and development by private enterprise fell by 7 per cent. I might stress that these are the latest figures we have. I think later figures would show a better position.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my tabling speech for the last statement, I stated that I would like to see the level of research and development spending by private enterprise more than double in this decade. Such an effort is essential if we are to compete internationally and yet it is a modest goal by the standards of other countries, as the table shows.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As well, I look forward to the Industries Assistance Commission report into the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme. I hope the report will enhance Government understanding of the effectiveness of the Scheme and its value to the economy. In another move, I have asked my Department to examine further ways of increasing the involvement of private industry in government- sponsored research and development. A nation without innovation succumbs to deterioration and decay. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of our own capability in industrial innovation must remain a high priority. Our vitality as a nation, and our ability to respond to rapidly changing demands, depend on our success in this task. Industrial innovation represents a major path by which science and technology can contribute to Australian economic progress. It must be stressed that only those firms which have developed their own research and development capability are able to effectively assess and utilise appropriate new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia cannot rely solely on buying new technology from overseas. However, it is unreal to expect Australia to generate all its own technology. Innovation is inherently difficult to foresee. New discoveries and emerging technologies can give rise to major industries in unexpected areas. The impact of the transistor and the growth of the silicon chip industry provide a powerful example. Biotechnology is a more recent case. Although sound research and development is a necessary foundation, successful innovation also depends on other complex market factors. Awareness of the role of market forces forms the basis of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Although governments are motivated by high ideals, they are not ruled by the fundamental economic laws which guide the entrepreneur and the innovator. Industry must take the primary role in the innovation process. The Government's overall priority in encouraging innovation is to ensure an economic climate favourable to investment in research and development. Innovation and high technology policies must be viewed against the background of these macroeconomic objectives. Within this context, the Government will assist in maintaining a viable infrastructure for science and technology, including support of the free flow of technological information and skills. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's long-term industrial future lies with a combination of resource development and the establishment of industries based on appropriate high technology. Microelectronics, robotics, biotechnology, new materials and information technologies are examples. High technology industries are strong performers in the critical areas of real growth, productivity, prices and employment. A study in the United States has shown that gains in labour productivity were twice those of low technology industries. Yet these gains were not made at the expense of employment. Jobs grew at an annual rate of eight times that of low technology industries. This is an experience Australia should seek to share. </PARA>
<PARA> Biotechnology is a direct example of the potential benefits of investment in high technology. Australia conducts world class research in this field and our scientific capability is highly developed. The prospects for biotechnology are revolutionary, and I urge Australian industry to respond to this opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> These challenges are momentous. We must seek to develop effective policies in a climate of informed discussion. There has not been enough progress towards developing a community consensus on the role of science and technology in these complex social and economic issues. The Government has encouraged debate on these questions, believing that without consensus it will be difficult for Australia to meet these challenges adequately. There is a widely felt need to relate science and technology policies more closely with social, economic and industrial policies. The task is not an easy one. The science and technology statement is a key component in contributing to the basis for informed discussion on these issues. I commend the statement to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The science and technology statement for 1981-82 is accompanied by a tabling speech only half the length of the last effort of the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) on 12 May 1981. The statement, that is the printed document, is a compendium of statistics and description of science and technology activities generally carried out by government departments with useful tables of comparative expenditure. The statement covers far more than the Department of Science and Technology and its satrapies, such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the Antarctic Division. It provides details of projected high spenders for 1981-82 in research and development. Science and Technology itself, with 51 per cent; Defence with 16 per cent-money that is not well spent, to be sure, but still substantial; Education with 13 per cent, 87 per cent of it taken up by grants to universities; National Development and Energy with 6 per cent and Health with a comparatively low 5 per cent, leaving all other government departments to take up the remaining 9 per cent. Industry and Commerce spends less than 2 per cent of the total research and development vote-and it shows in our national performance in that area. Overall the printed statement is a useful , if dispiriting, handbook, with next to nothing on policy in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister's tabling speech bears virtually no relationship to the printed statement. One can understand its brevity. It has been a tough year for the Minister and his Department. The razor gang was particularly tough on the Department of Science and Technology-of 18 bodies recommended for abolition, 11 were part of Science and Technology, including its valuable work on the impact of high technology on working conditions, and its study of technology transfer. Our scientific representation in London, Paris, Washington and Tokyo has been or will shortly be removed. We are standing still on a descending escalator. True, due to a last minute reprieve by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Budget cuts were not as savage as they might have been, but CSIRO came very close to being non-viable, and that would have been a national tragedy. The Government provided no money whatever for the Australian contribution to Starlab , the orbiting optical telescope which is one of the most exciting international projects Australia was ever involved in. </PARA>
<PARA> The table the Minister incorporated in Hansard indicates that in 1978-79 Australia spent 1.04 per cent of gross domestic product on gross expenditure on research and development. In science and technology as related to industrial development, the relevant figure is that in 1978-79 we spent only 0.93 per cent of GDP on research and development in the natural sciences and related areas. This is only fractionally higher than the figure for 1976-77 of 0.92 per cent and well below the figures for 1968-69 of 1.12 per cent and for 1973-74 of 1.18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> To put the matter in perspective, Australia's total expenditure on research and development is less than that of Eastman Kodak in the United States. In 1979 there was a Commonwealth Budget allocation of $450m to research and development- only 46 per cent of it through the Department of Science and Technology-while Kodak spent $459m in that year. General Motors spends each year four times as much as Australia, and IBM three times as much.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. In research and development we are approaching the status of a Third World country, and this is accentuated, as the Minister's speech conceded, by the overwhelming control of high technology industries in Australia by foreign ownership. If research and development is carried out at head office, in the United States or Japan or Britain, there is little incentive to do basic or pure research here. In his speech on the 1980-81 statement the Minister referred repeatedly to the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme which clearly he saw as the hope of the side, and he made no reference at all to biotechnology. Now, nine months later, this is the year for biotechnological enthusiasm, with five references to it in the Minister's speech, and only one to the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is worth recalling that all the pressure to take biotechnology seriously has come from the Opposition. Let it not be forgotten that it was as recently as 31 March 1981 that a question to the Prime Minister about what the Government was doing to recognise the importance of biotechnology to Australia received the horse laugh in the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The Prime Minister shoved the question off to his deputy, who in turn passed it down the line to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) who confessed in his disarming way that he had never heard of it. I was even castigated by some newspapers for asking a question about what was to them an utterly obscure subject. No one is laughing about biotechnology now, 11 months later. The Government's achievements in this area are two-it is spending $4.5m per annum in biotechnology research and it called a three-day symposium on its economic potential at the Hyatt Kingsgate Hotel in Sydney in November 1981. That is all. There has been no provision of venture capital and no collaboration with interested parties to set up a biotechnological consortium.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the House that, by way of comparison, Canada plans to spend $483m in the next decade to establish a strong Canadian biotechnology industry. In Australia under the Fraser Government we are drifiting aimlessly. We have the potential to be a world leader in biotechnology, as the Minister well knows, but it is certain that without a Labor government this potential will disappear and the rich intellectual and economic rewards of biotechnological development will be reaped, yet again, by multinational corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Our habitual diffidence in high technology areas was illustrated over and over again at the Sydney symposium. With depressing frequency I heard these kinds of exchanges when the possibility of setting up biotechnological industries for Australia was proposed: 'Are the Americans working in this field?' 'Yes'. 'Well, if the Americans are in it there's not much point in us trying to compete', or: 'Are the Americans working in this field?' 'No'. 'Well, if the Americans aren't in it then it can't be any bloody good'! We put the Indian sign on ourselves, and either way we are inclined to say: 'There is no point going ahead'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some fundamental reasons for the low status and low priority given to science and technology by this Government. The first is the irreconcilability of the Minister's expressed aims to seek a consensus approach to the challenges of science and technology and the policies of the Government. He concedes that in his speech, saying:</PARA>
<PARA> There has not been enough progress towards developing a community consensus on the role of science and technology in these complex social and economic issues. The Government has encouraged debate on these questions, believing that without consensus it will be difficult for Australia to meet these challenges adequately . </PARA>
<PARA>Tell that to the Prime Minister. Tell it to the Treasurer (Mr Howard). Tell it to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner). And while you are at it, tell it to the marines! This is a government led by a Prime Minister who has prided himself as the man who has ended political consensus. He has been the great advocate of the anti-consensus position, and in this he has been very strongly supported by the Minister for Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point is, of course, that the Minister presides over a Department which, by its very nature, is interventionist. It cannot be anything else. One cannot have an effective Department of Science and Technology that is not interventionist. Yet the whole thrust, the whole gravamen, of the Treasury approach is that the resolution of important areas in science and technology should be left to market forces. That means that the race will be won by the swift and that Australia will have comparatively little opportunity to play any role other than a subordinate one. </PARA>
<PARA> The only worthwhile part of that miserable document by the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia, the Myers report-one of the thinnest document intellectually, although it filled four fat volumes-ever produced even by this Government, is the proposal for a social safety net as a means of protecting victims of technological displacement. It was the only part of the report specifically rejected by this Government. How is it possible to say that we ought to be seeking consensus in this area when in that area of the social safety net, which was one of the few areas where we would have very willingly contributed to the consensus, the Government said: 'No, we are going to take an anti-consensus position'? Where is the evidence of seeking consensus by this Government? I exempt the Minister from this criticism, but from the other Ministers one sees no evidence of it. Where is the climate of informed discussion that he talks about? Where is the debate that the Minister says the Government has encouraged? When was it? I must have missed it.. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know anybody on our side of the House who was aware of it and I doubt whether anyone on the Government side could name the date, place and time either . It is absurd to pretend that there has been a continuing debate in which these issues have been argued out. I must say that I think that New Zealand's Commission for the Future-I do not always admire its government without reservation-has been successful in generating public debate over the last couple of years. Indeed, so successful is it that I understand Mr Muldoon is proposing to abolish it because the organisation has turned out to be much more effective in generating fundamental questioning of issues than expected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister referred with approval to the activities of the Australian Science and Technology Council. ASTEC was a Labor innovation and I wish I could share his enthusiasm for it. While some of its very specific reports have been of considerable value, its general reports, which could have been of great assistance, have been dismal, with all the crispness and freshness of week old lettuce leaves. The paper 'Basic Research and National Objectives' contained every known cliche except 'Gentlemen will please adjust their dress before leaving'. It was recognised as a disaster even by the Department of Science and Technology. That, as insiders will know, is saying a great deal. Under Labor ASTEC will be retained as a prime advisor but its membership will be expanded and rotated-and the present formula of confining Council membership to senior academics, businessmen and graziers will be changed. If ever there was an indication that Australia is not strictly a democracy as we normally think of the term but a bucolocracy-ruled by graziers-it is in the composition of the membership of ASTEC. Both there and in the Advisory Council of the CSIRO it is always assumed that graziers have some uncanny insight into the way in which Government and science works. If we look at the representation of graziers on the front bench of the Government we would be led to the same conclusion. </PARA>

It was never viable. The technological change committee of ASTEC, set up as recommended by CITCA, is floundering already and I do not expect much from that quarter. The naivete of the advice given to the Minister is shown in his assertion that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> High technology industries are strong performers . . . in employment . . . Jobs grew at an annual rate of eight times that of low technology industry. This is an experience Australia should seek to share. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a fundamental statistical fallacy involved in that. The proposition is both technically correct and irrelevant at the same time. It is in the nature of infant industries to have high percentage rates in employment growth, even though the numbers are not great in absolute terms. In other words, starting from a zero base any kind of increase-for example, an increase of nobody doing a job to one person doing a job-is an infinite increase in employment and yet it does not mean that in absolute figures a very significant contribution has been made. A four-person firm which grows to 40 persons in two years has a 900 per cent increase and yet as a proportion of the labour force this growth is much less significant than, say a long term decline in a large firm which falls from 2,000 employees to 1,800. </PARA>
<PARA> The phenomenon in the United States of America has been that throughout the 1970s 13 million new jobs were created, mostly in low technology areas, and there was a net loss of 1.5 million jobs in manufacturing industry. There certainly was an enormous growth rate in Silicon Valley and elsewhere accompanied by a huge secular decline in employment in the old manufacturing States, such as Massachusetts and Ohio. High productivity is a synonym for labour shedding-it just means that output is high relative to total inputs, including labour. This statement is a profound disappointment. It reflects the way the Fraser Government has sabotaged the national interest in science and technology. </PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals No. 6 (1982). </PARA>
<PARA>The customs tariff proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals No. 6 (1982), which operate from tomorrow, contain tariff changes resulting from the Government's decisions on recommendations by the Industries Assistance Commission in its reports on springs and wire products, cutlery, industrial knives and hand tools. The Government has accepted the IAC recommendations contained in the report on springs and wire products except in respect of motor vehicle springs, which will be dutiable at 25 per cent and certain woven wire, horseshoe nails and certain pins for which minimum duty rates will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The minor variations from the IAC's recommendations resulted from the Government's desire not to increase rates on certain goods not produced locally and where a significant volume of trade was involved. The effect of the recommendations accepted by the Government is that rates will be phased down over two or three years for goods such as stranded wire cables, other than those used as shafting for flexible transmissions, drawing pins and iron or steel springs, other than vehicle springs. There will be immediate increases in duty rates ranging from 19 to 23 percentage points for such goods as stranded wire cables of a kind used as shafting for flexible transmissions, springs and leaves for springs and woven wire of copper. There will be immediate decreases ranging from one to 19 percentage points for such goods as needles for hand sewing, bobby pins and springs used as original components in the manufacture of vehicles. Existing duty rates will be maintained for the other goods under reference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considered that the advantages from more efficient use of resources and lower costs to users, which were expected to result from the reduction in comparatively high levels of assistance, warranted acceptance of the IAC's recommendations. The Government had noted that the IAC did not expect acceptance of its recommendations to have any adverse effects on employment or activity in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the report on cutlery, industrial knives and hand tools, the Government has accepted all the recommendations of the IAC. The effect of this decision is that the duty rates on goods such as knives, spoons, forks and ladles will be reduced by between five and 10 percentage points after two years. There will be immediate increases in duty rates ranging from one percentage point for tool-tips to nine percentage points for goods such as rock drill bits and shears. There will be immediate decreases ranging from two percentage points for such goods as scissors and scissor blades to 14 percentage points for certain tools used in agriculture, horticulture or forestry. There will be no change in duties on files and rasps, spanners, trimming knives and furnace tapping steels. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of these proposals is to introduce a moderate overall reduction in duties and to introduce uniform rates of duty on certain closely related products. Acceptance of the IAC's recommendations is expected to lead to an improved industry structure with more efficient resource utilisation and some reductions in prices to consumers. The Government's decisions in relation to razor blades and the bounties on spanners and drill bits, also covered by this report, have already been announced. A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Tobacco Charge Act (No. 1) 1955 for the following purposes: To increase the rate of charge payable on sales of Australian tobacco leaf on and after 1 March 1982 from 1.1c to 2.5c per kilogram and to enable the rate of charge to be increased or decreased by regulation. The Bill is closely linked with the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill (No. 3) which will apply the rate of charge set under this Bill to Australian tobacco leaf purchased by manufacturers or grown and used by manufacturers. It is proposed that the three Bills be treated as cognate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> At present the rate of charge paid by manufacturers is 2.2c per kilogram. The three principal Acts have, since 1955, established rates of charge to be paid by industry funds for research financed from the Tobacco Industry Trust Account established by the Tobacco Industry Act 1955. In 1965 the latter Act was amended so that part of the charges paid by growers and manufacturers could be appropriated to meet the cost of operation of the Australian Tobacco Board which was then being established. The balance of the amount collected continues to be appropriated to the Tobacco Industry Trust Account. The rates of charge were increased at the time from one halfpenny to three-fifths of a penny per pound. Since then there has been only a minor reduction effected in 1973 to 1.1c per kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of money thus provided for research has been declining as the costs of operating the Australian Tobacco Board have risen in spite of substantial economies that have been effected. In more recent years there has been a further decline because it has been necessary for marketing quotas under the tobacco stabilisation plan to be reduced. An effect of this has been that research and extension programs in the three producing States have been pruned and rationalised over a period of several years. Even so the cost of basic programs has exceeded annual income and it has been necessary to draw on reserves accumulated in previous years and the proceeds of sales of real estate and assets which were no longer essential to the scaled down programs. The stage has been reached where remaining reserves would quickly be depleted and the current programs could not be maintained unless there were an injection of additional funds. </PARA>
<PARA> With the new proposals and at present marketing quota levels the industry will contribute about $250,000 more than it has been doing. The Commonwealth is prepared to continue matching expenditure of industry funds and so will contribute a like amount. Thus it will be possible to continue the current level of research for some years to come, drawing on reserves to some extent. The question of whether the Commonwealth should contribute to tobacco research has been asked before and will no doubt arise again. One of the decisions announced on 19 December 1980 following the Government's consideration of a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare was that there would be discussions with the industry on redirection of funding for research into alternative varieties of tobacco leaf which have a less detrimental effect on health. There has been an increasing emphasis on plant breeding and on cultural practices which affect alkaloid levels in leaf. There is also some important work on resistance to insects and plant diseases to lessen dependence on the use of chemicals for control purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be expected that there will be further emphasis on these essential aspects of research. With this in mind the Government has sought the agreement of the Australian Agricultural Council to add a representative of the Department of Health to membership of the Central Tobacco Advisory Committee. That is the committee which has the responsibility for examinging research programs and recommending to me the expenditure of moneys from the Tobacco Industry Trust Account. Expenditure approved for this year, 1981-82, is $1,233,155 of which the Commonwealth is committed to contribute $348,000. The whole amount is made available to State departments responsible for agriculture in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. Additional State expenditure on tobacco research in 1981-82 is estimated at $580,000. All of the expenditure is concerned with production and curing of leaf on the farm, not with manufacturing. The increases in the charge rates from the start of the selling season have been sought by the growing and manufacturing sectors. Both are in favour of the starting date of 1 March. As far as any future changes in rates are concerned regulations will be introduced only if changes are sought by both sectors. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979 to introduce charges for overseas students who will attend accredited advanced education level courses which are funded by the Commonwealth and offered at educational institutions other than universities and colleges of advanced education, for example, at colleges of technical and further education. At present, charges are imposed only on overseas students attending prescribed courses at universities and colleges of advanced education in Australia. It is intended that the extension of the charges will be applicable at the beginning of 1983. The basis for the imposition of charges on overseas students is to recover part of the costs involved in their education in this country. These costs are being met by the Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that when the Government first introduced overseas students charges in 1979, it was emphasised that the effect of the policy would be closely monitored and reviewed. Following a review of the overseas students policy by an inter-departmental committee last year, the Government decided to extend the overseas students charges. At the same time, the Government also decided, as part of Australia's special assistance, to meet the costs of overseas students charges from 1982 for nationals of Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific countries from its aid program for the region. The aim is to encourage more students from the area to come and study in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of this special aid program is consistent wih our special relationship with and obligations towards Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific island countries by virtue of Australia's geographic location, historic ties and relative economic strength in the region. The special assistance in favour of nationals of the South Pacific countries will also cover the new charges when they come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The main clauses of the Bill are: Clause 2 inserts the definition of 'declared course' into sub-section 4 (1) of the Principal Act and amends the definition of 'prescribed course' for the purposes of the Act. Its effect is that an enrolment in a 'declared course' will be subject to a charge under section 5 of the Act. Clause 3 enables regulations to be made to declare for the purposes of imposing charges, courses offered by special educational institutions other than universities and colleges of advanced education. Clause 4 inserts a new section into the Act to provide for a charge to be imposed in relation to 'declared courses' in the year that follows the year during which the declaration with respect to those courses was made. It also containes transitional provisions to exempt continuing overseas students from the new charges. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

These two minor technical amendments to the principal Act are designed to allow more flexibility for a Commonwealth authority to pay charges on behalf of overseas students from the South Pacific region under Australia's aid programs for this region. The Bill does not affect existing provisions in the Act with respect to special arrangements with a government of an overseas country for the discharge of liability for overseas students charges.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members are aware, I was three-quarters of the way through my remarks on the Canned Fruits Marketing Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill and the Canned Fruits Levy Amendment Bill when the adjournment debate commenced last night. I shall repeat the case being put to the House by the Opposition. The Opposition is opposed to this proposed increase in levy. I think it is very difficult for the Government to argue its case. I do not think it has any facts to its credit. The Government may claim that it is not the fruit grower who will pay but the canneries, but it cannot say that because all the canneries are now co-operatives. The fruit growers will pay whichever way it goes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason for the Opposition's point of view is that in a year when the quotas are to be cut to the lowest levels ever and in a year when prices have been slashed by up to $45 a tonne the Government is expecting the fruit growers to increase their levy payment from 11c to 27c a carton, representing an increase of 150 per cent. The Australian Canned Fruits Corporation, which has not served the industry well, under this legislation will get a 35 per cent increase in its funds. Now is not the time to slug the industry. The levy should be left as it is. If the ACFC needs so much extra money the Government should pay the extra $ 280,000. The Opposition wants to help the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd ), the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks), who all have in their electorates growers who are in desperate trouble. I do not know how those honourable members can stand by the Government. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) was recently in the Riverina district. Growers supplying the Letona cannery certainly made known to him their anger, their distress and the conditions they will face. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know why the honourable members will not back their State governments. The three State governments concerned have put a lot of pressure on the Federal Government about this. The South Australian Government, for quite a range of reasons, has now had to guarantee the debts of the Riverland cannery. The Government, as I said, is putting this proposal forward as a cost to be borne by the canneries, but we must point out that in fact it will be a cost borne directly by growers because all the canneries are co-operatives: Letona, Ardmona , SPC and RFP. I guess that next week or the week after we will have increased export charges as well for the growers to deal with. That is in an industry in which exports take up to 60 per cent of production. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, the Government has no sympathy for the plight of the canning fruit industry or the fruit growers themselves. The ACFC estimates that the proposed 27c levy will be paid on 4 million basic cartons of canned deciduous fruit. If we do the calculations we find that that will take $1,080,000 from farm incomes in an already depressed income situation. The State governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia have made repeated requests for urgent Federal assistance for canning fruit growers. Here we have the Government , a Liberal-National Country Party Government, supporting a reduction in farm income. There are few employment alternatives in the areas where canning deciduous fruit is grown. The dried vine fruits and wine markets are not looking all that good. The citrus growers are awaiting an Industries Assistance Commission report on the level of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> We must recognise that the communities concerned are concentrated in regional areas and the regional implications of a further decline in their incomes are enormous. The small area farms and the large labour content in production tend to concentrate the repercussions of reduced incomes. It might be true that fruit growing represents only a small sector of the national economy-perhaps 5 per cent of the gross value of rural production, or about one per cent of rural export returns-but that is concentrated in the irrigation areas, mainly areas in the Murray basin. Cutting the incomes of canning fruit growers will have an enormous impact on the surrounding areas, on the industries that feed on the canning fruit industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the conclusion that the Opposition has come to: We now have canned fruit production for which currently there are no profitable markets because this Government has failed to take seriously its responsibility for the industry in overseeing the operations of the ACFC. The Corporation's 1981 quota fixation was disastrous. Growers and State governments in three States have been seeking emergency short term assistance while long term plans are developed. The Federal Government's response, as I said, is to support a 150 per cent increase in the levy for the ACFC, representing a 35 per cent increase in income. I explained earlier in my speech that that organisation's management was part of the reason for the present state of the industry. The Corporation had the relevant information available to it and it should have anticipated the current difficulties. It should have been planning its options long before the present desperate situation was reached. </PARA>
<PARA> Some recent comments by members of the Corporation indicate that they are looking to the long term of the industry. That is to be welcomed. But, in terms of their long term look at the industry, they are saying that the number of trees will have to be reduced by one-third. If they are saying that and that there is some agreement with the industry on that, one would think that this Government would not set about to impose on the industry this proposed great increase in levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition cannot support these proposals. It believes that the levy should be retained at its current level and that the resources of the Department of Trade and Resources and the Department of Primary Industry should be used to investigate and promote alternative export markets, such as the Middle East for canned fruit and Asia for fresh fruit. The Government should supply the extra $ 280,000 that the proposed increased levy will collect. The major problem at the moment is caused by oversupply. It is unclear whether the same problems will apply to the 1983 crop. In fact, because of the industry's intake in 1982, carry -over stocks in 1983 may well be back to what the industry considers is an acceptable level, 1.5 million basic cartons. If production is at more normal levels in 1983 and markets such as the Middle East can be given some encouragement, in 1983 canneries and growers may be ready to support the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unacceptable to the Opposition to ask for more money from an industry at a time when that industry is in desperate need of Federal financial assistance. We propose that the extra marketing initiative which is needed should be provided by the Department of Trade and Resources and the Department of Primary Industry when, first of all, the ACFC has demonstrated its ability effectively to manage the marketing of Australian canned fruit and its interest in the industry by preparing an IAC submission for the next hearing scheduled for May next year. The Opposition then will be pleased to review its position of not supporting an increase in the levy for canned deciduous fruit.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by pointing out what the Labor Government did for the industry in 1973 when ex-Senator Ken Wriedt was Minister for Primary Industry. In that year the Labor Government provided $1.5m in grants to canners for revaluation assistance. We also gave emergency adjustment assistance to canning fruit growers. That emergency assistance was provided in the form of payments to canning fruit growers and those payments were made on the basis of deliveries of peaches, pears and apricots to canneries for canning in the 1972-73 season. Payments were made at the rate of $12 a tonne on up to 125 tonnes, with a maximum payment of $1,500 to a grower. Also at that time we had a tree pull scheme, which we continued. Funding by the Labor Government to rural reconstruction and rural adjustment was at a high level. The Government has now phased out the tree pull scheme and, on the other measure, funds are being cut back all the time. In 1973 the Labor Government did respond to the needs of the canning fruit industry. The current Government's response to a canning fruit crisis is to raise the levy which funds the Australian Canned Fruit Corporation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party, in its opposition to the proposed increase from 11c to 27c a carton in the levy to finance the promotional and administrative activities of the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation, puts itself in a strange and absurd position. If it were to think about the matter a little more I think it would consider its position a very unhappy one because of the ramifications it has for the whole policy in relation to rural areas. For one of two reasons the Labor Party has made the decision to oppose the proposed amendment contained in the Canned Fruits Levy Amendment Bill . The first alternative is that the Labor Party has not been in contact with the fruit industry. The grower organisations and the fruit canners who make up the canning fruit industry are in favour of the proposal. I repeat that quite clearly. They are in favour of the proposal. I checked with them on that again this morning because I was amazed to hear of the Labor Party's position on this proposal yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Canned Fruits Corporation speaks for the industry because it is made up of both the grower organisations and the canners. Therefore, its request to act has come formally from and on behalf of the industry to the Government. The Government is not trying to impose anything on the industry. I checked this again with individual leaders in the fruit growing industry. I know them all personally because most of them are in the Murray electorate. They are very much in favour of the proposed increased levy and are amazed and upset by the Labor Party's action. Either the Labor Party has acted in complete ignorance of what the fruit industry considers to be the best policy for it at the present time or , alternatively, it has contacted the industry, knows the view of the industry on this and has chosen to ignore the position of the industry. In other words, the Labor Party in opposing this legislation is indicating that it considers it knows more about the industry than the industry leaders. That is a very dangerous and arrogant position for the Labor Party to adopt. If I were a member of the Labor Party I would seriously consider my position on this matter. Either it has not bothered to contact the industry and therefore is completely ignorant of what the industry wants or it believes it knows more about the industry than the industry. That is a very dangerous position in principle for the Labor Party to be in because this will reinforce the fears of agricultural industries generally in Australia about the attitude a Labor Party in governmnent would adopt towards them: That is, that the Labor Party would consider and perhaps continue to believe-its track record appears to vindicate this point-that it knows more about the industry than the industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Labor Party is of the view that the work of the Canned Fruits Corporation and its promotional activities are to be reduced, surely it is for the industry which actually pays for these activities, not the Government, to make that decision itself. It is not for the arrogant or ignorant Labor Party to do so by manifesting that it knows better than the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) referred in his speech to an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry quite a few years ago into the fruit industry generally. He referred to the recommendation that regional development authorities, composed of drop-outs from universities and other people, should somehow or other go into these fruit growing areas that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I represent and tell these growers how they should grow fruit and generally look after themselves. That was an absurd proposal. It is one of the silliest things the IAC has ever done. I am glad to see that the IAC seems to have a bit more sense these days. But, to the credit of the Government, it did not accept that advice. However, I do support the honourable member for Werriwa in the comment he made about the need for financial assistance for fruit growers through the rural adjustment scheme. I have lobbied the industry and State Ministers for several months on the need for the canning fruit industry to be declared an industry in need of assistance, in need of adjustment, so that it can become once again eligible for rural adjustment assistance. My understanding is that the States themselves must initiate the move for the industry by stating to the Commonwealth that the industry is in that position. To my knowledge, none of the three States involved has made that request to the Commonwealth at this stage. The Commonwealth Government has to make a special allocation of finance for the canning fruit industry through the rural adjustment scheme because all of the funds provided for the scheme in the current financial year have been taken up. Obviously money is required. I hope that the Government will be making the necessary allocation to the rural adjustment scheme so that the industry can get the money it needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa, in his criticism of the Canned Fruits Corporation, referred to promotion and sales in the United Kingdom and the fact that in 1980, in spite of its promotional activities, there was a reduction in sales. When I was in London with a delegation a couple of weeks ago, along with the honourable member for Werriwa and other honourable members, I privately visited the Australian Canned Fruit (IMO) U.K. Ltd, which is responsible for the selling of Australian canned fruit in the United Kingdom, and was advised that as a result of the promotional campaign in 1981 there had been a significant increase in the sales of canned fruit from Australia to the United Kingdom. So I think I can rebut the point made by the honourable member and say that the promotional activities have been worth while in the United Kingdom. It is obvious from the actual scale of overseas markets for Australian canned fruit that the United Kingdom is still the major market and therefore is worth the promotional activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa stated as a Labor principle that somehow or other it should be unacceptable to require more money from farmers in an industry which is suffering the effects of an economic downturn. That is a new principle for the Labor Party to enunciate. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I were members of this place in 1973-74 when in the depths of the wool depression the Labor Party required that the wool growers of Australia contribute 5 per cent of their returns to a revolving fund. In other words, at a time when wool growers were going through a depressed financial period they had to contribute part of their money to support themselves, which was an added burden. </PARA>

Honourable members may also care to look at the situation in the beef market. What did the Labor Party do when the beef market collapsed? It required that the full export inspection charges for beef be imposed upon the unhappy beef producers of Australia. So much for these new principles of the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today we are debating a proposal to abolish the Australian Canned Fruit Sales Promotion Committee and a proposal to increase the canned fruits levy. The dramatic reduction in the canning fruit intake by the canneries to half of what it was last year, as the honourable member for Werriwa has pointed out, is one of the major reasons why it is necessary to increase the levy to maintain funds of the Corporation and take into account its increased promotional activities. The reduced intake and therefore the increased levy highlight the tragedy that has befallen the canning fruit industry. The incomes of fruit growers this year will be half of last year's income. I quote from a Bureau of Agricultural Economics document which was presented to an IAC hearing in Shepparton a few weeks ago. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Goulburn Valley, which is more dependent on income from canning fruit will be hardest hit with FCOS-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, farm cash operating surplus-</PARA>
<PARA>falling from $26,000 to minus $19,000, due to a combination of reduced intake plus a poor year for fresh apples and pears. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a dramatic reduction in income-from $26,000 to minus $19,000. Already one of the three canneries in the Goulburn Valley has closed and with it 121 jobs have gone. As the honourable member for Werriwa has pointed out, canneries in South Australia and New South Wales are basically bankrupt and one-third could be forced to leave the industry. These problems are additional to the earlier dramatic reduction in the industry when the United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community. At that time the industry was reduced by about one- third. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for the present tragedy are first of all, the very high valuation of the Australian dollar. The industry estimates that last year this cost it $ 10m. This is common to all agricultural exporting industries. They are losing millions and millions of dollars because of the very high valuation of the Australian dollar. The second reason is the EEC policies. In 1978 as part of the balancing act between support under the Common Agricultural Policy for northern and sourthern Europe a subsidy was introduced to encourage Italian pear growers to can their fresh pears instead of selling them on the fresh markets, which they preferred to do and for which they got more money. At the present time that subsidy amounts to almost twice the amount or growers receive in total. That has added to the reduction in the outlook for canned fruit exports. These trends were first of all hidden by the very large intake of the canneries last year and they are now exacerbated by that large intake because of the large carry over. So this season we will have a dramatic reduction. However, the problems to a certain extent have been masked this season by the fact that it is an off year for pears. The canning pear intake in the Goulburn Valley has now been completed . Basically all pears have been taken in in one form or another and in a couple of weeks we will know whether, and to what extent, there will be an excess of peaches, peaches that will not receive a home in any of the canneries. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC presently is inquiring into the short and long term problems of the canning fruit industry. It is to report by 31 March on what may be necessary for short term assistance for the 1982 season and by 31 August in respect of long term assistance. It is a tragedy that the total fruit industry was not able to reach agreement at an earlier stage. It could have been possible, six months earlier, to make the request to the Minister for an IAC hearing. The report could then have been with the Government before the present harvest and measures could have been taken earlier. It is of no use for Australian Labor Party members to be critical of the requirement for an IAC hearing prior to long term assistance being given to an industry. After all, they brought in the legislation themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has pointed out the governments of New South Wales and South Australia have provided some short term cash flow assistance to growers in their areas. Presently, the Victorian Government is considering taking similar action. I hope that an announcement will be made, if not today, in the very near future in that regard. Those State Governments have accepted their responsibility, have accepted that they too have a part to play on behalf of industries which operate in their States, in this case in the provision of short term assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that this Government act as quickly as possible at the end of March once the IAC has made its recommendations so that growers in the industry will know what assistance and policies governments will be pursuing for them in the short term, prior to the necessity to begin preparing for the next season. Those preparations would begin in about May so it is essential that the Government act quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> All sectors of the industry, in appearing before the IAC have recommended, among other things, that a tree pull scheme be implemented; they believe that it would be a good idea. I hope that, if such a scheme is accepted by the Government, it will remember some of the lessons of the last occasion and will have a scheme that is far more generous and flexible. It is incorrect to say that that tree pull scheme was a success. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also hope that the IAC would recommend some form of short term cash flow boost by government, in this case the Federal Government, to help reduce the dramatic cash flow problems from which growers are suffering, or will be within the next few months. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that there will also be a recommendation for the giving of special rural adjustment assistance, both for those who may be forced to leave the industry and for those to whom the industry offers a viable long term future but will be going through a cash flow and viability crisis in the short term. For the long term it is essential that there be an underwriting scheme for the canning fruit industry, just as there are for a range of other agricultural industries, to offer stability for the future at the new level of activity. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the Government needs to work far harder than it has done so far for the inclusion of canned fruit in the closer economic relations negotiations with New Zealand. Australia is suffering unfair competition from the European Economic Community because of the tremendous subsidies that it provides for its growers and through its high external tariff, which reduces the attractiveness of its market for our canned fruit. There are not many markets for canned fruit available around the world. Contrary to what the honourable member for Werriwa has said, I believe that the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation is doing what it can, together with our trade commissioners, to find those markets. One that is close to us is the New Zealand market. </PARA>
<PARA> The New Zealand canning fruit industry is not nearly as efficient as is Australia's. Our canned fruit sells for about two-thirds the price of New Zealand canned fruit but we are not allowed to sell it there because of the very severe restrictions imposed by the government of that country. My point is that New Zealand is applying a double standard in regard to its attitude to achieving closer economic relations. Where its industries are more efficient than ours-and certainly some are-New Zealand want open an early access to our market. Where our industries are more efficient than New Zealand's-canned fruit is a particularly good example, although we have many others also-it is not prepared to provide similar access to its markets. Therefore, one of the other measures that I believe the Government should undertake to assist the canning fruit industry in its present troubled time is to ensure that canned fruit is included in the CER negotiations to a far greater degree than is presently the case. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the penalising effect that the large levy increase, from 15c to 27c per basic carton of canned fruit, will have on fruit growers, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has indicated that the Opposition will oppose the Canned Fruits Levy Amendment Bill. Whilst it is true that the fruitgrowers in my electorate, being mainly berry and cherry growers, are not affected by this levy, the basic principles which have led to the proposed heavy increase would undoubtedly cause them concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, before I go any further I would like to answer some of the points raised by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). The first is that the Australian Labor Party does not believe that the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation's promotional activities should be curtailed. We simply believe that canning fruit growers should not be required to pay 150 per cent extra in levy at this time. We also believe that the government should pick up the $280,000 as a gesture of support for the industry while it awaits the results of the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry. I trust that the honourable member for Murray supports that proposition. The 5 per cent revolving fund for the wool industry introduced so much stability to the industry that it no longer requires any government funds to run the buffer stock scheme. The honourable member for Murray, in alluding to the Labor Party's beef policies fails to recognise that this Government still retains inspection fees in the beef industry and will do nothing to help it now that it is again in a bad economic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem in the canned fruits industry, as I see it, relates to a misjudgment in regard to marketing arrangements. Sales in 1981, as far as the Corporation was concerned, fell well below the anticipated figure for that year and, as a consequence, there has been a stock carry-over of four million basic cartons, in comparison with a carry-over of 1.9 million basic cartons in the previous year. This high stock level involves high interest rates, which have hit the industry at a time when it faces low-priced competition from the European Economic Community. It has been estimated by the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation that growers will suffer considerable trading losses. I do not accept, however, that growers should bear the burden of what amounts to an error of judgment in relation to the marketing circumstances of 1980. Both fruit processors and canned fruiters are suffering the effects of the heavy subsidisation of European processors and canners by the European Economic Community. In that regard both I and the honourable member for Murray are in full agreement. The EEC on its own admission, has very generously granted specific aid for the production of peaches, pears, d'agen prunes and cherries. The financial support granted these products is sometimes such that it amounts to reimbursing in full the amount paid by the processors to the fruit growers. It is to be hoped that the Industries Assistance Commission will take this unfair subsidisation into account when considering the provision of Government support for the industry. It is important to appreciate that, as opposed to methods used by overseas competitors, the basic principle which applies to fruiterers within Australia is to obtain a price for the grower which will provide a return on his direct costs. Any lesser return would mean that the grower would soon be out of production. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to emphasise that an important principle which must be taken into account by the IAC is that overseas fruiterers should not be able to use Australia as a convenient dumping ground. The problems which face rural industries frequently require government intervention, although members of the National Country Party and other members, on the Government side of the House, frequently deny that fact. Incidentally, they are all missing from the chamber at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy Speaker; the honourable member is sitting at the table. Contrary to misrepresentations frequently levelled at us by National Country Party members, the Australian Labor Party does have a clear understanding of the problems of the rural community. Government support and intervention is necessary to provide a measure of stabilisation in the rural industry but, as the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous) pointed out in a recent debate on the Dried Sultana Production Underwriting Bill, government intervention is also necessary in the manufacturing industry. Unfortunately, National Country Party members have two-sided Jekyll and Hyde characters. They are socialists when it comes to subsidies and concessions for the rural industry but rabid free marketeers in denying support to the manufacturing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that at this rather difficult time for the industry the Government should ensure that fruit growers are not deserted in a climate where most other producing countries are subsidised by their governments. It is clear that the industry must be involved in a restructuring process but this cannot take place overnight. A lead time is required in order to bring trees into production and the cost of expensive irrigation and fruit handling equipment has to be written off. The Government should ensure that financial assistance is provided to avoid any hardships to growers as a result of a planned reduction in bearing trees. It is estimated that the present restructuring of the industry, which has resulted in only two of the three Victorian canners continuing to produce, will mean the loss of at least 100 permanent jobs in Kyabram. There will also be a loss of about 500 jobs for seasonal workers for periods of two to three months. This considerable amount of local unemployment which has resulted from the lack of Government planning does not include the loss of fruit picking jobs for seasonal itinerant workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The responsible Ministers who can be blamed for this appalling state of affairs in the fruit industry are all members of the National Country Party. That party professes to represent the rural community but nothing is further from the truth . The National Country Party represents big business and mining interests and, by its enthusiastic support of Government policies, it is causing the impoverishment of small farmers. Victorian country voters are beginning to see the light, however, and the State elections on 3 April will see a further decline in the NCP vote. </PARA>
<PARA> Lest it be said that I am only criticising, I would like now to offer some constructive suggestions. Whilst I am not necessarily convinced that a tree pulling program is what the small growers really want, such a program will need the provision of government funds. However, assuming that such funds are provided, it will be vital to ensure that the program causes the least dislocation to the local community. The fairest method will be to allow those who wish to leave the industry to be the first to be compensated. The next step should be a priority aim of retaining the family farm, a concept to which the NCP is constantly paying lip service. Consequently, the biggest orchards should be the next to suffer production cuts. Unlike the small orchardists, they can afford to diversify resources, to absorb cutbacks in production. I would like to quote from a letter from Mr Neil Frankland, a Shepparton resident. The letter was published in the Shepparton News on 3 February. </PARA>

<PARA> Whether we like it or not, the so-called resources boom has turned Australia from a high-producing food bowl for the world and given priority to the non- labour intensive high profit forms of activities which characterises all exploitation of raw materials. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good blaming wages as Australia is rapidly sliding down the scale as far as wage levels are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, wages paid in the fruit industry and the existing conditions fall far below the accepted community standards. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, one cannot help wondering what the Minister was doing when this grave miscalculation of anticipated sales for 1980 occurred. In normal circumstances one would expect that a responsible government would have produced long term plans in relation to the canning fruit industry. However, it has to be understood that this Government is not one which believes in forward planning. It will rescue rural industries when problems arise because of the importance of the rural vote for its political survival. In the case of the canning industry the Government has no long term plans to guide the industry in its present crisis because the Government worships the false idol of the so-called free market economy. In requiring the growers to meet the financial cost of the overstocking problems arising from the upturn in the value of the Australian dollar and the competition from the European Economic Community, to which I have referred in detail, the Government is evading its own responsibilities. I support the rejection of this Bill accordingly. </PARA>

May I say right from the word go-I hope I say it kindly-that the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton) has missed the point about the structuring of rural industries in Australia. We do not aim in any way to set up a structure in which central governments, whether they be Liberal, National Country Party or Labor, will have a voice in how that industry will conduct its own affairs. Surely that is the very purpose of the statutory bodies we have set up. I do not think it is a fair judgment at all for the honourable member for La Trobe to blame the Government for a commercial error, even though I am forced to agree with the honourable member for Werriwa ( Mr Kerin) and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics when they point to the deficiences in judgment by the Australian Canning Fruit Corporation. That is so, but it is much better to have it that way than have an industry entirely structured, led and controlled by a centralised government.</PARA></TALK.START>

The fact is that this is the way the Government is elected and these industry statutory bodies are elected to try as much as possible to run their own industries with their own expertise. Quite frankly, it is absurd for anyone to say in this Parliament that any of us have more expertise in regard to canned fruit than the Australian Canning Fruit Corporation or, for that matter, than the Australian Wool Testing Authority or the Honey Board have in their respective industries. If we accept that proposition we are saying in effect that we should appoint civil servants to the Department of Primary Industry who in effect have expert knowledge not only of the industry and its makeup but also of all its merchandising judgments. That is equally absurd. Let us put that aside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sorry that the honourable member for Werriwa appears to be momentarily leaving the House because I wanted-I hope in a kindly fashion again-to refer to some of the statements he made. I think he is confusing State and Federal responsibilities. The honourable member for Werriwa knows very well the role of the Industries Assistance Commission. It was introduced by the Labor Government. It was supported by the Liberal Party and I think by the National Country Party, with some reservations. So he knows the role of the IAC, he knows the process that flows from IAC inquiries and he knows very well that within that process the Federal Government's hands are tied behind its back with regard to producing subsidies, loans or anything else until such time as the IAC has reported back. Let us carry that one stage further. If there is a role for State governments, surely that role is to pick up the unevenness between one State and another as it affects their industries. Our role as a Federal Government is to produce across the board legislation. If, then, unevenness occurs within State boundaries, State governments-if they are to justify their position in the future-must pick up some of that unevenness. Of course, this is precisely what has happened. I will not repeat the speech of the honourable member for Werriwa but he pointed out that the Leeton Cannery has received $700,000, as I understand it, followed by another $1m from the Wran Government, in two separate areas, to help it. </PARA>
<PARA> To cite a case in point from my own State of South Australia, the Tonkin Government has given $560,000 in approximately two halves, half of which is in the way of loans at 6 per cent interest and roughly $230,000 has gone to the growers. That was carried out in a situation where 80 per cent of the canning production is in Victoria, not in either Leeton or South Australia. Probably what the honourable member for Werriwa may have touched on, and I talked to him about this earlier, was far more than that. I have been told that the Tonkin Government has given guarantees to substantiate the future of the Riverland cannery to the tune of $29m. I quote that again because that is the role of State governments-to look at that uneveness and pick up what should be done as they see it. The role of this Government, and the honourable member for Werriwa knows this very well, is to wait until an IAC inquiry comes down shortly and then decide on three different alternatives. We accept the advice of the IAC, we reject it or we make up our own minds as to how the best method of rural adjustment measures, for instance, may be carried out. That is the position, and it is a course that this House knows very well should be followed. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very interested in the remarks of the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). It was certainly my impression-I say this in answer to the honourable member for Werriwa who attempted to interject a little while ago-that the industry is in favour of the second of these two Bills, that is, the Bill to increase levies on production at the farm level. Actually, the levy is taken off at the factory level, but that is beside the point. That was my impression. I was very glad to hear that somebody has done some checking today and that that is the position of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry requires that the Corporation should be able to continue its functions, one would hope with considerably more effect than it did in the last 12 months. In order for the Corporation to have its finance in place, the industry is posed with two serious problems. Firstly, the intake is down considerably, and that cuts down quantitatively on the collection of the levy; and, secondly, of course, the price, not only on the home market but more particularly on the export market, is down to blazes on that quantity of fruit. So there is a serious depletion of funds to establish the future of the Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party, as I understand it, says that the growers in the industry should not be taxed in the way that it is proposed in this second Bill, by way of levy. If that is so, what it is saying is that the Corporation should not exist. It is saying the Corporation should not function in the fields that the industry hopes that it will function in in the next year. I can only point out again that there is no way that I can seriously consider the Labor Party's rejection of this particular Bill today because it does not make sense if we regard the industry as having any sense of responsibility in this matter. If we take the view of the Labor Party, presumably we take the view that there is no responsibility in the canning fruit industry and it does not know what is best for it. That is a proposition I cannot accept. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice the honourable member for Murray said, quite rightly, that the majority of rural organisations and State departments of agriculture, I imagine he meant were pretty solid in their support for a tree pull scheme. What he says is quite so, as is obvious from the report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. In fact, if one wanted to be critical, one could say perhaps that the Bureau did not carry rural adjustment measures as far as I thought it would. It appeared to me that it concentrated its endeavours purely on tree pull. I want to make the position in my State very clear. The South Australian Department of Agriculture, and, I gather, the industry, are not in favour of tree pull. They are in favour of other methods of rural adjustment. They are not in favour of tree pull for one significant reason, and that is that over a period those who are wisest in the industry and who have had, say, fruit salad blocks, which spread the risk a bit, have tended to take out canning fruit. If the Riverland cannery is to persist, which the Tonkin Government is determined it will-it has guaranteed that it will for another two years-quite frankly we cannot afford a turn down in the amount of fruit for that cannery. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, I think can be substantiated much more fully if honourable members look at the statistics-I will not worry about putting them down because the honourable member for Werriwa also has them-that they relate to peaches. I expect other honourable members will disagree with me when I point out that the Riverland cannery in South Australia was primarily established for peach processing. I maintain that that area produces the best coloured and best quality peaches in Australia. It is by no means certain that in years to come peach production will not have some future. For that reason I support the South Australian Government very fully in its efforts to spend a lot of money on this cannery. Maybe some money may have to be found elsewhere eventually. Approximately $29m of Government guarantees have been given to that cannery. We in South Australia believe that there can be a future for peach production in particular, and only time will tell. Honourable members will remember very well the gloom and despondency only five or six years ago, which affected the Australian dried fruit industry. There were IAC reports, there were moves to rationalise the industry downwards and virtually to tear it apart. Of course, the Australian dried fruit industry has taken off. It has been one of the most profitable industries in the horticultural area. I point that out because none of us can be quite sure about the future of the canning fruit industry and in particular, I maintain, the peach section of it. </PARA>
<PARA> During my time in Parliament, if not in the time of some members of the Opposition, this Government made massive loans that became grants to co- operative canneries as a significant donation to a difficulty experienced some years ago. That difficulty, of course, was the advent of the European Economic Community. Those loans were made in an effort to meet adjustments and cash losses in that one year due to the highly protective attitude of the EEC to the canning fruit industry which historically sold its production to England and Germany-in other words, in part of Europe. So the adjustment was made. The Government's donation to help adjust really was made then but the dried fruit industry and the canned fruit industry, more than other industries in this nation, I think, have had access to some portion of the EEC market and have therefore continued to produce at a lower level; but they have continued to produce. There has not been quite the pressure on those industries to seek alternative markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Talking about alternative markets, the honourable member for Werriwa gave great hope for the Arab nations generally. If we look at some of those countries we will see the point I am trying to establish in my argument.There is some sign that in some countries there is an increase in sales, particularly of peaches. Time will tell whether the gloomy forecasts of the future of the fruit canning industry are correct or whether, like the dried fruit industry, they will prove to be incorrect. None of us really know. </PARA>
<PARA> I will finish on this note. I admire the industry leadership of the canning fruit industry which has agreed with the Government that it must continue to finance the Corporation; that without that there would not be the capacity to promote fruit for home markets or for export in future. They are hanging, with all their faith in their own industry, on to that fact. I am sorry that the Labor Party has to take this rather negative attitude to the faith that those people have in their own industry. </PARA>

It is probably two years too late and I think any reasonable survey would show that its marketing expertise has been very poor. There must, however, be some benefits from integration of marketing and management, for what is basically needed is new initiatives, not the sort of initiatives suggested by the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) . He wants to attack the minuscule New Zealand market, a country with which we already have a massive trade surplus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of the ideological hang-ups of the Government and I am very aware that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) would not sell wheat to China because he would not transgress his principles. But I do think there is an opportunity for us to look at some markets at the moment. Given the relatively short storage of canned fruit-in fact, canned anything-we are looking at a situation in which we will have a large carry-over of canned fruit. It will cost us a lot of money to store it. It may be to our advantage to look at doing a deal whereby we supply canned fruit to a market such as Poland on long term credit. I know the Government's position in relation to dealing with Poland but it could perhaps overcome its hang-ups by doing a deal with the Let Poland Live Committee being run through the auspices of the Church. It could supply the fruit to the Church, where it could be sure of distribution. In all possibility the credit of the Church is better than that of Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Canned Fruits Levy Amendment Bill, which I strongly oppose. I think the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) set out the case for the Labor Party extremely well. The honourable member for Murray says that he has massive growers' support for the scheme. That is strange. Growers in the Riverland have been contacting us continuously complaining that they cannot get their industry leaders to convene a meeting with them so that they can express their concern. Then we turn and look at the independent leadership of the Australian Canned Fruit Corporation. The Chairman is a heavy in the Liberal Party-the Treasurer of the Victorian Liberal Party. That is the sort of independent leadership that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles) was describing! The honourable member for Murray, in truth, does not talk to the industry; he talks to the hacks that form the leadership of the industry. The National Country Party hacks pervade most of the rural industries, and I might add, rural ABC and the rural Press. </PARA>
<PARA> In the House the other day, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) was criticising qangos and making snide remarks about them. I would probably share with the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) criticism of some of the qangos. I think that some of them are open to very great criticism. But the trouble with the rural industry today is not qangos. It is Liberal, it is National Country Party drongos. For an illustration of that, let us look at the decade through the 1960s and into the 1970s. Despite the obvious problems that the Common Market would be presenting, acreages in canning fruit rose quite dramatically. It is true that towards the end they tapered off, but at the end of the decade we ended up with more trees than we had at the beginning, and in some areas, such as Goulburn, the growth in acreage was quite dramatic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading of the Canned Fruits Levy Amendment Bill 1982 and the Canned Fruits Marketing Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 1982 comes at a time when the canned fruit industry finds itself facing extremely difficult times. As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon ) has stated in the second reading speech, the Australian Canned Fruit Corporation has decided to reduce canned fruit production in the 1982 season to approximately one-half of the level achieved last year. This decision is being made because of the drastic downturn in export market outlets last year and the build-up of unsold stock to record high levels. This decision was made by the Australian Canned Fruit Corporation in close consultation with grower and canning interests. That is why I was surprised to hear the Opposition speaking about how terrible it was that the Canned Fruit Corporation is making this decision, but, as I have said, it did that in close co-operation and consultation with the growers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of the reasons for a build-up in stock include the strong value of the Australian dollar and the excessively protectionist policies of the European Economic Community towards canned fruit imports, combined with generous production subsidies received by EEC canners. I know that the Minister for Primary Industry has been untiring in his efforts with the EEC on the matters relating to trade barriers, and it is imperative that these efforts continue in working towards having the EEC subsidies on their canned fruits substantially reduced. Of course, on top of the EEC and other international problems, we have the increased price of production brought about by the increased cost of labour, sugar, tinplate, labels and transport. The canned fruit industry depends heavily upon exports, and in 1979 approximately 66 per cent of sales were in export markets, but this percentage has declined markedly in the last two years. This decline in sales has in turn caused great concern not only to canneries but also to growers, some of whom are totally reliant on growing fruit for the cannery in their area. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area the Letona Co-operative Cannery situated at Leeton has been placed in the hands of an administrator, because it has been affected by the problems mentioned earlier, and canneries in other areas of Australia are in similar situations. The Riverland Fruit Producers Co-operative Cannery in South Australia is in the hands of a receiver and Ardmona Fruit Products Co-operative Ltd has announced a meagre profit of $50,000, indicating that the fruit trading portion of its operation has resulted in losses. It was therefore with a great deal of hope that growers heard of the Minister's intention to hold an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry into the canning fruit industry, with an interim report for short-term assistance being ready by 31 March and the final report being presented by 31 August. The Minister is to be complimented for the expeditious way in which the report was got under way after the industry indicated its desire to have the report undertaken. It is indicative of the Government's real concern in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent experience in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area has been that even where a farmer has diversified his crops, for example, by growing wine grapes, citrus or vegetables, along with canning fruits, he or she is running into difficulties . This season it has been estimated that only 73 per cent of the grapes available for wine making will be harvested because of a reduction in intake by the wineries, which have their own problems to overcome. At first 73 per cent sounds a reasonable figure, until one realises that this could mean 100 per cent of one grower's crop and none, or very little, of another's, dependent on the variety of grape required by the wine makers. For those combining the growing of canning fruits and wine grapes, the picture is grim. A similar problem is faced by those growing vegetables, where the markets at present are realising poor prices. To diversify to citrus is difficult because of the time a tree takes to mature, and the citrus industry itself is also presently subject to an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry on tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the announcement of the prices for peaches and pears by the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee earlier this year, where there was a reduction for peaches of $45 a tonne and pears of $40 a tonne over last season's figures, the Secretary of the Australian Canning Fruitgrowers Association, Mr Phillip Marshall, said that the reduction had not only disappointed growers but also had added weight to the argument that the Australian Canning Fruitgrowers Association had been putting to the State and Federal governments since early 1981-that the industry was in a very serious situation and required urgent assistance. Mr Marshall highlighted the fact that the canning fruit industry was one of the few agricultural export industries remaining that had not received any direct assistance to support export returns, and it was an industry that had already recognised the need for adjustment downward. If the National Country Party is associated with trends in that direction, I think it is to be complimented and not derided, as the Opposition seems to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the MIA is facing a difficult financial period because of those factors I have mentioned, and also because of the low prices expected for this year's rice crop, the resiliency of the growers will ensure that the area will survive. It was interesting to read the comments of Councillor Bill Barnhill, President of the Leeton Shire Council, who stated that he had every confidence in the town of Leeton for a number of reasons, among those being its geographical location and its high quality work force. I am sure all of the peope of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area would join with me in applying councillor Barnhill's comments to the total Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been representatives of the New South Wales Government who have been hypercritical of the Federal Government's role in the problems of the canning fruit industry. The criticism is unwarranted because we all know of this Government's concern for the industry which, as I said before, was highlighted by the swift action of the Minister for Primary Industry in having an Industries Assistance Commission inquiry take place. It can only be detrimental to the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area if these people use the problems facing the industry as another irrational and illogical means of attacking the Federal Government, as has been done recently in nearly every sphere of New South Wales and Federal government relationships. The Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area is too important for that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pleasing to see that the New South Wales Government has assisted the ailing canning fruit industry in New South Wales by injecting over the last 12 months an amount of $1.7m into the system. This is an admirable start and it is imperative that close State-Federal ties be maintained not only in the immediate future but also in the long term. This is essential if stable development is to persist in the MIA. I am pleased to say that due to the campaign launched by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and the initiative of the growers many have been able to dispose of much of their fruit on the fresh fruit markets. Although this demands a great deal of extra work it will allow many growers to overcome partly their liquidity problems, keeping in mind that a large number of growers are still owed substantial sums from previous seasons. I support these Bills because they will enable the Canned Fruits Corporation to continue to promote the sale of canned fruits and carry out those administrative operations which are so essential to the future well-being of the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Firstly, I thank the House for understanding my absence today during the debate. I understand that the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, made very solid contributions to the debate. I have been advised of that by my colleague the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) who had the pleasure of hearing those good speeches. As I understand it, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) has a plain, simple misunderstanding of what one of these Bills is about and who supports the Bill. The Australian Labor Party apparently is opposing the increase in the levy. I am not sure on what grounds it is doing this because it is normal for industries to make up their own minds about levies of this nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this case the fact is that the recommendation came to the Government from the Australian Canned Fruits Corporation and it is supported by the Australian Canners Association and the Australian Canning Fruitgrowers Association. If the Canning Fruitgrowers Association wants an increase in the growers' levy to help to promote this industry when it is in difficulty I would have thought that it is common sense for the Government to agree to that. That is simply what the Government has agreed to. The Labor Party, in its usual way, failed to understand that and failed to understand the industry. It is typical of its approach in respect of rural industry as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Also I understand there has been some criticism about a lack of a long term plan for the industry. The fact of the matter in this respect is that it was in about December 1980 that I first warned the industry that it would need to get an Industries Assistance Commission hearing of its problems to face up to the 1981 and 1982 problems. Unfortunately, the industry could not agree to approach the IAC and it did not agree until October last year. I kept harping on the industry at the instigation of my colleagues who came to see me. The honourable member for Murray in particular brought deputation after deputation. I kept saying: 'Get your act together and get before the IAC so that we can find out what its recommendations are and assistance can be given'. Unfortunately, they could not agree until October. </PARA>
<PARA> Immediately on the industry's acceptance of the proposition we went to the IAC. A hearing is now in progress. As honourable members know, an interim report is to be brought down before the end of March, providing perhaps some initial assistance, and a final long term report is to be brought down by October this year so that the long term problems can be dealt with. For the Labor Party to strut around the place and pretend that it knows something about this industry shows the complete humbug with which it tackles all rural industries. Its lack of knowledge, lack of understanding and lack of sympathy for these industries is legion throughout the countryside. People in the countryside will never forget what it was like with the Labor Party in the years 1972 to 1975. They know that the Labor party will never be any different if it gets back into government again. The Opposition's approach on these Bills is typically the same. Having made just those two points that I thought needed making very firmly, I thank those honourable members who have made sensible contributions to the debate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Amendment Bill 1982 is the first of two Bills I will be introducing tonight to amend the petroleum retail marketing legislation enacted in 1980. The amendments are designed to ensure that the legislation gives effect to the Government's policies in a precise and unambiguous manner. Some questions of interpretation of the legislation have been raised. These amendments are intended to remove doubts and to clarify the application of the legislation. The Government proposes that debate on the Bills be deferred until later in this parliamentary session. As with other commercial legislation introduced by the Government, this course of action is being adopted to give honourable members, interested parties and the public, the opportunity to comment on the amending Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall for honourable members the Government's policy in introducing the petroleum retail marketing legislation in September 1980. The Government is opposed to any unnecessary regulation of the business sector. However, the Government considered intervention in the petroleum retailing industry was necessary to correct certain marketing practices; to maintain a vigorous and effective small business sector; and to promote and maintain fair competition and the long term competitiveness of the industry. Experience since the legislation was passed has vindicated the Government's actions, and confirmed its belief in the need for the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act form part of a package of measures. These measures are inter-related and finely balanced to limit undesirable practices, without hindering competition, and without entrenching current market structures or preventing rationalisation. These Acts do, of necessity, raise a number of complex legal and technical issues-to an extent that has perhaps not been fully appreciated by all sectors of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the full impact of both Acts will, partly for constitutional reasons, only be fully felt over a two to three-year period, the legislation appears in general to be achieving its objectives. Security of dealers' tenure has been enhanced; the position of dealers vis-a-vis oil companies has been improved; franchisees are better able to obtain fair recompense for their investment; disclosure of relevant information to prospective franchisees has been greatly improved; franchisees have been able to take advantage of the remedies provided by the legislation; companies have adjusted their marketing strategies to comply with the legislation without significant difficulty; while competition in the industry appears not to have been impaired. The Government is convinced that the legislation is leading, and will continue to lead, to overall better relationships between franchisors and their franchisees and contribute to the maintenance of a healthy, competitive industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The only major practical issue that has arisen since enactment of the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act is the complex question of the Act's application to multi-function sites-that is, sites where the operator makes some sales as a principal, and some as an agent, of an oil company, or where some sales are bulk sales, and some sales are made direct into the supply tanks of vehicles; that is , service station type sales. Depots are the most obvious example of multiple functions being carried on at the one site, but it also occurs to a significant degree with ordinary service stations-for example, a franchisee dealer who services some national account customers on behalf of his franchisor oil company . </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to emphasise that it was intended, and is intended, that the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act apply to those sites where a typical service station business-the supply of motor fuel into the supply tanks of motor vehicles-is carried on by a lessee or licensee operator on his own behalf. In the case of multi-function fuel supply businesses it was, and is, intended that the Act apply if a significant part of the business consists of the kind of typical service station sales I have referred to. A franchise agreement can be subject to the Act even though the franchisee may sell some fuel as agent for the franchisor, or may make some bulk sales. However, where on-site sales into supply tanks of vehicles, made by the operator on his own behalf, form only a very minor and incidental part of total sales, it is not appropriate that the Act should apply. </PARA>
<PARA> It was seen that the Act needed a test to distinguish situations where service stations sales constituted a significant proportion of the total business-such that the Act would apply, from situations where such sales are insignificant-so that the Act should not apply. However, the provisions now in the Act are not as effective as was first thought, due to the variety and multiplicity of functions that are carried out by operators. The result is that the Act can apply to some businesses with quite minimal service station type sales. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments I am introducing tonight are directed at distinguishing between fuel outlets on the basis of the significance of any service station type sales made at the site. The amendments are also intended to provide that in any borderline cases, the Act will apply and the rights of the franchisee protected. This point has added to the complexity of the drafting. A more refined test based on the ratio of service station type sales to total sales of petrol and diesel fuel is proposed to determine the application of the Act and certain ambiguities in the current section are to be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic test proposed is that the Act not apply to sites where more than 85 per cent of the total amount of petrol or diesel fuel supplied by the franchisor to the operator of the site is sold, by that operator, through the site either in bulk, at wholesale or as an agent of the franchisor. However, the amending Bill provides, in effect, a presumption that the Act is to apply to all agreements containing all three elements of the definition of franchise agreement under the Act-that is, right to occupation of premises, right to use a trade mark, and supply of fuel. Positive action must be taken by an oil company franchisor for the Act not to apply by reason of this 85 per cent test. In addition, an agreement may be excluded from the operation of the Act by the 85 per cent test only for so long as service station type sales by the franchisee do not attain 15 per cent of total sales. Once that figure is reached, the Act applies, and will continue to apply throughout the whole term of the agreement and of any renewals to which the franchisee may be entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> This new approach has required complex legislative drafting. In addition to devising a more appropriate base for the application of the Act, it is necessary to deal with a number of factual situations. The rights of parties in these different situations have to be clearly spelt out-for example, the legislation has to cater for agreements entered into before the 1980 Act and still in force; agreements entered into under the 1980 Act; and agreements entered into after the amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> A further area in which there has been some uncertainty is section 20 of the Act-the price discrimination provision. This section is considered by the Government to be of major importance. It was drafted to implement the Government 's intention to limit price discrimination between the lessee and licensee dealers of a franchisor. Whilst the Government considers the present section does achieve this intention, we think it is preferable to remove any doubts about the section's application. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the important provisions of the amending Bill. Section 6 is the focal point of the Act. It specifies those agreements to which the Act applies. Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 6. The basic premise of the Bill is that the Act applies to all agreements which contain the three elements of the definition of 'franchise agreement'-the right to occupy premises, the right to use a trade mark and the supply of fuel. However, the Act will not apply if one of the two grounds provided in proposed new sub-sections 6 (1B) and 6 (1E) is available and the franchisor elects to exercise rights under those sub-sections. </PARA>
<PARA> First, sub-section 6 (1E) applies to new agreements entered into after commencement of the amending provisions. If the franchisor expects on reasonable grounds that more than 85 per cent of total sales will not be typical 'service station' sales, made by the franchisee on his behalf, and if he serves the requisite notice on the franchisee, the Act does not apply to the franchise agreement during the following 12 months. However, to ensure that this sub- section cannot be used to circumvent the operation of the Act, sub-section 6 (1F ) deems the Act to have applied from the commencement of the agreement if in fact this 85 per cent test is not met in the first six months after entering into the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, sub-section 6 (1B) deals with agreements already in existence at the commencement of the amending legislation. It also covers subsequent agreements to which sub-section 6 (1E) was applied in the first instance. If a franchisor so elects, a franchise agreement may be taken outside the Act when, over the previous 12 months, more than 85 per cent of total sales by the franchisee have not been 'service station' type sales made on his own behalf. This exclusion from the Act operates for a period of 12 months only. At the end of this period the test in sub-section 6 (1B) can again be applied to determine the future status of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-section 6 (1G) provides that once the Act applies to an agreement it continues to do so for the whole term of the agreement, and of all renewals the franchisee may be entitled to under section 17 of the principal Act. By sub- section 6 (1A) operation of the amending legislation is to be delayed for 30 days except for section 10, supply of motor fuel, and section 15, disclosure of information by the franchisor. This delay is to enable parties to assess their position and to avail themselves of the new provisions and of the transitional measures I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 20 of the principal Act-the price discrimination provision-is amended by clause 7 to clarify that it only applies to sales to franchisees under agreements to which the Act applies; that a franchisor is not liable for compensation where he has reasonable grounds for believing motor fuel was acquired for purposes other than retail sale for use in road vehicles; and that the onus for establishing these reasonable grounds is on the person asserting that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 amends section 15 of the principal Act to clarify its operation and to clarify that details of the information to be supplied and the manner of providing the information to the franchisee can be specified in the Regulations. Clause 6 amends section 17 of the principal Act to enable a franchisor, on renewal of an agreement, to vary a term relating to the manner of assessing amounts payable for motor fuel or other stock. Clause 6 also clarifies the provisions which protect a franchisee from unreasonable rent increases. </PARA>
<PARA> The Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act Amendment Bill and the companion Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Bill are being introduced at this stage to allow further study of the provisions of both Bills by honourable members and the public. Any submissions that are received will be carefully examined. It would assist if submissions could reach me, or my Department, by 26 March 1982. I commend the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Amendment Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to clarify the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980 to ensure that the Government's original policy intention is implemented. The Government proposes that, as with the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Amendment Bill, debate on this Bill be deferred until later in this session to enable honourable members, all sectors of the industry, and the general public time to consider, and comment on, the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In my speech to the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Amendment Bill, I reaffirmed the Government's belief in the equity of the petroleum marketing legislation and advised that the amendments do not represent a change of policy. The Government has been monitoring the operation of the legislation since its enactment. We are satisfied that in general the legislation is achieving its policy objectives. The Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Bill seeks to amend the principal Act to clarify the extent of its application to retail petroleum outlets. The Bill also alters the technical basis by which the rules on site operation are applied-from a basis of sales made on a 'particular day' to a basis of sales made 'during a month'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act was intended to apply to outlets, including depots, at which the major oil companies engaged in substantial direct retail sales to the public-broadly speaking, those outlets that conduct a ' service station' business. It was not intended, and is not intended, that the Act apply to sites where the direct sale of motor fuel by the company is only a very minor or incidental part of the company's operation at that site. To give effect to this intention, provision was made in the Act for it not to apply to sites where on-site sales into the supply tanks of motor vehicles did not exceed 25 per cent of total on-site sales. When the 25 per cent level was exceeded, that site would be subject to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience over the past 18 months has made it apparent that this formula is not appropriate to give effect to the Government's intention. The sites Act has a wider application than intended. The Act and its prohibitions apply to a number of outlets which engage in direct retail selling of motor fuel to only a very minor extent and in some cases not to the general public. The amending Bill is intended to rectify this situation. It provides that the Act not apply when less than 15 per cent of the total retail sales of petrol and diesel fuel effected through a site was motor fuel, as defined, sold by retail; that is, broadly, when 'service station' sales made by or on behalf of an oil company constitute less than 15 per cent of the total retail sales of the site. </PARA>
<PARA> A second problem area which has emerged is not one which requires amendment of the legislation. There was an erroneous belief on the part of some companies that depots and country distributor sites would be totally exempt from the Act, irrespective of the activities engaged in at that site. Due to this misconception, some companies failed to disclose depot and company distributor sites when notifying numbers of direct sales sites in 1980 prior to the enactment of the Act. Therefore, no account was taken of these sites in the allocation of sites to companies, or in arriving at the level of divorcement to be ultimately achieved. Subsequently, some companies did not include these sites in their early returns under the Act and did not take steps to bring these sites within the quota they were entitled to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of this misconception, and inaction, would have been disruption of the distribution network, particularly in country areas, and inconvenience to customers when sites quotas came into operation on 19 September 1981. In order to ensure that disruption, and inconvenience to consumers, did not occur-and not as has been alleged in some quarters to ease the divorcement burden faced by companies-the number of permitted retail sites companies can operate in the 12 months commencing 19 September 1981 was increased by regulation. I emphasise that this was a temporary increase. Additional sites were allocated only after each company had demonstrated a need for that number of additional sites if its distribution network was not to be severely disrupted. The Government still intends to achieve a 50 per cent reduction in the number of outlets which conduct typical service station sale functions by September 1982. The purpose of the amendments to be effected by the Bill is to restore precision and to give effect to the Government's original intention. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to outline briefly the specific provisions of the Bill. Clause 4- Operation of retail sites-amends section 6 of the principal Act. Firstly, it alters the relevant period for determining the application of the Act from a ' particular day' to 'during a month'. This change facilitates ease of administration and compliance with the Act as the unamended formulation could in marginal cases have required a daily analysis of sales. Clause 4 also amends the exemption test. The Act when amended will not apply during a particular month if the quantity of motor fuel sold during that month, by or on behalf of the corporation, at that site for road vehicles amounts to less than 15 per cent of the total retail petrol and diesel fuel sales effected through the site. This includes all categories of retail sales-bulk on-site, bulk off-site and pump sales made at the site or at other premises where the sale has the requisite connection with the site. Clause 3 amends the definitions of 'market research site' and 'training site'. Under the Act oil companies are entitled to a small number of training sites and market research sites outside their allocated quota . The present definitions require that the 'principal use' of the site be as a market research site or a training site. However, in practice, such sites may be used for these purposes concurrently with other uses, or intermittently. The definition is being amended to require only that there be 'substantial use' of the site as a training site or market research site. Because of the strict limits on the number of these sites permitted off-quota, the effect of this amendment will be very limited. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 5 to 8 and clause 10 effect amendments required by the change to applying the Act on a monthly basis. Clause 7 also amends section 11 of the principal Act to provide for extending by regulation the information required to be supplied by companies in returns. Additional powers dealing with the production of books are conferred by clause 9. The current section 14 provisions are extended, using a similar approach to that adopted with the Companies Act- but the provisions have been tailored to the requirements of the amended Act. Clause 11 preserves any rights which may have accrued to certain commission agents under the Act as originally enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I repeat the undertaking given in my second reading speech to the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Amendment Bill that any submissions received on that Bill or the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Bill, will be carefully considered. It would assist if submissions could reach me or my Department by 26 March 1982. I commend the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Bounty (Drilling Bits) Act 1980 and the Bounty (Non-Adjustable Wrenches) Act 1981 to extend the bounty assistance under those Acts until 31 December 1982 but at half the rates of bounty and half the annual limits on the amount of available bounty as specified in the principal Acts. The bounty schemes, which terminated on 31 December 1981, provided short term assistance to Australian producers and manufacturers of cemented carbide drilling bits and non-adjustable wrenches pending further inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission. Bounty assistance on non-adjustable wrenches was payable at 11c for each bountiable implement and the total bounty payment was limited to a maximum of $620,000 during the bounty period. Bounty assistance on cemented carbide drilling bits was scaled on the basis of bit size and the total bounty payments were limited to a maximum of $150,000 in any one year. The extension of the bounty assistance to these industries follows the Government's acceptance of the recommendations by the Industries Assistance Commission contained in its report of 30 June 1981 on Cutlery, Industrial Knives and Handtools. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of non-adjustable wrenches the Industries Assistance Commission found that the major local manufacturer, Siddons Industries Ltd, improved its market performance since receiving the bounty and was rationalising its operation. The Commission considered this industry to be relatively economically efficient at moderate levels of assistance but was concerned that the sudden withdrawal of the additional assistance might cause resources to move out of this activity. It therefore recommended bounty assistance at half the previous rate for a further 12 months. In respect of the drilling bits, the Commission found that the greater part of the local industry producing rock drills is, with moderate levels of tariff assistance, relatively economically efficient and that its further development is consistent with the Government's broad objective of promoting a more efficient manufacturing sector. The Commission recommended that , in order to provide the local producer with the opportunity to improve its market performance further, short term bounty assistance for drilling bits should be extended for a further 12 month period but at half the rate of those previously payable. After 31 December 1982, the manufacture of non-adjustable wrenches will be assisted by a long term general tariff of 25 per cent and the production of drilling bits will be assisted by a long term general tariff of 15 per cent. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members are aware, the Commonwealth and Victorian governments in September 1980 jointly commissioned Mr F. X. Costigan, Q.C., to inquire into and report upon the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. To date, Mr Costigan has provided to both governments three interim reports. In line with Mr Costigan's recommendations, it is intended that the first two reports should remain confidential for the time being. However, Mr Costigan has indicated that, in his view, there is no good reason why interim report No. 3 should not be made public. The Commonwealth Government concurs with Mr Costigan on this point and interim report No. 3 has been tabled accordingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While Interim Report No. 3 is concerned primarily with the question of tax avoidance activities involving painters and dockers, the report indicates other areas, namely, social security and workers' compensation frauds where, in the words of the Royal Commission, 'The community has suffered considerable loss'. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I do not propose to comment on the substance of the report. However, the report itself is reasonably short and members will quickly be able to glean the extent of the malpractices reported on by the Commissioner. I mention, however, the two substantive recommendations contained in the report. First, the Commission recommends that the secrecy provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 be amended so as to enable Royal Commissions to have access to tax information where the terms of reference authorise such access. Secondly, the Royal Commission has recommended that its own terms of reference be varied to take advantage of the suggested amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the Government recognises that the recommendations of the Commission raise very serious issues on which there will clearly be substantial differences of view. The Government is therefore giving careful consideration to the report and will announce its decision in this regard at an early date. </PARA>
<PARA> I would mention that Mr Justice Stewart, who is currently conducting a Royal Commission into the activities of the Clark drug syndicate, has also recently written seeking access by his Royal Commission to taxation records. Additionally , members will be aware that the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs recommended that information held by the Commissioner of Taxation should be accessible for the purpose of drug law enforcement. The recommendations of these other Royal Commissions will, of course, be taken into consideration in determining the Government's attitude to this important question. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I note that passages in the Commission's report comment on the operations of the Australian Taxation Office. A statement by the Commissioner of Taxation dealing with these matters has been prepared and, as sought by him, I table the statement and also seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ROYAL COMMISSION INTO FEDERATED SHIP PAINTERS AND DOCKERS UNIONSTATEMENT BY COMMISSIONER OF TAXATION</PARA>
<PARA> Neither I nor any of my officers gave evidence to the Royal Commission. Contrary to what might be assumed from the report I was not told in advance of the nature of the disclosures to be made about the people mentioned in the report as having false bank accounts nor was I told the names of these people. In this connection I point out too that I am only able to act according to law in taking action to ''secure'' moneys in bank accounts. The fact that moneys are withdrawn from an account before a tax liability is determined obviously does not mean that the liability will not be discharged. </PARA>
<PARA> In informal conversation with the Royal Commissioner and counsel assisting him I made a number of points about my administrative policies. I stressed that tax evasion or avoidance is itself not a criminal offence in Australia and that my officers operate in a financial context using special statutory powers. I said I did not unnecessarily expose my officers to danger or risk. But I challenge most strongly the Royal Commissioner's conclusion that tax officers failed to attend hearings either on any specific day or generally because of a fear of physical danger to them. I entirely disagree with that finding. In fact, tax officers have been present at hearings of the Commission and from time to time carry out investigations involving the criminal element.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out that there is an almost bottomless pool of work in the tax enforcement area. It is a matter of judgment how available investigation resources are employed from time to time. It is my task to sheet home tax liabilities, not to find evidence of non-tax criminal or civil offences. I was, of course, well aware of the schemes that the Royal Commission has referred to and, indeed, was the source of the information on these that led to the Government being advised to enact the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. The identity of directors of stripped companies-or the equivalent where a trust is stripped-is not an essential matter from the point of view of taxation administration, particularly if they are men of straw. Painters and dockers were , of course, not the only people who participated in the schemes in these ways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This third interim report of the Royal Commission on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, this slim document, is potentially one of the most explosive papers to be tabled in this House. The Government did not intend it, but it has indeed set a sprat to catch a mackerel and what a mackerel it has turned up. The Royal Commissioner has some very important things to say about the reprehensible and criminal activities of some painters and dockers and the way in which they have defrauded the public purse in the areas of social security and workers compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to make it absolutely clear at the outset of what I have to say on behalf of the Opposition that the Opposition joins with all reasonable people in deploring these activities, as they are properly established, and believes it appropriate that the course of justice should be fully pursued by the processes of law in respect of those activities. Having made that unequivocally clear, so that there is no possibility of misrepresentation in any quarter as to our position on what has been disclosed by the Royal Commissioner in regard to certain activities of some painters and dockers, let us see what the Royal Commissioner has in fact to say. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention and that of the House to paragraph 1. 05 which appears at page 3 of the report. Having referred to those activities of certain painters and dockers in defrauding the public purse in regard to social security and workers compensation, matters, and having dealt relatively briefly with them, the Royal Commissioner had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>But the figures I have mentioned above pale into insignificance compared with the figures involved in the tax avoidance industry which is the subject of this report. By way of example, four specific cases considered by the Commission involve a non-payment of tax in excess of $2,000,000. There are hundreds of such cases. The amounts to be identified and recovered by Government are enormous. It is for this reason that I have limited this report in essence to this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA>He adds in paragraph 1.06:</PARA>
<PARA> The matters referred to in this report form the basis for my recommendation that the Income Tax Assessment Act should be amended. The amendment is directed to the enhancement of the investigative capabilities of the Commission. Bearing in mind that the Commission has a limited life, such amendment, if approved by Government, would require early legislation if it is to be of use to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Before I conclude my remarks I will make some preliminary comments in regard to those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the House now to take particular notice of what the Royal Commissioner goes on to say under the rather illuminating heading of chapter 2, 'Slutzkin Rides Again'. Just in case any honourable member should be in any doubt as to the implication of that rather graphic chapter heading, I would mention that it is of course a reference to the Slutzkin case which was decided by the High Court in earlier days and was to form the basis of subsequent tax avoidance schemes. I venture to suggest that few more important paragraphs have come before this House for its consideration than this first paragraph, 2.01, of chapter 2, headed 'Slutzkin Rides Again'. The Royal Commissioner goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> 2.01 The Commission's investigations into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers' Union has led it, to the surprise of many, to the tax avoidance industry. This industry has developed in Australia, particularly over the last five years, at a rate far in excess of any other industry and has brought with it profits comparable only to the heady days of the Victorian gold rush. Unfortunately this industry carried with it a serious detriment to the interests of government and the Australian community. The detriment was twofold: In the first place it diverted from the Treasury tax which would prima facie be payable on income of taxpayers; in the second place it diverted the tax payable by those engaged in that industry. The amounts involved are very large indeed, amounting to many hundreds of millions of dollars per year or more. The impact on the community has been very serious. It has introduced into the community a class of people, almost invariably the highest earners, who pay little or no tax and make no contribution in that way as citizens to their fair share of community costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commissioner concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition it has made more difficult for government the task of providing for the community as a whole a more equitable and reduced taxation burden. </PARA>
<PARA>I think honourable members will see the justification I have for pointing up the paramount importance of this opening paragraph of chapter 2 of the third interim report of the Royal Commission on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the justification for my initial observation that the Government, without intending to, has indeed set a sprat to catch a mackerel. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have revealed here is out of the investigations of this Royal Commission on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. We have the opening up in very much more detail of this issue and of this fastest growing industry in the country-says the Royal Commissioner-the tax avoidance industry. He points out that this industry is concentrated in the area of the very wealthy section of the community and that the existence of this industry is not only imposing a situation in which people with the greatest capacity to pay and to meet their taxation requirements are avoiding it but also necessarily, by way of implication from that, it is imposing upon the whole community a situation where it is more difficult for government to provide for that whole community a more equitable and reduced taxation burden.</PARA>
<PARA> I go on, then, to what the Commissioner has to say as he comes towards the concluding sections of his report before he goes on to make the recommendations to the Government as to what course of action he believes is necessary to deal with this situation which his investigations have so unexpectedly exposed. After he has described the way in which the schemes are operated and the way in which some painters and dockers have been involved in the scheme, at paragraph 4.05 on page 16 he says:</PARA>
<PARA> The situation has now been reached by the Commission in this area of its investigation where firstly access is essential to the records of the Commissioner of Taxation and secondly there is a need for the closest co- operation between this Commission and the Taxation Office in the furtherance of its investigation. The Commission requires the active assistance of Taxation Investigation officers. I require access to taxation records. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Commissioner says: 'I require access to taxation records.' He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Joint action of this kind is as necessary in this area as it has proved to be where the Commonwealth and the States have set up joint task forces to investigate criminal organisations whose activities cross State borders. </PARA>
<PARA>The Royal Commissioner then concluded this paragraph by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> Provided there is this joint co-operation, there is good reason for believing that the Commonwealth will be able to take concerted action in this area of tax avoidance with the countless financial benefits not only in respect of past schemes but also in the deterrence of future frauds. </PARA>
<PARA>It is obviously important to relate paragraph 4.05, where he says what can be achieved if this is done, back to that earlier paragraph that I read. He talked about the inequities of the tax avoidance industry, Australia's fastest growing industry. I repeat the last sentence:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition it has made more difficult for government the task of providing for the community as a whole a more equi- table and reduced taxation burden. </PARA>
<PARA>So let us have no doubt about the great implications of what this Royal Commission is saying in respect of basic areas of discussion which are properly before this Parliament and are foremost in the minds of the community at the moment-what can we do about creating a more equitable and reduced taxation burden? This is an issue which is at the forefront of the political and social discussion in this community today and the Commissioner is saying that if he is given the powers which he asks for then, with the joint co-operation to which he refers, there is good reason for believing that the Commonwealth will be able to take concerted action in this area of tax avoidance with countless financial benefits not only in respect of past schemes but also in the deterrence of future frauds. He was saying that if what he asks for is granted we will be able to move towards that situation where we can more sensibly and with a greater degree of realistic anticipation talk about the possibility of having a more equitable and reduced taxation burden in the community simply because we will have the situation that those with the greatest capacity to pay tax who have been avoiding it will be brought into a situation where they pay their share in this community and enable, for the rest of the community, this more equitable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said those things, the Royal Commissioner goes on to make his recommendations. Without going into the technicalities of his recommendations, he is asking that section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended in two ways. He asks firstly that sub-section 16 (1) be amended. It relates to the purpose of requiring officers to observe secrecy. So that it will be well within the understanding of honourable members, that sub-section provides:</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of this section, 'officer' means a person who is or has been appointed or employed by the Commonwealth or by a State, and who by reason of that appointment or employment, or in the course of that employment, may acquire or has acquired information respecting the affairs of any other person, disclosed or obtained under the provisions of this Act or of any previous law of the Commonwealth relating to income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>The first proposal of the Commissioner, therefore, is that there be inserted after the words, 'employed by the Commonwealth or by a State', the words, 'not being a person appointed pursuant to the Royal Commissions Act'. The second and related proposal of the Royal Commissioner is that section 16 (4) of the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended to add to the list of authorised recipients of information. At the moment sub-section 16 (4) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in the section shall be deemed to prohibit the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner, or any person thereto authorised by him, from communicating any information to--</PARA>
<PARA>There is then listed a number of categories. The Royal Commissioner is seeking in his second proposal that there be added sub-section (j), which is to read:</PARA>
<PARA>any person to whom a Commission has been issued by the Governor-General pursuant to the Royal Commissions Act where the Terms of Reference of that Commission include a reference in specific terms to this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>His third proposal, which completes his desire to put himself in a position where he can be of assistance conjointly with the Commonwealth in bringing this industry to a halt, is referred to in paragraph 4.08, where he says:</PARA>
<PARA> If such amendment is made it will be necessary to amend the terms of my Commonwealth Commission by adding at the end of the first paragraph after the words 'Naval Defence Act 1910' 'or has engaged in illegal activities in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Act.'</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition regards the secrecy provisions of the Act as of fundamental importance. We support those provisions; we are committed to them. But we appreciate the very careful way in which the Commissioner has asked for very limited and careful amendments so that he will be able to achieve the noble purpose that he has outlined in his reports. We appreciate that the Government is going to look at this, but on behalf of the Opposition we flag that we will be considering it, of course, We indicate that, for the reasons so cogently outlined by the Royal Commissioner, these proposals which he brings forward so responsibly, so carefully and so circumspectly, should meet with the unanimous approval of a House which is concerned with trying to create a more equitable and fair burden of taxation in this community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) for breaking up the debate on this series of Bills into two cognate debates. We are dealing with the dairy industry, the edible oil industry, the egg industry and the honey industry. I think it is a bit much to try to speak to eight Bills, even though the measures they deal with are all related, in 20 minutes. I suppose we are in the land of milk and honey tonight, or if we look at the next debate, perhaps we are talking about the birds and the bees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All of these Bills are related. They all relate to export charges on the idustries concerned and the Government's decision now to get from the industries some 50 per cent of the export inspection charges. I guess this shows the hypocrisy of the Government because I well recall when the Labor Government imposed beef inspection charges the great hoo-ha that the then Opposition made at that time. Of course, the worm has turned now and the beef industry, for example, still pays those charges. The Government seems to have no intention of lifting them, even though the cattle industry is now heading for another low. I guess it is no surprise that the Cattlemen's Union of Australia recently passed a nearly unanimous vote of no confidence in the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard earlier today in the debate on the canned fruits legislation which increased the levy imposed on that industry the National Country Party say that the growers are quite happy. I guess we will hear the same line again-that the growers will be quite happy with the levying of all these export charges. The Country Party would have us believe that the shires are happy with road funding, that all is well in the country, that it is all right to sell the Australian Wool Testing Authority, or whatever was done to it, and that it is all right to get out of soil conservation. I guess in all these things the Opposition just talks to different farmers. It must be different people who write to me and telephone me. I guess all the newspaper stories must be nonsense. In other words , as Dr Pangloss once said: 'All is for the best in the best of possible worlds' . </PARA>
<PARA> But whichever way the National Country Party or the Government tries to rationalise it, these charges are simply going to cost the industries concerned more money-something like $307,000 from the dairy industry and $7,000 from the edible oils industry. The edible oil export part of the oil industry-the oil seeds industry-of course is only a very small part of it. </PARA>
<PARA> For all these four industries-I shall contain my remarks to dairy products and edible oils for the moment-I guess what has happened is that the Government or the Department of Primary Industry obtained an estimate from the finance section for the cost of inspecting these industries. As I understand it, the same inspectors inspect all four industries. Taking into account the cost of salaries , travel and accommodation, a division was made. The Government required that 50 per cent of the inspection fee cost be recouped, and it was divided in terms of the amount of wage labour on travel and accommodation rather than in terms of the value of the product. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the range of dairy products, whichever way we go, we see that it would be a very complicated calculation indeed. I guess the Opposition cannot really object too strongly to the way these charges have been calculated, given the Government's requirement. An amount of $307,000 is to be taken from the Australian dairy industry by the Government in accordance with its razor gang recommendations of 30 April 1981. I am not so sure that this really was a specific razor gang measure when we consider that the Government had already decided to place levies on the meat industry, the grain industry and the wool industry for like services in 1979. Although the charge on the dairy industry will be levied on a person who furnishes an export notice for inspection purposes, the cost of this and all other measures will be passed back to the farmers and will eventually be reflected in proportionately lower returns. The maximum rate of $5 per tonne is specified, although the rates for 1981-82 will be a maximum of $2.50 per tonne. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when the dairy industry wants confidence boosting signals from the Government, this Government decides to clobber it, again due, I guess, to the ideological obsession of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of trying to save money by handing functions back to the States, cutting out functions regardless of their intrinsic worth or by charging producers and consumers for public services. The dairy industry is not now a major exporter and due to this returns have risen in recent years; so the imposition is not large in overall terms, given the dairy industry's total returns. But I think we need to recognise that the point has been reached at which real concern for future production levels is justified. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980-81 the industry produced 5.18 billion litres of milk. That figure was down by about 4.2 per cent on the previous year. It is estimated that for the current year ending June 1982 production will be about 5 billion litres, perhaps a little more with better weather. That estimate again is down by 3.6 per cent. People are saying that the downturn in milk production is bottoming out and levelling off, but the statistics still do not show that. So there is a real reason for the concern. Seven thousand tonnes of some 68,000 tonnes of butter will be exported in this current year. Of course, we will also be importing some 4,000 tonnes for re-export repacking. </PARA>
<PARA> We are still exporting large amounts of other products-for example, about 9,000 tonnes of casein, 42,000 tonnes of whole milk powder, 40,000 tonnes of skim milk powder and about 49,000 tonnes of cheese. These are estimates for the current year. There are now some complaints by some of our more traditional cheese markets that we cannot supply all that they would like, and although export prices are still not stable, export markets are certainly paying at the present time. Even if they were not, with the production levels we now have, the proportion of production now being consumed domestically is sufficient to cushion the local industry against any quick downturns in the export market. But the industry is on the horns of a dilemma to a large degree. The level of production has allowed a measure of prosperity but the industry really needs to know where to go from here. What sort of signal should it get to produce more, or where do they take it?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the other concerns of many people in the industry-these are people who talk to me; perhaps they are not the ones who talk to the Government or the Country Party-is the future of the Australian Dairy Corporation. The Corporation is now becoming more and more concerned with the domestic market. Producers are querying its role. While the Corporation has a charter to promote milk products domestically, it does not have powers over the liquid markets or the direction of milk and, of course, there are large private processors of milk as well as the co-operatives. The relationship between the Corporation, the co-operatives, the producers and the private processors of milk are becoming more and more blurred. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we can say quite clearly that the Government has abdicated its role for policy direction in the industry. I know there is a lot of talking going on behind the scenes. But the Government seems to be happy to see policy control carried out by the States and the Corporation, with producers being represented on a range of industry bodies. When everyone agrees in that great mass of conflicting interests, the Government will move. I think there are club-like aspects in this form of organisation, the sort of rural politics of the industries and I guess the Asia Dairy Industries case showed up some of the deficiencies and the fact that rocking the boat is frowned upon. But I do not think it should be beyond the Commonwealth Government really to say what strategy it is following from an Australian national dairy industry point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> A bit of jawboning about the level of underwriting that went on last year is hardly a policy or a national strategy. Industry rationalisation has taken place and the stage 2 recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission inquiry of 1976 have been reached de facto due the levels of production. The whole system of levies is not now dealing with an industry it was intended to deal with. The legislation needs to be reviewed. Similarly, the dairy produce legislation, which goes back to 1924, still governs in large degree the operations of the Australian Dairy Corporation as primarily an export-orientated body. </PARA>
<PARA> What, if anything, is the Government or the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) going to do about these matters to give the industry some idea of where it is going or what strategy the Government would like to see? At the recent National Agricultural Outlook Conference, Mr Vawser, the Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation, summed up some of the essential elements or the circumstances of the industry of today. He said that the industry has rationalised itself to the point where further contraction will almost certainly damage its viability, and that this would not be in the interests of the Australian consumer or the economy generally. He said that the current economic climate is taking its toll among the dairy farming industry in that many farmers are leaving the industry to capitalise on the high land or stock values of their properties. This same factor is hindering new entrants to dairying because of the very large investment required in relation to achievable returns. The industry currently produces an exportable surplus which barely ensures that the needs of the domestic market are met. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the industry is vulnerable to imports because of the distortions and imperfections of the international market and the low level of protection provided by the Government. As we all know the international market is a corrupt market, due mainly to the policies of the European Economic Community. The marketing structure of the industry is very fragmented and usually follows State borders. Consequently, it is not in a position to defend the domestic market against any concerted effort by importers to gain a market share. State governments and their dairy marketing authorities have considerable influence over the direction of Australian dairying yet their policies can be divergent with respect to a national approach to dairying. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry, as we all well know-I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have a very close interest in the dairy industry-is made up of three interdependent sectors, namely producers, processors and marketers. As I have said, some of those processors in Victoria particularly, are large private processors. These sectors come together on a national basis through the Australian Dairy Industry Conference. The Conference is mainly a political lobbying force with its main interest in Federal Government policies. While the Australian Dairy Corporation may believe that that Conference is the best vehicle for the adoption of a national approach to dairying, I believe that the Government has to take a clearer role, give some direction and make some statements on where it would like to see the dairy industry head. The essential elements of a national strategy must include a review of the Corporation's activities and its legislation. It should include some requirement for adequate supplies of milk to be supplied to Australian consumers. It should contain something about the fact that returns have to be optimised and that prices for manufacturing and marketing milk have to be more closely matched to real relative costs of production. There needs to be stability for the industry to plan with confidence , and means must be found for improving productivity by way of technological advance, and of course the industry, on its own bat, is certainly doing a lot of that at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters most concerning the Australian dairy industry at present is the problem of closer economic relations with New Zealand. The Opposition is pleased, on behalf of the dairy industry, to see that the Minister is taking a reasonably firm stand with the ebullient Mr Muldoon on some of his statements and is giving as good as he is given. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has recently published a paper on that matter. While I am not 100 per cent convinced of what the BAE found on that, what it was setting out to do was to try to make a valid comparison between two industries, so that if there is to be trade between the two countries, the Australian dairy industry can get some accurate idea of to what extent the New Zealand dairy industry is more favoured than the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The points which I do not think the BAE touched on enough was the fact that the taxation regime for New Zealand dairy farmers is far different and more beneficial to New Zealand farmers than it is to Australians; that interest rates , particularly interest rates for their equivalent of the Australian Dairy Corporation, are highly subsidised; and that access to credit for the dairy industry and dairy farmers generally in New Zealand is far better than it is in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The BAE report was rather lengthy. Perhaps the House will allow me to summarise some of it, because I think that this matter is one of the major concerns of the dairy industry. I have been trying to stress that we need to have a national strategy for the dairy industry and that the industry needs to know where it is going. There is simply no way that we can have any sort of stability or planning if we have a situation in which imports may or may not be allowed into this country. What the BAE paper said was that it is generally believed-I share this belief-that dairying is likely to be more affected by differing levels of economic integration than other major primary products, such as beef, wool and wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> From a purely economic point of view, comparing the two countries, the New Zealand dairy industry is more important to that country than dairying is to Australia. In New Zealand dairying constitutes 15 per cent of rural production, but it constitutes only 6 per cent to 7 per cent in Australia. There is not that much difference between the two countries' production of milk, but New Zealand being a smaller country, it means a lot more to that country. About 16 per cent of the New Zealand total 1980 export earnings, for example, came from dairy products, by comparison with Australian dairy products, which account for less than about 2 per cent of total Australian exports. Dairy cattle numbers have been declining in both countries, but at a faster rate in Australia. Making a comparison of the two sectors, and looking at the market milk sector first, we find that in Australia the market milk price has exceeded the price of milk manufacturing by more than 50 per cent. The market milk sector accounts for around 30 per cent of total milk production but some 50 per cent to 55 per cent of returns, and the supplies and prices are regulated by the State authorities. This sector is also highly regulated in New Zealand, but along different lines, and the supply of milk is organised independently of manufacturing milk. Produce prices tend to move in line with returns for manufacturing milk. </PARA>
<PARA> In the manufacturing milk sector, where all the concern is-it is of particular concern to Victoria-in Australia the market for manufacturing milk can be divided into the domestic and the export markets for dairy products. New Zealand does not have a policy of high domestic prices for manufactured dairy products. In Australia the domestic market for manufactured dairy products utilises about 45 per cent of total milk production. Domestic prices are maintained at a higher level than exports by a levy system, but not to any marked degree. The export market absorbs around 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the total milk production. In general, returns from this market for Australia have tended to be below those on domestic markets. In New Zealand the manufacture of dairy products is under the overall supervision of the New Zealand Dairy Board, which also pools returns from domestic and export markets. The New Zealand Dairy Board has wider powers than the Australian Dairy Corporation. Although New Zealand does not have a policy of high domestic prices for manufactured dairy products, New Zealand producer returns are influenced by the high returns for butter sold on the United Kingdom market under special EEC access arrangements. As I have said, the New Zealand Dairy Board not only has wider powers than the ADC, but also it has special access to credit on very low terms-down to as low as 1 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at market prospects, in Australia the dominant market for milk and manufactured dairy products is the domestic market, which takes about 75 per cent to 80 per cent of total milk output, whereas in New Zealand the situation is reversed. Further contraction of dairying in New Zealand is likely to result in diminished ability to supply exports. The sudden emergence of new export prospects for Australian dairy products is regarded as unlikely in the foreseeable future because attempted inroads into new markets in third countries are likely to meet with strong competition from New Zealand and the EEC. Domestic markets in Australia seem to be stabilising at a time when milk production is falling. Australia and New Zealand produce similar ranges of dairy products and compete on world markets, especially the markets of Japan, South East Asia and the Middle East. New Zealand continues to rely on the United Kingdom market for about 60 per cent of its butter exports. Loss of this access for New Zealand dairy products will have serious implications for Australian exports; similarly with future levels of EEC exports and the level of protection in the EEC. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look now at Australian imports of dairy products. The trade relationships at present between Australia and New Zealand are determined more by informal agreements than by formal barriers or tariffs-that is, they are gentlemen's agreements, and with people such as Mr Muldoon and our Minister for Primary Industry I am sure that they are indeed gentlemen's agreements. Cheese has been the only product to be imported into Australia in significant quantities. Cheese imports from New Zealand were 37 per cent of total imports and account for about 5 per cent of domestic consumption. Net imports of butter were about zero, but in the last year about 4,000 tonnes were imported. However, it has been mainly for re-export. It is generally true to say that imports of dairy products into Australia are at very low levels. But the question is whether imports of dairy products will be needed to meet shortages on the Australian domestic market in the future. I say, and I am sure the Australian dairy industry says, that that situation should not be reached. </PARA>
<PARA> The BAE then set about analysing the trans-Tasman trade generally. We should really be trying to say what our policy is in this area. I guess the Minister for Primary Industry is grappling with that. The relationship at present is informal. Such tariff barriers which do exist could be removed with little or no direct effect on trade. Mutual agreement has been reached to limit imports of cheddar cheese from New Zealand. We have also agreed to have inter-industry consultation for all other cheeses. As I have said, cheese is the only significant item of dairy imports into Australia and imports from New Zealand account for about 5 per cent of our cheese consumption. So we can say that generally the current level of dairy product imports from New Zealand is low and supplants an insignificant proportion of milk production in Australia. The BAE made a calculation of about one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> When the BAE looked at some of the costs, it found that the production costs per kilogram butterfat of manufacturing milk is 22 per cent higher in Australia than in New Zealand. This accounts for the 3 per cent consumer subsidy which applies in New Zealand. I would say that there are many in the dairy industry in Australia who would debate this 22 per cent higher figure and believe that the BAE has not taken some of the aspects I have pointed to earlier into account. To get some measure of import competition that New Zealand could cause to the Australian market, the BAE did two evaluations. It evaluated the impact on dairying in Australia at two different stages with the prices in being at the time. In other words, it did a simulation study. The years it picked were 1977- 78 and 1979-80. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977-78 the landed prices of New Zealand imports into Australia would have been 9 per cent lower than the ruling domestic price in Australia, based on the actual prices received by New Zealand farmers. The effect of this would have been to place at risk an additional 6 per cent of farms and milk production in Australia. That was the least destructive possibility for Australia in the 1977- 78 circumstances. In other words, calculations could have been made that that would have disadvantaged the Australian industry even more. In the 1979-80 circumstances, when world market prices for dairy products and farm profitability in Australia were higher than they were in 1977-78, the extent of New Zealand competitiveness, its competitive potential and the possible contractionary pressures on the Australian dairy industry were considerably reduced. The landed price on that calculation for New Zealand imports in Australia, based on average prices received by New Zealand farmers from all markets, was estimated to exceed the Australian domestic price by only a small amount. The point that needs to be made about these simulations in the BAE's study is that they are very sensitive to exchange rate movements. These in the future are likely to favour New Zealand and again enhance its competitive potential on the Australian market. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at New Zealand's export capacity we can see that New Zealand, due to its smaller size and the great amount available for export, exports over six times as much milk as would be required to supply the Australian market in the most competitive situation, with about half of this quantity going to less profitable markets outside the EEC. Therefore, it is within New Zealand's capacity to meet the requirements of the Australian market under liberalised conditions. As New Zealand's exports to lower priced markets outside the EEC amount to almost three times the amount of milk required to supply the Australian market, even under the most competitive circumstances considered, New Zealand is quite capable of simply diverting dairy products to the Australian market without undergoing any major productive expansion. If we look at the government protection-this is of key interest to the dairy farmers-we can see that the level of protection to manufacturing milk production in Victoria was not significantly different from that in New Zealand when the consumer transfer on market milk was excluded for Victoria and the EEC access benefit was excluded for New Zealand. When the EEC access benefit was included the level of protection in New Zealand exceeded that in Victoria by about 19c per kilogram of butterfat in 1979-80. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the higher levels of government protection for production and marketing in New Zealand were reduced to comparable Australian levels the resulting increase in cost based on landed prices of between 12 per cent and 15 per cent would have meant that some 3 per cent fewer farms would have been at risk. The BAE concluded that the economic significance of the higher levels of protection given to dairying in New Zealand is small when placed in the perspective of other pressures that are likely to influence the prospects of the Australian dairy industry. The higher figure for damage that the BAE study came up with with was 6 per cent but, as the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has interjected, 19c a kilogram butterfat is not a small amount. I do not quite know how the BAE arrived at the figure of only 6 per cent of farms being prejudiced. Even though I do not quite go along with the BAE report, I think we do have a situation in which the fears of the industry are real. I think we have a situation in which the Minister is quite right to say that any quick agreement on this product and other agricultural products will not be too easy to reach. He at least said-the Opposition joins with him in saying this-that the Australian industry should not be subject to unfair competition and that we need to have a viable dairy industry. A viable dairy industry is one that has a capacity to export, otherwise it will not meet the other aim of supplying our consumers. The Australian Dairy Farmers Federation has a firm view on that. It says that there should not be any imports of dairy products from New Zealand unless there is mutual agreement between the industries of both countries, as one would expect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole question of dairy imports has become an important part of the discussions on closer economic relations. I trust that the Government-I am sure the Opposition will-will take a very keen interest in these negotiations. I think the Government has demonstrated sufficient interest in this issue to dispel some of the fears expressed by dairy farmers in Australia about a year ago when they thought that they may go down the drain due to the trading imbalance between Australia and New Zealand. All people, including dairy farmers , are very much aware of the realities of that trade imbalance and the vulnerability or otherwise of the New Zealand economy. But if there is to be any trading between these two countries in agricultural products it has to be a very fair deal and there has to be a lot of thought and consultation going into it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not spend much time on oilseeds. As I said at the outset, I guess it would not hurt to have a wide-ranging debate on the whole oilseeds industry because it is one of real potential. We still import a lot of our oilseeds needs . The broiler industry takes a lot of this product by way of vegetable protein. If we can improve our varieties and techniques, particularly for soya bean, this industry will be a growing industry in Australia for quite a long time to come. The amount of edibile oils we export is only small. There is the potential to export a lot more. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of oilseeds prospects overall, as we all know oilseeds are traded with the futures market very much in mind. In other words the price is set for us by overseas futures markets. There are lower projections for those markets for oilseeds in Australia for 1982 for both the summer and winter crops. But to a large degree most of the operators in the industry in Australia took out guaranteed minimum price contracts and they have been protected against some of the fluctuations on the futures markets. In January of this year-last month-soya bean and grain prices were being quoted at life of contract lows, following a year of steadily declining prices. The situation in Poland hovered over that market for about 18 months and is still a factor to be considered by all operators in the market, particularly speculators. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a huge shakeout of speculators in December 1980, followed by a dramatic increase in United States of America interest rates, which left the Chicago futures market with a reduced level of speculative involvement. I will not go into those aspects except to point out that even the oilseeds industry is affected by currency rates, by operations on the futures markets and by the interest rates in the United States and it is very much aware of international trading conditions. It is a relatively healthy industry but, of course, as with all primary industries, it is not without problems. The Opposition supports the measures before the House but feels that these penny pinching operations to obtain inspection fees from these industries really are just that-a bit of penny pinching. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just listened to a very interesting speech by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) on the dairy industry. I would not necessarily agree with all of the comments he makes but he has made a very valuable and interesting contribution to the present dairy debate. As he mentioned, the purpose of the Bills is basically to implement an export inspection charge of about 50 per cent of the actual cost of inspection. Whilst supporting the Government on this measure, I make one comment. That is that, while the total cost of that charge is met by the Government, there is possibly no requirement for the dairy industry, or for that matter any other industry so involved, to require accountability of the efficiency of that inspection. Once the industry is required to pay a part of that charge, or even the total charge, I believe that industry has a right to require some statement or accountability that the money that is being contributed by the growers is being efficiently spent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know that that is easier to say than to implement but I believe it is something to which we as a government should work. I believe that it is correct and proper that growers who are so charged should have some sort of audit of how their money is being spent. The position of the dairy industry is quite contrary to that of the canned fruit industry which was the subject of the previous debate. In the short term, the outlook for the dairy industry is very good, in contrast with not only the canned fruit industry but also the depressed beef industry, and possibly also the sugar industry. Over the last couple of years the economic position of the dairy industry has been very good and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, in its Outlook paper for this year's Agricultural Outlook Conference documents this quite well. </PARA>
<PARA> This position internationally has resulted basically from the failure of communist agriculture. The dramatic failure of the Eastern European countries to produce food for their large populations has required very large purchases of dairy products and other products from the European Economic Community. They have also had to purchase from New Zealand and now even indirectly from the United States of America via New Zealand. The 100,000 tonne purchase of United States butter via New Zealand is being laundered, if honourable members like, or turned into butter oil and some is being sold indirectly to the Eastern bloc countries. I am not saying that as a criticism because, obviously, such an amount of a dairy product in the United States was a threat to the stability of the international dairy market. I think both the United States and New Zealand have acted responsibly-I hope it will be responsibly-in the disposal of this product. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, in addition to the short term position being good, basically caused by the failure of Eastern European agriculture, there has also been reduced production and exports by Australia and slower than anticipated growth in dairy production in the EEC. But it would be wrong to say, as some countries are now saying, that there is actually a growing international commercial market for dairy products. Countries, in particular those of the EEC and New Zealand, are making optimistic noises about the medium and long term international outlook for dairy products. I am glad that the BAE also challenges this point in its document. Last week I was in Brussels and Strasbourg talking to EEC people. It is disappointing to hear them talk of what they consider to be long term export prospects for their dairy surplus. Of course, anything that they sell on the international market in dairy products would be on a subsidised basis--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Braithwaite" NAMEID="0F4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2E4">Mr LLOYD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like sugar-good point. It is also true that in the long term the projections for EEC production are of a 1 1/2 per cent increase each year against a 0.5 per cent increase in consumption. Therefore, the trend is for increased dairy surpluses from the EEC. If one looks at the price proposals for this year, with a 9 1/2 per cent increase, one has to say that the EEC is not trying very hard to do anything to correct this growing imbalance in its dairy market and dairy production. New Zealand is very enthusiastically encouraging increased production. It is doing so through its livestock incentive scheme, through very generous export arrangements and through the tremendous stability mechanism it has in the supplementary minimum price scheme introduced by its government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been told that the scheme could cost the government, for the whole range of agricultural products which it covers, about $200m this year. In the last two days it has led to a row in New Zealand as the New Zealand Government has tried to reduce its financial commitment by trying to force its Wool Board to reduce the reserve price for its wool. I believe it is a program or a policy which the New Zealand Government, in the long run, cannot afford. From our point of view, with closer economic relations, it cannot be allowed to continue. In the United States there are still very large stocks of butter, powder and cheese and presumably more of these products will be placed on the international market through New Zealand if the present arrangement works out. There is at least some encouragement in that the support price for dairying in the 1981 farm bill has been reduced a little from what it previously was. </PARA>
<PARA> However, sooner or later, Eastern Europe must have a better grain harvest because it has had two very bad ones in the last two years. This, in turn, will mean that it will have more feed for livestock which will produce more dairy products, among other things. Sooner or later it must wake up and provide the right sorts of incentives for its dairy farmers to produce more towards the capability that their livestock obviously has to produce. When that happens I shudder for the international dairy market. It is obvious that the Eastern European countries will continue to give high priority to the importation of foodstuffs from the West because, if they do not, they will have revolution on their hands. But it is important that the EEC, the United States of America and New Zealand realise that there is not the growing international commercial market for dairy products that they seem to think there is. They should take their share of adjustment, as we in Australia have had to adjust our agricultural and dairy production to the realities of the international market. </PARA>
<PARA> There is less support for the dairy industry in this country than in any other country in the world. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa, in quoting the BAE comparison, gave evidence of that in relation to these two countries which together have the lowest forms of government support for all agriculture. We are the second most efficient dairy producer in the world. I cannot think of any secondary industry in Australia that can make a similar claim. Other industries would be well down on any international comparison. But the EEC causes particular concern because, even in the reform proposals of the Common Agricultural Policy which were released last year, the EEC talked of long term export contracts, including markets such as Japan which we consider to be our traditional and correct markets. We were forced by Europe out of their market for our sales of dairy products and other products such as sugar and meat . We created new markets in other countries and now the Europeans, through the generous price support schemes of the Common Agricultural Policy, have developed surpluses and are now seeking through their subsidised exports, to take away from us the markets which we have developed on a commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recent speech, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) outlined seven points which he considers are essential for negotiation between Australia and New Zealand, or more particularly the dairy industries of the two countries, in relation to the inclusion of the dairy industry in the closer economic relations discussions. I agree with the honourable member for Werriwa that CER is probably the single most important issue in the minds of Australian dairy farmers at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to congratulate the Minister for Primary Industry for putting forward these points. I believe they are a very sensible basis for discussion between industries. I say to him: 'Good work and stick to your position in this matter'. I believe it is correct for New Zealand to be the first supplier for any shortfall of dairy product in Australia which is mutually agreed to by the industries of both countries. That should be the basis of dairy trade between the two countries. In any other situation, as a minimum, support for the dairy industry in New Zealand would have to be equalised with that of Australia and questions of difference in currency levels would have to be taken into account. As the honourable member for Werriwa pointed out there are taxation, credit, export incentives, livestock incentive schemes, supplementary minimum price schemes, and a whole range of other arrangements which the New Zealand dairy farmer has but the Australian dairy farmer does not. Since that BAE report was made I believe the difference in the degree of government support between the two countries has widened. Probably at the moment in Australia on international comparison terms it would be at a negative level. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe that New Zealand-I have said this in the debate on the canned fruits legislation-is operating on a double standard in relation to CER. New Zealand is claiming that it should have greater access to the Australian dairy market. But New Zealand itself operates and is determined to continue to operate the policy of supplying only in a shortfall situation for a whole range of its own agricultural commodities. I can think of about five or six agricultural industries in Australia which would love to be able to sell their products to New Zealand but they are restricted to the provision of shortfall. If that principle is right for New Zealand producers when it suits them, then it is a principle that had better be right when it comes to the dairy industries of the two countries. So I say once again to the Minister: 'Stick to your position because it is a very correct position in regard to the dairy industry in CER'. I would also say to the Minister that if the EEC continues to look for every possible opportunity to take action against imports from Australia-that seems to be its intent at the moment-then we should have a very hard look at taking anti- dumping action against the increasing imports of cheese from Europe. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address my remarks in this debate just to the Dairy Products (Export Inspection Charge) Bill. As indicated by my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), we on this side of the House do not intend to oppose the measure itself although we do have some misgivings regarding the necessity of opposing the charges. I would like to make some comment on the address given by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). I think it is very heartening to be present at a debate in which there is such a bipartisan approach to a measure such as this, given our general concern for the future of the dairying industry. As honourable members are aware there has been a long term policy of reconstruction in the dairying industry that goes back over many years. This process began as a result of pressures from the market and other economic forces which gradually imposed themselves upon the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With assistance, or at least encouragement, from government the national dairy herd was reduced to 1.83 million head in March 1981. No doubt the figure may well be a little lower today. These figures have been given by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. The size of the herd has been reduced from in excess of 3,263,289 in 1962-63 which is the first year for which complete figures were compiled. I think I ought to indicate that this process has been very long term and very dramatic and traumatic in terms of its effect upon the industry. In 1956-57 the figure was not far short of 3.5 million head. That is a lot of dairy cattle. The statistic for that year was 3,451,450. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were a fair number of them as well because that was before aritifical insemination. From that time there has been a decline by, as was indicated, a process of attrition and a process of consolidation et cetera in the industry. But that process was not necessarily as well co-ordinated as it might have been in the early stage. The fall-out in the industry has seen many thousands of dairy farmers leave the industry largely from areas considered to be uneconomical or in conditions which were considered to be uneconomical. In my previous occupation I had quite a number of dairy farmers who had left the industry come into the College of Advanced Education as adult entries to undertake training as prospective teachers. I might suggest too that they came with a tremendous desire to succeed. They were marvellous students. The process of the decline will reach a point where we must recognise that any further reduction in the size of the national herd could well result in a threat to the viability of the industry itself. I think that this point has already been alluded to by the honourable member for Murray and the honourable member for Werriwa. I do not wish to give any further detail on that. However, I think the problem should be seen in conjunction with the need to maintain an export industry. Perhaps it would be more advisable for the Government to look to a restructuring of the administration of the industry with a review of the roles of the various bodies involved. This might have been more valuable than perhaps reclaiming some of the costs of inspection as we feel that this is perhaps rather a petty measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As honourable members would be aware, the industry is already subject to a series of imposts which result in considerable threats to the returns in the industry. Manufacturers with export potential will attempt to recoup the costs of this added charge by whatever means they can. In this case they tend to pass it back to the producer, thus reducing his or her profit margin. Currently allowing for the normal tensions that beset any complex industry, the dairying industry is in a fairly stable state and this impost will certainly not help because it is one of those imposts which tends to cause a shake-out down the line. </PARA>
<PARA> The production levels are now down to five billion litres. Care must be taken to maintain this level if we are to avoid the need to increase imports. Tonight we have already heard from both the honourable member for Murray and the honourable member for Werriwa about just what dangers lie in the increase of imports, especially from across the Tasman. I am quite sure that few dairy farmers look forward to a time when Australia is forced to import butter for its own use. With good management right across the industry this should not happen. What is obviously required is a national dairy strategy. As I have indicated earlier, there has been a major restructuring of the industry already in recent times. What we now need is to review the significance of these changes. Accompanying these changes has been the necessity to review the role and functions of the Australian Dairy Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) will agree that there is a need for an ongoing revision of the capacity of the Corporation to meet the needs of the industry as it is undergoing this change. At the moment there is little evidence that the Government has this awareness. The relationship of the ADC with the industry has changed considerably since its formation many years ago. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the fact that the ADC's early brief was heavily orientated towards the export of dairy products. Again, that was mentioned. At that time, when much of our dairy produce was exported, the ADC certainly was of vital importance, but its role has altered in a somewhat ad hoc way. Nowadays both the Government and the dairy industry have come to depend on the ADC to perform tasks related to the home or domestic market; in other words, the ADC is now expected to service the domestic requirements, a role which previously was performed by other bodies. If it is to perform its task adequately it must have adequate legislative authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask the Minister to give consideration to these changed circumstances with a view to bringing legislation into line with the needs. I am sure that the various State authorities, both those directly concerned with marketing and those representing producers and manufacturers, have found that the changed emphasis of the role of the Corporation has tended to bring some confusion into the industry. Already in debates within the industry it has been noted that the marketing structure of the industry is very fragmented and usually follows State borders. The effect is that, should there be a relaxation of the arrangements with, for instance, New Zealand-I know that the Minister and other honourable members are very much aware of this-our domestic market will surely suffer. If we are to exercise adequate control over the direction of the Australian dairy industry there is an urgent need for all groups responsible, such as State governments, the dairy marketing authorities and the ADC, to make their activities more convergent. </PARA>
<PARA> There appears to be a shortfall in interest in the future of the ADC by the Government, as I said. We on this side of the House request the Minister to take it upon himself to ensure that the ADC's future is clarified. Both the Minister and I, coming as we do from the leading State in dairy production, processing and manufacture, are aware of the disquiet that exists in the industry. I think you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be aware that under the rudderless, directionless and somewhat leaderless Liberal Government in Victoria, industry and business in that State are in the doldrums. We do not wish that state to extend to primary industry as well. I suggest that the Minister might address himself to the need for co-ordinating the industry. In that way he might assist not only the industry in Australia but also the economy of his State. I do not want to use the record of the Minister to bring pessimism to people in the industry, but I must say that in all honesty his record with respect to the Asia Dairy Industries scandal gives no one grounds for optimism. Nevertheless, we on this side of the House do not oppose the Bill. But we exhort the Government to take more positive steps to ensure an optimistic and sound future for the dairy industry. </PARA>

We just take our basic position: This is a rather penny pinching set of measures. For example, we just passed a measure to collect $7,000. It seemed hardly worth while. That amount is to be collected from the edible oils industry. The purpose of the Eggs (Export Inspection Charge) Bill is to impose charges from 1 July 1982 for the export inspection of eggs, the maximum rate of charge not to go above $22 for a thousand dozen eggs in shell and $16 a tonne for other egg products. The actual rate of charge will be specified in regulations. On the basis of current estimates of export production those charges will yield approximately $145,000 in a full year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess this provides an opportunity for me to say a few things about the state of the egg industry. As all honourable members are aware, an inquiry into the egg industry has been conducted in Victoria. The former Minister for Primary Industry there, Mr Smith, made some suggestions about ending the existing arrangements and there was a lot of debate about that. Currently the New South Wales Government is conducting an inquiry into the egg industry. I think the inquiry is chaired by Mr Gilchrist. To my knowledge the Government either does not have a copy of the report of that inquiry or has not acted on it. But certainly changes are being mooted there. </PARA>
<PARA> What we can say is that again the egg industry is in surplus despite all the mechanisms of the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities of Australia Act and the various requirements in the States on the upper levels of the number of hens people can keep. In the latest year for which we have figures, 1980-81, we exported 1.6 million dozen eggs and we also exported 8.9 kilotonnes of egg pulp. Of course, the industry faces the constant problem of feed costs. There is nothing new in that. Ever since I have been in the egg industry-my father also was in the egg industry and I think that would go back to about 1935-there have been complaints about the price of feed going up. But really over the past year or so in both New South Wales and Victoria the price of feed has risen faster than the price of eggs has risen. That has led to a problem in, if I may put it in these terms, the egg to feed price ratio. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, despite relatively constant hen numbers, production rose by 4.6 per cent- from 188 million dozen to 196.7 million dozen-in that last year. Of course, there are widespread allegations in the industry that someone is not counting all the hens in a proper way. It is an industry with problems. Of course, with that increase in the number of eggs produced, the percentage of commercial production being sold on the export market rose from 8.7 per cent, I think the figure was, to 13.1 per cent in the last year. Although the export market takes about 13 1/2 per cent of the production it contributes only 7.2 per cent of the gross value of commercial production. What we are saying is that Australia is selling on the export market virtually at a loss. The major market for our pulp exports is still Japan. We sell our eggs in a range of countries, many of which are in the Pacific. World egg production has been rising over the past 10 years or so, so there is simply no way that the Australian industry can keep up this level of production. I am afraid to say that hen quotas will have to be cut severely in 1981-82 to try to cut back on the large exportable surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> This industry is one that will undergo some change. It is one that always has been undergoing change and adjusting to the economic conditions. All the regulations between the States and at the Commonwealth level do not seem to have prevented the very basic thing which was attempted to be avoided, that is, over production. Since the introduction of the quota scheme the State egg boards have attempted to reduce the percentage of commercial production being sold on the export market but this simply has not worked. The structure of the industry has been towards fewer and larger farms and the capacity to sell hen quotas has accelerated this process, though the trend now is being seen to have slowed down as the potential to achieve further size economies has been reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the number of farms that have been shaken out of the industry it can be seen that the number has decreased by an incredible 77 per cent since 1968-69. This is a faster rate of contraction than occurred even in the dairy industry, where the number of farms has dropped enormously in the last 10 years. As I have said before and as I often say, the people who talk about the problems of reconstruction or adjustment in the manufacturing industry just do not seem to be aware of the fact that the rural industries have adjusted enormously. People have been shed from the rural industries and adjustments have taken place on farms with respect to productivity increases. I guess one could argue-the industry would argue; certainly the Federal Council of Poultry Farmers would argue-that this charge will act as a constraint on production. It would say, of course, that we need a surplus at this time, just as we do with the dairy industry, of something like 10 per cent to go on the export market to guarantee against shortfalls. In a depressed export market any charge levied on an industry will add pressure to that industry. For that reason, I think the point needs to be made that this Government is simply trying to get $145,000 out of an industry that again cannot really afford it. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Bill, I guess there has not been much of a chance to discuss honey in this House before. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, it is an important commodity, as the honourable member for Paterson has said. He would know that there are 2,141 apiarists in Australia , that they have on average 511 beehives and that they produce 24,954 tonnes of honey worth a bit over $19m. It is an industry spread throughout Australia and of course it is a vital industry for the fruit industry for pollination purposes . There have been some complaints to me from the industry in recent times, but, as I said earlier in my comments tonight, the Country Party assures me that everything is all for the best and the best of all possible worlds. Perhaps I talk to the wrong people. For example, at present there is a proposal to introduce a levy on honey sold on the domestic market to subsidise export sales of honey. It is a very familiar tale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the view of many apiarists who have written to me that the attempt to get a levy system introduced has come about through pressure from the large export oriented honey packers. I looked up some of the records of this industry. An editorial in the May 1981 issue of the Beekeeper was very critical of the activities of the Honey Corporation of Australia. As I said, it is a familiar tale. Since that time many of the shareholders of the Honey Corporation of Australia have received payment in full for their honey after the threat of legal action. Of course, what the editorial was referring to was the slump in prices. The Honey Corporation of Australia packs a high percentages of the honey sold in the eastern States of Australia and it is the opinion of apiarists who have written to me that by causing many of its shareholders to sell their honey to other smaller packers at reduced prices a lack of confidence has caused an artificial glut situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important for the industry to know the quantity of honey that is produced in any season. The season ends in June. Then the industry would have a greater understanding of whether there is actually a glut. Yet for the first time, I am informed, the Australian Honey Board has released its annual report for the financial year ending June 1981 without figures for Australia-wide production. Perhaps the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) could inform us why this is so. I hope he will take some interest in the honey industry. The Federal Council of Australia Apiarists Association has appointed a five-man committee to look into the problems facing the industry in conjunction with five honey packer representatives. Again my information is that some of the apiarists were not all that happy with the people who were put on to that committee as representatives of the apiarists themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> This industry does export quite a bit. On the figures available to me it exported in 1980-81 about 8,373 tonnes or about 33.5 per cent of its production. So it is a large exporter in percentage terms. It earns something like $9.5m. The major buyers are the United Kingdom and West Germany. Australia, it should be known, is the eighth largest honey producing country in the world and we can be proud of that. The industry is very concerned about the inspection charge, again coming as it does at a time when the market is in its most depressed state for over a decade. At present the export scene is not bright, although it has stabilised somewhat recently. Two major factors account for the depressed market arrangements for our honey exports. They are, firstly, the upwards movement in the Australian dollar compared with sterling and the Deusche mark and, secondly, the flooding of the international market with cheap honey from China. The end result is that it is becoming unprofitable for many buyers to sell on the export market and they have begun to compete for access to the domestic market, causing depression of the price in that market. The industry is looking for means of price stabilisation at present. Although about $6.75 a tonne is not a great deal , it does come at a time when the industry is desperately trying to remain profitable and really needs to find new overseas markets. The Opposition does not oppose these Bills but, again, this measure is a penny pinching measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise on the adjournment the continuing problem which confronts Vietnam veterans because, for some two years now, they have sought unsuccessfully from both a series of Ministers for Veterans' Affairs and the Government, a judicial inquiry which would inquire into their exposure to the range of defoliants employed in Vietnam and deal with the problems of the physical, mental and other conditions which confront these veterans and their families as a result of such exposure. The range of problems which confront these servicemen and their families is, I believe, well known to honourable members of this Parliament and does not on this occasion require repetition by me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the Government has equally steadfastly refused such an inquiry despite the fact that the argument for it has received support from honourable members on both sides of the House, including indeed some Ministers.

<PARA>DEFOLIATION PROGRAMME 1 ATF NUI DAT APR-NOV 69</PARA>
<PARA>Introduction</PARA>
<PARA> 1. During the wet season a defoliation programme will be carried out at Nui Dat to defoliate the perimeter wire, ammunition dump surrounds, radio aerial complexes and any other sites which may present a fire hazard during the following dry season.</PARA>
<PARA>Types of Defoliants</PARA>
<PARA> 2. During this programme two types of defoliants will be used. The characteristics of these defoliants are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> a. knock down type-This chemical affects that part of the vegetation which is above the ground causing it to dry off in approx 48 hours. It does not affect the root system of the plant consequently normal growth resumes in 7 days.</PARA>
<PARA> b. Sterilant Type-This chemical actually sterilises the soil surrounding the root system of the plant and denies growth to any type of vegetation for a period of up to two years. It requires something in the order of three inches of rain to soak this chemical into the soil and its effects are not seen for approx 5 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA>Unit Responsibilities</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To ensure that the spraying programme is effective units must be prepared to carry out the following tasks:</PARA>
<PARA> a. During the current dry season, burn vegetation along the perimeter wire and keep this growth down to a minimum until such time as the perimeter can be sprayed.</PARA>
<PARA> b. During spraying operations in the unit, provide personnel to lift any mines and flares along the perimeter wire and to open up the wire to give access to all portions of the perimeter.</PARA>
<PARA>Personnel</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The field regiment and each infantry battalion is to detach one soldier to HQ Coy 1 ATF for the period 1 Apr-30 Nov 69. Because of the toxicity of the chemicals used and the rigid safety precautions which must be observed, the soldiers provided must be intelligent types.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. It is preferable that the personnel provided remain unchanged throughout the entire period of the programme. If this is not possible they must not be changed more frequently than once every three months.</PARA>
<PARA>Control</PARA>
<PARA> 6. During the period of their detachment, the four soldiers provided will be under the direct control of 1 ATF Hyg Offr.</PARA>
<PARA>Nominations</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The Defence Department has seen this document and to date its authenticity has not been denied. I believe that as a result of a Press statement which I made this afternoon the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has seen the document, but to date has chosen to make no comment upon it .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In October 1969, the United States military forces suspended the use of agent orange and other defoliants in populated areas of Vietnam because of the toxicity of such chemicals and the problems they became aware of regarding the exposue to them of civilian populations. However, the then Australian Government continued to use highly dangerous chemicals until 1971. That is borne out by the statements which are contained in the document that I have had incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA> During the whole of that period, the present Prime Minister was the Minister for Defence. I refer the House to his statement in this place on 9 March 1971. The then Minister for Defence, the present Prime Minister, told the House that the conduct of Australian military operations in Vietnam was ultimately his decision, his responsibility. He dealt at some length and in some detail with the way in which the relationship between the military forces in Vietnam and himself as Minister for Defence operated. There can be no question that if, in fact, Australian military forces were being exposed to toxic defoliants either on the Prime Minister's own statement he knew or-and this is the only presumption the House can draw-he ought to have known.</PARA>
<PARA> Having regard to the answers that the Prime Minister has furnished on this matter to the Parliament over two years, I do not believe that he can any longer remain silent as to the extent of his knowledge and approval of the use of these toxic chemicals. As I said at the outset, I for one have been at a loss to understand the Government's inaction, despite the support given by honourable members on both sides and also some Ministers, who have told members of the Vietnam Veterans' Association that they believe their problems ought to be subject to a judicial inquiry, which they would support. At this stage I can only reach the conclusion that the real reason the Government is refusing these men and their families a judicial inquiry is that it is more concerned to protect the reputation of the Prime Minister, when he was Minister for Defence, concerning his responsibility in these matters, than it is to see justice done to the Vietnam veterans and their families. The documents that have now been made public require a full explanation from the Prime Minister as to his responsibility. I call upon him to make such a statement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Residents of the Upper Hunter region are greatly concerned at the curtailment of the services of the Australian Broadcasting Commission broadcasting station 2UH, which is to take effect tomorrow, 26 February.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Upper Hunter region is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia, in particular because of the expansion of coal mining and large associated industries, and it is very disappointing indeed that this action is contemplated . At this time, irrespective of economic conditions, there should not be an emasculation of ABC services to this area. The 2UH breakfast program has been in operation for many years and is heard by a wide circle of listeners over a huge area. A separate program for 2UH has been in operation for at least six years. It was further expanded in April 1981 to come into line with the other three stations around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The afternoon program on 2UH began as an experiment in May 1981. It has received a very enthusiastic and favourable reaction because ABC Sydney was providing a program for 2UH only. It must be remembered that a Sydney program which comes into a rich agricultural and mining area is of little consequence to listeners. It seemed more sensible to provide an interesting program from 2UH Newcastle. In addition, the important Rural Department wished market reports to be broadcast in the evening, thus bringing the station in line with three other radio stations. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposed reduction Station 2UH is to lose seven hours of local content. This is of importance to country people. Station 2UH market reports will not be read in the evening. The Rural Officer will still present rural material by fading it in and out of the Radio 1 program from Sydney. Market reports will be broadcast a day late, on the following morning. What is the use of market reports that are a day late? Farmers, graziers and country producers want market reports when the markets are being held, not a day late.</PARA>
<PARA> Station 2UH has a strength of one kilowatt, but it is interesting to note that Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory and Fingal in Tasmania also have a strength of one kilowatt. It is important to note that the vast majority of Radio 3 areas have a strength of at least 10 kilowatts and in most cases greater capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, the morning program was not an experiment. The afternoon program was initially but, because Sydney ABC was providing a service for 2UH only and, because of the desire to broadcast market reports, it was agreed that Station 2UH should do its own programs. </PARA>
<PARA> This vastly important region is badly served by having a one kilowatt strength station. The Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) has been asked to intervene to see that this great developing area receives the 2UH broadcasts as was formerly the situation. The service in no way should be curtailed to the detriment of the people in the Hunter Valley. This is an important matter. The people in the Valley regard it as important because the relaying of market information is vital to the carrying on of the primary industries in the area. The people want to know what their sheep, cattle, pigs and grain are bringing because it is important in regard to supplying the local markets. I ask that the Minister give immediate attention to this matter to give a service which is necessary to this progressive and developing area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I spoke about the disastrous effects of ad hoc government decisions on the private sector in Canberra. The recently announced freeze on Government expenditure is causing serious concern amongst local business and industry leaders. It is not good enough for the Government to freeze Commissioner for Housing loan funds one day and then lift the freeze several days later. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), in his reply to my speech last week, urged us all to believe that the situation is not so terrible now that the funds have been unfrozen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Minister has overlooked the major point of my speech which was to high-light the instability in the Canberra economy generated by the Government's stop-start policies. No business can operate efficiently in an unpredictable commercial environment and I am very disappointed that the Minister is not able to grasp this point and put Canberra's case in Cabinet more effectively. Tonight I would like to discuss some of the wide-ranging effects that the cutbacks will have in Canberra. Honourable members will be aware that as there is no state or local level of government in Canberra, Cabinet's sudden decision to throw out its Budget plan for the year has had an immediate effect on schools, hospitals, welfare services, housing and so forth. In other words, every time there is a cutback in Federal Government expenditure, Canberra is the area that feels it the most. Local contractors and business people have, overnight, been deprived of their livelihoods. I read from one of the letters I have received this week. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Due to the recent period of low activity in the ACT the sole remaining source of work for my firm was commissions from the Department of Housing and Construction. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to explain that these had been cut and writes:</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the cutbacks was to instantly cut off the source of income to my firm, since all existing commissions were at or nearing completion. Since this is a small local firm, it cannot now guarantee to pay staff beyond the end of this month, and will almost certainly have to lay off staff, including myself. </PARA>
<PARA> With almost all construction projects in Canberra in recent years being sent by the NCDC to interstate consultants and contractors, this instant cutting off to the small remaining amount of work for local firms has had a drastic effect at a time when the Government is publicising its desire to 'stimulate private enterprise in Canberra'. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those were the words of the Minister for the Capital Territory. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>The effects of continual blows to the local economy on private enterprise workers and their families, has received no publicity. I feel that the perpetrators of these petty economies, which can only cost more money in the long term, should be made aware of the effect they are having on ordinary people outside their ivory towers. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat, that is a letter from a local businessman, from a person such as Government members are supposed to be supporting. In Canberra we have a situation where we have a large number of small businesses. Every day more of them are going under and the reason for that is that they want a stable economy in which to plan. They have come to terms with the fact that there will not be big growth in Canberra. But what they want to know is where they will be in five years' time. They want to plan and they want that plan adhered to. They do not want a continuation of the stop-start policies that we have seen in Canberra over the last six years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to do something unusual in the parliamentary sense because although honourable members are aware that frequently there are many matters and issues that bring us together, so often the forms of the House do not allow those who read Hansard or those who listen in to know that there are matters and issues that sometimes bring us together. Frequently we do not address ourselves to them. The first of the two matters I would like to mention relates to the unfortunate death of Emeritus Professor W. E. H. Stanner last year. Bill Stanner was well known to members of this House, because of his involvement in our committee system and because of his dedicated and life-long interest in the Aboriginal people of Australia. I know the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) was interested enough to join me in mentioning Bill Stanner because of his work, particularly with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. A number of eulogies have been written about Bill Stanner. Dr H. C. Coombs wrote about him in the journal of the Australian National University. He had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Bill Stanner, in character as in career, was a man of many facets. To read even the shorthand of the Who's Who record of his life is to range across the world and through the major events and issues of this century. And to read the record of his Curriculum Vitae or the introduction to the book of essays written in his honour by his professional colleagues, is to become aware of the powerful impact of a creative imagination on the anthropological discipline to which so much of his life was devoted and of his involvement in the institutions and policies which developed and used its ideas. </PARA>
<PARA>The Canberra Times, I think more adequately than I could, reviewed his outstanding career. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> From 1967 to 1977 he was a member of the small but very influential Council for Aboriginal Affairs, which advised a succession of Prime Ministers, from Mr Holt to Mr Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA> His ABC Boyer lectures in 1971 reached and touched many Australians because he wrote and spoke so beautifully. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that those who heard those lectures could not have failed to have been impressed. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1979 he published 'White Man Got No Dreaming' . . . a collection of his best writing. </PARA>
<PARA>I knew him particularly when I became a member of this Parliament in 1973 because, strange as it may seem, I was co-opted, into what seems now to be a very natural interest, that of Aboriginal affairs. I joined the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. During that time when I served with Gordon Bryant and Bill Wentworth, names familiar to all honourable members for their interest in Aboriginal Affairs, Bill Stanner was the specialist adviser to the Committee between 1974 and 1975. I remember going around with him particularly in northern New South Wales. He was able to explain so much of what I was to see and to help me appreciate so much of the hardship that I think some honourable members readily know and understand. Professor Stanner was particularly a consultant to the Land Commissioner in the Northern Territory, Mr Justice Toohey, from 1977 to 1979. One could go on but it is clear that his career has been an outstanding one. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that I want to mention briefly is the role of the Parliamentary Amnesty Group in this parliament. The group had its annual meeting the other evening and some 51 members of Parliament have joined or rejoined to this time. I am pleased to mention to honourable members that the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) is now the Chairman of the group and, succeeding me as Secretary of the group, is the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). This is a group that has performed a great deal of outstanding work in the Parliament over a long period. I am pleased that it will be in good hands to continue its work during the life of this Parliament. We had the opportunity the other evening to hear from Professor Vinh. I am sure that honourable members could not read a more elucidating story of a man's life in terms of challenge from the dictators of both the right and the left. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not often agree 100 per cent with the comments of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) but on this occasion I do. I wish to join in the remarks he made about Professor Stanner who was a man well known to my father and likewise his recommendation in relation to the Parliamentary Amnesty Group and his good wishes for its future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown) in his Press statement yesterday on funding of the Community Youth Support Scheme projects for the period 1 March to 30 June 1982 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The great majority of projects will receive a substantial increase in funds of 15 per cent to cover increased costs and to help pay travel costs of disadvantaged CYSS participants. </PARA>
<PARA>It is difficult to imagine other than disadvantaged participants, but I leave in his qualification. This would put an end to what he termed 'Opposition scaremongering'. This latter epithet, no doubt, is his erudite criticism of our concern that a government which has already attempted to eliminate CYSS once might try it again. This 15 per cent-it is only 15 per cent in some projects; a maximum amount-is to cover fares and increased costs. Some projects which will be continued will receive no increases. As with all government statements it is always wise to separate rhetoric from actual experience; so I shall draw the attention of the House to the effect of this decision on two of the three projects in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I take first the Victoria Park CYSS which, despite the fact that its number of participants is about the State average, receives the lowest funding in Western Australia. As honourable members would be aware, under the old funding scheme the travel fund was separated from the rest of the individual project budget. It is now included within it. On this basis, the Victoria Park CYSS spends about $ 760 weekly, of which $80 is spent on fares. Therefore, the incorporation of the fare component automatically requires a 10 per cent increase simply to stand still. So two-thirds of the increase disappears immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> Then it must be understood that the 15 per cent increase is calculated against a 42 week period, much of which was a period of crisis. Particularly at the latter end of the period when the Government threatened closure, usage fell in some areas quite dramatically. Throughout the period the financing of the projects relied heavily on project officers not taking pay rises and cutbacks in funds spent on CYSS activities. It would take much more than 5 per cent to restore the real funding of previous years. Thus, assuming the Victoria Park CYSS is to restore itself to its past level of operation, it requires at least a 15 per cent increase, I would say. Assuming that it gets that, then it will still find itself short. There has recently been a 10 per cent increase in bus fares. The Victoria Park project officers are the lowest paid of any project officers in Western Australia. The wages bill should go up by about $34 a week, which would mean an additional 5 per cent requirement on that alone. Effectively , a 15 per cent increase in grants to the Victoria Park CYSS would leave it behind its operating capabilities of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the Swan CYSS project to point out that 15 per cent of its previous $1,000 a week expenditure went on participants' travel. So assuming it receives the maximum amount, then it too will stand still in terms of receipts from the Government. When I asked the Minister last year whether he could give some consideration to adjusting the travel allowance, and I refer to question on notice No. 3080, he replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Should it emerge that the rate of allowance is inadequate for its purpose the Government will give consideration to adjusting the rate. </PARA>
<PARA>The CYSS projects in my area surveyed their participants to assess the adequacy of the then $6 a week for participants allowance. Of those visiting the projects daily, over one-third spent more than the $6 allowance simply as travel from their homes to the project. If they went out on visits for voluntary work, work experience and activities associated with CYSS, and the new guidelines seek greater emphasis on these activities, the weekly cost often exceeded $10. </PARA>
<PARA> There are particular difficulties in outer metropolitan CYSS projects such as the Swan CYSS project. But experience with such inadequacies is widespread. But on all my inquiries I have been informed, as I have said, that the granting of the $6 travel allowance will be up to the CYSS committees. It will not be automatic. If this is not the case in Western Australia I will be happy to be corrected. If I am right, then CYSS becomes unique because it will be the only one of the Government's schemes where the allowance, inadequate as it is, does not apply. </PARA>
<PARA> What all this means is that the 15 per cent increase is no increase. Given that it is not general and is based on expenditures in a period of unprecedented stringency in CYSS expenditures, most projects will experience cutbacks. That is not a promising start for the new guidelines, nor is it likely to lay the ghost of Opposition scaremongering haunting the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard recently of a great deal of incompetence in the administration of New South Wales. Public knowledge about that is growing rapidly. I will leave the members of the public to make their own decisions. I raise one matter that has become a glaring example of incompetence hurting a lot of young people. It was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning. I do not want to refer only to that. I want to refer first of all not only to incompetence but also to a growing fetish about secrecy to protect that incompetence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was reminded yesterday in a news release that the State Government of New South Wales, which is fearful about the problems in the power industry at the present time because of the backlash from the people, apparently decided that the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales should not be given permission to visit certain power stations in order to study the problems. For that reason I take it that that Leader of the Opposition had to visit Victoria yesterday to find out a few simple facts about the operation of power stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that concerned me this morning was a report of secrecy or attempted secrecy relating to the Board of Senior School Studies which has recently conducted the marking of papers for the New South Wales Higher School Certificate, probably the most important examination for young people, more important in many ways than any examinations at universities, which in many cases can be taken again or deferred. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that the Higher School Certificate is a tremendously important examination. When we find that some computer somewhere in the system has decided to spit out marks that are patently very way out; when we find that those marks are transmitted to people who then make decisions; and then when we find that some four or six weeks later some hundreds of young people have made decisions and commitments, many of which are irreversible, and are based on those incorrect computer marks, we just wonder whether we cannot get a little more competence somewhere to program computers or whatever is required so that those young people are not hurt. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from the newspaper report that the members of the Board of Senior School Studies were told not to talk to the media about this mistake. It was a gross error. I always believe that if people make mistakes they ought to admit them, especially in the bureaucracy because the bureaucracy has no particular reason to do otherwise. It is tremendously important in a democracy for people to know what has happened. I suppose that means that perhaps some people have to take the rap sometimes. It is tremendously important to avoid secrecy in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder what happened to many of those children who have been messed up in the marking of a particular paper. I believe it was the three unit English paper. I just wonder how many other papers have been messed up. We just do not know, do we? If it has happened in this case there is a statistical possibility that it happened in others. I despair that whatever system has been adopted in New South Wales for the marking of these examinations might be wrong. There may be some system that is not working. That can affect the whole future of many young people. It is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that in my own electorate of Eden-Monaro, where there are some 14 or 15 high schools, there are quite a number of people who sat for that three unit English paper. Over and above that, of course, there are thousands of children who sat for other papers. They must be sitting at home tonight wondering whether they really did get better marks. That sort of confusion is the wrong start in the lives of young people who are about to go out into tertiary education or into the work force. The tampering with young people's futures by incompetent people who, I suppose, will fall back on some excuse that is just not justified. I wonder whether next year the children will be able to have faith in the system and whether teachers will be able to say to the children: 'Work hard; you will be judged on your merits'. Certainly for many people in this case their merits were not judged and they have made their decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The supplementary answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been brought to my attention that the answer I provided on 26 March 1981 to Question 456 of 26 February 1981 by Mr Willis, the honourable member for Gellibrand, as to whether the Nugan Hand Bank had had any dealings with the Foreign Investment Review Board or the Foreign Investment Division of the Treasury was not complete.</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated in my response, there were no foreign investment cases in respect of which the Nugan Hand Bank was a party and there was no indexed record of communication between the Nugan Hand group and the Foreign Investment Review Board or the Foreign Investment Division in the Department. It has now come to light that there was an application in 1976 involving Nugan Hand acting as an intermediary on behalf of a foreign client. As it was the practice at the time to enter in the index recording such applications only the names of principal parties concerned, there was no reference in it to Nugan Hand.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal involved an application in November 1976 by Nugan Hand on behalf of a Hong Kong company seeking approval to acquire a shelf company in Australia as a corporate vehicle to invest funds with Nugan Hand. The proposal was examined in consultation with relevant Government authorities and approved by the Government in November 1976. Subsequently exchange control approval was given for a deposit of $150 000.</PARA>
<PARA> All relevant information known to my Department, the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Reserve Bank concerning the shelf company and its subsequent financial transactions has been supplied to the Commonwealth-State Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking which is investigating the Nugan Hand matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Section 8 of the Sales Tax Procedure Act 1934 and Section 46 of the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930 impose additional tax on a taxpayer in certain circumstances. Where a person fails or neglects to furnish any return or information required to be furnished, the additional tax is at the rate of 10 per cent per annum of the tax involved calculated for the period of the person's failure to furnish the return or information. Additional tax at the maximum rate of 200 per cent of the tax underpaid is imposed by section 8 in respect of certain other omissions, for example, failure to include taxable sales in a return or showing taxable sales in a return at an incorrect rate. The Commissioner of Taxation has the power to remit fully or in part the additional tax imposed by these sections if he considers the circumstances of a particular case warrants it.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The proposals to amend the sales tax machinery and liability provisions announced on 20 August 1981 include a proposal (proposal 8) to bring the sales tax law on additional tax into line with the current income tax law. To this end , I indicated that it was the Government's intention to bring forward amendments which would, among other changes, change the rate of 10 per cent per annum to a flat rate of 100 per cent. The Commissioner's power of remission would remain. The circumstances in which the maximum rate of 200 per cent applies would be unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The proposed amendments are scheduled for introduction into the Parliament during the Autumn Sittings and, insofar as proposal 8 is concerned, it is intended that the changes will take effect upon the amendments becoming law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. However, as 1980-81 income year returns will be assessed mainly during the current financial year the available information is incomplete. In the period up to 6 November 1981 the number of income tax returns in which deductions had been allowed for superannuation paid by self-employed individuals and unsupported employees was 38,358. This number represents about 0.9 per cent of taxable and non-taxable returns of individuals assessed during that period. It should be noted that assessments of taxpayers subject to provisional tax began being processed early in November 1981. This means that the available figures do not extend in any significant way to the class of taxpayer most likely to claim deductions under the new provisions. The returns processed to date that include claims for these deductions relate mainly to unsupported employees.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) The cost to income tax revenue in 1980-81 had been estimated at about $9m and the full-year cost at $100m. The cost of deductions allowed to date in respect of 1980-81 income year assessments is about $5.5m, but the total cost for the 1980-81 income year cannot be estimated precisely at this stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) In mid 1978 the then Chief of Air Force Materiel made public statements explaining 'the reasons for the decision that project development of the Tactical Fighter Force should proceed with emphasis on a new fighter with primary capabilities in the air-to-air role'.</PARA>
<PARA> In the same statement, he also said 'it would be ideal if the TFF comprises aircraft fully competent in both roles. However, the nature of the roles is such that it is not yet technologically possible to achieve full specialisation in both roles in one aircraft. Modern aircraft designed for the air-to-air role, however, generally have an inherently good capability or potential for the air- to-surface role.' He also stated 'if an order of priority is to be established between the two TFF roles, less strategic risk would attend primacy being given to the air-to-air capability.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the early stages of the definition of the TFF project, it was not by any means apparent that a full multi-role aircraft would be available. In those circumstances, the primary requirement for an air-to-air fighter had been established, largely because an aircraft developed for that role could be more readily adapted for other roles.</PARA>
<PARA> A two type solution was considered a possibility at that stage, but as the evaluation process progressed and more became known about the support, cost and manpower penalties of such an approach, it became readily apparent that a two- type solution to Australian requirements within available resources would not have been a practical proposition.</PARA>
<PARA> Attainment of air superiority is generally regarded as a necessary condition for being able to undertake other tasks in the air. Therefore, a tactical fighter's proficiency in the air-to-air role has a fundamental importance. Consequently, the contenders on the Australian short list were narrowed down to aircraft that (as an essential elegibility criterion) could adequately satisfy these fundamental requirements. However, the service life of the New Tactical Fighter will be long, 20 to 25 years, and there is no certain knowledge of what emerging threats the TFF could be called upon to deter or combat over that timeframe. Accordingly, having short-listed a selection of aircraft that satisfied fundamental requirements, and having rejected beforehand the option of a two-type solution, the final evaluation was done on the basis of according equal emphasis to the air-to-air and air-to-surface roles.</PARA>
<PARA> The FA18 will provide a high and enduring level of competence in both the air- to-air and air-to-surface roles, and was selected on the basis that it represented the best investment of the large sums that would have been required regardless of which option was chosen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The 1976 Defence White Paper stated that 'Tactical fighters and their associated weapons have been developed to such a stage of diversity that it is probably no longer practicable for pilots to be operationally efficient in the whole range of skills required in air-to-air and air-to-surface roles'. This statement was made before the overseas evaluation teams of 1979, 1980 and 1981 had gained an intimate knowledge of the capabilities of the contender aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The human factors interface between man and machine was a subject that received close attention in the final evaluations. Advances in fighter aircraft technology and capabilities have been such that it is widely suggested that the capability of the human operator has become the limiting factor in overall weapons system capability. The evaluation teams noted the thousands of hours of simulator development work that had been conducted during the early design phase of the F/A-18. They concluded that the F/A-18 represents the most efficient interface between man and machine yet developed in a fighter aircraft and that the F/A-18 represents a quantum advancement in the number of complex operational tasks that a single pilot will be able to undertake efficiently under combat conditions. However, it will not be until more operational experience is gained on the aircraft that the RAAF will decide what proficiency levels pilots will be capable of maintaining in each role.</PARA>
<PARA> RAAF policy is to give equal emphasis to the air-to-air roles and air-to- surface roles in peace-time training in recognition of the fact that there is no certain knowledge of the contingent situations the TFF might in future be called upon to combat or deter. In the Mirage force each squadron denotes 50 per cent of its training time to each role; however, the policy could equally as well be satisfied by specialising to certain degrees in different squadrons whilst maintaining an equal emphasis across the total force. The degree of specialisation within different squadrons, if any, is a matter for future decision. The Tactical Fighter Force will continue, however, to maintain proficiency in both roles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The trade deficit for the month of September 1981 was $238 million, which represented an increase of $170 million on the estimated deficit for August 1981 .</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The trade deficit for 1980-81 is presently estimated at $339 million.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia usually experiences a deficit on the current account of its balance of payments (that is, the net outcome of all trade and 'invisible' transactions). This is the way in which the supplementation of Australia's domestic savings by foreign savings is translated into additional real goods and services required to enhance our rate of economic development. It has rarely been the case that exports receipts have matched the sum of imports and the deficit on net invisibles, nor is that a desirable goal in itself in Australia's case.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes, as a matter of arithmetic. However, see answer to part (3).</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Because of seasonal variations, it would be unwise to extrapolate figures for a single quarter over the financial year as a whole. However, the trade and current account deficits in 1981-82 seem likely at this stage to be somewhat larger than expected at Budget time.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The main reasons for the trade deficit in the recent September quarter appear to be the strength of domestic demand in Australia-and in particular the continuing strength of business fixed investment in Australia-relative to that in our main export markets (which has resulted in imports increasing faster than exports); industrial disputes and drought-related supply shortages in Australia which have reduced shipments of some export commodities; and the appreciation of the Australian dollar during 1980-81, which has facilitated the growth of imports and, in the process, provided a useful dampening of inflationary pressures within the Australian economy.</PARA>
