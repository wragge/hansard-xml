<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address a question to the Minister for Administrative Services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for that question. This is a subject that has been reported with some feeling in newspapers around the country. I think that all honourable members would be well aware of the very great problems we have in Australia with drug trafficking and the use of drugs. We therefore have an arrangement with liaison officers from the Australian Federal Police stationed in countries overseas, particularly in South East Asia. It is important to understand that Australia also has international obligations under, for example, United Nations agreements. The purpose of the liaison officers in a country is to exchange information that comes into their hands on drug related offences. Of course, they receive information from their counterparts in that country and the various authorities in the countries then act on that information. I make the point very strongly that it is up to the country which receives the information to act. Sometimes that does result in Australian citizens being tried and convicted in courts and placed in prison. I make two points about that. First of all, my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and other Ministers who preceded him, and I, have made it clear in a number of public statements that Australian citizens run severe risks if they indulge in drug trafficking activities. The second point is that we have made it clear also that if they are arrested, tried and convicted in another country, whilst we will offer all consular facilities that we can to ensure that they are properly defended and, if they go to gaol, that they get a fair deal, that is about all we can do. However, they will have to run the gamut of that country's laws and prison conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF7">Mr INNES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to his statement on 15 September 1981 in this House that 'if one holds down interest rates in certain areas too far and too long, available funds for housing will dry up completely'. Is it a fact that in Victoria, where building society rates are not regulated, interest rates on home loans are the highest in Australia and are one per cent to 1.5 per cent higher than in New South Wales? Is it also a fact that the decline in building society loan approvals in Victoria over the past year was 50 per cent greater than in New South Wales? Finally, is it a fact that the main impact of higher interest rates is to exclude increasing numbers of families from home ownership and to make more people reliant on the rental market for housing and accommodation rather than to make any improvement in the availability of housing finance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall the statement which I made and to which the honourable gentleman referred, and I do not retreat in any way from what was contained in that statement. It is true that, as interest rates rise, some people, because of the limits of their incomes, are thereby denied the opportunity of purchasing homes. That is part of the problem with interest rates. I have said to the House on a number of occasions that the difficult areas in housing, apart from the overall availability of money for housing which is obviously related to the competitive interest rate structure of deposit-taking institutions which lend for housing, relate to people who have borrowed fairly recently and to those who are trying to gather a deposit in order to purchase a home. They are affected by rising land and property prices as much as by rising interest rates, and in some parts of Australia by more than rising interest rates. The third category of disadvantaged is, of course, renters. That has been my and the Government's analysis of the difficulties in this area for some time, and I see no reason to revise any of the earlier statements that I made on this subject.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether it is because of a current political combat in Victoria that there has been, once again, an emergence of the rumour that the Army Survey Regiment at Bendigo is to be moved. I must say to the honourable gentleman and to the House that there is no proposal before me or before the Government to move the regiment, but I cannot speak for five, 10 or 15 years time.

I say to the honourable gentleman that having regard to the very substantial capital investment in Fortuna, I appeal to the commonsense of people possessed with it. That fines the field down a little. I think it was in January this year that my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services announced the letting of a contract for some $3.5m for computerised mapping apparatus. That will be installed progressively. The answer to the honourable gentleman's question: 'Will that be made available to the public?' is yes, it will be through various agencies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Education, concerns the decision of the Government to invoke the Commonwealth Employees ( Employment Provisions) Act in respect of striking Australian Capital Territory teachers. Can the Minister say when the first suspensions of the striking teachers will occur and can he inform the House whether those teachers who are suspended will be automatically reinstated at the conclusion of the present industrial dispute?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr FIFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can give no assurance that teachers who are suspended from duty as a result of strike action will ultimately be reinstated. The Act provides for dismissal and such action is likely to be considered if the industrial dispute continues. In answer to the first part of the honourable member's question regarding suspension, let me point out that the decision taken yesterday by the Government applies to those teachers who engage in strike action on or after the commencement of duty today. I have not yet been advised as to whether any suspensions have occurred today, but I give the honourable member and the House an assurance that any teacher who engages in strike action on or after the commencement of duty today will be suspended. I also want to make it clear that this is an unnecessary industrial dispute. It is causing great hardship to many students and great inconvenience to many parents in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fact that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has made a determination that the new rates of pay will apply from today even if that determination is not taken up for some time. As I pointed out in answer to a question in this House yesterday, the Public Service Board of the Commonwealth is awaiting determinations in the eastern States. The tribunals which currently are sitting in the eastern States will make determinations before the Commonwealth Public Service Board makes an offer. So the two points that are very relevant to this dispute are, firstly, that the Public Service Board has indicated that it will make an offer and, secondly, that it has made it clear that the offer will apply as from today. There is a firm undertaking in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government of the Commonwealth is not going to stand by idly while children 's education is being unnecessarily affected and disrupted in this way by a group of irresponsible teachers. I deplore the action of the ACT Teachers Federation in directing its members not to attend certain schools that are on a roster for strike action over the coming days. We hear a lot in this place and in other forums throughout the Commonwealth about the contribution-the very great contribution-that government schools make to education in Australia and in particular to education in the Australian Capital Territory. The action of the Teachers Federation in the Australian Capital Territory is designed to destroy confidence in the government school system. The Commonwealth is not going to stand by idly. We will take whatever action we consider to be reasonable and necessary in the circumstances.</PARA>

I have stated on a number of occasions that, for my part, I would resolutely oppose any disturbing of the Shoalwater Bay exercise area. Nevertheless, inquiries have been made. Some may describe them as tentative. For my part, I would describe them as having firmer characteristics. It has been suggested that the Commonwealth should surrender Port Clinton in lieu of other land in the area. No formal proposal has been put before the Commonwealth. I would not like to be regarded as insensitive upon this point but if one is put forward the Commonwealth would be under an obligation to hear the other side of the argument, and as a consequence, we would attend to that. But I say to the honourable gentleman and to all those who may be concerned and interested in this matter that my sense of resolution to the surrender of Port Clinton remains as firm as ever.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the contrary, the honourable gentleman has interpreted my statement wrongly because any reading of that statement should make it very plain that Australia has done much better than the rest of the world in spite of difficult world conditions. The whole point of the statement was to indicate that the Government of this country must have policies that minimise, to the maximum extent possible, the effects of adverse world circumstances on the Australian economy. That is precisely what we have done. I regret that the honourable gentleman's interpretation has been inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday I answered a question about taxation. When we came into government there was a massive deficit which was blowing out. We have reduced that deficit, firstly, by a rigid control of expenditure and secondly, by a more straightforward approach to taxation because this country has got to pay its way as it goes. Having said that and having done that, the claims on the tax dollars of Australians by this Government have been reduced by 2 1/2 cents in the dollar or $3,700m in the course of a full year. If we were spending the proportion that the Leader of the Opposition did as Treasurer for a short time, then we would be spending an extra $3,700m this year. To that extent, the tax burden is significantly less than it would have been.</PARA>

What the State Labor Minister in the dying Holgate Government is doing, of course, is to misrepresent totally the fact that the Commonwealth Grants Commission, in its report on relativities, made certain recommendations that, if implemented, would have a particular effect. Everybody, and not least the Tasmanian Government because it was represented by the former Premier at the Premiers Conference that dealt with the matter, knows that we went out of our way to protect those States that would be adversely affected by the immediate implementation of that Grants Commission report by calling for a further inquiry to be carried out. In the face of that, which is well known to the Tasmanian Government and to every Tasmanian Minister, for Mr Aulich to put out a document of that kind is to mislead totally the Tasmanian public and is an example of a Government that is well and truly on the run.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Treasurer aware that over the two years from 1978-79 to 1980-81 the total net profit after tax of finance companies jumped by 120 per cent while their total income rose by only 34 per cent? Is it a fact that the greatest contribution to these higher profits came from leasing business which carries substantial tax benefits? Does this immense growth in profitability of a largely unregulated segment of the finance industry indicate the effect that wholesale deregulation will have on the industry? If so, will the Treasurer repudiate deregulation and immediately look at controlling finance companies in common with all other financial institutions to the good of the community as a whole?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find the question of the honourable member for Grayndler a very interesting one from two points of view. Firstly, he appears to be concerned about the implications of certain leasing practices. I welcome that concern and I invite him to translate that concern into voting in favour of the income tax amendments the Government proposes in respect of certain leverage leasing arrangements which, according to the honourable member for Gellibrand, the Labor Party will oppose and therefore cost the ordinary Australian taxpayer about $130m which will go into the pockets of the very companies which the honourable member for Grayndler now says make too great a profit. If he is really worried about the financial position of those companies, he had better look to the policies of his own party on that piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member, I have received many letters on the subject. To answer the first part of the question, no, there are no specific bilateral treaties or agreements in place relating to this problem. The Australian Government has had discussions with the Canadian Government about the seal hunt. I have to say that the Canadian Government is generally recognised in the world community as having an enlightened approach towards conservation issues and, as a result of our discussions, we are confident at any rate that the Canadian authorities are competent to deal with the problem. I note that the Canadian Government's policy is to welcome having representatives of known and reputable humane societies to observe the seal hunt. According to the information we have, the harp seal is one of the world's most abundant species, having a population of some millions and the number to be harvested is well below the safety limit. The Canadian authorities have laid down strict regulations to ensure that seals are harvested with a minimum of suffering. Other than to express our concern over the hunt, there are no direct means by which Australia can stop it taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>

In view of the fact that this is 3 1/2 per cent to 4 per cent higher than Commonwealth bond rates, does this put enormous pressure on these bond rates and thereby greatly increase pressure for all interest rates to rise?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not surprisingly, I am aware of the results of the most recent tender for Treasury notes. I think it has to be said at the outset that for some time now there has been an anticipation that as the Australian financial community enters the final quarter of this financial year there will be increases in short term interest rates and that that situation is likely to be the case throughout the period of the seasonal liquidity rundown. The short term interest rates normally increase at this time of the year. The relatively high rates for Treasury notes not only reflect that but also reflect the continuing very high demand for funds not only from private sector sources but also from Government sources. I can assure the honourable gentleman that the Government-myself in particular-is daily in consultation with the monetary authorities about the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We make no secret of the fact that we believe that in pursuit of our longer term anti-inflationary objectives it is necessary to maintain a continually firm monetary and fiscal policy and that one of the shorter term consequences of that , particularly at this time of the year, is that there will be outcomes of the type that were indicated yesterday in relation to Treasury notes. If one looks at this matter objectively it has to be accepted that at this time of the year a government has a very difficult balancing act to do. It has to maintain the effectiveness of its anti-inflationary monetary and fiscal policy and at the same time it has to ensure that whilst liquidity conditions remain firm they do not become too tight. That balancing act is not an easy one, but it is one to which my efforts and the Government's efforts will be bent very carefully and in a very conscientious way over the coming weeks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of Press reports which have reported Mr MacKinnon as having said that it appears that the Commonwealth is backing off in respect of Perth Airport. Let me make it very clear that the Government has approved in principle the expenditure of approximately $43m for upgrading the facilities at the international and domestic terminals and the 02/20 runway which, of course, is being lengthened to accommodate the long range international aircraft. Works to the value of $18m are in progress; some have been completed. There has been some delay because we have decided to meet the request of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and community groups in Perth to produce a master plan, which, I hope, will be ready in the very near future for presentation to that Committee. Residents around the airport have expressed some concern about the location of the air traffic control tower. I have no doubt that the provision of the master plan will necessitate some delay but I am sure that that would be desirable to ensure that we do not close off options in respect of perhaps a wide-spaced parallel runway to meet the future needs of the area. I hope that the plan will be in the hands of the Public Works Committee in sufficient time to permit the Committee to give it due consideration and report to this Parliament so that the Government may consider , in the course of budgetary discussions later this year, future capital needs in meeting the in-principle decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If all of those timetables can be met I assume that we will be able to complete the international terminal facility at a time that will be reasonably close to the forecast date announced some time ago, namely, the end of 1984. If there is a delay in completion I am sure that it will be in the best interests of the people of Perth. However, I assure the honourable member and the people of Perth and Western Australia generally that the Government is not backing off from a decision to provide adequate facilities for people travelling by air to and from Perth.</PARA>

I ask: Does he recognise that in this extremely restrictive economic setting highly geared corporations and financial institutions are vulnerable and that informed money market opinion is that a couple of financial institutions could easily fail? Therefore, if he is not prepared to ease out the money supply, thereby reducing pressure on interest rates and freeing the economy, would he be prepared to extend lender of last resort backing to reputable financial institutions in order to remove any fears that small savers who invest in such institutions will become the next victims of the excesses of government economic policy?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that I am disturbed at the question by the Leader of the Opposition, not for the reason that he hopes, but rather for the reason that if he has any information which, according to him, represents informed money market opinion about the stability of particular financial institutions he should do the responsible thing and provide that information either to me or the Governor of the Reserve Bank, a person who, incidentally, was first appointed to that position by the former Labor Government. If the Leader of the Opposition is really concerned about the stability of the financial system and about preventing the sorts of results that his question suggests, he will do the responsible, not the irresponsible, thing. But by asking such questions and by making the sorts of statements that he made yesterday, he is merely imitating the behaviour of the Premier of New South Wales who delights in scaring young home buyers. Apparently, the Leader of the Opposition delights in scaring small investors. I say to him and to the House that I have no information from the authorities that would lend substance to the irresponsible claim that he makes in his question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is probably aware that negotiations have been proceeding for a number of years on whether it is possible to achieve a closer economic relationship with New Zealand, replacing the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement which has been in operation for the past 15 years. It has been considered that an upgrading of economic and trade activity is needed between the two countries and it is suggested that if we could move towards a closer economic relationship there would be greater activity between our two countries. Up to date, in the discussions that have taken place, a good deal of common ground has been achieved although some problems still remain. Problems relating to rural industries have been looked at closely. Some of them have been looked at on an industry to industry basis and we have been able to come to satisfactory arrangements. In other cases, such as the dairying industry, discussions are continuing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the New Zealand Minister for Trade and Industry, Mr Templeton, is in Australia at present. He will be having discussions with Ministers and members of parliament. I believe the purpose of his mission is to express the interest of New Zealand in trying to achieve a closer economic relationship and the importance New Zealand sees for its own future well-being in being able to trade more freely with Australia. Australia sees economic opportunities in New Zealand for itself in regard to a wide range of products, not only in manufacturing but also in agriculture. I am sure that if other countries, particularly European countries, can achieve common trading conditions it ought to be possible for Australia to do likewise. At the moment the objective is to achieve an agreement which will come into operation on 1 January 1983. Whether that can be achieved will depend on the satisfactory result of negotiations between Australia and New Zealand. Until there has been further discussion between officials, and with the industry, I will have nothing more to report.</PARA>

I believe and the Government believes that interest rates ultimately are a reflection of the demand for and the supply of money in the community, and anybody who parades under the delusion that we can ignore that does not understand how our system operates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I want to raise, I trust briefly-it is always risky I know-the procedures associated with the dispatch in this House of reports of the Auditor-General. These are probably the most important reports which come before us. They are effectively a test of the efficiency and effectiveness of departments. As things stand now, these reports, which should be the subject of substantial debate, are referred to committees for attention and there they seem to be buried. The processes are obviously either too turgid in the committees or so complex and demanding as to render them incapable of responding to the needs of this Parliament. The needs of this Parliament are for an early debate on the contents of the reports. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) has pointed out to me, with his usual attention to this sort of important detail, that the records of the House show that the last annual report of the Auditor-General was presented to this Parliament in April last year and was referred to a committee. As I understand it-the honourable member for Corio will correct me if I am wrong-that report is still with the committee. There was an efficiency audit report of the Auditor- General in October of last year and it is still with the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point does not have to be laboured. There are, obviously, from the earmarked bits of paper in these several reports, many instances where the Auditor-General, in his commendable and invaluable work, has uncovered matters of concern to this Parliament and to the community. I will not cite them all-in fact very few of them-because I am sure that the force of the point is quite apparent to honourable members. I would expect that bi-partisanly we would share this concern. But I will deal with a few of them. In relation to the Department of Administrative Services the report of the Auditor-General of March 1981 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter for concern that, at the time of the audit, claims examinations were significantly in arrears, the backlog being estimated at approximately 10- man years. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to talk about staff shortages. I do not think I need to give any more illustrations of that. There are at least half a score to a dozen earmarked pages where similar comment is made in that report. We also have the Auditor-General's report upon financial statements which was prepared in June 1980. At pages 82 and 83 matters were referred to in connection with the Department of Health. The shortage of staff is raised. Page 83 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Without the provision for staff training, especially in computer-based audit techniques, it is doubtful whether existing departmental staff have the necessary expertise. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a reference to doctor fraud. I think this is an appalling situation and one which requires attention. Page 5 of the Auditor-General's report of March 1981 upon audits, examinations and inspections under the appropriate Act, states :</PARA>
<PARA> A contractor submitted a tender for the purchase of torpedo batteries having a high silver content. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to discuss the way in which this matter developed. It then points out:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the differential cannot be quantified exactly the difference between the value of the metal at dates of tender and delivery has been estimated at $ 203 680. </PARA>
<PARA>In a nutshell we were taken for a ride. Page 68 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an error of some $260 000 in a departmental document comparing estimated costs of a project at the sketch plan stage with those at the detailed cost estimate stage ($1 855 000 in 1976 as compared with $2 764 000 in 1978) . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That refers to the Department of Social Security. There are quite a number of errors and frankly I have mentioned the lesser ones. Mr Speaker, you will recall that there have been some major disclosures by the Auditor-General of deficiencies in audit processes, efficiency and practices. They represent losses to the community which have to be borne. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the shortness of time I have not had the opportunity of highlighting the more dramatic examples. I do not believe it is necessary. I would expect that we would all share the concern I have that these matters are of such moment and they are so numerous because they have been reported on so frequently and in so many different areas, that there is obviously a need for a tightening up in the way in which the Public Service is being administered. The most obvious deficiency is staff ceilings. Staff shortages are not creating savings; they are generating costs, through amounts of money which are not being detected through effective audit or administrative processes and through inefficiencies. The most dramatic example is the disclosure that staff ceilings in the Australian Taxation Office have saved petty cash at the cost of millions of dollars of tax revenue that is not being collected. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying that perhaps we could have a system so that in future these reports would have a specified period during which the Committee could attend to them and report back-if not finally, on an interim basis- to the Parliament and the Parliament proceed with a debate. I suggest that these matters are of such great moment and the scandal is so appalling and staggering in many cases that the Parliament should not have to wait any more than three to four weeks before it commences debating these topics. If the Committee is not up to handling that-I acknowledge that there would be difficulties about producing even an interim report-nonetheless the Parliament must proceed and put on record its grave concern. Our great obligation is to make the public sector system work. Institutions serving the community outside this Parliament, in my view and from my experience, do so loyally and well. They have to forebear, not infrequently, with ministerial incompetence and most of all, obloquy which is heaped upon their shoulders quite unfairly by Government Ministers who are seeking to escape imputation of blame for their own shortcomings. I want to put that on record because this is not a broad brush accusation or attack on the Public Service. I repeat, that largely I believe the deficiencies arise because of the restrictive arrangements about staff. We cannot increase the work load and freeze the staff levels and expect efficiency to be maintained. It goes down. We can save petty cash in our bookkeeping presentation but at enormous real expense to the community in inferior services, deficiencies in general administrative arrangements and so on. We lose more than we gain. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the things that we should be talking about. They are not the sensationalist or scandalous things that the media might want to attend to, although from time to time the larger matters have drawn their attention. But they are the things that determine the efficiency, the quality and the satisfaction level of the service that the Public Service can give the community . I am arguing that we should be backing up the Public Service in its claim to be able to provide superior services. That can be substantially done only by proper attention by this Parliament to what is going on and unremitting commitment by the Parliament to guarantee that a sufficient level of qualified staff is made available for the Public Service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I should take the opportunity to clarify a couple of points raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden). Firstly, I am delighted to see that at last he has discovered the existence of the Auditor-General's report. I do not recall that he, after many years as Leader of the Opposition, and prior to that as a Minister in this House, has ever made any reference to them. Furthermore, the point should be made that the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and the House of Representatives Expenditure Committee, which is chaired by my colleague, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher), have been handling the examination of Auditor-General's reports for many years, and this in turn includes the handling of the efficiency audit reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) this morning referred the next report, which is the fourth report, to my Committee. The previous two reports were referred to the Expenditure Committee. If I am correct that Committee has reported on at least one of those reports, if not both. I am sure the honourable member for Hume will correct me if I am wrong. The only report outstanding is that into the question of overseas aid, which is a very complex matter and which involves a whole range of issues. Because of their nature they cannot be categorised in mathematical terms as there is considerable subjectivity in the decision making process in the field of foreign aid. </PARA>
<PARA> We look now to the fourth report which has been tabled. If the Leader of the Opposition cares to look at page 6406 of Notice Paper No. 74 he will see that many of the items which he has taken out at random from the Auditor-General's report in fact are subject to investigation by the Public Accounts Committee. There is a standard procedure for Committee members to sit down with the Auditor -General, after the reports have been tabled in the Parliament, to go through them systematically and to make their own determinations as to which items are worthy of further examination. In due course we report to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the problem lies-the honourable gentleman is certainly correct on this point; it has been emphasised by me and many chairmen for years prior to my occupancy of that position-is in the need for this Parliament to be prepared to have a serious debate on the recommendations made by parliamentary committees, especially in the audit and financial area. The fact that we are not doing so is remiss of us as members of Parliament. I certainly recommend that we provide time for a significant debate on this matter. I would not like the people of Australia to think that the Auditor-General's reports are simply put away and allowed to gather yet further dust when, in fact, that is not the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter the debate briefly. There is a difference between what has been said and a committee examining a document, such as the Auditor-General's report, in some detail and at some length. It should be pointed out that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts currently has before it some 23 references, including some which derive from the 1979-80 Auditor-General 's report. The point that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) made and which I make is that the Parliament has a responsibility to deal with the reports which it requires to be presented to it. The Auditor-General reports to the Parliament, which is evidenced by the fact that you, sir, present his reports to this Parliament. They are important enough in that they have regularly made significant disclosures of bad or at least doubtful practices or inefficiencies which have had to be debated in the Parliament shortly after their presentation. It is a function of the Parliament to supervise public expenditures. It is a function of this House to supervise the finances and the administration of government in this nation. That is what the Parliament is all about. The House of Representatives, at least technically, has responsibility for money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not suggesting that the Public Accounts Committee should not continue its detailed examination of these reports, but on each occasion a report is presented to the Parliament time should be set aside for members to examine it. Not more than four weeks after its presentation the Parliament should debate the Auditor-General's report as one of its major functions in exercising its authority over the Executive government in its administration of the Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add a few words to the debate as Chairman of the House of Representatives Expenditure Committee, which Committee has some responsibility in this area. I think the debate which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) have engaged in has gone a little wider than the motion before the House. I will restrict myself to that matter. The reality is that efficiency audits are referred for examination, on behalf of the House, to either the Joint Committee of Public Accounts or the Expenditure Committee. As the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee has already stated, the first two of these reports went before the Expenditure Committee under reference from this chamber and both of those reports have been tabled in the House following inquiry by the Expenditure Committee. The next two have been referred to the Public Accounts Committee and will be referred back here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not have any problem with the suggestion that has been made by the honourable member for Corio that those reports should then be the subject of further debate in the House. I think that is perfectly proper. But there are procedures which have been adopted and which, as I understand it, there has been no disputation about, that provide for reaction from both the bureaucracy and the Government to the reports the parliamentary committees have made, having inquired into the reports that the Auditor-General has made. In the case of the Public Accounts Committee, there is the Treasury minute procedure whereby the bureaucracy comes back to respond to the points made by the Public Accounts Committee and those comments are then tabled in this Parliament as a further report of the Public Accounts Committee. They are subject to debate if there is a desire to bring the matter on for debate. </PARA>
<PARA> At least the Government responds in this Parliament, as a government, to the report of the Expenditure Committee, and the responsible Minister comes forward with a response. The Committee has expressed some concern about the delay with responses to efficiency audits. The procedure that has been adopted in relation to normal reports by committees to the Parliament involves the Government or the appropriate Minister responding within six months of the report being tabled in the Parliament. But in the case of an efficiency audit report from the Auditor- General, because the matter has been before the Government and the appropriate departments at the same time as it has been before the Expenditure Committee, and now the Public Accounts Committee during its consideration of the report, we have taken the view that it is proper that the Government give consideration to the time within which it will respond to the Expenditure Committee's report on the audit after it has been tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> I, as Chairman of the Expenditure Committee, have written to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to suggest that he change the response period from six months to three months. Once the response has been made I think it is probably important in many cases, because of the nature of the issues raised, that debate ensue. But I think that the Opposition, in putting forward a suggestion that the House in its plenum debate matters of import from the Auditor-General's report or from his reports on efficiency audits before they have been looked at by the committees of the House and a response from the Government has been forthcoming, is being unrealistic. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing, of course, is that both the committees to which I have been referring have members from both sides of the House. The Public Accounts Committee also has members from both sides of the Parliament, from the Senate also. The opportunities are there for fully raising all the matters of substance . I think the Leader of the Opposition is raising the matter in little more emotive fashion than it needs to be raised in. It is important that the House and the world at large understand that these matters are handled properly and thoroughly and that there is adequate opportunity for debate. </PARA>

<DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="863">
<TITLE>Government Response to Recommendations</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 1 An Australian Marine Science Council be established. This Council would: operate as the national adviser on marine science matters, especially in the areas of policy development; co-ordinate marine science research efforts; liaise with similar bodies overseas; and finance marine science research projects.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The Government considers that a Marine Science Council as proposed by the Senate Committee is not appropriate at this time.</PARA>
<PARA> Recent initiatives of the Government have demonstrated its strong commitment to develop a worthwhile, effective and cohesive marine science programme. Support has been given to the relocation of the headquarters of CSIRO's marine research facilities in new laboratories in Hobart and to the acquistion by CSIRO of a specialised oceanographic research ship to be operated as a national facility. The Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and Technology has been transferred to new facilities in Kingston, Tasmania and is being developed as a centre of excellence in Southern Ocean marine biology. The Australian Maritime College in Launceston was established by Commonwealth legislation in 1978 to provide for maritime and maritime related education and training for the shipping, fishing and allied industries. Substantial new resources have been directed to increasing our knowledge of the Australian Fishing Zone and a large part of this assistance is being channelled through CSIRO's Division of Fisheries Research. The Australian Institute of Marine Science has had its staffing levels increased and is endeavouring to establish for itself a major scientific reputation as a centre of tropical marine research. The new structure of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics will include a Division of Marine Geosciences and Petroleum Geology; funds have been allocated for the Bureau to undertake a major geophysical survey of Bass Basin. Additional resources have been provided for the work of the Navy Hydrographer and the Division of National Mapping to accelerate the charting of Australia's marine areas. These operational developments have been supported by the development of policy advisory mechanisms. Special funding has been provided for marine science and technology projects for allocation on the advice of the Funding Advisory Panel of the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee. For greater flexibility this panel has now been amalgamated with the Queen's Fellowships in Marine Science Committee. As a result of the recent Review of Commonwealth Functions AMSTAC now reports to the Minister for Science and Technology. This has served to consolidate marine sciences and technologies advisory and funding functions within a single Ministry that has also an operational role.</PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements are the result of recent initiatives designed to cope with the present and near-future level of marine science activity. The considerable cost and disruption that would be involved in setting up a Marine Science Council are not justified at the present stage of development of Australian marine science. Acceptance of these recommendations would also be contrary to the Government's policy of financial restraint and its concern to reduce the number of statutory bodies. Existing institutional arrangements, including AMSTAC exercising a coordinating role and providing advice on marine science programmes and priorities, are considered adequate for meeting present needs. The Government believes that AMSTAC already has functioned to good effect and with continuing support will become even more effective. The organisational model and concept proposed in this and related recommendations, though inappropriate at present, may have a place at some future time as Australia's marine science effort evolves.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 2 The Australian Marine Science Council co-ordinates research efforts through Regional and Marine Sciences Committees and an Advisory Committee. The Council, through its Executive and Secretariat, would be responsible for operating an Information Services Unit and a Ship Operations Unit. The Council would also manage the two proposed Research Institutes, presently operating as the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the CSIRO Division of Fisheries Research and Oceanography.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See Response to Recommendations 1 and 15.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 3 The Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972 be repealed and replaced with an Australian Marine Science Act. This Act would contain such provisions as are necessary to enable the Australian Marine Science Council to fulfil its proposed functions.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on Recommendation 1. The Government does not consider these legislative changes are necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4 A Marine Science Research Endowment Bill be enacted to establish a Marine Science Research and Development Fund. The Australian Marine Science Council would be responsible for advising the Minister for Science and Technology on the administration of the fund.</PARA>
<PARA>Response Not accepted. The Government does not believe that the establishment of a Marine Science Research and Development Fund would offer any advantage over existing funding mechanisms. Such a Fund would account for only part of the Commonwealth's total expenditure on Marine Science Research. It could not comprehend Tertiary Education Commission and Australian Research Grants Committee funding of marine science for example, and would have no effect on State or private sector funding activities. The Government considers that a plurality of funding mechanisms helps to maintain a proper balance of funding availability between research, development and routine monitoring. In certain circumstances amalgamation of funding sources may be desire- able to increase the flexibility of funding. For this reason AMSTAC-FAP and Queen's Fellowships in marine science have already been amalgamated. Co-ordination between Commonwealth funding agencies already occurs, and ensures that proposals are transferred to the most appropriate agency.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 5 A small Secretariat be made available by the Department of Science and Technology to provide administrative support for the Council.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on Recommendation 1. The Department of Science and Technology provides secretariat support for AMSTAC.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6 Four marine science regions be identified.These regions would be based on northern, eastern, southern and western waters.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See response to Recommendation 8.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 7 Four Regional Committees be established, comprising representatives for all major marine science agencies in each region.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognises that two streams of committees will be necessary: one stream to co-ordinate and advise on a regional basis; and other stream to deal with special disciplines in marine science. Recommendations 8-12 refer to these committees.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See response to Recommendation 8.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 8 The role of the regional Committees be: to co-ordinate research activities within the region, to the extent of advising the Council of any overlap; to provide a means of encouraging co-operation and liaison between researchers and agencies in that region; to ensure that individuals or organisations seeking finance for marine science research have access to the financing process; to advise the Council of areas of research, or research projects, which they consider are worthy of support, and to generally represent the region's interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The Government recognises the need for the coordination of regional advice but believes that the Committee's proposed regions are not an adequate reflection of the scale, complexity and natural regionalisation of Australia's continental margin, of the very different priorities attached to the scientific study of particular regions (such as the Barrier Reef, Bass Strait and the North -west Shelf) or of the location of existing and proposed facilities around the Australian coast. The proposed Committee structure would be unduly cumbersome and expensive. AMSTAC's terms of reference provide a sufficiently broad charter for it to obtain necessary information from regional, sectoral and disciplinary sources when developing its advice to Government. AMSTAC is expected to give increasing consideration to specific regional research needs and priorities. Already AMSTAC is moving to cultivate closer links with regional organisations such as the Antarctic Research Policy Advisory Committee, the various committees concerned with the Great Barrier Reef, regional committees of the Australian Fisheries Council, the Victorian Institute of Marine Sciences and other state- oriented marine science agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommedation 9 Appropriate Marine Sciences Committees be established. These Committees would include the interests of the following areas: marine biology; fisheries research and technology; marine geosciences; oceanography; marine taxonomy; coastal and ocean engineering; and marine environmental studies.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on Recommendation 10.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 10 The role of the Marine Sciences Committees be: to co-ordinate research activities undertaken in their field and to reduce unnecessary duplication of research; to operate as an information source to researchers by providing resumes of current research being undertaken in the field; to encourage joint research projects across agencies and regions; to ensure that individuals or organisations seeking finance for marine science research have access to the financing process; to advise the Council of areas of research, or research projects, which they consider are worthy of support; and to generally represent the discipline's interests.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on recomendations 1, 6, 7 and 8.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that co-ordination of research activities is best achieved by ensuring that operating agencies receive effective support for scientific collaboration and for encouraging and facilitating contracts between working scientists through the promotion of conferences and workshops, and the dissemination of information. Inadequate co-ordination and collaboration arise as often at the interdisciplinary level as within specific disciplines. AMSTAC will continue to establish specific-purpose working parties to undertake major investigations in the course of which advice and information is sought from non- government disciplinary organisations such as the National Committee on Coastal and Ocean Engineering (of the Australian Institution of Engineers), the Australian Marine Sciences Association, and the Consortium for Ocean geosciences of Australian Universities. AMSTAC is conscious of the need to identify, and to seek information from those organisations which utilise the results of marine science as well as those carrying out research.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 11 One broadly based Advisory Committee be established to advise the Council on programme planning and evaluation, education and training, and the conferring of fellowships, scholarships and project and programme grants.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on Recommendations 1 and 2.</PARA>
<PARA> Advice on marine sciences and technologies programs is provided to the Minister for Science and technology by AMSTAC. The amalgamated AMSTAC-FAP and Queen's Fellowships in Marine Science Committee advises the Minister on the conferring of fellowships and on project and programme grants in the context of priorities set by the Minister on advice from AMSTAC. Responsibility for advising the Government on the level and pattern of provision of tertiary education lies with the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 12 The CSIRO cease to conduct marine science research, and the Divisions of Fisheries Research and Oceanography become a separate Research Institute. This Research Institute, together with the Australian Institute of Marine Science, would become Research Institutes responsible to the Australian Marine Science Council.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on Recommendation 13.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 13 Each Institute would have its own Board, to which the Director of the Institute, subject to Council policy, would be responsible for the management and operations of the Institute. The research programmes would be approved annually by the Council and would be financed by the Marine Science Research and Development Fund. The Council would direct the Institutes to develop independent programmes to avoid unnecessary duplication.</PARA>
<PARA>Response Not accepted. See response to Recommendation 1. CSIRO has a responsibility to continue to play a major role in Australian marine science in accordance with the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 as amended in 1978, following the Government's acceptance of the Report of the Independent Committee of Inquiry into CSIRO. The Executive of CSIRO has given marine research a high priority. The Government believes that removing the marine science divisions from CSIRO would, without providing any compensating benefits, break existing links which facilitate interdisciplinary consultations and a multidisciplinary approach especially to problems which bear on both the terrestrial and marine environments. Within CSIRO the marine science divisions interact on the widest possible range of skills and resources and utilise the capabilities of various scientific disciplines to meet changing objectives. The Government has previously accepted the recommendations of ASTEC that the future long-term role of AIMS (5 years ahead and more) be determined by the situation at that time, including the reputation and capabilities of AIMS and of other institutions, as they evolve and that for the forseeable future AIMS should direct its research towards programmes associated with the tropical waters of Australia, particularly, the Great Barrier Reef Region, and chiefly in appropriate marine biological/ecological fields.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 14</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the importance of the dissemination of information the Australian Marine Science Council becomes a user of the CSIRONET computing service.</PARA>
<PARA>Response CSIRONET is a commercially available computing service and its facilities are available to whoever needs them. Several marine science data banks are already stored on CSIRONET.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 15 The Council establish an Information services unit to service the information needs of the organisation and researchers and agencies concerned with marine science.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The Government recognises that the effective management of information is a key element in a national marine science program and believes that it is of prime importance that the transfer of information and data are readily available to those who have a need for them. However, it believes that a strongly centralised information services unit is not practicable. Data and information are best managed by those with prime responsibility for collection and with the necessary expertise to analyse them. A basic need in information management is to have a readily available central registry of what data and information are available and where they can be obtained. To this end the Department of Science and Technology is currently compiling an inventory of marine science data banks and a directory of current research projects. In addition, a research officer is being funded through the Fishing Industry Research Trust Account to investigate the fishing industry's need for scientific information and how to develop better mechanisms for distributing this information.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 16 The Council establish a Ship Operations unit to co-ordinate the operational management of marine science research vessels.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on Recommendation 18.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 17 The Ship Operations unit be responsible for co-ordinating information concerning available ship time on Australian and overseas vessels in Australian waters. The unit would administer a fund to enable scientists to take up ship time opportunities at very short notice.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on Recommendation 18.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 18 The Ship Operations Unit establish a Users Committee, comprising representatives of the various disciplines which require access to research vessels. The Users Committee would be an integral part of the Ship Operations Unit.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The Government accepts that research vessels need to be utilised to their maximum extent possible subject to necessary considerations of scientific and cost effectiveness and that a mechanism is needed to co-ordinate the use of available ship time. However, it does not consider that a centralised system of control is required at this time and believes that research vessels, including those acquired as national facilities, should be managed by major operational agencies. The Government has already accepted ASTEC advice that organisations managing a research vessel designated as a national facility should appoint a committee, comprising representatives of major users of the vessel, to provide advice on the allocation of vessel time.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 19 Marine science research vessels purchased, or chartered, as national facilities be managed for the most part by experienced marine contractors and that these contractors form part of the Ship Operations Unit. Such contractors would liaise closely with the Users Committee to ensure compatibility in decision making.</PARA>
<PARA>Response In response to the Report of the Review of Commonwealth Government Functions, the Government has decided that there should be further contracting of its services to the private sector where practicable. In this regard the need is recognised for maximum scientific and cost effectiveness in the use of research vessels. Accordingly the Government will consider in particular cases whether the best results would be achieved through management by marine contractors or through Government operation. In all cases close liaison between operators and users is essential.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 20 Wherever possible all marine science research vessels be chartered, and experienced marine contractors consulted in identifying research vessels suitable for charter or purchase.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The practice of chartering research vessels is well established in Australia. If a vessel is required for a definite and short-term project, chartering may provide the necessary flexibility if a suitable vessel exists, is available, and can be used to full capacity during the charter period. However the Government believes that, where there is a continuing need, or where a long- term project is envisaged, purchase may be cheaper than chartering. All relevant sources of advice are used in identifying vessels suitable for charter or purchase.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 21 Encouragement be given to developing modular research vessels.</PARA>
<PARA>Response Most research vessels constructed recently have some provision for interchanging laboratories but overseas' experience has shown that fully modular research vessels have not proved generally effective. It is the view of the Government that users should be uninhibited in selection of vessels designed to meet particular needs.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 22 The Ship Operations Unit fully consider the acquisition of small research vessels for use by bodies such as universities, colleges and museums.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The acquisition of small research vessels is a matter for the individual institutions concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 23 AMSTAC and ASTEC oversee the establishment of the Australian Marine Science Council. Thereafter, AMSTAC and its Funding Advisory Panel would no longer exist, as the Advisory Committee would assume the responsibilities of AMSTAC.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on Recommendation 1.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 24 A marine science policy be developed incorporating such aspects as: The types of research to be financed; and mechanisms for the selection, financing and effectiveness of research as well as the exploitation of research results.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on Recommendation 1.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 25 All possible avenues be explored to acquire a complete bathymetric and hydrographic survey of the Australian coast as rapidly as possible. These measures could include financial assistance to the Royal Australian Navy Hydrographer, the Australian Survey Office, the Division of National Mapping and private contractors.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The Government accepts the importance of having a complete bathymetric and hyrdographic survey of the Australian coast. It has recently committed the ' 'Cape Pillar'' for additional bathymetric work, at least until the end of 1982. The Division of National Mapping of the Department of National Development and Energy has been allocated additional funds of $1.5 million in 1981-82 for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 26 Funding of physical and chemical oceanography be increased, particularly in determining an understanding of the tides, waves and circulation patterns of the continental shelf. Priority should be given to processing this information such that it can be widely made known to other marine scientists.</PARA>
<PARA>Response Accepted. The Government decided in 1980 to establish CSIRO Marine Science Laboratories at Hobart to be supported by an oceanographic research vessel. The Government notes that CSIRO attaches high priority and commitment to marine sciences and especially oceanography, and inter alia is reallocating staff and resources to this end. The need for routine collection and distribution of oceanographic data is being considered and proposals aimed at meeting this need are being developed.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 27 The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 be amended so as to reduce the period of time for the release of information from five years to twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA>Response Not accepted. The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 was extensively amended in 1980 following consultation with all State Governments. Amendment of the relevant provision (Section 118) was considered at that time, but it was decided that no changes would be made to this provision.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 28 Priorities for coastal and ocean engineering in the protection of our foreshores and the development of our mineral resources be better recognised. Emphasis should be given to the provision of tanks and basins for the simulation of wave, current and wind impact on structures and the sediment bed.</PARA>
<PARA>Response This recommendation is in accord with advice received from ASTEC/AMSTAC and is being considered in detail by a working group of AMSTAC.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 29 The adoption of a national code to provide a development-free zone of approximately 1 km from the shoreline for those areas of the Australian coast which have not yet been developed and where there is any risk of shoreline erosion or instability.</PARA>
<PARA>Response Although the Commonwealth has constitutional power with respect to maritime areas beyond low water mark adjacent to the States, under the offshore constitutional settlement each State is to have the same power with respect to the adjacent territorial sea (including the sea bed) as it would have if the waters were within the limit of the State. The establishment of such a zone would, therefore, be mainly a matter for the States, subject to any Commonwealth legislation. The matter will be taken up with them in accordance with the Commonwealth Government's decisions on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation Report on Management of the Coastal Zone which is being considered by the State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 30 A blue-water research vessel be acquired, or a modular laboratory be developed for, the marine geosciences, and that Australia seriously consider participating in the forthcoming Ocean Margins Drilling Programme. Priority should be given to upgrading the services provided by the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The matters raised in this recommendation have also been foreshadowed as important issues for future action by AMSTAC in its report ''Towards a Marine Sciences and Technologies Program for the 1980s''. Participation in the Ocean Margins Drilling Program is not considered warranted. However the Government is expecting to receive shortly a proposal from Australian marine geoscientists concerning participation by Australia in the second phase of the International Program of Ocean Drilling. In the reorganisation of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics, the Public Service Board has agreed to the formation of a Division of Marine Geosciences and Petroleum Geology. This Division will undertake regional offshore geological and geophysical investigations and analyse and integrate offshore petroleum exploration data.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 31 Priority be given to studying the biology of marine micro- organisms, plankton and the fish resources of the 200 n.m. zone.</PARA>
<PARA>Response Accepted. The Government has already significantly strengthened CSIRO's capacity to undertake research related to the resources of the Australian Fishing Zone.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 32 Increase finance be provided for marine taxonomy and for the upgrading of museum facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The Government accepts the importance of marine taxonomy to Australian marine science and notes that AMSTAC-FAP has supported projects in this field.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 33 Priority be given to research into the distribution, allowable yields and management of current and potential fisheries. To foster such research, greater liaison between government and industry should be developed.</PARA>
<PARA>Response Accepted. The Department of Primary Industry has established a comprehensive system for collecting catch and effort data from foreign vessels operating in Australian waters as a basis for research and the development and management of the Australian Fishing Zone. An extensive feasibility fishing programme has been carried out by means of foreign and Australian commercial partnerships. The results of both these programmes are available to industry. The Australian Fishing Council has established the Australian Fishing Zone Committee, a government/industry committee which reports to it annually on the interrelations of foreign and Australian fishing in the AFZ. The reports of the Committee are published. Additionally, there is extensive consultation with industry when foreign operations are approved and during the development of fishery management and development regimes. Industry is represented on the Fishing Industry Research Committee which advises the Minister for Primary Industry on expenditure of funds from the Fishing Industry Research Trust Account.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 34 The possible over-exploitation of the North West Shelf by foreign fishing ventures be immediately examined, and if necessary, rectified.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on Recommendation 33.</PARA>
<PARA> There are serious deficiencies in the knowledge and understanding of the functioning and appropriate management of tropical, multi-species, trawl fisheries. Examination of the basis of this recommendation must await further development of our understanding. The CSIRO Division of Fisheries Research is examining a proposal for research of this type. In the meantime, however, the exploitation of the North-west Shelf is being managed on a very conservative basis.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 35 Priority be given to researching the effects of oil spills, waste disposal and effluent on the marine environment, especially on coral reefs . This research should include the development of a marine pollution monitoring system.</PARA>
<PARA>Response Accepted. The Government notes that a number of research programmes are underway which are relevant to this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 36 Attention be paid to the impact of tourism on the Great Barrier Reef. The possibility of developing an extensive underwater viewing gallery should be explored as a means of reducing this impact whilst at the same time promoting tourist interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Response Accepted. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has this matter under investigation. The development of proposed tourist facilities on the Great Barrier Reef and adjacent Coast is being considered so as to increase opportunities for the public to experience the Reef environment, while at the same time minimising human impact on it.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 37 The declaration of the 200 n.m. Australian Fishing Zone should be accompanied by research into the fauna of this zone, especially mammals, and how they can be adequately protected from the over-exploitation of their foodstocks.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See comment on Recommendation 31.</PARA>
<PARA> The Fisheries Act obliges the Minister for Primary Industry to take account of the effects of fishing on cetaceans. Recent government actions on whaling have demonstrated the Government's commitment to conservation of marine mammals.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 38 The development of appropriate technology for the marine sciences be encouraged, especially in relation to remote sensing and fisheries technology.</PARA>
<PARA>Response Accepted. This recommendation is consistent with the Government's policy of a balanced development of Australian marine science. Development and utilisation of advanced technology already is part of marine science activities. For example, the Fishing Industry Research Trust Account has funded a CSIRO/West Australian Institute of Technology study on the applications of remote sensing to fisheries. The Australian Maritime College is also involved in developing appropriate technology. The College's School of Fisheries provides training in the application of modern fishing techniques. There is an on-going Defence program of design studies for industrial production of the Laser Airborne Depth Sounder which can greatly increase the rate of collection of data from coastal waters shallower than 50 metres. Both CSIRO and AIMS regularly use remote sensing techniques in their research.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 39 The Australian Marine Science Council provide finance for the operation of facilities at the island research stations. Programs conducted at these stations would be the responsibility of the Consortium of Island Research Stations.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The Government is aware of the important contribution made by the island research stations to marine research in the Great Barrier Reef and notes that parent institutions of island research stations are eligible to apply for funding support through marine research and development grants.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 40 The marine science laboratories at Cronulla be retained as research and training facilities for marine scientists in the Sydney region, especially for university-based scientists.</PARA>
<PARA>Response CSIRO will have no need for a residual presence at Cronulla when the proposed Marine Science Laboratories are constructed in Hobart. The Government has noted this recommendation and will take it into account when consideration is given to the future of the Cronulla facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 41 Support be given to increase the number of graduates in the marine sciences whose initial degrees are based on the pure sciences. Emphasis should also be given to the provision of courses in resource management and marine technologies.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission is responsible for advising the Government on the level and pattern of provision in tertiary education. The Commission's planning for the 1982-84 Triennium has been based, among other things, on there being no increase in student numbers in universities during that period. This is consistent with the findings of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training. The Government's policy is that, in expensive and highly specialised fields of study, decisions on the numbers of places to be made available will be influenced primarily by manpower considerations. The Government acknowledges however that an improvement in the quality and comprehensiveness of labour market information is a prerequisite for any significant advances in the use of manpower consideration in educational planning. AMSTAC will review the adequacy of trained manpower in the marine sciences. With regard to the provision of courses, the Australian Maritime College currently offers a number of relevant undergraduate courses and is planning to introduce post-graduate courses in hydrographic surveying and fisheries technology. The college also provides short, specialist, non-award courses to meet the needs of maritime industries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has currently under consideration a suggestion that the proposal for a National School of Fisheries be examined further with a view to its development in the 1985-87 triennium. It is recognised that such a school would complement the role of the Australian Maritime College with regard to fishing and related activities.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 42 The number of Queen's Fellowships be increased both to give young Australians an opportunity to continue their research in this country or overseas, and to attract researchers from overseas on a short-term basis.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The recent amalgamation of the Queen's Fellowships in Marine Science committee with the AMSTAC-Funding Advisory Panel enables an appropriate balance between fellowships and project grants to be reached year to year.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 43 Post-graduate scholarships be made available in the marine sciences and technologies, to be tenable in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The number of new Post-graduate Awards provided by the Commonwealth Government has been increased from 700 in 1980 to 800 in 1981. This increase was in response to the Recommendations of the William's Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training. It has not been policy under the Post-graduate Award Scheme to allocate Awards to particular areas of study. Traditionally the Awards have been available in open competition on the basis of academic merit to people in all disciplines.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 44 The Australian Marine Science Council finance marine science in this country through the mechanisms of the Marine Science Research and Development Fund. Research directed towards national priorities would be financed through project and programme grants, scholarships and fellowships. This Fund would also finance the Ship Operations Unit, the Information Services Unit and the operations of the Research Institutes and the island research stations. Financial support for research conducted at these, and all other facilities, would be subject to successful application for grants, scholarships and fellowships.</PARA>
<PARA>Response See response to Recommendations 4.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 45 Adequate levies be placed on industries exploiting resources in the 200 n.m. zone, especially foreign-owned fishing ventures and oil and gas industries. The revenue derived from these levies should assist in the financing of marine science research, and in the provision of inspectors and scientific observers on foreign fishing vessels.</PARA>
<PARA>Response The hypothecation of general Government revenue derived from fishing and offshore crude oil production to specific Government expenditure is contrary to general Government budgetary policy.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Barry Jones-Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a very short statement on the Government's response to the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sinclair-Leave is refused, but I am prepared to move that the House take note of the paper and for debate to be adjourned until another day.</PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed:</PARA>
<PARA> That the House take note of the paper.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Barry Jones-Before I move that the debate be now adjourned may I have your indulgence, Mr Speaker, to say that I hope that this matter will actually be brought on for debate. I ask the Leader of the House whether he can give an undertaking of some sort. We have not been exactly burdened with the business in the last few sitting weeks. This is an important matter on which I think several honourable members would like to speak briefly. I hope that rather than just being put on the Notice Paper and going into the limbo of forgotten things, time will be found to have a discussion of over an hour or so some time within the next two sitting weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sinclair-I shall discuss the matter with the manager of Opposition business along with the other outstanding matters of business for the House that have been deferred in a similar way.</PARA>
<PARA> Debate (on motion by Mr Barry Jones) adjourned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to raise today is one which will not be seen to have world shattering implications for many people but for those people who are affected it certainly has influenced both their faith in the word of government and their ability to maintain a decent standard of living. Back in 1972, in the 1972-73 Budget Speech delivered on 15 August, the then Treasurer, none other than yourself, Mr Speaker, announced the domiciliary nursing care benefit. The intention of the new benefit was to supplement existing nursing home benefits. In the statement accompanying the enabling legislation, namely the National Health Bill of 1972, the Minister of the time expressed the hope that the domiciliary nursing care benefit would provide many people with an alternative to full time care in a nursing home. This was a laudable aim. These were the words used by the Minister in ending his statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The number of elderly people in our population is increasing each year and therefore the requirement to provide community services and benefits based on the particular needs of this segment of the population needs to be given special consideration. It is also a fact of modern day living that the evolution of the so-called nuclear family tends to exclude, often through necessity rather than choice, the care of parents or grandparents in the same home as their children or other relatives. But it is also true that there are many families who feel deeply a sense of family totality and who make considerable sacrifices to keep elderly relatives within the home even when they may require constant nursing. Such people are to be admired. But the Government wants now to see that they receive, on behalf of the community at large, more than just admiration. We trust that the new domiciliary care benefit will not only assist people to meet the financial consequence of their dedication to sick friends or relatives but also help maintain that special sense of service, security and satisfaction which grows out of such dedication. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that all honourable members will feel a warm glow following the reading of that excerpt from the Minister's statement. Of course, there were and there are conditions for eligibility. Initially, eligibility was limited to those of 65 years or over but that and other conditions were modified; today allowance is made for those in remote areas and, since 1979, the minimum qualifying age has been reduced to 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Benefit rates were increased from $28 to $42 per fortnight from 4 September 1980. It may come as some surprise to those who have so far basked in the rosy glow of self-satisfaction to learn that there is still a credibility gap which the Government must bridge if the fine words of 1972 are to be accorded any respect in 1982. The rise in the consumer price index since the benefit was first introduced on 1 March 1973 has steadily eroded the value of the benefit despite the increase of 1980. The following figures give the true picture. Had the $28 per fortnight kept its original value, beneficiaries would now be receiving $74 per fortnight. When the rate was increased to $42 per fortnight, an increase to $65 per fortnight was needed to regain the original value of the benefit. Now the picture is even worse. What has happened is that the benefit has been seriously devalued since the fine words of 1972 were spoken. Of course, if that were the only problem facing beneficiaries, that would be bad enough, but the situation is worse than that. </PARA>
<PARA> When programs such as this are introduced and are in operation I consider that there are moral obligations on both parties, that is, the Government and the participants, to maintain the principles involved. After all, when the Department of Health approves the payment of the benefit, it cautions the participants with these words: 'Advice of any change in circumstances which might affect payment of the benefit should be forwarded to this office as soon as possible but not later than seven days from the time the change occurred'. But obligations should not be one-sided. </PARA>
<PARA> What then is occurring in Victoria at present? A number of constituents of my electorate of Ballarat have contacted my office in recent days and indicated that their domiciliary nursing care benefit payments have been delayed or have arrived rather intermittently since the end of October 1981. Any member of this House should feel very concerned about this delay of payments. Firstly, there is the matter of breach of faith and, secondly, many of those participating in the scheme depend upon the prompt arrival of the benefit cheque to be able to meet the cost of the care, for instance, for the services of a visiting nurse or the cost of medication and aids. I have made inquiries about this matter and have found that the reasons for the delay are recent in origin. Firstly, there has been a reduction in the number of staff involved because of a failure by the Government to replace staff who are promoted or transferred out of the section or who leave the service. Secondly, no overtime money is allowed. Thirdly, sicknesses among the people in the section dealing with this benefit have caused a reduction of staff and no relieving staff have been available. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only should members of this House be concerned about this matter, but also members of the Government should feel absolutely ashamed that the victims of the actions of the so-called razor gang of 1981 are, once again, those least able to withstand the impact of this Government's actions. If Government members have any compassion at all, they will revolt against this rigid and dogmatic adherence to this Procrustean doctrine so dogmatically pursued by their Government at the expense of the aged, the infirm and their loved ones who make such a tremendous effort to keep their faith in the Government's proud words of 1972. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1V5">Mr KATTER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Kennedy)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.16)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The two matters on which I wish to speak today are both, I am sure, in the evaluation of any reasonable Australian, of immense value to the nation generally and to every person in it. I wish to refer first to the severe penalties, both financial and physical, that are suffered to a greater or lesser degree by people once they live beyond the boundaries of the metropolitan areas in each State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like particularly to draw attention to some of the extreme difficulties which exist for residents of areas such as those for which I and other members, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker, are responsible. I have in mind the obvious disadvantages presented by climatic conditions and the penalty of distance. I do not use that phrase as a cliche; it can be applied in 101 different ways. To use my own state of Queensland as an example, once a person travels in his motor car 80 or 90 miles from the city of Brisbane he must face a petrol bowser charge of anything from 42c to 45c a litre. In my home area which is 500 or 600 miles from the coast, a family man who drives his family to the nearest point which enjoys somewhat better climatic conditions must face an expenditure on petrol alone of $100 to $200, or as much as $400 for a return trip. What I have stated is fact. </PARA>
<PARA> My electorate embraces many mining interests and today I would like to take a slant different from that which I might be expected to take. Constantly we hear of industrial upheaval, in coal mining areas in particular. I would like to point out that the average labourer in the area in which I represent must combat temperatures of anything from 35 to 45 degrees centigrade. That is not an exaggeration. The effect of the intense heat is greatly accentuated if one is, for instance, a linksman engaged in repairing railway lines. All of us know of these groups of men, whose work is quite unheralded. I use their situation as an example. I do not want to become ultra-parochial but a very fundamental principle is involved. Whenever men who work in coal mines go underground they take their lives in their hands. I had the terrible experience of having 13 of my constituents wiped out at Kianga in a coal mine disaster. It is important to remember that such people sustain the most vital industries of this nation. They sustain the beef cattle industry, the sheep industry, the mining industry, the sugar industry and the fisheries. All of these, in the aggregate, fill the coffers of the Treasury, and if one were suddenly to cut off the income they produce the nation would be in real trouble; it would be bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Government made a well-intentioned attempt to re-examine this situation, and in particular zone allowances. As one who was on the original committee, under Ben Chifley, which considered zone allowances many years ago, I have argued repeatedly that such allowances are an attempt to meet just one aspect of the financial penalties under which people must operate once they get away from the more favoured areas of this nation. The Government's review was well-intentioned but it was utterly futile. The findings that were made, and the recommendations that were accepted by the Government, did not help in any measure that was commensurate with the difficulties confronted in the areas involved. Any honourable member who has any intelligence, who is reasonable and who is not trying to make political points because perhaps a marginal seat is involved will recognise that the Government is making a super effort to balance the Budget in what are very difficult times. It is a pretty weak argument to refer constantly to what is happening overseas but one cannot deny that what is in fact happening overseas involves our interests. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk of additional funding and of trying to assist these areas that produce this great wealth, wherever they might be, let us remember that there is certain expenditure, certain funding, which the Treasury is obliged to make which is non-productive, which does not bring a return. However, I say with all of the conviction of which I am capable that every cent that is given to the people living in these areas is more than productive. This funding stimulates production. We do not talk very much these days about the gross national product . The GNP is regulated by such things as the capacity of people to produce, the desire of people to produce and the intention of the worker to give an honest day's labour for an honest day's pay. If we can build up that we can increase our social services and the good things that we like to give the people of the nation. I well remember that when I was in the United States of America, attending the United Nations, President Nixon came on the television to make one brief announcement. He said to the people of America: 'I am immensely proud of you because today you have reached a gross national product for this nation of one trillion dollars'. Admittedly, things are not that good now. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying that if funding can be given to these areas, these achievements can be made. Take the pensioners. I know this is a very moot subject but it does not bring me or anyone else any great joy to see the situation in which the old people of these areas are placed. If the Australian Labor Party, the Opposition, takes any joy in saying that Katter is having a belt at his own party, I point out one fact that will stand to the disgrace of the ALP for all time: It reduced the pension during the Depression. People in the most disadvantaged group in the nation had their limited income reduced during the Depression years. Also, I doubt whether one yard of bitumen was put down in the inland areas of this great nation during the term of office of that Government. What did the Menzies Government do? It produced an epic and made probably the greatest contribution even to this nation-it built the beef roads. Where would any of us in those desolate areas be if those beef roads had not been built? Let members of the Opposition gain no particular comfort from my, I hope constructive, case to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> What can be done? I refer to the sales tax on freight costs. For years and years-as long as I can remember-we have argued against this. It is a vicious penalty and should be removed. I believe its removal would be one of the great contributions we could make to decentralisation and to the building up of the great inland areas of this nation. It is not so much a matter of building up those areas now but of keeping people there. It is a matter of survival. The great story of history is that when people begin to emigrate, like moths around the glow of the city, the nation concerned begins to deteriorate. I could go on and on in regard to this subject but I do plead with the Government to look at the whole spectrum of penalties under which people in these remote areas live. I ask the Government to have a look at freight costs, at the price of petrol, at health services and at the capacity of people to travel to more favoured areas for perhaps a week's holiday. It should look at these things and try to give back to these people, who are doing the hard yakka, who are working their guts out in terrible climatic conditions, some compensation for sustaining the great industries of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other subject I want to speak on is an unbelievable recommendation made by a working party or committee-call it what you like-on which some very eminent people served. I refer to the recommendation that marihuana be made available, that people be permitted to grow it. What is the attitude of a group of people who could make such a recommendation? I happened to chair a marihuana committee- it was not a drugs committee, but a marihuana committee-and the greatest lesson I learned was from a young addict who had succeeded in getting rid of the habit. He said: 'Look, Bob, marihuana is not an addiction like heroin is; your body doesn't scream for it, you don't get that terrible physical reaction, but what does happen is that you get such a lift when you take it or when you are addicted to it'-he used the word 'addicted' with a good deal of thought-'that when you are without it you would sell your socks to get back to it'. </PARA>
<PARA> I was on the World Health Organisation mailing list. Information I have received from that body clearly indicates that 90 per cent of those who have graduated to the heavier drugs such as LSD and heroin had been addicted to marihuana. I am not saying that 90 per cent of people smoking marihuana went to the heavier drugs; what I am saying is that 90 per cent of those on heavy drugs had at some time or other been addicted to marihuana. I think that men who put another pressure on young people should be subject to a dreadful indictment. These young people are already absolutely barraged with various pressures that reduce their capacity to be the good young Australians they naturally would wish to be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to grieve for those Victorians, pensioners and home buyers, who are exposed to the cruel and deceptive fraud perpetrated by the Thompson Liberal Government and particularly by the Victorian Minister of Housing, Mr Jeff Kennett. The conspiracy to shift the whole of the blame on to their Federal colleagues was conceived by the Victorian Liberal Government late last year when it started to realise that it had lost the confidence of the Victorian electorate. The Victorian Minister of Housing, Jeff Kennett, put full page advertisements in Victorian daily papers blaming Malcolm Fraser for the disastrous housing situation in Victoria. Kennett spent tens of thousands of Victorian taxpayers' dollars on that exercise. He set up the effigy of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and, knowing his unpopularity, knocked him down. He hit below the belt in the process and expected the applause of the Victorian people. Well, the applause never came. All Kennett got instead was a sharp attack on him by the Federal Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh), his senior colleague, who pointed out that Victoria has the worst record of all the States in Australia, and has spent the smallest amount per capita on housing . To add insult to injury, he called Jeff Kennett a political gelding. I am occasionally ashamed of the terms which the honourable members opposite use to describe their own colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So after spending tens of thousands of Victorian taxpayers' money on gimmicks instead of on better housing, the Liberal Minister of Housing, Jeff Kennett, did not succeed in duping the voters of Victoria. All he managed to do was to invoke the wrath of his Federal Liberal colleagues who are guilty enough in their own right of the slump in housing without being blamed for the Victorian Government' s mismanagement also. It is true that the Fraser Government has a dismial record on housing, especially as far as allocations for welfare housing are concerned. It is true that the Fraser Government presides over the highest housing interest rates in our history. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us examine the credentials of the Victorian Liberal Government, and what credentials the Victorian Housing Minister, Mr Kennett, has, to drag its Federal buddies across the carpet. While Kennett was busy trying to blame his ideological buddies in Canberra, he left $16m unspent from his allocation for housing in Victoria for 1980-81. While homeless youths in my electorate, and indeed in many other parts of Victoria, sleep in parks and shelters, this Minister, Mr Kennett, has $16m unspent from his allocation. He would have done better if he had used this money and the taxpayers' money that he is spending on Liberal Party electioneering through media advertisements on housing homeless youth. Let us have another look at the Victorian Liberal Government's performance as far as housing is concerned. According to Federal Department of Housing and Construction figures, Victoria spends less on welfare housing per capita than any other State in the Commonwealth. Let us look at how they compare . On a per capita basis New South Wales spends $13.98, Queensland $13.67, Western Australia $16.10, Tasmania $25.17 and South Australia $66.08. Victoria spends the princely sum of $8.80. How does Mr Kennett have the temerity, the impudence, to criticise anyone?</PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the latest gimmick of the Victorian Housing Minister. At a special meeting of State Premiers last month Mr Kennett outlined a new scheme- the so-called 'granny bond'-which has as its target the syphoning off of $500m to $1,000m held by aged people to lend to home buyers. It was a good old confidence trick-use anybody's money but your own. However, there are many other things wrong with this scheme. Mr Kennett knows that. As I have said before, he is perpetrating a deceptive fraud on Victorians. He knows very well that this scheme is useless unless the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) cough up the dough. Both Mr Thompson and Mr Kennett know that those two Liberal colleagues of theirs in Canberra are good at making promises and equally as good at breaking them. However, in this instance no promise was given. On 25 February 1982, I asked the Prime Minister this question without notice:</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Prime Minister aware that the granny bond scheme outlined by the Victorian Minister of Housing, Mr Kennett, this week depends heavily on the Federal Government agreeing to legislate to provide for tax deductibility of interest rates? Since this involves a major commitment by the Commonwealth Government with far broader implications than housing policy, will the Prime Minister state what consultations, if any, he has had with his State colleagues on this important matter? Has the Commonwealth Government agreed to support the Victorian Government by immediately introducing legislation for such tax deductibility? If not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA>From the Prime Minister's reply to my question it was quite clear that no undertaking has been given for the introduction of tax deductibility for granny bonds, not to mention the question of assurances that interest earned on savings of aged people will not affect their pension entitlements. So the fraud perpetrated on pensioners and home buyers by the Victorian Government is exposed . But, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you think that I am somewhat harsh on the Victorian Liberal Government, I wish to draw your attention to the editorial of the Australian Financial Review of 26 February this year. I may be accused of some measure of bias or dislike of the Liberal Party, but the same cannot be said of the Australian Financial Review. Let us examine what was said in the editorial. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The silly season for housing subsidy schemes is well and truly on. The Premiers of the States, in their collective wisdom, have just produced a set of proposals which would be ludicrous if they were not seriously advanced as some kind of solution to the difficulties of house buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> As usual, the bill is to be presented to the Commonwealth Government, and therefore to the taxpayer. The States have always been only too willing to spend the taxpayer's money so long as they do not have to take the blame for collecting it. </PARA>
<PARA> A rough estimate of how much the measures proposed by the Premiers would cost the Commonwealth is $750 million. In the present state of Commonwealth finances, to expect expenditures of such a scale is unrealistic, especially as the States are equally enthusiastically opposing the sales tax measures which were designed to increase Commonwealth revenues. Of course, realism is not what the exercise is about. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather, it is a cynical exercise in politics intended (in the Victorian case) to shift the blame for impending defeat on to the Federal Liberal Party, in the likely event that the Prime Minister refuses to cough up, and in the New South Wales case, to be used as a campaign issue in the Lowe by-election. </PARA>
<PARA>What an indictment. This speaks for itself. I could not have said it better myself. The dirty tricks of Mr Thompson and Mr Kennett are exposed here-not by me, a member of the Opposition, but by a newspaper which is not known to favour the Australian Labor Party. Let us now have a look at Thompson's latest promises made last night. Again I quote from an article in the Australian Financial Review under the title: 'Thompson bids with a fistful of dollars'. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Premier's speech was notable for the absence of any reference to how the Government proposed to fund its big-spending bid for votes in the April 3 poll. </PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal Government in Victoria had 27 years to implement what it has suddenly started to preach now. 'Thompson bids with a fistful of dollars', says the headline. The Victorian electors remember only too well that Liberal fist of $5 notes in a federal election a few years ago. That fist is back again. But the Victorian electors will not be duped by Mr Thompson. They will not be misled by his dirty tricks and by Mr Kennett's shadow boxing with his own Liberal Party. They will see through these manoeuvres. On 3 April they will elect a Cain Labor government which will be an honest government for Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the investigation which is currently being set up into the activities and future of the Australian Loan Council. This investigation was first announced after the recent Premiers Conference, and first announced in the newspapers following that Premiers meeting. I was concerned that such an important and fundamental investigation should be launched in such a way as to ignore Parliament in that announcement. I spoke on this matter in a speech which I made in Queensland to a dinner of the Young Liberal Movement on the evening of 22 February. Subsequently I asked a question of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) as to the Government's intentions. My question in part stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Who are the members of the committee which is to conduct that study? When will the committee report and to whom will it report?</PARA>
<PARA>That was the first reference made in Parliament to this investigation. The Treasurer was good enough to table the terms of reference which are headed: ' Terms of reference for inquiry into role of Loan Council'. It was only then that we were able to learn of the significance of this inquiry. I wish to quote from parts of that document. Whilst the document has been tabled it has not yet been inserted in Hansard. The terms of reference stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Loan Council resolves that a working party of Commonwealth and State officers be established to undertake a fundamental examination of the role of Loan Council . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Working Party is to identify any desirable changes in a Report to Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA>In part, one of the changes which it was to examine was the extent to which governments and their authorities now have access to capital funds additional to those provided through approved Loan Council borrowing programs and the extent to which Loan Council should control such access. The paper indicates a number of other items of investigation and in a particular paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> Additional specific issues may be added at the request of the States during the next two weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>Those two weeks have elapsed and the Parliament has still not been informed of any additional matters that reflect upon or add to the work of this inquiry. In the speech which I made in Queensland I said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is fair then that it should not be surreptitiously altered--</PARA>
<PARA> I was referring to the Loan Council-</PARA>
<PARA>behind the closed doors of a secret meeting. Proposed changes should not be stage-managed by a departmental investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting that the inquiry-this fundamental examination of the role of the Loan Council-will be carried out by a working party of Commonwealth and State officers. It is worth reflecting that whilst some of those officers, as any honourable members who have been involved with those officers would agree, are of the highest order of integrity and commitment to their work that one will find in Australia the fact nevertheless exists that they are departmental officers. They are subject to direction by their Ministers and to a direction in the way in which their study could be and can be carried out. The Loan Council has served Australia for 50 years. It regulates the developmental programs that are spread across this nation. It is an organisation which was set up out of a very great debate conducted over a long number of years. It was set up because States had overborrowed and had established loans which they were unable to meet . The legislation to set up the Loan Council had to be approved by a referendum of the Australian people. I find it rather strange that considering the background of such a successful organisation, which has stood behind an enormous program of decentralisation and development in this country, it should be subjected to a fundamental inquiry of its future role by departmental officers who are subject to departmental and ministerial direction. I find that that pays less than proper service to the importance of that body and to future development in Australia. I believe it has been a tremendous regulatory factor for decentralisation, which I have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country we have an enormous aggregation of population on the eastern seaboard. We have a financial system which greatly subsidises population in the smaller States from the wealth of the larger States. This is something which has been carried on in relation to the amount that smaller States have been able to borrow in their loan programs. I believe that it is easy to agree superficially to an examination of the Loan Council. However, on further study one finds that one is examining a very fundamental basis for development and growth in Australia and a fundamental prop of living standards of some equality for all Australians wherever they may be. It would be inconceivable to think of disbanding the Loan Council. In fact, I believe that the Government would never countenance disbanding it. However I refer again to the statement that it is a fundamental inquiry. If it is fundamental one could conceive that it could recommend that the Loan Council be disbanded. If that were the case that recommendation would come from departmental officers. I believe that the investigation is not of sufficient width and independence to provide the basis for any such recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a somewhat shoddy way of the Government to treat the importance of the Loan Council that it should announce such an investigation outside the Parliament. It is somewhat shoddy that information about that investigation is being supplied to this Parliament only by an answer to a question. It should have been the subject of a ministerial statement and, following that, a debate in the House of Representatives. It may be that the Treasurer will provide further information. In response to my question asking who will comprise the members of the investigative study I was told that the names will be furnished. They have not yet been furnished although the question was framed on 23 February . I await the answer. All members of the Parliament should take an interest in the study of the fundamental role and future of the Loan Council. We should know who are the members of the study group and we should be assured that they are free of ministerial direction. I await the Treasurer's further reply to the question that I have posed. As I said, I hope that he will initiate a statement in this place as to the Government's intentions. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that some Premiers arrived at the Loan Council without knowing that this matter would be on the agenda. I understand that one or two were informed privately. That in itself is a bad start to such an important step . If the recommendations of this committee were to be put before the Loan Council in the same way as the proposal to have the investigation was put before the Loan Council, we would have a very much closed shop investigation and tend to have a closed shop implementation of the recommendations that would come from it. The Treasurer owes it to the importance and future of the Loan Council to make a statement to the House and to allow it to debate fully the issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night the Premier of Victoria, in his policy speech, put up a phony housing proposal that must be regarded, by anybody who has studied the situation in that State, as much too little, much too late. The people of Victoria will assess it in that way on 3 April. The needy were, once again, ignored and the Premier simply carried out a cynical vote-catching exercise for the marginal seats in Victoria by offering a mere pittance to a handful of families. While the debate continues to rage on the problems of home ownership, the availability of loan funds and the costs of these funds, those dependent on the rental market are ignored by both State and Federal governments . Yet, ironically, as the myth of home ownership becomes more mythical, as the great Australian dream becomes the great Australian nightmare, more families and individuals are being forced to rely on the rental market for housing and accommodation. The fault lies at both federal and State levels and the Victorian Government's performance in this area has been abysmal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major contributors to the problems in Victoria have been the non-regulation of interest rates in respect of building societies, the concentration of federal and State funds on bolstering the private sector, the massive decrease in real housing funds under the Federal Government, the failure of the Victorian Government to match other States in housing spending and the run-down of the public housing sector, exemplified in the irresponsible sell-off or, more correctly termed the 'give-away' of the Holmesglen construction division by the Victorian Minister of Housing. With an economy in chaos for ordinary working people facing the obstacles of real and threatened unemployment, falling wage values, inflation and soaring interest rates, public housing must become a government priority. Yet this Government and the Victorian Government say nothing about it and do less. Public housing is not the provision of low cost, poorly constructed estates for the disadvantaged. It is the provision of high quality, decent housing stock throughout the community at reasonable rentals. Rentals ought to be adjusted to salary or income but the level of income ought not debar people from the right to adequate and proper housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this Government's record. When the thieves of public office stole government in 1975 the Federal Budget outlay on housing was 3.9 per cent. Last year it was one per cent of the total Budget outlay. A comparison of that decline against the Government's spending patterns on industry assistance, handouts and giveaways to big business, subsidies and support for the pastoral and rural industries, spending on massive infrastructure for the resource industry and tax concessions and holidays to giant capital makes the major thrust of the Government's policy and philosophy apparent. The results are more apparent in the desperate need for decent public housing at one end of the scale and the record profits and affluence at the other. Spending on public housing, expressed in constant 1981 prices, was $1,227m in 1974-75 and a pitiful $399m in the present Budget. There was a cut of 77.5 per cent in real terms over that period. At the same time, spending on defence homes and home savings grants has increased dramatically, unbalancing the priority further in favour of private housing against public housing. Further, under the current 1981-86 Commonwealth- State Housing Agreement the break-up of funds between home purchase assistance and public rental housing is determined by each State. When that choice is placed in the hands of a free enterprise government, such as the Victorian Government, with no concern for ordinary working people, the result is disaster.</PARA>
<PARA> We have recently heard the Victorian Government excuse its appalling record in public housing by blaming the Federal Government. In part that is true but the growing numbers of people requiring a responsible public housing policy are being jammed between two governments which are unwilling to assist them. While Federal funding is being reduced dramatically the Victorian Government has also failed to pull its weight in the area. The Federal Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) was reported in the Age of 18 May last year as pointing out that the national average State contribution to housing was $16 a head, yet the Victorian contribution was $6 a head. My friend, the the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) said earlier, that it was $8 a head. Whilst the Victorian Government claims that the money was directed into another area of housing, it is a matter of robbing Peter to pay Paul and highlights the poverty of the policy. At the level at which the need exists this irresponsibility by Federal and State governments means waiting lists in some areas of up to five years at a time when Victorian Housing Commission waiting lists are growing by an additional 1,200 rental applications a month. Even the Victorian Ministry estimates the number of low income earners living in poverty in the private rental sector at about 200,000 households. At least 15,000 young people are homeless, and women's and youth refuges turn down three in every four requests for accommodation each week. </PARA>
<PARA> More and more people are being forced into the rental market through their inability to meet housing repayments. In this Government's economic climate the position will only worsen. The need for massive injections of Federal and State funds on public housing is desperate. It is receiving no more than token acknowledgement from this Government or its Victorian ally. The only new direction of any Victorian policy, as spelt out by the Victorian Premier last night, is down. Public housing must be provided by buying good housing stock in developed areas and building new, high quality stock in other areas or through inner urban infill housing policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government has abandoned this principle by giving away its Holmesglen construction division. It argued that the cost of construction at Holmesglen was excessive. However, there are strong arguments to suggest that the costs arose not from the Holmesglen facility per se but from the maladministration and professional incompetence within the Housing Commission itself. Given the Commission's history of corruption and land deals, which have left more than one Liberal Minister in retirement or on the back bench, that explanation seems quite reasonable. In an area where the State Government claims there is a shortage of funds we have the scandalous position of engineers and architects sitting in the Housing Commission with virtually nothing to do. Of course, given the track record for wastage and contempt of public funds in the Victorian Housing Commission that position is par for the course. </PARA>
<PARA> But the position is worse. In the mass give away of the viable and the socially vital Holmesglen plant expensive machinery has been handed over to the private sector at a fraction of its value. In a concentrated industrial area the big business mates of the Victorian Government were able to buy cheap and sell at a major profit. Let me give one example. Simsmetal Pty Ltd bought 16 vibrating tables, which are large work benches, for $189 each and sold them for $850 each with no interim costs apart from transportation. Large tyre tractors worth up to $6,000 were sold by the Victorian Government for $1,400 and overhead gantries worth up to $20,000 were sold for $6,000. Expensive mixers worth $45,000 were sold for $4,000; if 'sold' be the word. I would rather use the more correct term that the items were given away by the Government to its mates. If the items were to be sold they should have been sold at least at their real value so that the State did not subsidise big business any more than it already does. </PARA>
<PARA> In real terms the major companies which bought these give-away items were taking the roofs from over the heads of the needy who cannot obtain housing, thanks to the policies of the Victorian Government. However, the construction plant should have been retained, not only for building homes and units, but also for other vital government works where lucrative contracts are let to private profiteers. I believe the Holmesglen plant which was allowed to be destroyed by the Victorian Government was the only plant in Australia capable of supplying the amounts of material required for the new and permanent Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> The homeless, the needy, those who require adequate, proper and non-charitable public housing are the victims of both of these governments. The people of Victoria will reject the Liberal Government on 3 April. I sincerely hope and trust that the Cain Labor Party will be given a mandate to correct this shocking state of affairs perpetrated on the people of Victoria. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will allow anybody who heard that outburst to judge from that the level of the honourable member's contribution. I speak today about research in Australian universities and in particular about a program concerning research centres of excellence in Australian universities, a program in which I had the very fortunate opportunity to participate last year. The Prime Minister (Mr Fraser), in his 1980 policy speech, promised that $16m would be devoted over the 1982-84 triennium to set up research centres of excellence in universities. The idea originated with the old Universities Commission which put forward the idea of special post-graduate centres giving in universities a concentration of research which could not be provided from normal individual grants. In other words, if the critical mass of research were put in one area a more concentrated effort could be made. Results would be speeded up and there would be a contribution to better or more attractive conditions for researchers around Australia. The Commonwealth Research Centres of Excellence Committee had the following terms of reference:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Research Centres of Excellence will be special units within Australian universities, or in other places by arrangement with universities, established by concentrating research workers and resources, with the aim of pursuing research of outstanding quality within an international context likely to lead to a significant and major development of knowledge; in addition, their research programs may be directed to a national research objective or to take advantage of unique Australian opportunities. A Research Centre of Excellence will be led by a chief researcher, recognised internationally as eminent in his intellectual discipline, currently active in the Centre's particular area of research and able to maintain his commitment for the duration of the Centre's program. </PARA>
<PARA>It is fair to say that this kind of idea is already in practice in the research schools of the Australian National University and also in certain research institutions such as the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne. It is not a totally new idea. The idea was to extend research from outside those sorts of special centres into universities generally and to enable them to set up concentrated centres of research and give the very best people a push along. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government decided to set up not an academic committee to determine grants but a committee chaired by a businessman, Mr S. B. Myer, the Chairman of the Myer Emporium Ltd, and having as its members Mr R. D. G. Agnew, a Perth businessman and Chairman of the new Australian Bank Ltd, Professor D. N. F. Dunbar, the Chairman of the Universities Council and me. Obviously we had to get assistance from the academic community in Australia and elsewhere to judge the academic excellence of the applicants. We were able to contribute something towards the selection by looking at the management of the centre and the kind of support it received from the university in which it was placed. We had to get some idea of the individual qualities of the chief researchers. We had to be very heavily guided by the expert advice of the peers of the researchers from overseas and within the Australian community; in other words, those groups which were not applying for grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme was publicised. We received some 327 proposals from universities. It was a very difficult task to get these down to a short list of some 30 universities, which we did again based on the academic recommendations which were received. The Committee visited the 30 institutions on the short list. Going to universities pretty well all around Australia and meeting the very best Australian researchers was one of the most interesting and exciting things in which I have ever been involved. I was overwhelmed by the quality of the people, by their dedication to what they were doing and by the sheer brilliance of their work, as far as we, as lay people, could judge it. I had a feeling also that, despite all the problems Australia has in getting enough funds for research, it has an extraordinary capacity in this area when it is looked at at ground level. I recommend to honourable members to visit, insofar as they can, their local universities and to talk with some of the very best research workers. It is a most rewarding and enlightening experience. </PARA>
<PARA> We really had a surfeit of excellent applications. From that short list of 30 and from the money we had we were able to give awards to only 10 centres over the three years. We awarded not on any geographical basis-that caused some heartburning in certain areas-but as we awarded on the sheer excellence of the proposals we virtually had to ignore the disciplines in which the proposals were and also the locations of the universities in which these centres were based. Of course that caused some heartburning and some difficulty had to be faced. We also invited applications from non-university institutions, such as colleges of advanced education, although there was a requirement in our terms of reference that those centres be funded through universities. Indeed, in one case we were able to make a grant to a joint microelectronics research centre headed by Dr Graham Rigby, who is about to be made professor in the school of electrical engineering and computer science in the University of New South Wales, in association with Dr Martin Green of the University of New South Wales and Dr James Williams from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. This was quite an interesting situation in that we had two proposals from two quite separate institutions, but by finding a head of a research centre who came from the private sector and who was about to be appointed to the University of New South Wales we were able, with the advice of the Australian Science and Technology Council, to have a centre which got the very best from the two cities and from two quite different institutions. It was a rewarding experience to see that being set up in an area of great importance to Australia. But it has to be emphasised that that centre was chosen on the excellence of its research rather than on the particular discipline on which it was based. It was a happy coincidence that it happened to be also very much in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA> In the choice of the final 10 there was a bit of a bias towards medical sciences and related disciplines, but that tends to reflect where the very best Australian research efforts are currently placed. This is not in our report and it is only a personal view, but I suppose if the medical schools around the country over many years have been creaming off the very top number of places from the schools, it is almost inevitable that over time-as people are attracted to that field-there will tend to be heavy concentrations of brilliance in those areas. This was certainly the case. But we did get a reasonable spread in other areas. It is worth looking at that situation for the future and worrying about how we can get greater concentrations of the very best brains across the various faculties, some of which have a more direct relevance to Australian results and Australian research than medical sciences, which have relevance virtually on a world wide basis. </PARA>

I hope also that the Government will enable the centres to be expanded.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like many other Australians I am eagerly awaiting the Lowe by-election next Saturday, 13 March. I believe that a crushing win by the Australian Labor Party's candidate, Michael Maher, will mark the beginning of the end of this Government and that the demise of this Government will come as a pleasant relief to the majority of Australians. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics brought down a report which stated that unemployment was as high as 483,000, or 7 per cent of the work force. That figure is up by nearly 60,000 over last year's. The balance of payments for the first eight months shows a trade deficit of $2.2 billion. The current account deficit is $5.6 billion, which is almost double last year's. The capital inflow figure is $3.9 billion. That is an overall deficit of $1.7 billion-a great record for this Government! Inflation is running at 11.3 per cent and rising, whereas overseas it is less than 10 per cent and falling. Consumer confidence is at its lowest level for nine years. Short term interest rates are now 20 per cent with no signs of any ceiling. This rise must eventually affect home loan interest rates in some measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having been given more than six years to implement its policies, this Government has proven beyond any doubt its general incompetence to do the job. It can no longer cast the blame for its troubles on the Whitlam Government. The Australian Labor Party was in power for only three years, and that was six years ago. This Government cannot reasonably blame overseas economic conditions, the unions or the so-called 'millionaire pensioners' for the nation's troubles. These scapegoats wore thin long ago with the electors. The responsibility for this mess has been laid squarely at the feet of the Government and no amount of squirming and lying is going to change that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe those voters in the 1980 elections who foolishly gave this Government another chance are now rueing their mistake. Some of these voters are in the electorate of Lowe, and 13 March is their chance to make amends and to let the Government really know how they feel about its performance . Other voters will, I hope, not have to wait too much longer for their chance. As they cast their votes they should consider the Government's policies over the last six years and especially how they affect them. The aged should consider how their pensions have been whittled away by inflation and how they have been further denigrated as second-class citizens. In March 1976 the pension stood at $38.75 a week, which was 22.8 per cent of average weekly earnings. By June 1982- in three months-the pension will be $72.10, which is only 21.6 per cent of average weekly earnings. If this is not bad enough, the income test figure has remained constant at $20 when it should have been increased to at least $36 to allow for inflation. This has meant that gradually more and more pensioners have been denied the full pension although six years earlier they would have been entitled to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Likewise, because of the negligible increase in the income test for health cards and fringe benefits, which by the way was raised only last year, a growing number of pensioners are being denied health cards and fringe benefits although six years earlier they too would have been entitled to them. Late last year the Government threatened to stop pensioners from holding no-interest bank accounts, even though this situation was mostly caused by the Government's failure to raise the pensioner income test. Now the Government is threatening to apply a stricter means test on pensioners in order to reduce its expenditure on social welfare. It is a pity that the Government did not think of the need for cost cutting when it decided recently to spend nearly $480m on an aircraft carrier. As a further infliction on pensioners, from May this year single pensioners will be paying tax on any bank or building society interest of more than $6.51 a week . This does not affect just the interest; it affects also the pension payment. Pensioners will face the imposition of tax at 32c in the dollar on their income above the $4,195 threshold. This will mean that many more pensioners will be joining the 250,000 pensioners who are already paying tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Government is making its message to pensioners loud and clear. It is blatantly treating them with contempt and playing them for fools. Does the Government seriously expect their vote? How can anyone blame pensioners for being apprehensive about their future when different members of the Cabinet contradict each other about Government policy? How can anyone have faith in the assurances of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when the Deputy Leader of his party (Sir Phillip Lynch) is espousing the opposite view. Based on the Prime Minister's past record of broken promises, his word is worthless. How appropriate it is that the description of him remains in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has displayed indifference to the plight of the aged in need of nursing home and hostel care. As the Australian population is aging and becoming increasingly in need of domiciliary services and nursing home and hostel care, the Government is short-sightedly making cutbacks in this area. By not adequately supporting domiciliary services it is also promoting inappropriate use of residential care. In my electorate of Sydney the demand for nursing home and hostel accommodation far exceeds the supply, causing many of my constituents to look for accommodation in the neighbouring Kingsford-Smith, Lowe and Grayndler electorates. The accommodation in these areas has reached saturation point. </PARA>
<PARA> The inadequate quantity of accommodation is one serious problem; the quality and price of the accommodation is another. A number of nursing homes are still providing poor quality care for their patients, particularly in the areas of meeting social and activity needs. The price of staying in many nursing homes now far exceeds the pension, causing many pensioners to become a financial burden on their children or to quickly use up their financial reserves. At present the nursing home benefit in addition to the pension fails to cover the full cost of nursing home care for over 15,000 pensioners. By next May this figure will double, leaving as few as 30 per cent of pensioners in nursing homes fully covered. With quality tending to follow price, and with available accommodation difficult to find anyway, more and more pensioners and their families are realising the sorry state of affairs only too late. For those families in the electorate of Lowe their chance to break through this frustration and to record their hostility comes next Saturday through the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA> Those 36,000 residents of the Lowe electorate who were born overseas and who have now made Australia their home should consider the Government's performance in the area of immigration and ethnic affairs as they cast their vote. At a time when immigration to Australia is at an all time high, nearly $10m has been cut from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs as a result of the razor gang's recommendations. Long delays are occurring in the Department's offices overseas in the processing of applications for permanent residence. It is not uncommon for families to wait for a year or more to be reunited with their loved ones, including spouses. The Government apparently thinks the money saved by staff cuts justifies this heartache. </PARA>
<PARA> Also worthy of consideration by the many families in the Lowe electorate is the Australian Labor Party's new universal health insurance plan under which all Australians will be automatically covered for 85 per cent of the standard medical bills and public hospital treatment and accommodation will be available free. Compare this to the present medi-muddle which has undergone several changes and which costs taxpayers a considerable amount each week in health insurance premiums. The present system has proved difficult for consumers to understand and has provided a windfall for health insurance companies and unscrupulous doctors. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, I welcome the Lowe by-election and look forward to being joined in this Parliament by my friend and colleague, Michael Maher. I believe he is an outstanding candidate. He has successfully proven his ability in his 10 years as the State member for Drummoyne. He is a very popular man with people throughout the Lowe electorate because he is a man of the people, ever willing to help them with their problems. Even when Michael was a State member, he was handling Federal matters for those constituents who could not find their Federal member or who preferred to deal with a person they knew and trusted. Therefore, in many ways I believe Michael will find the transition to Federal Parliament an easy one. I wish him, his wife Margaret and their many children every success. </PARA>

What the people in the electorate of Lowe, and the citizens of New South Wales, need to remember is the industrial relations scene, the housing scene and the taxation scene as they exist in that State. The State taxes that are applied in New South Wales are the highest of any Australian State. Federal Government policies which are applied Australia-wide cannot overcome the mismanagement of the State of New South Wales by this corrupt State Government, a government which is captive to the left, a government which has problems in all of its Labor Party branches which are currently under investigation by the New South Wales police.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In presenting this Agreement, I am maintaining the commitment by the Government to present the texts of all of Australia's nuclear safeguards agreements in the Parliament as soon as practicable after signature with a full explanation of their provisions. The Agreement, which replaces the 1972 Australia-Japan Agreement for Co-operation in the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy , provides that nuclear transfers between Australia and Japan will be exclusively for peaceful, non-explosive purposes. It prescribes the conditions and controls which will apply to achieve the purpose of the Agreement and to ensure the observance of its provisions is fully verified. The provisions of the Agreement fully meet Australia's policy requirements as laid down by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 24 May 1977 and put into effect in Australia's other bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements. The Agreement also establishes a framework for mutual co-operation in the peaceful non-explosive uses of nuclear energy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The conclusion of the Agreement represents the achievement of a major objective of the Government's nuclear safeguards policy. It marks a significant extension of Australia's network of bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements which are designed to facilitate international nuclear trade under strict non- proliferation conditions. Further, it clears the way for export of Australian uranium to Japan, a country which is a major market for Australia's uranium and which has a heavy commitment to nuclear electricity generation and a significant investment in the Australian uranium mining industry. The Agreement adds significantly to the bilateral relationship and confirms the broad measure of agreement between Australia and Japan on the need to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and how this can be done. The conclusion of the Agreement with Japan is further evidence of the international acceptability of the requirements of the Government's nuclear safeguards policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Agreement brings the number of nuclear safeguards agreements concluded since 1977 to 10, covering 17 countries, including those Western countries with the most significant civil nuclear power programs, as well as two developing countries. All these agreements have been tabled in the Parliament. They are published in the Australian treaties series, and available to the public and to the media upon signature. </PARA>
<PARA> The announcement in 1977 of the Government's nuclear safeguards policy made it necessary to replace the 1972 Agreement between Australia and Japan by a new agreement incorporating the requirements of the Government's policy. Negotiations to this end began in Tokyo in June 1978 and were concluded in Canberra in January 1982. Several factors influenced progress in the negotiations. The Japanese, along with several of our other negotiating partners , wished to await and study the findings of the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation-INFCE-which took place from October 1977 until February 1981. The Japanese also took a close interest in the outcome of our negotiations with other significant partners, particularly those in Western Europe. I wish to stress that, as required by the Government's policy, there can be no deliveries to Japan, or any other country, of Australian uranium under contracts concluded since 1977 until the relevant nuclear safeguards agreement has entered into force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Agreement complies with all of the Government's nuclear safeguards policy requirements for the export of uranium. These include the prohibition of explosive and military uses of Australian-supplied uranium; the application of International Atomic Energy Agency-IAEA-safeguards to verify compliance with these basic undertakings; 'fallback' safeguards in the event of failure of the Non-Proliferation Treaty safeguards regime; adequate physical protection; consultations, and detailed procedures to ensure implementation of the obligations of the Agreement; provision for sanctions in the event of the non- observance of stipulated obligations of the Agreement; and arbitration procedures. The Agreement also provides for controls on the transfer of material , equipment or sensitive technology between the two countries, and for co- operation in the peaceful non-explosive uses of nuclear energy. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been suggestions in the media that the Agreement waters down Australia's policy requirements for prior consent over reprocessing, retransfers and high enrichment. These suggestions have no foundation whatsoever. The Agreement fully upholds all of Australia's policy requirements, including these requirements. The detailed conditions under which our consent rights are exercised over reprocessing and retransfers are set out in the documents which are attached to the Agreement and form part of it. I announced the Government's approach to the exercise of consent rights over reprocessing in my statement of 27 November 1980. As I made clear in that statement all of Australia's existing policy requirements continue to apply. What we have done on reprocessing is to define what had not previously been defined-the conditions under which the consent to reprocessing would be exercised and the controls that would apply to that operation. These have been incorporated in this Agreement with Japan as in the agreements with the European Atomic Energy Community, France and Sweden which have already been presented to the Parliament. The text of the Agreement shows that Press speculation which appeared at the time officials concluded their negotiations was misleading and incorrect. Japan has received no more than any other negotiating partner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Agreement incorporates what is known as the Australian 'program approach' to reprocessing. It requires that Australian-origin nuclear material subject to the Agreement shall be reprocessed, and the resulting separated plutonium stored and used, only under IAEA safeguards in the delineated Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program. Reprocessing for research and other applications is not approved under the program approach but is to be the subject of individual consideration in the future. This is fully in accordance with Australia's policy requirements and the conditions are the same as those in previous agreements concluded by Australia with EURATOM, France and Sweden. The Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle program is heavily dependent on nuclear fuel cycle services, namely, conversion, low enrichment, fuel fabrication and reprocessing, being undertaken at facilities in third countries. As I have already observed, the Agreement provides for the exercise by Australia of prior consent rights over transfers to such third countries. All the third countries with facilities included in the delineated Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle program have a safeguards agreement with Australia incorporating the requirements of the 1977 policy. These agreements confirm that satisfactory controls would be applied to the trans- ferred material in those countries in accordance with Australia's policy requirements. Consequently, it has been possible, in an exchange of notes to the Agreement, for the Australian Government to exercise its prior consent right by means of a system of notification for the transfers to the facilities in third countries within the delineated Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle program. A similar arrangement is contained in our agreements with Sweden and EURATOM. </PARA>
<PARA> The conclusion of the Agreement with Japan means that the Government has now come close to accomplishing the objective of concluding bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements with those member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with significant nuclear industries. The network of bilateral agreements we have established represents a body of international law and practice that is facilitating international nuclear trade under strict non-proliferation controls. This is what is meant when we say that Australia's bilateral agreements are contributing to international efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. The Agreement with Japan is particularly relevant in this respect. Like our agreements with EURATOM, Canada, Finland, Sweden and the United States, it has a duration of 30 years. Moreover, Japan has a heavy commitment to the use of nuclear reactors for the generation of electricity possessing some 24 such reactors, and, for the foreseeable future, the Japanese nuclear fuel cycle will continue to depend significantly on international co-operation for its effective functioning. </PARA>
<PARA> Bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements are a major element in the Government's policy, aimed at preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons. This approach includes active participation by Australia in international disarmament discussions, continued support for relevant international treaties and for efforts aimed at maintaining and enhancing the contribution to this objective of international institutional arrangements. To this end, Australia has played an active role in the Non-Proliferation Treaty review conferences, in INFCE in the negotiation of a Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material in International Transport, in the study of the feasibility of an international plutonium storage scheme and in an IAEA committee which is studying the question of assurances of supply in the nuclear field. The Government is also active in working for improvements in international safeguards through the IAEA itself, and is making a voluntary contribution to a program of support for IAEA safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to stress the importance of this Agreement for the bilateral relationship between Australia and Japan. It is a binding legal document which expresses the obligations of the two countries to carry out future co-operation in the peaceful, non-explosive uses of nuclear energy. It represents a significant contribution in the continuing effort to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons not least in our own region of the world. It provides confirmation that the Government has been able, throughout its negotiations on nuclear safeguards agreements, to apply the terms of Australian policy without favour or discrimination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -by leave-The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) has made a statement today relating to the Australia-Japan Nuclear Safeguards Agreement and, as he has said, this is the tenth agreement. We could say it is the tenth statement in similar terms. It has a feeling of deja vu about it. On that basis, I find myself having to repeat the strong objections I made to the other nine agreements because this one is no different. The objections I put forward, whether they related to the agreements with France, Sweden, the European Atomic Energy Community or Finland, still apply. The Government will not shift its position as to the weaknesses of that position. The key to these agreements, it seems to think, are the much lauded administrative arrangements to implement the provisions of the Agreement, to guarantee that we can always follow our fuel through the whole cycle and to guarantee that there is no diversion of the fuel into explosive material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, the Agreement purports to say that Australia maintains its right to prior consent over reprocessing. If looked at from that point of view, it appears that the Government does have some continuing control over it. But I want to make the point that the Agreement has watered down safeguards to which any responsible government should adhere. We do not really have control of the fuel throughout the cycle. At the moment, it is taken out as natural uranium and is then controlled by everybody else except Australia. It is important for the Australian people, and for the policies of peace in the world, to guarantee that environmental factors at least are preserved during high level waste disposal, that we maintain complete control. It is important that we talk about storage of waste, and the Government has a responsibility in that respect also. </PARA>
<PARA> A fair bit of work has been done in technology but it is still not sufficient. The technology of the world is not sufficiently advanced to guarantee that there will not be any diversification into weapons grade material. There is certainly no technology to guarantee the safe disposal of the high level waste. It is important not to assume that the technology is right; it is wrong. The French vitrification process of high level waste disposal is not adequate. The United States of America will not use it and nor should it. It is important that we consider developing some research, such as that done in Australia by Professor Ringwood and others, in an effort to help the world by safe disposal of high level waste. Unfortunately, at the moment, simply because it is France disposing of the waste, it has to be done the way the French do it; if it is the United States disposing of the waste, it has to be done the way the United States does it. But when an Australian has a few good ideas nothing is done. Australia remains well down the totem pole compared with the people who are using its uranium in the matter of taking advantage of the intelligence of Australians who might be able to help in the safe disposal of high level wastes. The fact that governments make statements such as the one before us, while not really grappling with the problems facing the world, is to be deplored. It is important that we back high level research in this area. If Professor Ringwood has ability in that regard he should be backed fully by the Government. The moneys that apparently are being expended upon the sale of natural uranium should certainly be used to guarantee that the world remains a safer and better place. </PARA>
<PARA> What is Australia's significance in terms of natural uranium resources? We have 294,000 tonnes of reasonably assured resources, and an estimated further 264,000 tonnes available to us. Thus, we are second only to the United States in the world, in terms of natural uranium resources. Of course, we do not know the extent of the resources of the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. Admittedly, the demand for uranium has declined rapidly. In 1975 it was estimated that by 1985 the demand from Western world buyers would amount to 108,000 tonnes per annum. A revised estimate now puts the figure at a mere 39,000 tonnes by 1985. Simply because world demand has become slack is no reason why the Government should become slack and embark upon a desperate effort to maintain a high selling rate for our natural uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I make the point that at present uranium is making a contribution to the production of the world's energy. Unfortunately, it is also making a contribution to the production of weapons. The issue is one of getting the two uses separated, with an understanding that there must be proper peaceful use of the fuel rather than its being used for weapons. At present there are in operation in the world 243 nuclear power stations of more than 30 megawatt capacity. An additional 229 are under construction and another 55 are on order. There is no doubt that within a very short time at least 500 nuclear power stations will be operating throughout the world. Japan has 23 in operation and a further 10 under construction. Indeed, it is one of the world's top five users of uranium. Because it has no natural fuels of its own but obviously must sustain its capacity for electricity generation, it must employ uranium for that purpose. Again, because Japan is in that bind, and has to enter into negotiations with us concerning safeguards anyway, it is important to guarantee that there shall be no diversification or misuse of the resultant waste. It is not just a question of being anti-Japanese; we are not that. But the Japanese have no alternative, and surely it is possible to reach a proper agreement. The same can be said of the other nine agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister states that there has been no watering down of the Agreement but I ask honourable members to examine it. Certainly, the Agreement is expressed in very fine words. Article V provides that there shall be no processing without our prior consent, but if one turns to the annexure one finds a letter written on 5 March by the Minister to His Excellency the Ambassador of Japan which states:</PARA>
<PARA> I have the honour to refer to the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I have further the honour to propose, on behalf of the Government of Australia, the following arrangements:</PARA>
<PARA>As regards the question of giving prior consent, the statement is made that consent is hereby given. Therefore, it is not of much use Article V providing that Australia must give prior consent when a letter such as that of 5 March is attached saying that consent has been given. </PARA>

<PARA> 3. (a) As regards the transfer of nuclear material directly from Australia to Japan, the Government of Australia shall approve such transfer in accordance with the relevant laws . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Minister writes that he wishes to ensure that the letter shall be deemed to be an agreement between the two Governments. I am not making a personal attack on the Minister-the same may be said of all of the other agreements-but this seems to be a desperate attempt to sell uranium fuel even though we do not have the necessary technology to guarantee safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA> Article VIII speaks of arbitration. If there is any dispute between the parties again we will lose control of the fuel because it will fall within an arbitral process. Certainly, Australia has one arbiter, the Japanese have another, and the two countries select a third, but naturally the point is made that 'the decisions of the tribunal shall be binding on the Contracting Parties'. Therefore, even if an arbiter disagreed with what was being done he could be outvoted two to one and Australia's ownership control of the fuel would again have disappeared, as a result of this arbitral clause. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I have made whenever I have spoken on the issue is that Australia's only guarantee is to own and control the fuel throughout the cycle. I acknowledge that Australia does not possess all of the processes necessary to enable this to be done but we certainly should be endeavouring to develop the technology. We should not be allowing our fuel to fall into private hands. That is far too dangerous a course to follow. Throughout the world reprocessing plants are government owned. One cannot afford to place the re-processing of fuel in the hands of the private sector. That is where the great difficulty lies . The United States has adopted the stupid approach that it should be left in the hands of the private sector. Look at the disasters that Westinghouse has perpetrated in regard to uranium fuel as a result of its poor technology or inability to understand the problems involved. I invite honourable members to consider that there are in existence 40,000 nuclear weapons, the possession of which is not limited in all cases to the super-powers. A number of diversions have occurred into countries that should not have such technology. That is the difficulty that confronts the world. The question as to what is happening to Australia's uranium is a cause for concern. I repeat, the only way to provide an adequate safeguard is to own the fuel throughout the cycle or, if the technology is not safe, to refuse to sell it. There will always be a market for it later on ; there is no need to sell it now. It is the wrong way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Atomic Energy Agency has not yet arrived at a proper safeguard policy in respect to the use of plutonium, which is being produced in large quantities as a result of re-processing. If the world has not been able to work out a satisfactory safeguard procedure for plutonium, why does the Minister believe that the fuel which we sell will be treated differently from any other fuel? Our fuel goes into the fuel rod with fuel from other countries. We cannot trace the progress of every unit of our fuel. When it goes through the fuel rod in the first cycle and is re-processed knowledge concerning it is lost to us. We cannot identify Australian fuel as distinct from other fuels. One may well ask: What has happened to the plutonium and what is to be done about it. At the moment Japan sends our uranium elsewhere for reprocessing. Japan has a limited capacity in that regard. But Japan is adopting fast breeder technology, which involves the re-use of plutonium. </PARA>
<PARA> Also great pressure is being exerted on Japan by the United States to upgrade its defence commitments. Does this mean that Japan might at some stage feel that the best way for it to go, in order to achieve parity with the Soviet Union or China, is to manufacture nuclear weapons? It will have the technology and the fuel and could well be pressured into doing that on the ground that it had better do something about achieving such a capacity. Again I make the point that , although that surely is not the intention of this Government, the Japanese might say: 'We have to do something like this; we have this concept of defence for the area.' It could well say to Australia: 'We will give you an umbrella of protection'. How laughable that would be. But it might happen because President Reagan of the United States is saying to Japan: 'I want to withdraw our umbrella of nuclear protection; you had better think about providing one yourself'. In the light of this, one becomes very sceptical about the making of arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> France engages in the reprocessing of fuel. As everyone knows, it provides a dreadful example of what can be done in the name of providing nuclear energy. France has set itself out to be the leading exponent of the use of such fuel in the production of nuclear energy, but its technology is not right. Its vitrification processes can easily be shown to be wrong. France is also, though, persisting with nuclear testing at Mururoa and irrespective of the change of government in France, unfortunately, that testing will continue. Why is the testing carried out at Mururoa, in the Pacific? If it is so safe, why not do it at Marseilles in France? When we ask the French about that they say they do not have the basalt rock structures that Mururoa has. That is nonsense. They would not be prepared to do it, nor would the people of France allow them to do it. France insists on having a first strike capability for nuclear weapons. It sold enriched uranium to Iraq-enriched to 30 per cent, well over the average-which in effect led to the pre-emptive strike by the Begin Government to destroy the reactor. We know that Finland and Sweden reprocess and enrich their uranium in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we have any idea what happens to the uranium? We do not. There are no adequate safeguards. We cannot control the fuel unless we prevent all diversion and can ensure satisfactory disposal of the wastes. The only way to do that is to own and control the fuel through the whole cycle. This applies to all our agreements, not just this one. Australia has this dangerous fuel but obviously it is a fuel that the world will use more of. It is ridiculous to think that we can run the world without energy but if there are alternatives we should try to find them quickly. If there are no alternatives and governments have to use this fuel for peaceful purposes, of course there will be demand for our uranium. There is no danger about the market; there is no danger about the capacity of Australians to fulfil their role. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is important with agreements like this to analyse what is wrong. The technology of waste disposal does not exist. The French technology is basically wrong. This can be shown clearly in regard to the vitrification process. The waste, because of the heat in it, has to be stored for 40 years and if it is stored it is likely to break down because of the conditions. It is important that we do something about these matters. The Labor Party policy has always said we want more technology and more guarantees that this fuel, if used for peaceful purposes, will not be of any danger to the world. What will happen in regard to the Japanese disposing of our waste in the Pacific? Will anybody in the Pacific agree to that? What will the Japanese do about waste disposal? Where is there in this agreement any arrangement as to the disposal of the high level waste? We cannot find such an arrangement because the Japanese do not yet have the technology. They should not be using French technology. I can guarantee that the French will not be prepared to store the Japanese high level waste in France , so what will happen to it? The United States will not store any of its high level waste because it has not developed the technology. </PARA>
<PARA> It is about time we had a pause in uranium development, not to prevent people from maintaining their standards of living but certainly to prevent any misuse of safeguards which are as weak as those contained in this statement. It guarantees nothing unless we own and control the fuel through the whole cycle. That means it all has to be done on a government to government basis. The private sector has no chance to participate in uranium development because it cannot give guarantees on the issues that worry the world. It is for that reason I repeat what I have said in my previous addresses to the House on uranium. It is about time we put more money into technology. That is the way we ought to go. Until such time as we help Ringwood and others develop that technology we should not do anything about selling our uranium. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Interest rates on housing finance will rise by at least one per cent in April after the Lowe by-election and the Victorian State election are out of the way. This will mean a further increase in repayments of $22 a month on a $30,000 loan repaid over 25 years. It will be a further burden placed on people now paying off their homes and it will drive home ownership out of the reach of 9,000 prospective home buyers. This will mean an accumulated increase of $88 a month on an average loan since September 1980. Things could be even worse because if the Howard-Lynch group in Cabinet gets its way the Government will implement the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System recommendation to deregulate interest rates. This would mean that savings bank loans would rise at least to 15.5 per cent, which would mean an increase in repayments on existing average housing loans of $132 a month since September 1980. It would disqualify nine out of 10 prospective home buyers . Of course building society loan repayments would be even higher than those of the savings banks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Next to unemployment, housing is the most serious social problem in this country. Over the past six years housing problems have grown more serious because of this Government's neglect. We have not seen any attempt by this Government to address the growing problems of housing. Instead we have seen the Government withdraw further from its responsibility to ensure the adequate provision of shelter for Australian people. We have seen it withdraw from its responsibility to ensure a stable flow of funds for housing at a price ordinary people can afford. We have seen this Government deliberately withdraw support for State public housing. We have seen it withdraw from its responsibility to promote stability in the housing industry. Just as this Government has been prepared to trade off unemployment against inflation, so it has deliberately sacrificed the housing sector in order to make room for expanded foreign investment in resource development projects in this country. Through its rigid monetary policy this Government has stifled those domestic economic activities which provide a secure social and industrial structure in our nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The housing sector is a major victim of this Government's economic policy. Several areas of the housing sector have suffered badly. The Government's housing policy requires urgent comprehensive attention, and it needs to be attention on a broad base. Its policy cannot really be saved by any band-aid approval or narrow concepts. Home ownership has to be looked at, particularly in regard to first home buyers. As a result of rising interest rates more people are being excluded from access to affordable housing finance. They are faced with a widening deposit gap which years of savings cannot overcome. For example, the median house price in Melbourne in December 1981 was $49,000. At the current interest rate in Victoria of 15.5 per cent a family with a single breadwinner's income equivalent to average weekly earnings of $301 can obtain a maximum loan of only $25,000 from a building society over a 30-year term. The family then has to find a further $24,000. If it had saved, say, $10,000 over six years it could approach a finance company for a second mortgage of $10,000 but it would have to pay an interest rate of between 18.5 per cent and 22 per cent. To do that the family would have to commit around 35 per cent of its household income to mortgage repayments. It would then leave itself highly vulnerable in the event of further interest rate increases. As I have stressed, interest rates will be increased in April after the Victorian State election. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality of the situation is that single income families on incomes of up to 135 per cent of average weekly earnings are effectively excluded from access to home ownership at present house prices and interest rates. To put it another way , three out of four salary earners can no longer afford to buy their first home. The Government has done nothing about this problem. It is prepared to stand by while the level of home ownership in Australia continues to decline. The only scheme that the Government has put forward in the past six years has been the Homes Savings Grants Scheme which last year helped fewer than two out of five first home buyers. It provides too little too late to be useful to most people. It is known in the industry as the home decorators' account. It is a scandal that this discredited scheme absorbed over $70m out of a housing budget of some $400m. </PARA>
<PARA> At the last election Labor put forward a more effective home ownership assistance scheme which provided for a $3,000 grant over the first four years of a mortgage so as to increase average borrowings by around $10,000 at no extra cost to the first home buyer. We will be putting forward such a scheme again at a revised level to take account of house price increases and interest rate rises . </PARA>
<PARA> The second area of concern to the Labor Party is the failure of the Government to protect those families that bought their first home over the last five years and are now having trouble holding onto it because of rising home loan repayments and, particularly rising interest rates. We estimate that there are at least 250,000 households in such difficulty. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the net effect on household incomes of interest rate rises on average loans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The table shows, for example, that a single income family with a dependent spouse and two children, where the breadwinner's income was the equivalent of average weekly earnings, obtained an average loan in 1977- 78 of $26,000 from a building society at an interest rate of 11 per cent. At the time of purchase the family paid $249.20 in monthly loan instalments. Because the interest rate has risen to 14.5 per cent, repayments on that loan are $319. 70, an increase of $70.50 per month. However, the family's post-tax monthly income has risen from 1977-78 to September 1981 by only $16. As a result of the increased repayment burden, in the context of other Government policies which reduce family living standards, the family's real disposable income has been reduced by $54.50 a month. In September 1981 the problem was less severe than it was in September 1980 for those families whose income has grown. Again I stress that interest rates will again rise in April and that pressure will be increased on those people. But what of those who have not been able to increase their incomes during that period?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me turn to another matter that really needs consideration. Other housing programs are necessary to ensure that no householders who brought their first home over the last five years pay any more of their income in mortgage repayments than the proportion they committed at the time of purchase. The Government needs to implement such a scheme; otherwise it will have the real problems of at least a quarter of a million families on its hands. In addition, there should be provision for household budgeting advice to families in difficulty and to renegotiate the mortgage debt structure of first home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of concern is the need to stabilise the availability and price of housing finance. The number of loan approvals for the purchase or construction of dwellings fell by 17.3 per cent from November 1980 to November 1981. In the case of savings banks the fall was 7.2 per cent and in the case of permanent building societies the fall was 35.4 per cent. These declines reflect the increased value of loan advances, the falling demand for loans as a consequence of high lending rates and the declining availability of loanable funds, especially for savings banks. Funds are being attracted away from housing in a number of ways as a result of this Government's policy. In the first place, foreign corporations are raising a large proportion of their borrowings on the Australian capital market. Last year $1 out of every $5 saved by Australians was being used by foreign owned corporations. At the same time, some government authorities are offering an interest rate of 15.6 per cent on four to nine year bonds while the market rate for bonds over eight years is 16.25 per cent to 17.6 per cent. Merchant banks are offering 18 per cent on secured at call notes. Solicitors' funds are offering 17 per cent on 12-monthly investments. Over the year to November 1981 savings banks deposits grew by only 7 per cent, which is less than the rate of inflation and lower than the rate over the last few years of 9 per cent to 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look more closely we find, however, that deregulation of bank deposit rates has allowed the banks to increase deposits in investment accounts by 17 per cent while deposits in ordinary accounts grew by only 0.5 per cent. Savings banks currently offer interest rates of 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent on investment accounts as distinct from 3.75 per cent on ordinary accounts. This rate has levelled out at 7 per cent. Under this Government the banks are finding that they are being squeezed by competition from the resource development area. If the deposit structure of the banks continues to shift towards higher interest rates the banks will be unwilling and possibly unable to provide housing funds at affordable interest rates. Action needs to be taken to stabilise the flow of funds to housing lenders. This should be done in a way that keeps the price of housing loans within the means of average households. This Government has no policies in this area. It is prepared to sit back while the market, which is distorted by the power of the large financial corporations, sets for itself new structures to determine the availability and price of housing finance. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor is prepared to assert the social importance of housing. I want to stress that for Labor housing is a major priority. We will intervene in the financial system to ensure that there is a stable flow of funds for housing at an affordable price. We will proclaim Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 which gives the Government power over assets, lending and interest rates and financial corporations at present outside the arm of regulation. We will use the Act in accordance with one of its objectives which is: 'The ensuring of an adequate level of finance for housing'. If, for example, we required that 2 per cent of the assets of financial corporations under the schedule of the Act be earmarked for housing, we would provide an additional $600m for housing. The finance companies could continue to offer housing loans at their usurious interest rates but we would have captured a large part of their lending, together with funds from other sources, to ensure a pool of lower cost housing funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area at which we could look where funds for housing are available is life insurance funds. I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the assets and types of lending by life insurance funds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) was a cynical exercise. Its timing was not dictated by any real attempt to improve the situation of Australian home buyers. It was purely and simply an attempt to get round the electronic media blackout in the hope of picking up a vote or two in a certain by-election that is coming up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has nothing whatsoever to be ashamed of in the way in which it is handling the complexities of providing solutions to the housing problem. It has been difficult to pick up a newspaper, switch on the radio or television or indeed, appear in this House, without being bombarded by suggestions of all sorts from the Opposition about how the Government should solve the housing problem. </PARA>
<PARA> As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, we on this side of the House are rather humble people. We have never claimed to be the only people with all the answers and all the wisdom. We have actively sought the views of State governments, housing and industry groups and, of course, many individuals. We have also analysed the Opposition's high-cost panaceas. Let me say that we appreciate the advice that is being offered to us from everyone. But the advice and the suggestions we have heard from the honourable member for Reid would ring truer if they came from someone who had a better track record in relation to housing and home ownership. It would ring truer if it came from someone from a party which had shown itself capable of understanding the interrelationships between housing finance and the economy as a whole. It would ring truer if it had come from an Opposition which had shown itself capable of taking the time and applying the intelligence to track through the complexities and come up with a sensible solution-not one dictated to by political expedience in an attempt to influence each and every election. </PARA>
<PARA> I am amongst the first to admit that housing has become an urgent problem for some people, but this is not the case for the vast majority of Australian householders. At the present time, more than 38 per cent of Australians own their homes outright. That compares very favourably with the miserable 28 per cent which Labor managed to achieve in its big spending term of government. The honourable member for Reid has no right whatsoever to be critical. Of those who direct criticism against current policies it is he who should be the least vocal . Despite his cries of doom, Australia still has one of the highest rates of home ownership in the developed world and that has been achieved through a succession of Liberal-National Country Party coalition governments. This Government has carried on that commitment to home ownership and can be expected to do so in the future. At almost 72 per cent, our level of home ownership compares favourably with other countries. It compares with 50 per cent in England; 62 per cent in Canada; 47 per cent in France; 65 per cent in the United States of America and 33 per cent in West Germany. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ML7">Mr McVEIGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thirty-three per cent in West Germany. Victoria's home ownership rate of 75 per cent is the highest of all Australian States and outshines the New South Wales rate of 71 per cent which is below the national average and indicates the Wran Government's demonstrable lack of concern for home buyers and home owners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has been accused by the Opposition and by some sections of the media of being unaware of, and uninterested in, the plight of home owners and intending buyers. Such claims are hysterical nonsense. As I have said on many occasions, the Government has conducted a review of its housing policies and a review of those housing problems and difficulties facing specific groups in the community. We have identified and costed the various ways of assisting both existing and aspiring home owners and are looking at these options in association with measures to increase the availability of housing finance. As we see it, the main groups facing difficulties at the moment are: People who have borrowed in the last couple of years, particularly those who have since become one income families; aspiring first home buyers who are finding it hard to bridge the deposit gap, and some families renting in the private market. </PARA>
<PARA> In the face of mounting and emotional criticism I believe it is to the Government's credit that we have not been stampeded into announcing schemes and policies merely to satisfy the likes of the honourable member for Reid and those media commentators who are more interested in headlines than in facts. When we move it will be the right move. It will be the right decision and it will be a decision which fits comfortably into our overall budgetary and economic strategies. There will be no band-aid treatments. There will not be any patch-up jobs. The people of Australia deserve responsible and steady government. That is why they voted for us in 1975, again in 1977 and again in 1980. There will be no ad hoc or erratic decisions on housing or any other matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking broadly, the Government's assistance in the field of housing can be broken down into two groups-assistance to first home buyers through the Homes Savings Grant Scheme and assistance to the needy and those in special circumstances. The Government is often subjected to unreasonable criticism by an Opposition which chooses to ignore the facts and the realities of housing and which fights its crusade purely on shallow and emotional grounds. In addition to expanding the flexibility with which the States can manage and direct the welfare housing contributions made by the Commonwealth, this Government, in the August Budget, lifted very substantially indeed its overall spending on housing and accommodation. Appropriation in these areas rose from $555m to $660m, an increase of 18.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that lifting of expenditure we have also announced a contribution of $2m to the States to provide crisis accommodation for families in distress. This honoured an election commitment we made in late 1980. Significantly, there was not a murmur from the Opposition benches. The media, with few exceptions, ignored the announcement. If this overall increase is an indication that the Government is unaware of and disinterested in housing and accommodating Australians, then I suggest the only alternative the Opposition can offer is a return to the irrational and irresponsible big-spending programs which it introduced in 1972. The economy of this country and the people of this country are still paying the bill for that senseless period of government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is aware of the problems facing home owners, intending home buyers and the poor in our society and is taking positive steps, and spending substantial amounts of money, to solve these problems and lessen the burdens. It is about time then that credit was given where it is due and that housing stopped being a political issue and started becoming a human issue. It is often forgotten in the so-called housing debate that housing is an area in which State governments also have a responsibility. State and local governments also bear a heavy responsibility for housing costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the people who build houses. The building trades award of 27 January this year has given tradesmen an average pay rise of almost $30 a week. The reduction of the building industry's working week to 38 hours-from 24 May this year-will increase wage costs by a further 5 per cent. We can expect the new building trades award to increase wages by a further $14 a week from July. The total wage-hours package will add around 21 per cent to the on-site labour costs of building a house. By the time these costs flow on an average $50,000 new house in Sydney will suffer a cost increase of $3,000. An average new house in Melbourne, costing $36,000, will suffer an impost of about $2,200. Statistics of the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that because of differing building regulations and other factors influenced by State and local governments, the cost of building an average 150 square metre house in Sydney, at around $44,000, compares with $36,000 in Melbourne. A more modest 120 square metre home will cost about $35,000 to build in Sydney and less than $30,000 in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> Conveyancing and stamp duty imposed by, or under the control of, State governments also pose a burden to home buyers. In Sydney, a house and land package costing $65,000 confronts a first home buyer with a stamp duty bill of $ 1,300, the only concession being that this can be paid in five interest free instalments. In Melbourne the same house and land package would cost about $40, 000 and would attract stamp duty of $800. By comparison with the mean, miserable New South Wales Government the Victorian Government offers first home buyers a concession which reduces this bill to $400. So there are States which are more willing than others to reduce the cost burdens and cost pressures facing first home buyers. As I have noted in the Press recently that the States are never afraid to offer advice to the Commonwealth Government as to how it should spend money which it has the responsibility of raising, I will now offer the States a little advice. I appeal to all the States of the Commonwealth to abolish stamp duty for first home buyers. I suggest that they stop prancing and parading about and uttering platitudes. They should put their cheque books where their mouths have been and abolish stamp duty for all first home buyers. </PARA>
<PARA> It was reported recently that the New South Wales Government, for example-I am not picking out the New South Wales Government for any particular reason- collected $243m from stamp duty in 1980-81. This amount was a staggering 100 per cent increase on the collections made in the previous year and yet the Government is charging first home buyers $1,300 each for stamp duty. The receipts levied from home buyers were more than three times the amount which the Wran Government spent on welfare housing in that year. It raised three times more money in stamp duty from home buyers than it spent on welfare housing. As far as first home buyers are concerned quite obviously there are blood stains on the New South Wales balance sheet on account of this. Last night the Victorian Premier placed himself among the few State leaders who are beginning to take their housing responsibilities seriously. His announcement of two new schemes- both containing an interest subsidy element-indicates Victoria's realisation that housing is a joint and a shared responsibility. Mr Thompson's announcement that more than $60m worth of State funds will be injected into the housing area is welcome news not only for those people who are intending to buy their first homes but also for those who have bought recently and are facing difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already established that the Federal Government shares with State and local governments a responsibility in the housing field. But let us not forget that people too need to act responsibly rather than make decisions in the hope that, if they are the wrong ones, the Commonwealth will mount a rescue operation . Not very often in this House do I quote a member of the Opposition but I believe it is appropriate to quote the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), a former Minister for Housing. He said recently-it was reported in the Press-that many home buyers are not leaving themselves a reasonable margin. I would like recorded in Hansard what the honourable member for Hughes, a former Minister for Housing, said. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> People are maximising their loans and incurring trouble with the various building societies. They don't take into regard things such as pregnancy. Some of them are getting into trouble. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole question of housing assistance is one which must be considered in a responsible light. The Commonwealth cannot afford to provide assistance across the board, nor can the States. Financial assistance must be well directed to people in need and it must be directed for the period of the need. I would like to look at some overlooked facts on housing finance and the building industry. The situation is not as bad as honourable members opposite would have us believe . In fact, lending by permanent building societies has increased in each of the last three months on a seasonally adjusted basis. It is up by nearly 8 per cent in the three months to January on the previous three months. Forecasts by the Indicative Planning Council of the housing industry suggest an even higher rate of lending over the remainder of the financial year. The latest figures for banks for the month of December also showed a seasonally adjusted increase of about 6.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has continuously claimed that the housing industry is on the edge of collapse. The industry keeps disappointing the ALP. In fact the number of approvals for dwellings in 1981-these are the latest figures available-was up 1.2 per cent on those for 1980. Of course, I will not claim that the industry is likely to repeat its near record 1980-81 performance of about 150,000 commencements, but it should commence around 138,000 dwellings. That is not a figure that can be portrayed as a total collapse as the Opposition tries to do. In fact it would be higher than any year since 1976-77 apart from last year's near record level. The contribution by the honourable member for Reid, who tried to stir up the worries of people by indicating that interest rates would increase, reminds me of a funeral director preparing the obituaries of initiative, determination and reliance on one's own efforts. He has seen fit to criticise the performance of this Government, a government which, through its sensible financial control, has been able to stabilise costs to the industry and keep the Australian home ownership rates amongst the highest in the world. </PARA>

This discrimination results in greater hardship and distress to the unemployed and their dependants, and reduces their access to essential health facilities by increasing the onerous burden of health charges on this group which can least afford it.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for amendment of the Repatriation Act in four respects. The first is in relation to the control of the disability pensions for veterans suffering serious service related mental illness. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced last year, following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, that deductions for maintenance from the pensions of a small number of mentally ill veterans to whom section 49 of the Repatriation Act applies, were to be discontinued and that the disability pensions of certain veterans should be handled in the same manner as all other disability pensions. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 49 of the Repatriation Act is a special provision that can be applied by the Repatriation Commission to withhold the pension of an unmarried veteran suffering severe mental illness. The severity of the mental illness must usually be such as to warrant long term hospitalisation in a mental institution. If a veteran recovers to the extent that he is able to control his own affairs, all retained money is paid to him. If he dies without recovering, the accumulated funds do not form part of his estate but are disposed of at the Commission's discretion to members of his family or to persons dependent on him, with any remaining funds being paid to Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of section 49, which had their origins in legislation enacted in 1920, are out-dated and create some significant differences between the way these mentally disabled veterans are treated and the way other disabled veterans are treated. For example, it has been the practice under section 49 for half the disability pension to be deducted as a contribution to the cost of their maintenance while in a mental institution, and to pay this deduction to Consolidated Revenue. It is the Government's view that, since no other veteran is required to make such a contribution when receiving treatment for a service related disability, the practice is discriminatory and should cease. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, in repealing section 49, will provide for a veteran's pension and any accumulated money to become his property, in the same way that it is for every other veteran. As a result, if a veteran dies while still suffering from his disability, all of his accumulated pension will form part of his estate and be distributed in accordance with his wishes if a valid will has been made, or otherwise, in accordance with the laws of intestacy. If a veteran is in a mental institution his affairs are normally controlled by the State Public Trustee. Some of the veterans to whom section 49 applies are not the responsibility of State governments, and these are generally those veterans who are no longer in mental institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that upon the repeal of section 49, the accumulated moneys of these veterans will be transferred to the trusteeship of the Repatriation Commission under regulation 9 of the repatriation regulations or, if it is thought that the veteran is able to manage for himself, his pension will be returned to him with the interest earned. The Bill provides for these arrangements to come into effect on the date of the royal assent. Discussions have been held with the various State governments with a view to transferring the appropriate funds to the respective State public trustee who would be responsible for the veterans' welfare. Agreement has been reached with five States on the proposed arrangements, and a reply is awaited from the other State . These arrangements will mean that a Public Trustee would assume the responsibility which he would normally have in respect of these veterans but for the existence of section 49. In many cases the Public Trustee already has responsibility for the other assets or income of the veteran and therefore the current dual trustee arrangement would be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for transitional provisions to finalise the accounts of veterans who have died, or who die before royal assent. These provisions extend the benefits of the new proposals to those veterans. The Bill also provides for the extension of repatriation benefits to Australian members of the Multinational Force and Observers committed to the Sinai region. This is in accordance with the undertaking the Government gave last year when repatriation benefits were extended to Australian representatives of peace- keeping, observation or monitoring forces. Repatriation benefits are to be extended on the same basis as applies to Australian members of other peacekeeping forces under Division 10 of the Repatriation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for two other matters. The first is to facilitate the recovery of Commonwealth expenditure for medical treatment provided to patients eligible to receive either workers' compensation benefits or third party damages and to align such provisions with those in other Commonwealth Acts. The present provisions of the repatriation legislation are restrictive in that they allow the recovery of the medical treatment costs from the injured party only and not from a third party, such as an insurer. The cost recovery process would be far more efficient and less demanding on patients if the Repatriation Commission could act directly with third parties as is the case under the Social Services Act and the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act. The Bill will achieve this . </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter enables regulations to be prepared which will protect from legal actions those employees in repatriation hospitals who may be required to carry out duties arising from State legislation. These employees, in order to comply with State law as part of their community service, require the full cover of the law in order to be properly protected in the execution of their duties. However, because of their status as Commonwealth employees and the separation of Commonwealth and State jurisdictions they do not have that protection in some instances. At this stage, the main concern is the taking of blood samples in accident cases for the purpose of blood-alcohol testing. As the protection of medical and ancillary staff is not extended by State legislation, repatriation hospital staff have not been permitted to undertake these procedures. These amendments are to come into operation from the date of royal assent. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1982 now before the House proposes amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The Bill, which contains 13 Schedules, is necessary to enact tariff changes which have been introduced into the Parliament at various times since 14 May 1981 by customs tariff proposals Nos. 6-15 (1981) and proposals Nos. 1-5 (1982). In the main, the amendments give effect to decisions by the Government in respect of the following reports by the Industries Assistance Commission:</PARA>
<PARA> Certain bags, cases and similar containers; certain monomers, prepolymers and goods of the silicone type; chain of precious metal; cutlery, industrial knives and hand tools (in respect of razor blades only); fabricated steel structures; lamps and lighting fittings (developing countries preference); loudspeakers; miscellaneous manufacturing-certain refractory products; miscellaneous transport equipment; polyunsaturated margarine; primary batteries; railway and tramway locomotives, rolling stock, etc.; surge diverters; textiles, clothing and footwear; vibratory road rollers (developing countries preference); and wheelchairs</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will recall that on each occasion when tariffs were introduced into the House, a comprehensive account of the IAC's recommendations and Government decisions was outlined and the IAC reports were tabled. Other amendments contained in the Bill provide for:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI7">Mr LUSHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The report on the Australian National Railways Commission marks the completion of the last of the inquiries of the Expenditure Committee which were initiated in the previous Parliament. The carry-over of inquiries always involves difficulties for a new committee and, in this case, the Committee's problems were compounded by some very complex issues which inevitably involved assessments as to how a commercial public authority such as Australian National ought to operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to thank the members of the Committee, whose task it was to grapple with these problems and to resolve them. I am particularly grateful to the contributions made by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) in this regard. The Expenditure Committee's inquiry into the Australian National Railways Commission was initiated because of concern at the large appropriations made by Parliament to offset the Commission's annual losses. The Commission has been directed by Government to eliminate those losses by 1987-88 but, even if this goal is achieved, it will have accumulated losses of over $500m by that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian National is a wholly owned public undertaking which is subject to pressures and directives from both the market and the Government. It must also operate in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreements associated with the Commonwealth takeover of the South Australian and Tasmanian railways. The result is a complex web of interactions which give rise to conflicting objectives for Australian National's management. As the inquiry progressed, the Committee developed the following theme which it believes unlocks this interrelationship. Australian National's commercial objective must predominate and therefore the scale and range of operations of Australian National should be determined by customer preferences for its services, subject only to explicit Government directives in the form of Public Service obligations, including the obligations embodied in the transfer agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations of our report are designed to overcome constraints which inhibit the decision-making ability of Australian National's management. Some of these constraints, such as the corporate planning deficiencies identified in our report, are internal to Australian National and should be remedied by its management. Others, such as operational, legislative and financial constraints require changes which Australian National alone cannot induce. These include difficulties with inter-system arrangements and numerous legislative restraints which inhibit Australian National's performance. The Committee believes it should be the catalyst in overcoming these restraints and has recommended appropriate changes to the Act. The Committee has cautioned against an assessment of management performance on the basis of existing operating losses as presently defined in Australian National's accounts. We have recommended a number of changes to Australian National's reporting processes which will improve both the usefulness of the financial accounts as a measure of management 's performance and the organisation's accountability to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately Government must make decisions about public business undertakings such as Australian National. One particular view is that they can be direct and closely supervised instruments of government which provide in many cases uneconomic services which are financed by cross-subsidisation and/or claims on the Budget. Alternatively, they can operate at arm's length in the market-place and be reimbursed by Government for those uneconomic services which the Government specifically requires. Having fully examined the issue, the Committee is of the view that the latter option represents the better course. I wish to thank our specialist adviser, Professor H. M. Kolsen, or Ted Kolsen as he is better known, for the contribution that he made both in the inquiry and in the report stage. Special appreciation is extended to Malcolm Aldons, the secretary of the Expenditure Committee and also to Adrian Scott, our assistant secretary, who had to pick up the inquiry at a late stage and see it through to the end. This he did admirably. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Australian National Railways Commission has the major part of its operations in South Australia. This report, which aims to assist in improving the performance and accountability of Australian National, is therefore, of enormous importance to South Australia. As the only member from that State on the Standing Committee on Expenditure, I have had to ensure that South Australia's views were taken into account. I thank the Committee members and the secretariat for their forbearance and their final acceptance of those interests. Australian National operates the South Australian non-metropolitan rail service. It therefore operates the State's major rail links to Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Alice Springs. It also services country areas and the provision of those services is a significant and continuing concern of mine and, indeed, of the other South Australian Liberal member who represents a country electorate, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Giles).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ever since the South Australian country railway was sold by the previous State Labor Government during the time of the previous Federal Labor Government, Australian National Railways has endeavoured to reduce its deficit by a more efficient use of its resources. The report of the Expenditure Committee reviews the progress made by AN towards this end and, more importantly, this report looks at how AN can better meet its major objective of efficiency and profitability whilst also meeting some clear obligations to the public. The Committee believes, and I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA> AN's commercial objective must predominate and therefore the scale and range of operations of AN should be determined by customer preferences for its services subject only to explicit government directives in the form of public service obligations (PSOs), including the obligations embodied in the Transfer Agreements. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to deal with those two restrictions on the pursuit of AN's commercial objectives because they are extremely important to South Australia and indeed to my electorate. A Public Service obligation as defined by the report is an obligation:</PARA>
<PARA> Which AN, if considering its own commercial interests, would not assume either at all or to the same extent or under the same conditions. Two necessary conditions must both be met, before any obligation can be treated as a PSO. The obligation must be accepted by government as fulfilling an undertaking incurred by government either:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) because, in the current government's opinion, it is in the public interest to do so; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) because it is a consequence of previous government obligations (eg. the Transfer Agreements) and the costs of its provision will exceed its revenues when the service is provided as efficiently as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me explain a Public Service obligation in practical terms. Australian National, in an effort to reduce its deficit, has curtailed or closed many unprofitable lines, services and sidings, whilst increasing the services, et cetera, on the more profitable lines. This course of action has led to a number of problems. A major problem arises where there is a conflict between efficiency and profitability on the one hand and the need for some form of transport to service country areas on the other hand. Where curtailment of services has been threatened, my role has been to protect the interests of my constituents and to ensure that adequate transport services continue to be provided, especially to remote country centres. In my view it is not responsible of the Government to cease the operation of a service in country areas without satisfying itself that some suitable alternative is available. To date the railways have been meeting an obligation in the provision of passenger and/or freight transport services. Therefore, if those services are to be withdrawn I believe we have a duty to ensure that alternative arrangements are made, and those alternative services do not necessarily have to be provided by public transport. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me emphasise the point: In the last financial year 34 sidings were completely closed because the volume of traffic did not, in AN's view, warrant their retention. In these cases we either have been able to ensure that reasonable and suitable alternatives were available, or have been satisfied that there has been no demand for the service. However, the Expenditure Committee was of the view that there may be occasions when, for one reason or another, the Government may wish Australian National to operate a service which it would otherwise discontinue. In these circumstances, such a service would be a public service obligation and separately funded. </PARA>
<PARA> The other restriction on AN's pursuit of its commercial objective are the Transfer Agreements. Again as I shall explain, this is enormously important to South Australia. South Australia's ability to attract industry to the State relies on a number of factors. Among these are our geographic position and the availability and lower comparative cost of many basic inputs such as land, power and labour. However, we are also reliant on transport to our markets, both in the eastern States and to our north and west. Given that Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia have their own railway systems, if Australian National, under Commonwealth control, were the only railway to follow a purely commercial objective while the other State government railways did not do so, South Australia could be seriously disadvantaged, particularly in relation to its manufacturing industry, compared with the eastern States. Therefore, it is of particular significance that the Expenditure Committee has recognised the obligations embodied in the Railways Transfer Agreement with South Australia. I want to refer to just one part of that agreement. Clause 8 of the Schedule to the Railways Agreement Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission will ensure that, in general, fares, freight rates and other charges in respect of the non-metropolitan railways and services shall be maintained, on and after the commencement date, at levels not less favourable to users than those levels generally applying on the railways of States other than South Australia and where, in general, fares, freight rates and other charges at the commencement date have established a relative advantage to the users, that advantage shall not be diminished. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, that clause aims to protect South Australia's relative position in relation to railway rates and charges. It was therefore important, in my view, for the Committee to recognise the agreement, as it ensures that the State of South Australia will not be disadvantaged by this report. In fact the report, subject to those critical provisos, will assist AN to provide a more efficient and effective transport system, one which will be of great benefit to both the users of that system in my State and the whole of Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr MORRIS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Shortland)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I join the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure in expressing the appreciation of Opposition members of the Committee to the Secretary, Mr Malcolm Aldons, the Assistant Secretary, Mr Adrian Scott-he joined us fairly late in the inquiry-and the adviser to the Committee, Professor Kolsen of Queensland University, for the valuable and long service which they provided. The recommendation of the Committee that the Australian National Railways Commission-or Australian National, as it prefers to be known-should be more commercially oriented and that public service or community service obligations should be identified and kept separate from commercial goals is in our view a wise one. The public service or community service obligations should be quickly identified by AN management and separately funded by government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another recommendation is that Australian National should seek to recover the total resource costs of providing its commercial services over a reasonable period in which planned approaches can be implemented without dislocation of services or hardship to communities or employees. </PARA>
<PARA> I expressed to the Committee the personal view that I did not accept that deficit elimination could be achieved by 1987-88. I do not believe that that target, or deadline, is based upon evidence; in fact, the deadline was selected prior to the 1977 election, on grounds of political expediency rather than on the results of a sound analysis of how and when Australian National could achieve deficit elimination-that is, apart from the provision of public service obligations-without unduly disrupting the transport network, work force and communities. It is interesting that recently the Australian Railway Research and Development Organisation or ARRDO as it is known, in its 1981 report on railways said that in its assessment Australian National would still have a $25m deficit in 1989-90, even assuming significant but attainable rises in real freight rates , passenger fares and labour productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that, in considering total resource costs, environmental and social costs must also be considered. As a corollary of this, when service reductions are planned, total resource, environmental and social benefits forgone should be compared with total costs saved. One cannot consider the commercial aspects of the provision of rail services in isolation. One must take into account the total resource cost, the environmental and social costs and the impact of service reductions. This general or umbrella-type of approach to the impact of changes on transport services is what economists have chosen to call a 'social cost-benefit analysis'. Since most of the environmental and social costs and benefits are outside normal market considerations, public service or community service obligations will need to be used to incorporate those factors. </PARA>
<PARA> Again the ARRDO report states that deficit elimination in Australian National, in isolation from any attempt to implement cost recovery on long distance road transport may, from a resource allocation perspective, result in a worse allocation of resources than presently applies. The reason is that AN's costs, and thus freight and passenger rates, will rise, but long distance road rates will continue to be held artificially low. Thus, ARRDO believes that Australian National should not be considered in isolation from the rest of the transport system but rather as part of a nationally integrated transport network. Only in that manner will we as a nation, be able to achieve maximum efficiency in the use of our national resources. </PARA>
<PARA> The General Manager of the Australian National Railways Commission, Mr Don Williams, in a recent speech summarised the position succinctly when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Economic efficiency is achieved when there is both technical efficiency-each mode performing its task at the lowest cost; and allocative efficiency-each mode performing the right task. </PARA>
<PARA> The achievement of economic efficiency by means of pricing which properly reflects total costs. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>If road-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, road services-</PARA>
<PARA>paid full tote odds for its track-</PARA>
<PARA>In this case, the road-</PARA>
<PARA>the escalation in road prices would force sufficient business onto rail to allow us to contain cost escalations to a very significant degree. </PARA>
<PARA>The point he makes is that if the road industry made the proper contribution to national and State revenues to meet the costs generated by its utilisation of road pavements and services, road prices would have to rise to such an extent that it would be better for many industries to use rail rather than road. Similarly, the Australian Railway Research and Development Organisation argues that cost recovery for long distance heavy road vehicles covers nowhere near its attributable road costs. On its calculations cost recovery on pavement costs would increase road costs by about 15 per cent. In regard to the railways across Australia-not just ANR but because ANR is locked into the Australian system we have to consider what is involved in each of the State systems that are supplemented-ARRDO has found that railways fail to meet the avoidable costs on less than container loads, the broken container lots, where consolidation is necessary, and importantly, on livestock traffics. ARRDO states:</PARA>
<PARA> In competitive markets such as this, it is unreasonable for any mode of transport to take unilateral action to increase prices to improve its cost recovery performance, since if all other factors remain the same then that mode of transport will lose business . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We cannot pluck out one mode of transport, force it to bear full cost recovery or to operate on a commercial basis to the exclusion of what is happening in the other modes of transport without decimating in some cases the mode of transport- in this case, railways-that we are seeking to place on a commercial basis. The ARRDO report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Only a policy which requires or encourages joint action by competing modes will make possible improved cost recovery in transport. This implies a strong commitment by governments to improved cost recovery both as a financial goal and as a means of improving economic resource allocation in transport. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be grossly unfair to Australian National, as well as inappropriate national policy, to focus on Australian National in isolation from equal cost recovery policies on road, and indeed all, transport. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now for a moment to the investment side of Australian National and our railway systems generally. Part of the commercial approach to Australian National's future must be the upgrading and rehabilitation of the rail network. The Government cannot simply give a directive to Australian National to become commercial, or more commercial, without regard for infrastructure endowment compared with road transport. If one compares government or public investment in road construction and maintenance with that for rail, one can see the enormous disparity in favour of road services. So if we require rail to improve its efficiency, it has to have similar investment in infrastructure. Again I refer to the Australian Railway Research Development Organisation, which can supply the best figures on this matter. Its calculations on warranted rail main line investments-similar to the Bureau of Transport Economics' calculations for warranted road investments-show that an additional investment of $43m annually is commercially justified at current real borrowing rates and if future investment levels are not increased by this $43m annually opportunities for a reduction in deficit by Australian National and other State railway systems will be forgone. </PARA>
<PARA> An important repercussion of the situation is that the road network, partially funded by Commonwealth non-repayable grants, far outstrips the rail network. Commonwealth rail main line assistance is repayable with interest. On the one hand road services receive non-repayable grant assistance and on the other hand, in respect of railways, loans are made to the Australian National Railways Commission or to the States on a repayable and interest-bearing basis. One result of such a distortion is that it limits the capacity of rail compared to road to develop infrastructure in the competitive main line freight area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in its report points out that the Australian National management should behave commercially; it should search out new profitable areas of work to raise revenue as a means of increasing profitability. It has been found in other rail systems that cost cutting places severe limitations on the possibility for deficit reduction-this has been the experience over recent years-and that the dislocation it causes and the understandable reaction of work forces in protecting their jobs provide many counteracting forces to the often simplistic and academic notions of service cutbacks; the simplistic notion that if we cut back on rail services we cut back on deficit. The experience has been that these types of cutbacks, which ignore the human element and the inherent inflexibility of railway systems, have not been the success originally anticipated. It has to be accepted that there must be rationalisation but this ought to be done within a planned and participative environment which includes service expansions where appropriate. This entails on the part of the railway management, on the part of Australian National, aggressive marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I made earlier regarding investment is crucial when we require a railway system to be more commercial. A commercial approach requires investment in potential growth areas. I do not assume that passenger tasks are almost totally non-commercial. It is up to rail management to be innovative, to accept risks in passenger and all rail services and to provide modern services that are convenient, reliable and speedy, that will attract passengers and freight back to rail services and that will yield a surplus to the operator. The Commonwealth should do a lot more than set Australian National an arbitrary deadline for deficit elimination and some deregulation. It must aid the rehabilitation of the system by providing capital where it is shown to be needed for profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Government's arbitrary requirement that AN become profitable in 1978-88 may lead to most passenger oriented and small and medium- scale freight services being cut as they cannot be justified on a commercial basis; that is, unless those services are determined by the Government and by the Commission to be public service or community service obligations. If cost recovery mechanisms for the alternative road improvement and road services required to replace rail services are also taken into account, and if the rail services are placed on an equal footing with road services, Government funds currently expended on financing rail deficits could then be diverted-once we have improved the profitability of rail services-to the profitable areas of bulk mineral carriage and main line general freight. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report points out the necessity for appropriate organisation- management information systems, personnel and skills-to fulfil AN's commercial tasks. It is important that Australian National and other publicly owned transport undertakings be modernised and rationalised to enable them to increase efficiency. Bureaucratic structures should be minimised and a more flexible organisation established. Personnel with appropriate skills should be employed. If possible, existing employees should be retained and backed up by the necessary administrative systems. Especially important to this progress are clear Government guidelines within which Australian National will have expanded commercial freedom, explicit and realistic objectives for it to attain, appropriate structure, personnel, skills and administrative systems, retraining and educational facilities, an improved industrial relations environment and expanded, meaningful employee participation in decisions affecting their working lives. </PARA>
<PARA> The last matter I want to refer to is the exercise of tendering by AN for works to be carried out within the Australian National Railways Commission system. The Committee had before it representatives of the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, who asserted that Australian National had unfair advantage over private contractors when tendering for Australian National construction works. They put to the Committee a similar case to that which they put in respect of national road construction; that is, because they are private enterprise operators, because they employ contract labour, they can do the job cheaper-in a number of cases it was asserted at least 30 per cent cheaper-than a public authority, in this case Australian National. As in the case of roads, I want to reiterate and emphasise that there is absolutely no proof of this-for road or rail. In effect, what is happening is that the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, which is dependent on government or the public sector for about 70 per cent of its total work, in the face of a situation where public sector capital expenditure is contracting, is seeking to have diverted by a sycophantic government works normally carried out by public authorities. It is doing so without regard to the impact upon the level of efficiency of those authorities that would follow a diversion of publicly funded and public authority works to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect what we see is a featherbedding of the private sector in the name of efficiency. This is a fallacy; there is no proof and there is no evidence. On the other hand, AN, which is a public authority, while able to participate in consultancy work abroad to a limited extent, is unable to use its resources to participate in tenders or to seek work in the private sector. We maintain strongly, and I think the Committee's decision can reasonably be interpreted in this way, that AN is able to continue to tender for its own construction works and development projects. I believe that function is in the interests of the Commission. The alternative is that the resources and employees of the Commission would be kept idle so that construction or maintenance works could be carried out by large and wealthy private contractors. That is the featherbedding to which I referred earlier. Such an arrangement is not in the interests of the taxpayers. It is a squandering of taxpayers' resources to prop up wealthy companies that are going through a period of financial stringency and market contraction. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations of the Committee were reached after a great deal of discussion and a great deal of input from members of the Committee, and particularly its staff. The subject examined is a very important one. It is a central part of our railway system in this country. I hope that the Government, in the time before it, will pick up the recommendations in a constructive fashion and that at a later stage the Minister for Transport will come back to us with a report on the Government's response to each of the recommendations. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VT7">Mr WALLIS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Grey)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-First of all I would like to comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter). Rather ungenerously, when speaking about the country electorates of South Australia, he referred only to Barker and Wakefield, which is held by Mr Giles. Those electorates represent 9 per cent of the State. I thought he should have been a bit more generous and also thrown in the electorate of Grey which represents 90 per cent of the State. My electorate of Grey also has railway problems which in many cases are similar to those to which the honourable member referred. Whilst I have not had a chance to read fully the report of the Standing Committee on Expenditure, I would like to comment on some of the anomalies that I have faced in the hope that they have been covered in the report and are the subject of recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one of the Expenditure committees examined last year's Budget allocation for the Department of Transport I made inquiries regarding the method of booking on Australian National because it was quite obvious that the system was grossly inefficient. The figures given to me later by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) on the percentage of berth occupancy on both the Transcontinental and the Indian Pacific were shocking. I know that around the middle of the year is not the most popular time to travel. However, the figure for June got down as low as 24 per cent west bound and 34 per cent east bound on the Transcontinental. Even for February we find a berth occupancy of 42 per cent one way and 38 per cent the other way on the Transcontinental. Staff members have informed me that on many occasions people who tried to get on the trains were told that there were no vacancies, that no berths were available. Yet those trains were travelling half empty. It is quite obvious that the booking system was in a shocking state. We have been told that the railways are trying to establish a computerised booking system to overcome this problem. I would hope-as I said, I have not had a chance to read the report-that the Standing Committee on Expenditure has considered this matter and made recommendations to try to overcome this position . </PARA>
<PARA> Something was said earlier about public service obligations. I would also like to say something about the social responsibility of a railway system. It is quite obvious that pressure is being put on AN at present to break financially even by 1987. This means that the railway will try to cut out everything on which it is not making a profit and that some of the social responsibilities which have been carried out by the railway in the past will be put to one side. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to one function of the railway which, while not affecting a great number of people, affects people in the more outlying areas of South Australia, and particularly those between the South Australian border and Kalgoorlie. I refer to the historic tea and sugar train which was organised just after the commencement of the construction of the east-west railway line. The main function of this train was to supply provisions for railway staff such as people working on railway gangs along the east-west railway line. Following improvements to the railway system-the re-laying of the track with all welded rails and concrete sleepers-the railway has been able to cut out quite a number of maintenance gangs. I am informed that up to date 14 maintenance gangs have been removed from the east-west railway line between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie . It is anticipated that in a few years, after the conversion is completed, the number of stops between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie will be reduced to seven. </PARA>
<PARA> The tea and sugar train not only serviced railway people but also enabled people on the cattle and sheep stations-people in any sphere of life-to obtain provisions. Now, because of a reduction in the number of maintenance gangs the number of stops has been reduced. This means that a lot of people will have to get provisions in other ways. Approaches have been made to the Minister and to the railway. The railway has said that it will stop the train to allow people to get their provisions but at a cost. I think the cost in one place that was mentioned was $20 per customer. This is one area where the concept of social responsibility needs to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 44 of the Australian National Railways Commission Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may direct the Commission to make any alteration in any existing practice or carry out any system or matter of policy, but where any such direction adversely affects the accounts of the railways, the Commission shall notify the Minister thereof from time to time, and the amount of any loss occasioned by the direction shall, if certified by the Auditor-General, be provided by Parliament in the annual Appropriation Act and paid to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>In terms of social responsibility, some consideration should be given to people who live in isolated areas. These people as a general rule would support the Government. I suggest that any loss incurred by Australian National as a result of allowing the train to stop could be reimbursed to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Barker mentioned the closing of country railway lines . In my electorate two such lines are affected. These lines were considered unprofitable. They had reached the stage where maintenance costs were very high. However, if they had been in first class condition they could have carried on. The lines had been allowed to deteriorate over a number of years. As a result the cost of upgrading the lines was not a viable proposition when Australian National took them over. When we talk about closing country railway lines I wonder whether we ever take into account the other costs which result. I am not talking about costs for Australian National but costs which State governments have to bear as a result of having to upgrade roads. When we look at these things all the factors have to be taken into account. If we close a railway line because we consider it is unprofitable it could mean that grain, for example, has to be carried by heavy trucks. As a result the roads on which the trucks travel will not last a great time and will have to be upgraded. Therefore, overall, is anything going to be saved by society? Here again I think we could refer to section 44 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to one other matter. Again, I hope that the Committee has given consideration to it. One of the greatest decentralised industries in any country is its railway system. The same applies in Australia. I appreciate that the word 'decentralisation' is a much abused word. Whilst a lot of people talk about it very few people do anything to put it into effect. Since the amalgamation of the South Australian Railways and the old Commonwealth Railways, we have seen greater centralisation of railway activities in Adelaide, with the result that traditional country centres, such as Port Pirie, Port Augusta and Peterborough, have been downgraded. It has been said that some of those centres could become whistle stops in the future. It is quite obvious to me as a resident of Port Augusta, a very important railway town, that the number of railway activities that have been moved out of that city to Adelaide is considerable. This does not bode well for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a continual reduction in staff employed by the railways. Despite the promises which have been given by railway officials to councils and groups of employees in the area that reduction in staff continues. This will certainly downgrade the activities in those towns and cities. According to the report, there has been a further reduction in the number of staff of Australian National of between 400 and 500 in the last 12 months. When one sees the advertisements for staff it does appear that the number of wages staff is going down but that the number of managerial and administrative staff is on the up. So the situation could be getting a bit out of balance. There has been a cutback in the number of apprentices being taken on by Australian National. The railways did promise the Port Augusta council in the northern area where the main workshops are situated, it would put on 40 apprentices this year but it finished up that only 27 lads were taken on. The excuse was given that lads had taken other positions elsewhere. In the past the practice has been that when a lad applied for an apprenticeship he would also apply to Telecom Australia, the Electricity Trust of South Australia, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd in Whyalla, the Army, you name it. Often a lad would win one of the railway positions but, if he took one of the others which was offered, another lad would step up and take his place. Apparently that has not taken place this year. I have taken up the matter with the Minister. He has agreed to refer it to Mr Marks, the Chairman of the Commission to see whether this problem can be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I do feel that the pressure which has been put on Australian National at present certainly places it in a position where it has had to ignore completely any social responsibility. I feel that if railways are to play their proper part in Australian society they must be allowed to accept that social responsibility with the full backing of the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the interruption of this debate last evening I was commenting on the revenue shortfalls in the health administration in the Northern Territory. In the first submission to the Commonwealth by the Northern Territory Government in December last year the clear decline in hospital utilisation and its consequent effect on revenue was clearly demonstrated. In the five months since 1 December 1981 occupied bed days decreased by 20 per cent. Out-patient services showed a downturn of 46 per cent after three months compared with the 33.3 per cent downturn estimated by the Commonwealth. After five months' operation out-patient utilisation decreased by a further 8 per cent to some 54 per cent. Full bed day costs were increased as well on 1 September 1981 from an average of $98 per day to $189 per day. This represents an increase of 133 per cent. As a result, the nominal charges raised show a potential revenue in the vicinity of 46 per cent higher than the actual $ 500,000 which was estimated by the Commonwealth. However, the actual payment of accounts for revenue cases eligible for compensation is usually received between one year and four years after charging. In fact, it is more likely to be four years in the case of larger claims. On current trends the $500,000 estimated by the Commonwealth cannot be achieved and a shortfall of $0.33m is indicated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I mentioned before, out-patient services have felt a severe downturn. After five months' operation it is apparent that revenue at 30 June 1982 will be in the vicinity of $918,000, a $282,000 shortfall from the Commonwealth target of $ 1.2m and 5.4 per cent lower than the $970,000 forecast after three months. In- patient bed days have declined by 20 per cent over the previous year, but out of this Aboriginal bed days have increased from 43 per cent of total bed days at the end of November to 45 per cent after five months' operation. It is still less, though, than the 50 per cent recorded in 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> Bed days attributable to patients holding health care cards have increased from 44 per cent after three months to 51 per cent after five months. By November 1981 total additional charges raised as a result of the new arrangements represent only 50 per cent of the Commonwealth assessed revenue of $4.8m. Furthermore, with the increased use of health care cards additional charges represent only 41 per cent of the Commonwealth target of $5.25m. So with the reduction of use of in-patient treatment and the increase in the number of disadvantaged patients, the collection of every debt within the financial year would leave a deficit of $3.09m from a target of $5.25m for in-patient services. As honourable members will understand by these trends, the Northern Territory Government has been badly placed under the health funding arrangements by a mis- calculation by the Commonwealth in the amount of revenue the Territory could raise from its hospitals. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables which quantify the difficulties for this current year and next financial year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bill under consideration today to amend the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act permits the Commonwealth to extend to the three most populous States an allocation of $69m in return for their willingness last year not to press the Commonwealth for immediate implementation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission report on tax sharing. This Bill should bring back fond memories for the Treasurer (Mr Howard) for it is the $69m that the Commonwealth was prepared to allocate to the States in May last year, but which was concealed from the Premiers and then boasted about when the Premiers failed to demand it. We then witnessed a truly Dickensian performance from the Treasurer and his fellow culprits as they gave excellent impersonations of Uriah Heep in performing their mea culpas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Essentially this legislation marks time. It awaits the result of the Grants Commission review of its own report which is to be announced in May. This Bill provides us with what is probably a final opportunity for critical comment on the Grants Commission formula for tax sharing arrangements. From a Western Australian point of view, we are marking time under a Sword of Damocles. The arrangements have trimmed considerable amounts off our financial assistance from the Commonwealth and the review could trim up to $160m more. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I want to look at the historical background to this Bill, and the Act which it seeks to amend, in order to demonstrate the extent to which a deceit has been practiced on the citizens of this country by this Government and various conservative State governments, particularly that in Queensland, which is a substantial gainer from this Bill, and that in Western Australia, which is a substantial loser from the whole process. The tax sharing formula is unrelated to the size of the aggregate allocations to the States but some mention of the aggregate allocation is necessary here. When the Whitlam Government was in office it was the object of the most vicious attacks by the Premiers of Western Australia and Queensland as well as the federal coalition then in Opposition for its alleged centralist tendencies. The concept of new federalism was brought forward by the Federal and State Tories and became a centrepiece of Liberal ideology. It was argued that, in particular, specific purpose grants should be phased out and that functions which are essentially dual Commonwealth and State responsibilities under our Constitution should largely be returned to the States . Their responsibilities for those functions were to be exercised by their own power to dispense general revenue grants received from the Commonwealth as they saw fit. </PARA>
<PARA> There was the implication in this new focal point of Liberal Party ideology that the States would have available to them much the same revenue that had been available via specific and general purpose grants in the past. This would be possible because firstly, either the Commonwealth would increase general purpose grants by the amount of the reduction in specific purpose grants and/or secondly , the Commonwealth would vacate a proportion of the taxation field to permit the States to re-enter the field with new taxes, raising the revenue directly themselves. Of course neither of these conditions has been fulfilled. It was never intended that they should be. It was a major confidence trick played, to some degree, on some of the State governments and upon the Australian population as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The decline of the States' share of total Commonwealth tax receipts has been quite dramatic since the implementation of the new federalism policy. In the last Whitlam Budget the amount of money granted by the Commonwealth to the States in either specific or general purpose grants was 50.8 per cent of the Commonwealth tax receipts. In the last Budget of this Government it was 39.8 per cent. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth has not vacated the tax field. It has become even more obtrusive, abandoning indexation of income tax rates and entering new fields of sales tax or increasing its take from old fields. Only in the field of tax on business has there been a decline in the Commonwealth's take since this Government assumed office. The area of tax on business is not really one that is open to the States to enter readily, at least not on an equitable basis as in some States there will be a far greater capacity to raise funds from businesses than there will be in other areas. It is not an area of the tax field which the States can enter and hope thereby to achieve an equitable-in interstate terms-distribution of taxes from that source. </PARA>
<PARA> What States' rights have come to mean to the Tories is loading responsibilities for cuts in services on to the States, the losers being Australian citizens who really could not care less about Liberal ideological arguments but would rather like to have their money efficiently expended and be given honest explanations about the purpose of shifting funding arrangements. However the Australian people must pay more attention to the ideological tribal dances of the Liberal and National Country Parties because the outcomes of those dances have an impact upon them. What the collective efforts of the Western Australian and Federal Liberal-National Country Party governments have produced between them for the people of my home State, with the impact of new federalism ideology, has been the breach of an historic compromise on which our association with the Commonwealth was founded. Western Australia traded its right to erect protective fences around its economy in relation to the eastern States and its choice to impose or remove barriers on its international trade in return for the status of a claimant State. What we lost in our hampered development thereby was to be regained in direct Commonwealth assistance. That assistance was important in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s in establishing a number of manufacturing or secondary processing industries in our State. At a time when we found it extremely difficult to encourage private investments in key employment industries in our State the funds that accrued to Western Australia as a result of its claimant status were expended on the establishment of things such as the State timber mills and a number of other State industries. Those funds enabled us to develop those industries when we could quite easily have found ourselves with no industrial development at all because we permitted, effectively, a state of free trade to exist between Western Australia and the eastern States as a result of the terms of federation. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government argues that Western Australia's revenue raising potential is great it ought to reflect on two things. Firstly, under the new Grants Commission formulas, revenues from mineral levies are to be wholly or partially discounted against Commonwealth financial assistance. So our capacity to raise revenue via levies on mineral companies will be offset by consequent reductions in Commonwealth funds. Therefore in reality it is no advantage unless we take extraordinary measures in the judgment of the Grants Commission over and above normal levels in taxing those mineral companies ourselves. Clearly, our capacity to do that will be limited by a whole variety of factors that will be largely beyond the economic control of the State Government. Secondly, we still are massively disadvantaged by eastern States' tariff subsidies. The most recent figures I have been able to find are from an Industries Assistance Commission paper, published in 1980, entitled 'Approaches to a General Reduction in Tariffs Information Paper No. 1'. The figures are for 1977-78 but they remain representative today. If the tariff had been eliminated and replaced by a government subsidy the required distribution to industries in the various States would have been New South Wales, $1,465m; Victoria, $1,635m; Queensland, $265m; South Australia, $375m; Western Australia, $176m and Tasmania $87m. That would have amounted to an explicit massive transfer of resources from Western Australian taxpayers to the east if, as I said, the tariff had been eliminated notionally and, instead, subsidies provided to particular industries out of Commonwealth revenues. The tariff, as it is, indicates the existence of a massive transfer of resources from Western Australian consumers to the east. </PARA>
<PARA> We may also consider the hidden subsidy in Australian internal trade. When we entered the Federation, as I have said, we waived the right to erect tariff barriers against the eastern States. There is a trade imbalance now between ourselves and the eastern States of the order of 10 to one. Western Australia's poverty may have been alleviated since the time it first became a claimant State but that was not historically the only question of equity involved in the entry of Western Australia into the Federation. Another question of equity involved was our capacity to develop ourselves internally and that, as I have suggested, continues to be seriously damaged by the nature of commercial relationships in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Grants Commission report on tax sharing arrangements has been exceptionally hard on Western Australia. If it were to proceed unaltered in the review of May this year it would produce a revenue loss of $160m next year to the Western Australian budget. The Fraser-O'Connor Liberal new federalism therefore would require a 12 per cent increase in the amount of income tax paid by the State's population to make up this shortfall were the O'Connor Liberal Government to fulfil indications by its Court predecessor that a State tax would be introduced . The report tabled last year has many inadequacies. In numerous places it admits inadequacies in data collected. Only 15 centres were visited in Western Australia by the members of the Grants Commission. The commissioners stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Several areas of interest were overflown at low altitude. </PARA>
<PARA>I am afraid that that is not a substitute for landing and talking. It might be useful in mapping techniques if the commissioners wished to engage in a little mapping in the Western Australian outback. It may be useful in spotting herds of cattle but it will tell us very little about the nature of the needs of Western Australia. I hope that in future when the commissioners fly over the backblocks of Western Australia they will lower their altitude even further, apply the brakes and hop out and have a chat. Nevertheless, this ought to have alerted the commissioners to particular Western Australian distance problems. Whilst the Commission took into account the differences in degree and pattern of dispersal of the State's population it made inadequate allowances for costs arising from distance factors, both interstate and intrastate. There was no attempt to take account of costs of equalising the range and standard of services throughout Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of deficiency was the failure of the Commission to include in its assessment all the considerations of expenditure needs it was entitled to include. It was given a legal opinion from the Attorney-General which said that assessment of services should include 'any body which is controlled by the State Government or by any other State statutory authority'. The Commission, however, decided to exclude from its consideration these services: Ports and harbours, electricity and gas, metropolitan water supply, sewerage and drainage, and housing. Its rationale, that these undertakings do not regularly result in a net cost to Consolidated Revenue in all or most of the States, flies in the face of the Attorney-General's legal opinion. Western Australia is particularly disadvantaged by this decision. These services are all extraordinarily costly to Western Australians. They are getting more expensive as charges on them paid by the Western Australian consumers subsidise the interest on infrastructure borrowings for new mineral developments. </PARA>
<PARA> Geography adds to our costs. For example, power costs are higher because we lack cheap, dispersed coal deposits, and great distances are involved in power transmission. Supplies of natural gas from the North West Shelf are plentiful but will have to pass along an extraordinarily lengthy pipeline to go from the North West Shelf to the industrial south-west. Another problem with the way in which the Commission has assessed needs is that it has failed to take account of the future development of the States and, in terms of tax sharing entitlement, has locked each State into its past expenditure patterns. </PARA>
<PARA> Inadequate planning for regional development by successive Tory governments in Western Australia has resulted in expenditure needs being based on Western Australia remaining the most centralised State. Queensland, on the other hand, which is a major beneficiary of this amending legislation, has encouraged decentralisation thereby creating established needs. In terms of the Commission' s analysis, a need does not exist unless it is an established need and one which has involved past expenditure commitments. I hope that when the commissioners undertake their review to restructure their formula they will do at least several things for Western Australia. I hope, firstly, that their assessment of needs will not be based solely on past needs but that on the question of decentralisation, for example, they will make an assessment of the potential and requirement of the State to decentralise and include that in their judgment. Secondly, I hope that the commissioners will include in their review all the States' services that the Attorney-General said they could include and make a judgment in relation to needs on the basis of an assessment of equity in each State's performance in those various statutory authorities I mentioned. Thirdly, on the question of decentralisation, I hope that the commissioners will pay particular attention to the very extreme difficulties experienced by outback Western Australia and to the fact that even greater distances are covered in Western Australia than in any other State including Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Grants Commission report has merely capped an appalling record of lack of direction in federal and Western Australian Liberal thinking on the State's economy. It was a point of Liberal pride which withdrew Western Australia prematurely from the Grants Commission's claimant status in 1967-68. It was an immature, ideological whim that so readily accepted the altered basis of financial assistance assessments in 1976. Even though the State and Federal Liberals knew that the formula then devised would in the long run kick the bottom out of Western Australia's finances, as the new formula was sustained only by a 4-year promise by the Commonwealth Government to permit assistance to a State not to fall below the value of a previous year's assistance, ideological blinkers caused them to persist. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia has been living on borrowed time since 1976, and this year the debt on that time has been called in. We lost $53m last year and experienced effectively only a 7 per cent increase in funds available during a period of 10 per cent inflation and when tax revenue to the Commonwealth-the Commonwealth is far from vacating the field, as I said before-from all sources increased by 16 per cent. It is quite evident from the tone of the Commonwealth's attitude on this Bill that the type of special grant it entails will not be readily forthcoming in the future. Western Australia cannot expect any reliable form of special assistance once the formula has been settled, as it had been promised it will be settled in May this year. That will be very much a red-letter month-I suspect even a dead-letter month-for Western Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The ideological blinkers of the Federal and State Liberals also deprive the Western Australian population of the possibility of an intelligent trade-off between our tariff disadvantage and a formula which recognises Western Australia 's real difficulties. The free trade credentials of the State Liberals are suspect. Most recently the Premier of Western Australia was critical of the level of tariffs and the extent to which they disadvantage Western Australia. Yet he was a Minister in a government which in August 1980 criticised the Federal Government for its lack of decisiveness in rejecting the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission on lower tariffs for the clothing and footwear industries. </PARA>
<PARA> People such as the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) have been more consistent. However, his stand on tariffs, which will never gain the support of a Federal government, Labor or Liberal, has not included any consideration of a trade-off elsewhere in the economy or in financial policy. His philosophy does not contemplate the alternatives. The philosophical commitments of his colleagues in the State combine with sheer intellectual laziness to ensure that no serious initiative is taken. In other words, they set up the straw man of the tariff barrier in the full knowledge that if Western Australia is to remain in the Federation absolutely nothing can be done as the lobby of the eastern States on the question of tarrifs will always be far more significant and powerful than the Western Australian one. But they do not take the logical next step of using a legitimate source of complaint. They do no seek to offset that situation with a request for special assistance for Western Australia or, at the very least, a formula in the Grants Commission which takes into account Western Australia's developmental needs. We will never have that because the Liberals in Western Australia, Federal and State, are utterly incapable of the intellectual effort to make that leap. Those of them who are capable are more interested in their ideological stance than in the real needs of the people of the State. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that the tax sharing Act could eventually spell extraordinary damage to the Western Australian education system and State services, the State Liberal Party puffs up pipe dreams and volleys of inconsistent statements. We can only hope that they organise their minds in their last few months of grace and take some cognisance of the lesson they will learn from the State by- elections which will be held on Saturday when massive swings will be registered against them as punishment for their financial mismanagement. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of the amendments which have been circulated is to correct a technical fault in the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Amendment Bill 1982. As the Amendment Bill now stands, the States' aggregate tax sharing grants vary from the figures settled at the June 1981 Premiers Conference to the extent that the Australian Statistician's determination of State and Northern Territory populations as at 31 December 1981 is different from the estimates that were used for the purposes in June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments overcome this problem by fixing the States' aggregate basic tax share at $6524.6m and providing for the addition of $165.1m on a basis also determined at the Premiers Conference. The amendments also simplify the description in the legislation for the calculation of the States' tax sharing grant. At the Premiers Conference on 20 June 1981 it was decided to pay the States an aggregate tax sharing grant of $6,689.7m in 1981-82. This amount was comprised of a basic tax sharing grant of $6,524.6m and certain other additions which total $165.1m and which, with the exception of the $9m once and for all granted to Queensland, are set out in Schedule 2 of the amendment Bill. It was further decided at the Conference that in distributing the basic tax sharing grant amongst the States, the existing States' per capita relativities would be used; that is, the distribution of the basic grant would be calculated on the basis of the population of each State as at 31 December 1981, weighted by the per capita relativities contained in section 8 of the principal Act, which in turn derive from the per capita relativities established by the financial assistance grants in 1975-76. The amendments retain the description of the basis of distributing the basic tax share amongst the States but remove the method of calculating the basic tax share. In doing so the amendments involve nothing other than simplifying a description and providing for the payment to the States an aggregate of the amount which was decided at the June 1981 Premiers Conference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words about these amendments. Firstly the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with these amendments and which the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) has read to the chamber is a fairly unsatisfactory document for explaining exactly what these amendments do. It is particularly unsatisfactory for explaining why they are necessary. The second paragraph simply states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Amendment Bill now stands, the States' aggregate tax sharing grants vary from the figures settled at the June 1981 Premiers Conference . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But it does not explain why that is so. It is not immediately obvious why that would be so. In talking about the difference in population figures as between the States and the Northern Territory for December 1981, in actuality as distinct from what the original assessment by the Australian Statistician would have been, it is not immediately clear, I suggest, why that would alter the States' aggregate tax sharing grant. After a lot of delving around one can find out why that is so, but it would surely not be beyond the realms of possibility for the Government to spell that out clearly so that people and the Parliament can understand what is being done and why before such debates come on, rather than leaving it to the Opposition to make those explanations. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that it is worth while putting into English why these amendments are appropriate. Therefore, I put to the chamber what I understand to be happening at present. The States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act-which I remind the Committee was opposed by the Opposition when it came before the Parliament in June of last year and to which I will refer later-determined a formula for calculating the aggregate tax sharing grants to the States and the Northern Territory and provided a formula also for dividing that aggregate grant between the States and the Northern Territory on an adjusted population basis. The Amendment Bill, which is the Bill now before the chamber, provided for a fixed grant to the Northern Territory of $315.1m, which was expected to be $6.5m more than the formula would have provided; that is, the formula for dividing up the aggregate grant between the States and the Northern Territory. However, this was only an estimate as to what the additional grant to the Northern Territory would have been over and above the formula, because it involved the Statistician making an assessment in June of last year-the time of the Premiers Conference-of the population of each State and the Northern Territory as at 31 December last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also made consequential adjustments to the original Act by seeking to remove reference to the Northern Territory in section 8 of the Act, which deals with tax sharing grants for the States in 1981-82. However, it is clear that the legislation did not make those changes satisfactorily because the determination of the payment for each State, not the Northern Territory still involved reference to the total amount to be paid to the States and the Northern Territory. If, under that formula, the Northern Territory entitlement was different from that originally estimated, the States' aggregate funds would be accordingly changed from what was originally agreed upon; which was the figure of $6,524.6m. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Bill, which are now before the Committee, are presumably to ensure that the States receive that agreed amount of $6,524.6m. The amendments to the Bill abandon reference to the formula for calculating the total grant to the States and the Northern Territory and just set the sum to be divided amongst the States and vary the formula for the division of that sum to exclude any mention of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that explains the situation rather more adequately than the Minister did in his speech to this chamber on the amendments now before us. In not opposing these amendments the Opposition draws attention again to the change in the formula which was brought about by the original Act last year, following the Premiers Conference; surely one of the most notable and despicable Premiers Conferences of all time because of the actions of this Government in deceiving the States in a way which got every State Premier enormously upset. After that Premiers Conference the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) skited to the nation about the way in which they had deluded the States and kept from them 1 per cent which they would have been prepared to give them if they had been pushed hard enough. But, more importantly, at that Conference the Commonwealth imposed upon the States a change in the formula for the calculation of the total grant to the States from the previous tax-sharing arrangements to a basis on which last year's sum was increased eventually by only 9 per cent. In other words, there was a real reduction in the amount of funds that were made available to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other reasons which one could go into but as we are in the Committee stage I will not pursue that matter any more. I do reiterate how important it is for the Government, when bringing forward complicated amendments, to spell out exactly what is being done and why it has to be done. Broad references to technical changes leave the Parliament in a position in which it is difficult to know what the Government is doing and it is left to the Opposition to explain exactly why the changes need to be made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the second reading debate I said that there were some aspects of the amendments proposed by the Government about which I was not very sure and about which I had some concern. I endorse the remarks that have just been made by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), in connection with the necessity for the Government to provide in explanatory memoranda sufficient detail to make it possible for honourable members to understand clearly what is intended by the amendments and the impact that they will have so that we do not have to spend, unnecessarily, hours of our time wading through the Act, the amending Bill, the formulas that are being applied and the proposals that are made in connection with any adjustments. To some extent my fears have been allayed but not entirely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Initially I was concerned about the impact of proposed amendments to this amending Bill which, as the Minister has indicated, seeks to correct a technical fault in the Bill. It appears that the June 1981 Premiers Conference agreed to the aggregate tax-sharing grant of $6,689.7m for 1981-82. That aggregate grant was comprised of a basic grant of $6,524.6m and other additions totalling $165. 1m which included the $9m once and for all grant to Queensland, because of an adjustment in the population base part of the formula. It was suggested that the States agreed to the total amount of the grant rather than the basis upon which it was to be calculated. I am prepared to accept that suggestion. The specification of the actual amount rather than including the method by which that amount was calculated, and the explanations that have been given for that, satisfy me but I am still not completely satisfied about the reason why the $165 .1m less, if we wish, the $9m to Queensland has been deducted to reach the total as specified in the amendment, $6.524m instead of $6,689m. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this question because it was agreed at the Premiers Conference that the aggregate tax-sharing entitlement of the States in any year after this current financial year will bear the same proportion to the previous years total tax receipts as the general revenue grant to the States during this current year bears to the total tax receipts for 1980-81, that is, 20.72 per cent. For the purpose of this calculation the additional $60m which this legislation provides to be granted to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland is to be included in the 1981-82 grant. I am concerned that this $60m now forms part of the $165.1m which has not been included in the amount stated in the amendments. I would like clarified the extent and the way in which, if at all, the deletion of that $165. 1m, which includes the $60m which the Commonwealth and the States had agreed would be included in this current year's allocation, will affect the grants to the States for 1982-83 and subsequent years. </PARA>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 7 and 8 (1982). </PARA>
<PARA>The customs tariff proposals I have just tabled and which are being circulated relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals No. 7 ( 1982), which operate from tomorrow, introduce tariff changes arising from the Government's decisions on recommendations by the Industries Assistance Commission in its reports on ginger and ginger products, cork and articles of cork and floor and wall coverings. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendations on these goods except in regard to a section of the report on floor and wall coverings. The Government decided not to accept the Commission's recommendation that goods falling within tariff item 59.10, other than floor and wall coverings, be dutiable at minimum rates. Implementation of the Commission's recommendation would have created difficulties of identification. However, the spirit of the recommendation by the IAC will be achieved by allowing normal by- law criteria to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of ginger and ginger products, the effect of the decision is that: dry ginger will be assisted by a sliding scale duty of $0.60 per kilogram less 50 per cent of the value. Duty will be payable on imported dry ginger only where the price is less than $1.20 per kilogram. </PARA>
<PARA> This arrangement is designed to maintain stability by providing a buffer against an unexpected or drastic fall in world ginger prices. Gingerin will be dutiable at 10 per cent in line with the tariff assistance recently accorded other fragrances and essences. Other ginger and ginger products will be dutiable at 2 per cent. The IAC had concluded that the ginger industry is efficient and is well suited to the Australian economic environment. The above duty rates largely maintain the assistance the tariff currently provides. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of cork and articles of cork the effect of the decision is that natural cork, mainly wine corks and agglomerated wine corks, will be dutiable at 2 per cent, which represents a decrease in the duty rate. The duty rate on floor or wall coverings made of agglomerated cork will be reduced from 26 per cent to 20 per cent after two years and the duty rate on gaskets and similar joints of cork will be reduced from 30 per cent on implementation to 20 per cent over two years except in regard to certain goods currently dutiable at 17 per cent which will become dutiable at 20 per cent immediately. The IAC's recommendations generally represent a lowering of the duty rates currently applying to the goods covered by this report. The phasing arrangements will allow local producers of these goods time to adjust to the new levels of assistance. The new rates will reduce duty disparities between different cork products and between cork and substitute products. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of floor and wall coverings the effect of the decision is that laminated rigid sheets of artificial plastic materials and floor and wall coverings of materials other than artificial plastic will be dutiable at 20 per cent, foamed polyethylene wall coverings will be dutiable at 6 per cent and other floor and wall coverings of artificial plastic materials will be reduced to a rate of 20 per cent over two years. These rates are not expected to have any significant adverse economic, social or employment consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 8, which operate from 1 April 1982, introduce a legal note to define 'printed' fabrics for the purposes of the customs tariff. This change was foreshadowed in my media release of 12 February 1982 concerning textiles, clothing and footwear. The legal note will ensure that only genuine printed cotton sheeting may be entered at the lower rates of duty prescribed for such goods and is consistent with the definition used in the by-laws which allow concessional admission of certain fabrics 'in the grey' that are subsequently printed in Australia. A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the changes has been prepared and has been circulated to honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These three Bills are minor Bills but the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), in his second reading speech, was at pains to stress that there are quite a few matters in them which need to be discussed. The Opposition does not oppose the measures. The industry, at both the growing and the processing level, agrees with them. The purpose of this Bill to amend the Tobacco Charge Act (No. 1) 1955 is to increase the rate of charge payable on sales of Australian tobacco leaf on and after 1 March 1982 from 1.1c to 2.5c per kilogram. It also enables the rate of charge to be increased or decreased by regulation. Of course, these charges are paid by growers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Linked with this Bill are the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Tobacco Charge Amendment Bill (No. 3) which apply the rate of charge set under this Bill for Australian tobacco leaf purchased by manufacturers or grown and used by manufacturers. At present the rate of charge paid by manufacturers is 2. 2c per kilogram. The principal Acts were introduced in 1955 and simply established rates of charge to be paid by industry funds for research financed from the Tobacco Industry Trust Account. In 1965 the Act was amended so that part of the charges paid by growers and manufacturers could be appropriated to meet the cost of operation of the Australian Tobacco Board. In 1965 the rates of charge increased from one halfpenny to three-fifths of a penny per pound of tobacco. They were reduced in 1973 to 1.1c per kilogram. One can see from that that there has been a decline in the amount of money thus provided for research. Also, as the cost of operating the Australian Tobacco Board has escalated, there is a need for the industry to pay more levy at all levels. Of course, the size of the marketing quotas has declined under the terms of the Tobacco Stabilisation Plan. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the highest production figure in recent years was in 1971 when it was 15.876 million kgs whereas last year, for example, it was down to 14.739 million kgs. The research and extension programs in the three producing States have been pruned and rationalised over a period of several years. These new arrangements will result in the industry contributing a quarter of a million dollars more than it had been doing. The Commonwealth contributes on a dollar for dollar basis. As I said, the issue of government support for an industry which produces a commodity of dubious benefit to society was mentioned very strongly by the Minister in his speech. The Government is saying that it is now promoting the redirection of research moneys into alternative varieties of tobacco leaf which have a less detrimental effect on health. The Minister made the claim that in the research programs there has been increasing emphasis on plant breeding and on cultural practices which affect alkaloid levels in the leaf. Research is also aimed at lessening dependence on the use of chemicals in the growing of the tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that there will be further emphasis on these essential aspects of research, the Government has sought the agreement of the Australian Agricultural Council to add a representative of the Department of Health to membership of the Central Tobacco Advisory Committee, that is, the committee which has the responsibility for examining research programs and recommending to the Minister the expenditure of moneys from the Tobacco Industry Trust Account. Expenditure approved for this year, that is, 1981-82, is $1,233,155 of which the Commonwealth is committed to contribute $348,000. The additional State expenditure on tobacco research in 1981-82 is estimated at $580,000. As I have said, the increases have been sought by both the growing and the manufacturing sectors. The Tobacco Growers Council has said that the growers are not opposed to the Bill and consider it in their interests that it be passed. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has had a substantial input into the decision to increase charges. Prior to proposing the increase in charges, the growers were careful to review the existing research and administration in order to make all possible cost savings. The funds will not be used for promotion or research into promotion, and the arrangement whereby the Commonwealth is required to match expenditure of industry funds will not mean that the Government will have to make a considerable increase. The Government's contribution has not increased in absolute terms since 1965 but this increase does not make up for growers' losses due to inflation and the declining quotas I have already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than acting as a means of maintaining a health problem, research into the growing and curing aspects of the tobacco industry can act as a valuable and effective means of dealing with problems. Through research programs, efforts can be channelled into developing less toxic varieties of tobacco or devising methods of curing and processing that minimise the levels of contaminants in the tobacco leaf. The industry is aware that such research is in its long term interests. The dependence on heavy applications of insecticides and herbicides is another problem. Pollution of streams is widespread in tobacco growing areas. Therefore, substantial social and economic benefits are to be gained from research within the industry itself into ways of curbing the dependence on chemicals. I suppose that most honourable members, as realists-this would certainly be the industry view-are convinced that in the short term it will never be possible to ban cigarette smoking any more than governments will be able to ban junk food, both of which may be desirable objectives. However, via research, we may be able to make smoking less harmful. It is this positive direction that research should be encouraged by the Government to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> Further research, inasmuch as it facilitates cost savings in production, allows Australian leaf to become more competitive with leaf produced overseas. If we do not support and encourage the domestic tobacco industry, increasing amounts of leaf will simply be imported from overseas. It is much harder to control the toxicity levels of a product produced in foreign countries than it is to control them in our own. It appears to the Opposition that research is capable of making a positive contribution to the problem of the effect of smoking on health. It is doubtful that such one-off measures as a 10 per cent levy on cigarettes, which I understand is being proposed in another place, will be equally positive. Numerous studies have indicated that there is no provable relationship between the level of advertising and the level of smoking in the community, but there is a very commonly held view that advertising certainly does promote brands and in so doing stimulates consumption. The recent Committee of Inquiry into Advertising of Tobacco Products which was conducted by the Western Australian Department of Health reported:</PARA>
<PARA> There are many factors having the potential to contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the smoking habit. Advertising (including promotion) is only one of these. The majority of the more potent factors are of phychological or social nature. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill gives honourable members a chance to say a few words about the tobacco industry, even though it simply increases the amount of levy being paid by growers and processors. As honourable members are aware, the Tobacco Stabilisation Plan operates until 1983. It is administered by the Australian Tobacco Board, whose main job is to oversee the marketing quota for Australian flue cured tobacco for each of the five years dealt with in the plan. Quotas are increased or decreased by the use of a rather complicated formula. As I have said, production levels are coming down slightly. Queensland produces over half of Australia's leaf, Victoria produces over a third and New South Wales produces the least-some one-tenth to one-twelfth of total production, which comprises about 15 million kiograms a year. The Tobacco Board also maintains a grade and minimum price schedule which is operated under the terms of the stabilisation plan. It is an industry which is in discrete locations. For example, in Queensland the industry is located mainly in the electorate of the honourable member for Leichhardt, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson). There are elements in the northern tablelands of New South Wales and also in the electorate of the honourable member for Indi (Mr Ewen Cameron). </PARA>
<PARA> It may be appropriate, as some of my comments have been devoted to health aspects, to refer to the recent report by the Australian Foundation on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence. One of the things which some people in our community smoke is marihuana. The recommendations of that report should be seriously taken on board by the Government because if we admit freely that tobacco can be a harmful product, we need also to deal with the recommendations of that Committee, which reviewed all the reports that had been submitted on drugs to see how society should handle this problem, including the legal situation, possible control measures and so on. We should not continually seek to avoid that issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my privilege to support the Government on these tobacco Bills. In doing so, I support also some of the comments made by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin), especially those to the effect that much of the increased revenue will be channelled into research into the effect of various varieties of leaf on the health of we humans when we smoke tobacco. One of the three Bills relates to leaf that is sold; another relates to leaf that comes into Australia; and the third relates to leaf that manufacturers produce and consume themselves through their factories. All in all, an average charge of 2.5c per kilogram is to be applied as from 1 March 1982. The levy has been in operation since 1955.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also important to point out that in future the levy will not need an Act of Parliament in order to be either increased or decreased. The Bills allow the levy to be regulated by the Department concerned. This is a big step forward. It is much easier to make amendments to research funding in that way than by going to the trouble of putting an Act through Parliament. Unfortunately, these days most charges seem to go upwards; nothing seems to come down in price. I suppose that the next change will also be for an increase in the levy. On 2 July 1981 the industry decided that the research allocation for 1981-82 would be no more than $1.23m. As the honourable member for Werriwa has indicated, the Commonwealth and States contribute to that fund. I add that New South Wales receives approximately $59,250, Victoria $430,200 and Queensland $676,000. A contingency fund of $66,000 is also set aside. That is a very good idea. Doubtless that fund is used for carry-on purposes if the research funds are run down or additional finance is needed in a particular research sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Money is also allocated for the publication of an industry journal. That is an excellent idea. Of course, these allocations apply to only the three States in Australia in which tobacco is grown. As has been mentioned recently, most is grown in Queensland-on the Atherton Tableland, in the Glasshouse Mountains area and in my electorate of Maranoa, around the Texas-Yelarbon district. Most of the expenditure is involved in research. I believe that the honourable member for Werriwa has covered the health aspects very well and, of course, I support what is being done in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer briefly to what is happening in each State. In New South Wales most tobacco is grown in the Ashford area which is quite close to the Queensland border, so the two States have something in common in that regard. Junior and senior screening trials are conducted in an effort to keep the quality of leaf as high as possible. In Victoria the research station is established in the district of Myrtleford. Its programs cover pests and disease, weed control, plant breeding and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa mentioned the alkaline content of the leaf. It is most important that this be researched and minimised for reasons of our own good health. Of course, weeds in crops are always a problem and must continually be kept under control. Much work is being done in agriculture these days in the use of insects rather than chemicals to keep pests under control. We all know the detrimental effect which some chemicals have on our lives. It is important that this work continue. We have seen all sorts of beetles and toads introduced into Australia to try to keep some of these pests at bay. Some of them, of course, have not turned out to be very exciting. For example, the cane toad got completely out of hand and has spread right across eastern Australia. Research is continuing into methods of harvesting. Also the curing of tobacco is very important. Once the crop has been harvested in its green leaf stage, it has to be cured. That is probably one of the most important stages of the crop. Most of the curing is now being done with gas. A lot of work is going on to try to reduce the cost of the heat necessary to cure tobacco. All tobacco leaf must go through the curing stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Plant pathology and crop management are other considerations. In Queensland, which grows the most tobacco, most of the research takes place in the Mareeba district. There is also a station at Beerwah and one at Indooroopilly, in Brisbane. These establishments are looking at plant breeding, crop protection and the economics of the crop. Of course plant varieties are very important. The one currently being looked at is ZZ100. It is hoped that that variety will replace the Hick variety, which has been the most popular in the last few years. Bulk farm tests have been carried out on ZZ100 and it is hoped that it will be used to counteract blue mould, which is very prevalent in tobacco growing and will easily wipe out a crop. This variety is resistant to blue mould. A chemical called Antimould has been produced which is very useful in keeping this disease under control. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the honourable member for Werriwa, I would like to use this opportunity to refer to the industry. It is presently in very good shape. It has had a number of dry years-the last three-but this year has been excellent. Tobacco likes overcast, rainy conditions and certainly Queensland has been getting plenty of those conditions in the last two or three weeks. The wet has set in with a vengance and the tobacco growing areas in my electorate have received up to five inches of rain. Most of the tobacco is grown under irrigation. I have taken the liberty of contacting some of the growers, including Mr Augi Agostenalli and Mr Harley Girle in the Yelarbon district. I have spoken to them about these Bills. They are very happy as growers to see that the Government is increasing the levy . As good farmers, they know that without research these days any industry will quickly slip backwards. They have indicated to me that they would like to see funds spent on the things I mentioned previously-variety trials, fertilisers and particularly irrigation. There are all sorts of new methods to irrigate crops. Perhaps at this stage we should ask the Federal Government to give us more funds for irrigation, not just in Queensland but throughout Australia. It is one area at which we have to look closely. Water, along with roads, is very important and certainly we need much more funding for irrigation. I guess the money we need to spend does not drop out of the sky. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Water does but unfortunately the money does not. The current price for tobacco is 464c a kilogram, which is 20c above the minimum price set by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and the Tobacco Growers Stabilisation Fund. At present the price is above that minimum, so it can be understood that the growers are quite happy with the prices they are receiving. Like all good farmers they want more money all the time. They argue that the manufacturers are probably making a greater profit than they are, that the manufacturers' profit margins continue to rise whereas the profit margin for farmers is fairly static. They would like to see the minimum price increased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The gross value of tobacco in Australia today is approximately $60m, so it is no small industry. Of course it is very important to the people involved. New South Wales has 69 growers, Victoria 316 and Queensland 575, giving a total of 965 growers in Australia. We have 234 single operators and 663 family partnerships. A large portion of the Australian tobacco growing industry is made up of Italian immigrants. They are not frightened of a bit of hard work and wielding the hoe, and having got into this industry they now lead it. Anybody one talks to at the top of the industry has an Italian name. I think that is excellent. This situation is excellent for Australia and it has been of tremendous value to the families concerned. It is of tremendous value to the Government's philosophy of helping the family farm and making it the base of our rural operations. Nearly three-quarters of the operators are family partnerships , which is a very good indication of the co-operation within the industry. It has not been taken over by the large corporations; it is still basically made up of family units that work very hard to make a living from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Queensland now has a quota system. The industry has just voted on it and has decided to allow a quota to be established throughout the State. Previously quotas were allowed to be sold only locally. For those who do not understand the quota system, each grower has a quota. If his quota is over and above what he is able to grow then he is allowed to sell that quota. Since this vote was taken he has been able to sell it throughout Queensland. The industry presently is asking the Industries Assistance Commission to look at extending those quota sales throughout Australia. This would be very welcome if it were to come about because it would allow growers to move their quotas throughout the eastern States, so allowing tobacco growing to be moved from one area to another much more quickly. At present the heavy leaf grown west of the range is not in demand . The market is looking for the light leaf that is grown more in Victoria and on the Atherton Tablelands, in the more humid areas and the cooler areas. It is most important that quotas can be transferred throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The stabilisation scheme was mentioned by the honourable member for Werriwa. This has been of wonderful value to the industry. I am sure that with those involved in the industry working so hard, with the stabilisation scheme they have and with the extra funds that these Bills will enable the industry to use in research, the industry can look forward to a very prosperous future. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SH4">Dr KLUGMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To get lung cancer, as the honourable member for Reid points out. Lung cancer is only one of the conditions which are a result of tobacco smoking. I am not one of those who believe in banning things but I do think that this problem is of huge cost to the community. The previous legislation passed by this House dealt with grants to the States of some thousands of millions of dollars for hospitals and health care. A very high proportion of that care is connnected with the use of tobacco and the excessive use of alcohol. It is a huge cost to the community. It is a clear question of addiction so far as tobacco is concerned. I do think that some of the money which is being raised as a result of this legislation ought to be used to educate the community and to counteract the temptation, especially for young people, to smoke more and more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think most honourable members would agree, with the possible exception of those who are smokers, that there has been a significant drop in the use of cigarettes amongst what I would call the thinking portion of the population. Fewer and fewer people with certain educational standards who have thought about it are in fact smoking. But it is worrying that the total consumption of cigarettes is not going down, partly because their use has spread to younger people and to females. More and more females are smoking; more and more females are suffering the diseases which formerly were mainly confined to males. A greater proportion of females has such conditions as carcinoma of the lung and other things. </PARA>
<PARA> I think money should be used to advertise the adverse effects of the use of tobacco and alcohol. Although in this instance we are dealing specifically with tobacco, I think that such action should be taken in respect of both substances. Governments, of course, have been in some ways hypocritical. I am not referring to this Government but to governments as a whole. Large amounts of revenue from excise, sales tax and so on, are collected from the sale of tobacco and alcohol. I am sure that people who have looked at the question would agree with me that the cost to government and to the community is much greater than the amount of money collected. My party has a policy to forbid the advertising of tobacco products on television and radio. I have some reservations about that policy. I can see reasons for such a policy but I would very much prefer to see every advertisement by Peter Stuyvesant, Marlboro, or whatever glamorising the use of tobacco and every advertisement glamorising the use of beer, wine or whatever, counteracted by an advertisement showing the results of the use of those substances. If this were done I think that within a relatively short period we would see a significant decrease in the consumption of those substances. I think that such a requirement would be to the advantage of the population as a whole. People at least would be aware of the problems that are being caused. As I said, I think there is a lot of hypocrisy about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) mentioned a report on marihuana. Obviously there is a large amount of hypocrisy involved on the part of governments of all kinds when we condemn out of hand the use of marihuana and yet allow the use of tobacco and alcohol. Tobacco and alcohol undoubtedly do much greater harm to society. Yet people hold their hands up in horror and complain about any suggestion that the use of marihuana be legalised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not advocating the use of any drug which affects people's minds , any drug which becomes addictive in any sense, or any drug which has a mind altering quality. I suppose that alcohol is by far the leading drug used in this community. All of those drugs are bad. But I think it is quite hypocritical to go ahead and make statements about the danger involved in using one drug and not to do anything about other drugs, not even to run any strong campaigns against the use of tobacco and alcohol. I may be a wowser on those issues but I think that governments ought to look at the health bill. Indeed, they often talk about it. I am sure that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), who is at the table, was very concerned when he was Minister for Health about the continuing increase in the proportion of gross national product that goes to health. Yet one of the easiest and most clear-cut methods of reducing expenditure on health is to spend more money on education to discourage people from leading unhealthy life styles. I am sure the unhealthiest lifestyles of all from the point of view of cost to the community are the two I have mentioned-the excessive use of alcohol and the smoking of tobacco products. I urge the Government again to think about this point when it imposes charges on the tobacco industry. The best way to help Australia, the revenue and individuals in the community would be to spend much more money on educational programs to expose the dangers that follow the use of tobacco and alcohol.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are all too familiar with the measure that is now before the House, the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981 [No. 2]. The elements of this Bill first appeared in the omnibus Social Services Amendment Bill following the Budget and were rejected by this Parliament. They reappeared in the form of the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) which was likewise rejected by this Parliament. The same Bill appears before us this afternoon. It comes to us completely unchanged from the Bill rejected by this Parliament in November 1981 and its fate will be similar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill's objectives are primarily to deny the single rate of unemployment benefit to spouses of trade unionists involved in strike action, to spouses of unemployed persons denied benefits under the work test, to the spouses of those allegedly voluntarily unemployed or dismissed for alleged misconduct. In addition, this denial is extended to the special benefits provision so that spouses of those who would have received special benefits, if they failed on any of these conditions, will also not get them. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Bill comes completely unchanged despite an intense parliamentary debate over nearly four months. Substantial criticisms were delivered against this Bill-not just from the Australian Labor Party but from Australian Democrats senators and independent Senator Harradine. Yet not one jot or tittle of the Bill has been altered to meet any of the reasoned criticisms that have been directed against it. Indeed, the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) is virtually word for word the identical reiteration of the same tired old cliches used to justify this legislation twice already in this Parliament. I am pretty certain that on this occasion third time repetition will not be lucky. Basically this is anti-union legislation which seeks to use social security as a means of industrial discipline. The Minister has twice said, and his colleague elsewhere has also delivered exactly the same words:</PARA>
<PARA> We are not here concerned to discuss the merits of strike action as contrasted with other means open to employees in dispute with their employers to resolve these disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the legislation is concerned with the merits of strike action. It is concerned simply with condemning strike action out of hand, with penalising the wives and children of those involved in strike action on the basis that all strike action is wrong and that the use of any weapon is justified against the families of those involved in the strike. There was never any suggestion in any of the speeches made from the Government benches that in the inevitable conflict between capital and labour, capital might occasionally be wrong. It is always assumed in all these cases that it is those workers involved in industrial action who are wrong and, therefore, these penalties have to be taken against their families. So let us have none of this thrice repeated nonsense that this Bill is not concerned with the merits of strike action. For the Government all such action seems to be, according to the justification of this Bill, always and everywhere unmerited. The Minister told us:</PARA>
<PARA>What we are concerned with is how the cost of strike action is to be borne. </PARA>
<PARA>He was saying what the Bill is really about is how the cost of strike action is to be borne. The Government's concern on this point has been shown to be basically unfounded because the numbers involved and the amounts are minimal. The justification for persisting with the legislation in this way does not rest on a very large financial basis. Of course, the Government does make much of the $450,000 which was paid to those 475 wives and children during the prolonged 12 weeks strike at the Utah coal mine in central Queensland. Yet the real question that needs to be asked about that strike is exactly the merits of that industrial action. Why was such a great multinational company, which made a $ 160m profit in the very year of that industial action, able to reveal nothing but unmitigated intransigence in solving its industrial relations problems? They are the sorts of questions that need to be asked in relation to this legislation . </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is wasting this enormous amount of parliamentary time on a measure which saves a minimal amount of money in its overall social security bill, not because it is concerned with how the cost of strike action is to be borne. That is not the reason for this measure; that is not the reason the debate has continued for four months it is not the reason that this Bill has been shunted back and forth between the House and Senate. The Government is not concerned with what the Minister ostensibly says it is concerned with. The Government is desperate in its concern with how votes are to be won. Union bashing seems a cheap and easy, if rather irresponsible, way of getting those votes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the legislation in detail. This Bill is the culmination of a prolonged attack on the social security rights of those involved in strikes. It is not the first of these actions. Throughout the history of this government it has been whittling away social security rights in relation to those involved in strikes. Enormous legislative resources have been expended on this relatively small group in the community. First of all, the Government denied the unemployment benefit to actual strikers. Secondly, the unemployment benefit was denied to those who belonged to the same union and who were stood down as a result of strike action by that union even though the strike may have occurred in another industry and, in some cases, even in another State. Thirdly, last year the Government reduced the benefit to the spouses of these people involved in industrial action from the married rate down to the single rate. This Bill attempts to go the whole way and remove the single rate unemployment benefit from the spouses of those involved in strike action. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the situation which applies at the moment-that is, what this legislation aims finally to get rid of. First of all, the benefit which the Government aims to remove is the single rate benefit of $69.70 a week, plus $10 a week for each child. That is what the Government is striking at. It is not a family benefit because the spouses, usually the men, have already been dealt with. The Government is now primarily getting at the wives and children. The amount involved is the single rate benefit of $69.70 a week, plus $10 a week for each child. Moreover, no benefit is paid until seven days have passed after a person has registered for the unemployment benefit. So it will concern only those very few industrial actions which are prolonged for over a week. No benefit is paid at the moment unless the strike action extends over eight days. Of course, it is only paid then if the wife or the spouse has registered immediately. Moreover, usually no cheque is paid until two weeks after registration. So at best the strike needs to extend over more than seven days before any benefit at all is paid. In a strike lasting 10 days the spouse, if he or she had registered immediately, would get only three days' benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Even this marginal pittance paid under these quite strict conditions, which already exclude the spouses of most of those involved in industrial action, will now be removed in order to punish the spouses of those few involved in prolonged industrial action. In those prolonged industrial actions-whatever the rights and wrongs of the case as judged objectively-the workers have usually made fairly tough decisions because such actions involve long term costs for them if the strike runs over the period with which we are concerned in this Bill. It is true that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), the so-called human face of liberalism, has said:</PARA>
<PARA> If a person is precluded from receiving unemployment benefit and special benefit, in a case of extreme hardship and where there are no other means of support, his or her spouse may be eligible for special benefit at the single rate with additional benefit for children. </PARA>
<PARA>It is said that if this legislation does produce cases of extreme hardship these people may be eligible for special benefit. All of us are familiar with how the Department of Social Security applies the extreme hardship rules. As the Minister clearly pointed out, there have to be no other means of support-that is , resources such as savings have first to be whittled away, other resources have first to go before the extreme hardship principle can be applied. Basically what the Minister is saying-it is somewhat dressed up-is that if people are reduced to destitution then at least the Government will prevent them from starving. That is, after all their other resources have gone and they can no longer sustain themselves, at least the Government will prevent them from starving. Indeed, the Bill can be said to enshrine the latest of Liberal principles-family destitution as a system of industrial discipline. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is totally opposed to the principle embodied in this Bill-that of using the social security system as a weapon in industrial relations, as a means of imposing industrial discipline. We object fundamentally to that use of the social security system. We have a second fundamental objection in principle to this measure. The whole of the Australian social security system is based on the principle of individual entitlement qualified by spouse income. We have a basic system which entitles every individual to the social security benefits for which he or she has a claim. This is qualified only by spouse income. Yet the changes embodied in this Bill sweep that basic notion away because the Bill says that in particular cases this individual entitlement will no longer exist. It seems to me that this is a fundamental attack on the basic notion of our social security system which is that individuals are entitled to benefits. It is true, as I have said, that that is qualified by spouse income considerations. But in this case, where the spouse-the wife, or in a few cases it may be the husband-has, for whatever reason, no income, he or she will not be entitled to any benefit. This continues the change of a fundamental principle on which our social security system has been based. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the effects of this legislation, which strike mostly at women, it is in a very real sense sexist legislation. Why should the wives and children lose unemployment benefit because of the actions of their husbands and fathers? It is a particular view of the society which seeks to impose this penalty on wives and children. Can members of the House imagine the outcry that we would have from the Government benches if the Polish Government cut the food vouchers to families of striking workers? The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) would no doubt come in to the House and make one of those rare statements which can not be debated. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) would no doubt protest outside the Polish Embassy and the back benchers would be wrapped in paroxysms of concern for the wives of Polish workers if such action were taken. Yet this basic principle is being applied here. We are saying that because of the actions of workers their wives and children shall be penalised. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the benefits of Ministers recycling their speeches ad infinitum is that their hypocrisies catch up with them. A fine example of this occurred this week. On Tuesday the Prime Minister, in his address on the state of the nation, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We seek an increasingly compassionate society. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Transport who represents the Minister for Social Security in this House said on Wednesday:</PARA>
<PARA> The legislation, as it stands at the moment, permits a situation in which trade unions can choose to strike, knowing that through the operation of the social security system their members can be largely insulated-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the phrase 'largely insulated'-</PARA>
<PARA>from the financial effect of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at this insulation which is boasted about by this Minister in a compassionate government. For a family with one child the insulation is $79.70 a week. That is, a family of three is insulated against the effects of this action by living on less than $80 a week. The poverty line for a family where the head is not working, is $128.90 a week. So such a family is well below the poverty line. The insulation the Minister talks about-'largely insulated from the financial effects of their actions'-is a weekly income $50 below the poverty line. Of course that does not take into consideration delays in payment and the fact that the benefit will not even be paid in the first week of the strike action. This so-called insulation seems to be a word used only by people who live in very affluent circumstances, and who have never in their lives experienced these kinds of costs. Only the affluent could describe a family of three having to live on $80 a week as largely insulated from the financial effects of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, let me stress the miniscule numbers involved in the whole operation which makes the Government's behaviour in anything but political terms very difficult to understand. A very small proportion of strikes in this country go beyond five days. In 1980 only 9.9 per cent of strikers were involved in strikes of five or more working days and only 4.8 per cent of strikers were involved in strikes of 10 or more days. Overall, the proposed changes to the Social Services Act, in relation to the spouses of strikers, appear likely to affect less than 2 per cent of all the workers involved in industrial action. I have had to make a judgment because we do not get a precise seven-day figure but about 60,000 workers would be involved in disputes which extend over seven days. Of these 60, 000 workers roughly one third are single people and roughly one third have working wives and, therefore would not be able to claim unemployment benefit anyway. So we finish up with about 20,000 workers, or 500 to 600 families involved in disputes lasting more than a week. As I said, these are cases involving prolonged strikes where there is a real sense of grievance on the worker's side. On the whole, workers in this country do not embark on strikes of the nature we are now talking about unless they feel that they have strong and distinct grievances. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the point that the Government's legislation seems to ignore entirely the reality of industrial relations. It seems to assume that all strikes are unmerited. Basically, that is the justification for the legislation. Yet the causes of many of the disputes are directly attributable to management. An Australian Bureau of Statistics' survey in 1980 attributed the prime cause- not the only cause-of nearly 40 per cent of industrial disputes to managerial policies. In another 19.6 per cent of cases physical working conditions were the main cause. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that there are other causes as well. I agree with the Minister. All I am asking him to admit is that the assumption in this Bill that all strikes are unmerited is false. That is the basic assumption in this Bill. The wives of all strikers in any situation, no matter what the basis or cause of the strike, will be penalised by this Bill where the strike goes over a certain period. I wonder what sorts of sanctions might be thought of in relation to management. Of course, all the sanctions in this Bill are directed solely at one side of the struggle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me turn briefly to the other section of the Bill because the Bill is not simply concerned with punishing the spouses of workers who are involved in industrial action; it also denies unemployment benefit to workers dismissed for misconduct. Again, the notion of misconduct in the work place is, as we all know , an extremely dubious one. At least it is debatable. I think fair-minded honourable members on the other side will say that in many cases there can be a great debate about the dismissal of a particular worker for misconduct. Secondly , spouses of those who are voluntarily unemployed will also be denied unemployment benefit or special benefit. We have had long debates, both in this House and outside it, on the notion of voluntary unemployment. Thirdly, the spouses of those who fail the work test will be denied unemployment benefit. First of all let me say that all these categories are extremely dubious. They are debatable. In 1980-81 50 per cent of all the appeals against the denial of unemployment benefit were upheld, that is, 50 per cent of social security denials of unemployment benefit, which in many cases related to the issues I have just mentioned, were upheld as incorrect. In many cases spouses will be punished in error as a result of this legislation. If the average remains we can say that in roughly half the cases penalties will be imposed on people who do not deserve them. </PARA>
<PARA> The penalties already are peculiarly harsh for workers who are dismissed for misconduct, who are voluntarily unemployed or who fail the work test. First of all, there is a mandatory denial of benefit for six weeks and it is up to the discretion of the Department to extend that period to 12 weeks. Therefore, if the full period of suspension-the 12-week period-is exercised against an individual that means a fine of $600 for a single person and at least $1,000 for a married person. Already quite extreme penalties are imposed on people. As I pointed out in an earlier debate, they are often higher than those penalties imposed on drunken or dangerous drivers. Now this measure seeks to punish the wives and children as well. The Government is not content with the already quite high penalties which are imposed on people who are dismissed for misconduct, who are voluntarily unemployed or who fail the work test. It is not content with the quite severe sanctions which are already exercised against them. These penalties will now be extended to the wives and families of these individuals. Again, the numbers are fairly miniscule; something like 300 to 400 families a week are involved. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons we have opposed this legislation in this House and we will continue to oppose it in another place. We are confident that we will be supported by independents and other parties on this issue. We also believe and are quite confident about facing the people on this issue. Once the Bill is examined in its reality and once we put aside the shroud of anti-union rhetoric which has been used to defend it and which no doubt again today will be used to defend it, I think it will be found that this is a splendid piece of legislation on which to judge this Government's pretended commitment to a compassionate and more humane society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always good to hear the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) since he has a capacity to dress up an argument with some deceptively attractive characteristics and at the same time to avoid the essential nature of what is before the House. I want to address my remarks to that part of the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981 (No. 2) which deals with the payment of unemployment and special benefits to spouses of persons who are on strike. The question that that raises on the view put by this side of the House is: Who pays? The honourable member for Bonython called the legislation anti-union and sexist. The only thing he did not say was that there was some sort of conspiracy to intern the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us get back to the central question, and that is: Who should pay? We know what the present system is; there is no dispute about that. It is worth while recording one or two of the occasions in recent times when there have been prolonged strikes. The honourable member at one and the same time points out that the consequences of this Bill are miniscule and says that it is a means of imposing industrial discipline. That is a very interesting way of putting an argument because the one view conflicts with the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at two or three examples of recent industrial action. I take what was said in the Senate by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on 25 November 1981. He referred to a series of strikes in the period 1980 to 1981, which gives and indication of the amount of money which can be involved. Let me pick up the examples he gave. Firstly, he referred to a strike from June to September 1980 at Blackwater in Queensland. The reason for the strike was a dispute about the subsidised housing. Some 4,500 people in that town were on strike, 411 wives were granted unemployment benefit at a cost of $30,800 a week and 112 wives were granted special benefit at a cost of $8,400 a week. The total cost was $431,475. </PARA>
<PARA> The next example is a strike which occurred from 19 January 1981 to 19 March 1981 in Gladstone, Queensland. Some 177 people were on strike and 47 wives were granted unemployment benefits at a cost of $4,000 a week. As I note that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) has entered the chamber, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Earlier this afternoon the Opposition attempted to move a motion in this House to the effect that a senior Minister of the Government has been responsible for preventing any action being proceeded with against Nugan Hand. This Government, in co-operation with the New South Wales Government, has been determined to establish whether Nugan Hand was involved in any criminal activities, particularly drug trafficking. A joint Federal-New South Wales police task force was set up in 1979 by the two governments following recommendations by Mr Justice Williams and Mr Justice Woodward to inquire into matters which had been raised before the royal commissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Subsequently Mr Justice Woodward, the New South Wales Royal Commissioner into Drug Trafficking, recommended in his second report that the evidence concerning Nugan Hand should be referred to appropriate law enforcement groups for further investigations. Thus, on 26 August 1980 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) took the initiative of proposing to the Premier of New South Wales that the terms of reference of the Commonwealth-New South Wales joint task force be extended to enable it to investigate breaches by Nugan Hand of Commonwealth laws as well as all State laws. The Premier agreed. </PARA>
<PARA> I table the Prime Minister's letter of 26 August 1980 and the Premier's response of 28 August 1980. As well, I table a subsequent letter of 9 September 1980 from the Acting Prime Minister to the Premier. It will be seen from these letters that as well as suggesting the terms of reference should be widened to include Nugan Hand, the Prime Minister also offered to provide any assistance to the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission in its investigation of Nugan Hand. The joint task force is investigating whether there was any criminal activity, particularly drug related, in or affecting Australia by any persons connected with Nugan Hand activities and, if so, I will seek to identify such persons so that appropriate action can be initiated. These investigations are being conducted irrespective of what organisations such persons may or may not have belonged to. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the Nugan Hand liquidator has, with the assistance of the Commonwealth, approached American authorities for information. I am advised also that the joint task force has passed information through normal police channels to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for inquiries to the relevant American authorities including the Central Intelligence Agency. I emphasise that the police task force which is investigating Nugan Hand is a joint operation involving Federal and New South Wales police. It is managed by a committee chaired by the Premier's Department of New South Wales. There is close association including the exchange of information between the task force and the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) seriously suggesting that, given these circumstances, any Minister from this Government or the New South Wales Government could attempt to hinder, stop or delay this investigation without there being a public disclosure. It is clearly a silly and stupid proposition. A year ago to the day the Prime Minister, in this House, in response to questions by the Leader of the Opposition concerning Nugan Hand, invited the Leader of the Opposition to provide him with any information that he had that could help the joint task force. </PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, the Leader of the Opposition did not and has not produced any information. I call on the Leader of the Opposition again today to provide, firstly, any information that he may have on any Minister who has been involved in preventing the Nugan Hand investigation either from this Government or the New South Wales Government; and, secondly, any information that he may have that the joint task force is not operating properly. For this purpose an assistant commissioner from the Australian Federal Police is available in my office now to take any information that the Leader of the Opposition may have. I extend also to all members of this House and the Press Gallery the same invitation. Indeed, any member of the public with relevant information on Nugan Hand should provide it to the police. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-First of all we should get the decks cleared and understand accurately what was moved in this House this afternoon. There was a rather inelegant effort by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) to redirect the whole thrust of what was raised in the House this afternoon. One understands why. It it worth the effort. If it succeeds it will mean that rather than the Government being required to explain itself on a number of scores, the Opposition-and in particular me-will be put on the defensive. As I said, I suppose it is worth the effort, but it is altogether too clumsy to succeed. The implication of what the Minister said in his opening paragraph is simply this: That I effectively had accused a senior Minister of the Government of being responsible for preventing any action being proceeded with against the Nugan Hand organisation. A little later he asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) seriously suggesting that given these circumstances, any Minister from this Government or the New South Wales Government could attempt to hinder, stop or delay this investigation without there being a public disclosure?</PARA>
<PARA>I moved something which is vastly different. There are two parts to it. I moved in the first part that this House views with the greatest alarm certain public allegations which are of quite an extraordinary and disturbing nature because they are so serious. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister does not dispute that. It is reasonable to view those allegations with alarm. They were transmitted on a responsible media outlet- Channel 9-this morning. The second thing that I proposed in the motion was that the House requires-because that is one of the parliamentary forms, but another way of saying it is to say seeks, requests or invites; as it effectively was an invitation-the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) forthwith to respond and to assure the House that there is nothing in these allegations. Now I will not go into the detail of the motion. It is on the record. Essentially the precis that I gave is an accurate reflection of what was moved. Therefore, it is a nonsense for the Minister suddenly to stand up in the House and to suggest that the Opposition is making allegations. It is not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the Minister has not cleared it up. But let me go on. The Minister has come into the House with this statement and, in relation to the matters that I raised, has expressed his view. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is clearly a silly and stupid proposition. </PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate him. It has taken him 10 hours to arrive at this conclusion, because the news was transmitted this morning at about 7.30. The Minister's office collected a transcript of the allegations which were made from the relevant television channel and made no attempt at any stage in the House to clarify what he confessed here this afternoon are extraordinarily serious and damaging allegations. That was 10 hours ago. It is now three and a half hours since the matter was raised in this House. The Minister could have stood up then . The Government could have spoken and said: 'This is clearly silly and stupid. It is an untenable proposition for the following reasons'. It could have convinced everyone, but no, no, there was no opportunity for any rational explanation. When I raised the motion this afternoon I sought to make it clear that we certainly did not endorse the allegations. How could we? We had no evidence of them. But we were disturbed. At that point six and a half solid hours had elapsed between when the allegations were made--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And when they went on to the news. I am going on the transcript. It states that the news went out between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. on telecast national news this morning. So it is six and a half hours. The Minister cannot even do simple arithmetic. No wonder the country is in a mess. He is a senior Minister. It is another three and a half hours after that before the delayed time fuse goes off-bang, and the Minister gets an inspiration and says that it is silly and it is stupid. Conceivably it is, but it is also very serious. If it is so obviously silly and so abundantly stupid why could not the Minister have made the patently obvious comment and say it right away? Why did the Government seek to gag debate? No wonder this country is in a mess. A bomb goes off today and the Minister will wake up to it tomorrow. I will tell the Minister the sorts of things which were said this morning on television; the sorts of things that rattle my composure and the composure of people who viewed that program. The gentleman interviewed said that he resigned because of interference. I shall not delay greatly on that as it is in the transcript. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Well so far as the investigation is concerned my information is that a Minister of the Crown, a Federal Minister of the Crown, directed that no action of any overt nature take place in respect of the Nugan and Hand organisation. He didn't have any responsibility in the Narcotics Bureau portfolio I hasten to add. </PARA>
<PARA>The next question was:</PARA>
<PARA> What was the thrust of the information relating to Nugan Hand?</PARA>
<PARA>The reply was:</PARA>
<PARA> It related to heroin deals. It related to the laundering of money. </PARA>
<PARA>Later on he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Well the directive was-the brief or the file was to be a holding brief. In other words it was to be a benign enquiry where information was gathered but nothing acted on. </PARA>
<PARA>A later question was:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you think, or could that lead you to a conclusion that it was set up for that purpose?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA> I think that, from all the information that's been gathered, that's what it was highly entirely for. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting exactly from the text. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> For the laundering of money and for the marrying of the two organisations, the CIA and organised crime and various other people who wanted to launder their money. That's what it was all about. </PARA>
<PARA>The next question was:</PARA>
<PARA> How much do you know of a CIA connection with Nugan Hand?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA> Well this highly placed informant was within the Nugan and Hand organisation. The initial information was that one of the principals of Nugan and Hand was an ex-CIA operative, or current CIA operative connected with the CIA within the Nugan and Hand organisation. </PARA>
<PARA>He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Who was that?</PARA>
<PARA>The reply was:</PARA>
<PARA> I understand it was Michael Hand. </PARA>
<PARA>The person being interviewed went on:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to the evidence that the intelligence organisations are raising funds to finance various covert operations through the assistance of organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA>I think those are sufficient extracts. I refer merely to the allegations which have been made. I ask to have the transcript incorporated in Hansard as the Minister appears to dispute it. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>March 10, 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The following is a transcript from National News Today. It is given to you on the understanding that credit be given to the programme National News Today and/ or Channel Nine. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject: Business correspondence, Patrick Lindsay interviews ex Australian Narcotics Bureau investigator, Mr Joe Volkman. </PARA>
<PARA> To be telecast National News Today, 7 a.m.-8 a.m. Thursday, March 11, 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Embargo: Thursday, March 11th, 8.00 a.m. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: Joe Volkman was an investigator with the Australian Narcotics Bureau, but he left the Force. We asked him why. </PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: I resigned because myself and three other colleagues were subjected to a form of victimisation, vilification. We believe it was because we were gathering information on the Nugan and Hand organisation and I got to a point where I could take no more and I resigned. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: Who was responsible for this vilification?</PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: Well you can't single out any particular person. The problem was that various snippets of information were gathered from some very highly placed informants who had information on the Nugan and Hand organisation which was all channelled into the Narcotics Bureau as it was at the time and from there the information was delegated to a relatively junior officer who was in command of the file and it would seem that senior officers within the Narcotics Bureau in Sydney and in Canberra were responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: How high did it go?</PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: Well so far as the investigation is concerned my information is that a Minister of the Crown, a Federal Minister of the Crown, directed that no action of any overt nature take place in respect of the Nugan and Hand organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> He didn't have any responsibility in the Narcotics Bureau portfolio I hasten to add. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: What was the thrust of the information relating to Nugan Hand?</PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: It related to heroin deals. It related to the laundering of money. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: So the Narcotics Bureau's investigation had just been shelved. </PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: Well the directive was-the brief or the file was to be a holding brief . In other words it was to be a benign enquiry where information was gathered but nothing acted on. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: When did the activities of the Nugan Hand bank first come to your attention?</PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: My recollection is it was late 1976 or early 1977 that the information started to flow. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: But were they dealing before that?</PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: In the very early seventies, when Hand first arrived here and the Nugan Hand organisation was set up it seems that the information suggests that the deals started not long after it was set up. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: Do you think, or could that lead you to a conclusion that it was set up for that purpose?</PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: I think that, from all the information that's been gathered, that's what it was highly entirely for. For the laundering of money and for the marrying of the two organisations, the CIA and organised crime and various other people who wanted to launder their money. That's what it was all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: How much do you know of a CIA connection with Nugan Hand?</PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: Well this highly placed informant was within the Nugan and Hand organisation. The initial information was that one of the principals of Nugan and Hand was an ex-CIA operative, or current CIA operative, and there were other people connected with the CIA within the Nugan and Hand organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: Who was that?</PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: I understand it was Michael Hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: You're convinced a conspiracy of silence existed which prevented a proper investigation of the Nugan Hand bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: Well there has to be some reason for why this has suffered the course of events that it has suffered. I would point out that I have information in respect of the Nugan and Hand organisation to the Federal Royal Commission into Drugs, the Williams Commission, in the middle of 1978 and I gave information about laundering of money, the export of cannabis and various comings and goings of the Nugan and Hand organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay: This revelation that you're telling us about now throws a new light on Nugan's death because originally he was supposed to have killed himself because of financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Volkman: That's right. I think it's the only direct evidence we have of linking , if you like, between organised crime and intelligence organisations. It seems to the evidence that the intelligence organisations are raising funds to finance various covert operations through the assistance of organised crime. This suspicion was put up in respect of the Kennedy assassination in America. But here we have some direct evidence of this occurring. Here was the biggest thing in drug investigation this country had ever seen. I mean the only inference you can draw from the way it turned out is that it's Australia's watergate. </PARA>

I repeat, if the allegations which have been made, not by me but publicly, are clearly silly and stupid as a set of propositions, is there such a delayed time fuse on the intellectual mechanism of the Minister for Administrative Services that it takes 10 hours for a response to be made?

<PARA> An investigation into illegal dealings of the Nugan Hand Bank and other companies had been stopped by a high-ranking Customs officer in Canberra, a customs officers' union official said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>The gentleman referred to was Mr Spanswick. I do not know him. I have never come across him. The article reports him as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Members of my association had gathered enough evidence to conduct a full investigation of the Nugan Hand Bank when they were ordered to stop', he said.</PARA>
<PARA> 'If these investigations had gone ahead we could have exposed these illegal dealings years ago. But now that they have come out this year, what do we have but a dead body, a collapsed bank, a missing principal and millions of dollars vanished'. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> He had had discussions with the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Garland, but had not reached any agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I was disgusted with his attitude as all he was trying to do was fob the whole issue off', he said. </PARA>
<PARA>People cannot be blamed for being disturbed when they see those sorts of reports , bluntly declared, publicly committed by these people. Let us look at Nugan Hand and the reason for concern. Bernard Morris Houghton, an intelligence operative of the United States, is a man who apparently has entry to and exit from this country without the necessity for a visa. He arrived in 1972 without a visa. What did he recommend so that he could get into the country? He recommended that the appropriate authorities at the port of entry contact the head of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. That was done. He was allowed in. Edmund Wilson was able to move in and out of this country in spite of being of quite unsavoury character. He is an intelligence operative of the worst type, in the worst areas of intelligence operations and reputedly tied up with the United States naval intelligence. He has been in and out of this country several times and he is an associate of Houghton, a man allegedly involved in quite questionable commercial transactions which could only undermine administrations in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the file on Nugan Hand which is held by the Federal Bureau of Investigation? That file, under the American Freedom of Information Act, is accessible but large areas of it are completely blocked out on the grounds of national intelligence requirements. I ask the Minister not to stand up and give a declaration but to give us some hard facts on this because I understand that the police task force was impeded by the Fraser Government in its frequent requests for support to obtain access to the intelligence portions of the FBI file. These are some of the facts that need to be tested. The Minister has said- -</PARA>

I said: 'How can you be convinced by just asking them?' They got very angry in the end, and they desisted. I am telling the House the facts. I am embarrassed somewhat by relating this but I am very unhappy that that is the level of intensive investigation in this matter. The Minister might be satisfied with the rather flimsy, rather threadbare bit of paper he has put before the House this afternoon, his rather thin efforts to try to turn the tables as it were and put me on the defensive, but the facts are that the allegations have been made publicly. They have been heard, I presume, by that portion of the New South Wales community that viewed the program I referred to and also by the rest of Australia if it was transmitted elsewhere. The Minister knew about it. The usual form in this House is to come in and make a personal explanation to clear the record on such a serious allegation, such a damaging allegation, but he did no such thing. It took six and a half hours before the matter was even raised in the Parliament and another two and a half hours or three and a half hours for him to think about it. It took 10 hours to get the Minister mobile. It takes an awful lot of cranking up to get his magneto sparking. I reject the whole flimsy approach of the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the interruption to this debate I had given two examples of strikes during which social security payments had been made. Let me give a third example. In Broken Hill, from 18 February 1981 to 15 March 1981, 2,000 to 2,500 people were on strike and 1,167 wives claimed the unemployment benefit at a cost of $99,195 a week. Special benefit of $340 a week was also granted. This made a total cost of $369,274. In those three examples, we have a total sum of over $800,000. There is a very simple equation: Cause and effect. What takes place is that there is a strike, an application for social security benefit is made and the benefit is granted. We might remember that in those three examples we are talking about sections of the community which are certainly not the worst off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said that the proposed legislation is anti-unionist, that it is union bashing legislation. Let us spend one or two minutes examining the nature of a strike. We all know what it is but let us look at the decision to strike. Who makes it? The decision to strike is an act of free choice and is taken by a union or by union members to achieve one aim, and only one aim; that is, to advance what those engaged in the strike action judge to be their own interests. No other interests come into it. It is the ultimate industrial weapon and the weapon that has become all the more powerful as advancing technologies increase the power of the few over the many. </PARA>
<PARA> How is the strike weapon used? First of all, there is the classic method which is directed against an employer. That is obvious enough and it has been around for many years. Of course, sometimes the strike affects those who are not directly in the firing line but who happen to become involved. I refer to those people affected by the results of strikes because they find themselves, as sometimes happens on the waterfront, involved in events which do not concern them and over which they have no control. The second way in which the strike weapon is used is to bring social pressure to bear, and to bring it to bear in a way which is designed to try to induce a quick settlement. What is a classic example of that? A very striking example has been provided in New South Wales. It has been provided in the last 24 hours. Australian Associated Press reports that a 24-hour strike by 3,000 members of two associations has been so serious that the New South Wales Minister has alerted the Army that if the strike continues the Army could be needed. What has happened as a result of this strike ? Volunteers have had to go into hospitals to look after geriatric patients. There we have a weapon used which is known to affect directly and harshly people who are mentally ill or suffering from diseases of age. </PARA>
<PARA> The third way in which a strike can affect people, and affect people very broadly and generally, is by the sort of strike that is produced in the area of transport, the result of which is that men, women, small and large businessmen, who have nothing to do with or any reason to be involved in the strike, are directly and sometimes grievously affected by it. For those matters the Opposition professes no concern at all nor will it. It will pay some lip service to the consequences but it will say that there is an inalienable right to strike and to be funded when on strike. If we look at some of the examples of the widespread effects, we find them in transport strikes and in wharf strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country, one of the problems that we face, and will continue to face, is the consequences of strikes that affect our overseas trade. Such strikes have given us a reputation as an unreliable supplier and will affect the long term trading reputation of this country. When that long term reputation is affected, the long term consequences for the country are grim unless we can recover the reputation that we would like to have. It is well known-it will be known to honourable members on the Opposition benches-that the Japanese view of the Australian industrial relations scene is such that Japan is seeking to diversify its reliance from Australia, from which it takes the majority of its raw material inputs for industry, to other countries. Why? It is because of the reputation we have earned, and, as the honourable member for Wills will know, we undoubtedly merit because of the actions which have taken place on the waterfront. We are a trading nation and, unless we trade and trade with Japan, the consequences will be felt by us all. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spent one or two minutes on the effects of strikes for the purpose of looking at this question: The need clearly to understand the costs of strikes. It is a cost which is ultimately borne by the entire community. Why should the community as a whole subsidise strikes? Effectively, that is what takes place if a payment goes to a family or to a spouse rather than to the person who is on strike. There is, in fact, no difference at all in effect. Why should the community as a whole provide economic support for those who strike, those who freely, deliberately and in pursuit of their self-interest, take industrial action against others and who frequently take such action regardless of any consequences to others, regardless on occasion of the cost to members of the community-indeed, it is sad to say, frequently regardless of that cost-and also regardless of the real suffering and hardship that strikes may inflict on others . </PARA>
<PARA> Does anybody in this House think that the strike that has taken place in the psychiatric hospitals in New South Wales is not a strike which inflicts severe hardship on others? If that strike were to go on for such a period as would allow the spouses of those on strike to be entitled to unemployment benefit under the Act, does anybody think that that would be a just result? Does anybody think that the kind of assistance that would be provided would be right, and that society should make that payment? I suspect that the answer that will be given at some stage in the evening will be to speak of hardship. Unquestionably, when people are on strike those involved suffer. Unquestionably, there are times when the members of the family of the person who is on strike will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three answers which need to be looked at. First of all, there is provision under the Act to provide payment in cases where there is real hardship . Secondly, whose decision is it to strike in the first place? It is the decision of the man, the woman or the union that goes out on strike. Thirdly, where does the balance of hardship lie? Does it lie with the community at large or does it lie with the individual who makes the decision or the union that makes the decision and does it in the interest of one thing and one thing only; that is, the pursuit of self-interest with no regard whatsoever for the consequences to the community?</PARA>
<PARA> Those who would oppose the legislation put forward would have to embrace this proposition: No matter what the consequences, no matter how arbitrary, capricious or bloody-minded and no matter what the cost, there is a group in this country that is entitled to special treatment and to a kind of support system against the consequences of its actions. Who else gets this sort of treatment in our society?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting I had said that in the case of a conflict between sectional and perceived interests it would be a rare occasion indeed when the Opposition would depart from those interests which support it. I do not say that it does not happen but I most certainly say that it would be a rare occasion. What are we looking at here? It has been put by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) that this legislation is an exercise in family destitution-a most curious argument since, as I have pointed out, he went on to say that in any event the sums involved were only minimal. As I understood him, he said that every individual was entitled to go on strike. Nobody is disputing that, but we each of us have to accept the consequences of what we do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue to which I have directed my remarks is as to whether the social security system should be available to persons to buttress them against the consequences of their own actions. The right to strike is an exercise in individual free will, for the advancement of a point of view that the individual or the union regards as being in that person's or in that union's self-interest- not for any social self-interest. The question then is whether in any way at all the exercising of that decision should be financed by recourse to the social security system. It is by recourse to that system that the three cases to which I have referred the House could be said to provide vivid examples of the way in which, shortly after strike action takes place, a large number of spouses apply for unemployment benefit. If these were genuine applications it would be one thing, but I doubt that anybody in this House would claim that they were genuinely made on behalf of people who were seeking work for the purpose of going on to full time employment. They were lodged simply for the purposes of providing more for the family income, therefore putting the family in a better position to ride through strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn the coin around and take the case of a lock-out by a small family enterprise. It might say to its unionised staff: 'We are going to lock you out; you cannot come here to work. We will lock you out until you come to an agreement with us as to the terms and conditions under which you should be employed'. In those circumstances, would anybody in this House say that the owners of the business, or their spouses, would be entitled to seek unemployment benefit? Of course not; that would be arrant nonsense; it would be absurd. The reason is that that would be seeking from the taxpayer a subsidy against the consequences of their individual actions. Similarly, under this legislation we are concerned with the obverse side of the coin, the case in which unionists seek, through the medium of their spouses, to provide for themselves a financial buttress against the consequences of their own actions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is one of the most despicable pieces of legislation ever to come before this Parliament. My very informed friend, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) in an excellent speech on this occasion, as on an earlier occasion, has outlined the arguments which sustain that proposition. Essentially, what the legislation seeks is to use the wives and the children of workers who have chosen to exercise what is regarded as one of the characteristics of a free society-that is, the right to strike-as an instrument to try to prevent their exercising that right. The capacity for any honourable member to digest this despicable piece of legislation is not made easier by the defence which has just been advanced by the honourable member for North Sydney ( Mr Spender) being as he is, a member of one of the tightest, most highly organised, closed shop unions in the world. In other words, he is a Queen's Counsel, a member of a union which does not have to worry about going on strike to determine what its income shall be. It determines what that miserable income will be-some $1,000 a day or more-and also that no one shall have right of entry to membership except under certain conditions which it also determines. I will spend no more time than that on the remarks made by the honourable member for North Sydney. His hypocrisy condemns him out of his own mouth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is labouring under the delusion that, with this piece of legislation, he is giving himself the second tool to go to the people on a double dissolution. I find it difficult at the best of times to follow the mind of the Prime Minister of this country, but in these circumstances I find it absolutely impossible. I understand that he thinks it good politics that his first tool shall be the fact that this Parliament has rejected his betrayal of a promise that he would not increase indirect taxation; that he proposes using as a tool the fact that his breaking of that promise has been frustrated by the Parliament. Apparently, he proposes to go to the people of Australia and say: 'Dear electors, I want you to return me because this awful Parliament, the combination of the Labor Party and the Democrats, will not allow me to impose additional indirect taxes on you'. That is a sign of his intelligence, but he now says that the second weapon in his armoury will be that he wants the people of Australia to say that they will endorse a proposal under which he will use the wives and the children of men and women who exercise their right to strike. He will say: 'I want to condemn them and want you to endorse me in that action'. All I can say on behalf of the Opposition is that we trust that the Prime Minister will summon up the courage, particularly after the defeats that he is about to suffer in the Lowe by-election and in the Victorian State election, to go to the people on a double dissolution with those two weapons in his armoury. We welcome it and challenge him to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the facts. The situation is that, of course, the right to strike has been brought into issue. As I have had cause to say previously, there is a marvellous difference between the perspective of the Prime Minister and this Government on this issue of the right to strike when they look at the situation in Poland, and their perspective when they look at the situation inside their own country. They have the clearest perspective, the clearest vision, that it is right that people in Poland should be able to organise freely in unions and, within such organisation, exercise the right to strike; that the Communist state should not be arrayed against them to prevent them from exercising that right. However, when it comes to the situation in this country the Government will use any piece of punitive legislation it can to try to deny or impede the exercising of that right. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Parliament recently I have had cause to refer to what must be a highly reputable source within conservative circles as to the fatuity of the recourse to such punitive legislation as this. I refer, of course, to a statement made in these precincts, at the Premiers Conference in August last year, by Sir Charles Court. It is appropriate, given the diabolical nature of this legislation, that we should recall the actual words used by Sir Charles Court in talking about resorting to punitive legislation to try to deal with an industrial relations situation. I repeat to the House the words used in these precincts last August by Sir Charles Court. At page 22 of the confidential transcript of the Premiers Conference he said:</PARA>
<PARA> After looking at the matter very closely, I am convinced that there is no set of rules which we can devise which will improve the situation if we cannot change the attitudes of people involved in the system. You can lay down the most diabolical rules, the most diabolical laws, and attempt to implement them; but if you do not have a spirit of co-operation in the matter nothing will work. </PARA>
<PARA> He returned to this point two pages later, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I come back to where I started: No system, no matter how clever the law or how diabolical it might be, will achieve a result if there is not goodwill on the part of everybody. </PARA>
<PARA>If there is an appropriate word to describe this legislation, it is the word ' diabolical'. Two grounds are proposed by the Government in purported justification of the legislation. There are the industrial relations grounds and of course there are the grounds that some people are ripping off the system. I will examine each of those two grounds. Honourable members opposite can bray as much as they like; they will not divert me. Let us look at the industrial relations ground. In respect of industrial relations I suggest that what I have quoted from Sir Charles Court makes the point that by passing diabolical laws we will not make people behave better. I preface anything else I have to say on this matter by repeating unequivocally to this House, in the context of this debate, what I have had cause to say before-that the trade unions of this country and individual members of individual trade unions make mistakes. They do at times make wrong decisions. they do at times undertake industrial action which I believe they should not undertake. But having said that, I repeat that we do not exhaust our intellectual responsibility in analysing these issues. We have to understand that in these issues fault simply does not lie on one side. </PARA>
<PARA> So it does not remain on the records here as merely the member for Wills making that assertion, I refer to the facts in respect of the analysis of fault situations. One example to which I can go immediately is in relation to the Loy Yang area, an area which has not been absent from the minds of the Prime Minister and this Government. I refer the House to what happened just last month in that area in regard to an industrial dispute. Over a period of some three years in the construction of what is known as the Big W station a set of safety procedures were worked out. They were arrived at in co-operation between the trade unions and the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. Those procedures in which the responsibility lay with the employer were then transferred into the building of the Loy Yang station. </PARA>
<PARA> On 12 February there was an accident in which a man fell a very considerable distance and injured himself very badly, suffering two broken vertebrae and broken arms. The safety hooter which was supposed to be sounded in these cicumstances was not working. No safety procedure was available and this man suffered untold agony for some time. The company was given seven days to bring the situation up to scratch. Within eight days another accident happened, on 20 February, when a man fell, breaking an arm and ribs. The hooter on this occasion was working but the loudspeaker was not. Those who wanted to rescue the man had no access to him. A crane had to be brought in and a box had to be built. In those circumstances the men refused to work for two days. They said that the employer had had three years; the responsibility had been put on the employer but the employer had not carried out that responsibility and the lives and limbs of workers were in danger. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances the responsibility in this matter was crystal clear. It was not the fault of the worker and it was not the fault of the trade union; it was accepted to be the fault of the employer and in the event the employer paid all the wages of all those men who withdrew their labour for two days because there was a clear recognition that it was right, that the men and women involved in that situation should have withdrawn their labour. Whilst the responsibility was sheeted home where it should have been on that occasion, what would this Government have done in that situation had the strike gone on longer? It would have punished the wives and the children of those workers who properly had exercised their right to withdraw their labour when the employer had demonstrably been at fault. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a recent circumstance right in the heart of an area which this Government looks to. But do not let us rely simply on that. Let us look at what some academic writers dispassionately studying this area have had to say. I quote from an article by Clifford Donn, who was at the time a lecturer in economics at Macquarie University. In the Australian newspaper of 18 January 1977, on the question of the responsibility for strikes, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Some managers, politicians and journalists blame 'militant' unions for precipitating frequent strikes which are said to be damaging because they are unpredictable. In fact, strikes are often not nearly as difficult for managers to predict as is commonly believed. Many strikes are precipitated by unilateral management action which affects wages and working conditions. Often, workers and their representatives are not informed of such actions until the last minute. When unions are consulted it is usually after all the major decisions affecting the employees have already been taken. The management simply gives an order and expects it to be obeyed. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an asymmetry in the relationship between management and its employees: management can unilaterally make decisions affecting work conditions and insist that employees accept those decisions; employees can make no such unilateral changes. They can only resist the employer's decision by striking. For employers to pose in this situation, as they often do,-</PARA>
<PARA>And as their spokesmen do, I interpolate-</PARA>
<PARA>as the innocent victims of power-hungry militant unions is hypocritical nonsense . </PARA>
<PARA>I quote from the Australian of 2 December of the same year, 1977, under the heading 'Unionists not at fault in strikes, says consultant'. The article states :</PARA>
<PARA> At least 80 per cent of Australia's strikes and industrial unrest can be blamed directly on management and not unionists, a management consultant said this week . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr John Hood, who is in charge of the human resources department of PA Management Consultants Pty Ltd in Melbourne, said many strikes were caused by lack of communication. </PARA>
<PARA> Senior and middle management were not getting down to the shop floor. 'It's a ' 'them and us'' situation, and it's quite wrong', he said. </PARA>
<PARA>There are two totally independent analyses which confirm the point I have been making. Let us look at the statistics, the figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on industrial disputes in this country. For the last year for which an analysis of causes has been put forward, 1980, we find that 23 per cent of days lost are attributable to managerial policy and, in respect of the actual number of disputes, 39.7 per cent are attributed statistically to managerial policy. There we have it in the aggregate, there we have it in the theoretical analysis, and there, at Loy Yang, we have seen just in the last few weeks an illustration of what I have been talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we find when we look at this first ground of industrial relations? We find that it is the greatest load of hypocritical nonsense for the Government to delude itself that it has properly analysed the situation simply by saying that when there is a strike it is the fault of the striker, because the evidence from the SEC in Victoria just a few weeks ago is that the men were entitled to go on strike because the management had seriously repudiated its responsibility for the industrial safety of the workers on the site. So much had it done that that it paid fully for the days lost by strike. There was a recognition of the fact that the workers were right. But what does this Government say in this situation ? It has introduced a piece of legislation which says in respect of a situation where the workers are justified: 'We, this compassionate Government, will make the wives and children of these people, who are justifiably withdrawing their labour, suffer'. Is there little reason that I say that this is one of the most despicable pieces of legislation to be brought into this chamber?</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the second ground advanced by the Government to support its legislation. It is that these people, the wives and the children of strikers, are engaged in a rip-off of the community. It is so convinced that these people are ripping off the community that it rushed in to pass this legislation. What a load of hypocrisy on the part of this Government! This Government has had since 18 December a report from a royal commissioner saying that the Income Tax Assessment Act should be amended so that the powers of the royal commission to pursue tax evaders in this community, assisted in their scheming by members of the profession followed by the honourable member for North Sydney, are increased . The royal commissioner needs this power to pursue not just people who are ripping off the community for a few hundred thousand dollars but people who are ripping off this community for billions of dollars. The Government has had that report since 18 December. Has it rushed off to frame legislation in terms of what the commissioner has asked? Of course it has not. Three months have now gone and the Government has refused to bring in the legislation for which the commissioner has asked. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just look at what the royal commissioner has had to say about those people who are ripping off the community with the assistance of members of the legal profession. This is what the royal commissioner has to say about that. I will read again to the House what he had to say in paragraph 2.01 of his report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's investigations into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers' Union has led it, to the surprise of many, to the tax avoidance industry. This industry has developed in Australia, particularly over the last five years, at a rate far in excess of any other industry and has brought with it profits comparable only to the heady days of the Victorian gold rush. Unfortunately this industry carried with it a serious detriment to the interests of government and the Australian community. The detriment was two-fold: in the first place it diverted from the Treasury tax which would prima facie be payable on income of taxpayers; in the second place it diverted the tax payable by those engaged in that industry. The amounts involved are very large indeed, amounting to many hundreds of millions of dollars per year or more . . . It has introduced into the community a class of people, almost invariably the highest earners, who pay little or no tax and make no contribution in that way as citizens to their fair share of community costs. </PARA>
<PARA>He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition it has made more difficult for government the task of providing for the community as a whole a more equitable and reduced taxation burden. </PARA>
<PARA>In the few minutes that are left let me share with honourable members what the commissioner revealed in the transcript of the way in which members of the profession of the honourable member for North Sydney have aided and abetted these schemes which are costing the community billions of dollars. Let us see what they have done. I refer to page 5756 of the transcript of the royal commission on 3 December. This is what the commissioner said after it had been revealed that the lawyers and accountants sit down and arrange their scheme in a way in which within a matter of five minutes they do a deal which costs billions of dollars. They sit down and just swap money, steal from one company and give to another. They pass money on in a way that costs us billions of dollars. What did the commissioner say in respect of that? What did he say about the lawyers who facilitate this practice? This is what he had to say:</PARA>
<PARA> What would be the position if a man who was a very good driver was offered a job by two other men: his job was to drive those men, say, to the CBA at Blacktown in a car and his instructions were to sit outside the bank with the engine running while these two men-who coincidentally had masks on and guns in their hands, and he said, I do not want to know what you are doing in there and please do not tell me, and what is more I have taken senior counsel's advice that I am not to know what you are doing. Is he relieved of liability for being an accessory to that fact. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we have. We have members of the legal profession and taxation profession in this country aiding and abetting these schemes. They are ripping off billions of dollars. We have a royal commissioner saying to this Government: 'Change the law so I can smash this industry'. There is no legislation for this purpose yet the Government will bring in legislation to attack the wives and children of people exercising their right in a democratic community. This is the height of hypocrisy. The Government will be judged accordingly by the community if it ever summons up the guts to go to the people. </PARA>

He used the word 'diabolical' on many occasions. I want to remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker-and you probably do not need reminding-that in 1948, during the time of the Chifley Labor Government, a special sub-committee headed by Mr Chifley and including the late Dr Evatt and the then Minister for Social Security, Mr McKenna, advised, following consideration of this subject: 'that all unions represented at the conference in Sydney accepted the principle that the Commonwealth could not permit unemployment benefits to be used for financing strikes'. That was only 34 years ago! Tonight we have heard words such as 'diabolical' and 'the most despicable piece of legislation to ever come before the Parliament'. How honourable members opposite have changed! There is one thing that the Opposition is doing to Australia today that it did when it was in government between 1973 and 1975. It changed this legislation to enable a lot of these things to happen. Oh, the honourable member can sit there like a harpist.

One of the problems with this country today is that there is always a group of people prepared to stand up and justify why something should continue to exist. Opposition speakers in this debate this afternoon, in a previous debate on this subject some weeks ago and in the other chamber have tried to portray this Government as proposing this legislation simply as an election gimmick on which to go to the people. I suggest to all members of the Parliament that if the case they are presenting here in support of the retention of this provision is as strong as they would like us and the Australian public to believe, there is no way in the world that they would carry on with the speeches to which we have been subjected from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills talked emotionally about women and children. This is always a good tactic. We always get back to the women and children. The fact is that the decision whether or not to strike is made by the worker in the house. My background is not like that of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Speaker) who, because of his accomplished legal background, was denigrated by the honourable member for Wills. I was on the Australian waterfront as an industrial officer in the 1960s. I know what strikes are like. I know how some people are hurt when the decision is made to go out.

That is all the honourable member has done in this debate. He has oversimplified the matter. He tried to talk simply about women and children. He has dismissed the fact that provisions exist and provisions will be maintained under special benefits to look after those people who are unfairly and unduly hurt and who are put into a position of suffering as a result of this legislation. Listening to the honourable member for Wills, one would think that the only people who ever suffer setbacks as a result of strikes are those who make the decision to go on strike.

Strikes can absolutely cripple small business and they can smash big business. What is more-this is what he does not seem to understand- when an industry goes out on strike it can have effects so far down the line that people whom we do not even think of, who are unseen and unheard, can also suffer. People employed in other businesses which are completely unrelated to the cause which is being pursued also can be destroyed and crippled.

For too long now we have been prepared to go along with namby-pamby machines and simply say: 'We might hurt somebody and we cannot take it back'. As I have said, a unionist who has $25,000 in his bank account is able now, by the existing legislation, to dip into the taxpayer's pocket. I repeat that for the family which has nothing, provisions exist in this legislation to continue assistance so that that family is not reduced to the state that the honourable member for Wills tried to portray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for North Sydney referred before the suspension of the sitting for dinner to the actual costs involved. Compared with a national budget of $40 billion and social security costs of $11 billion perhaps about $2m in not much money. But it is the principle involved which matters. I do not know how members of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine can stand up, shake their heads and say: 'You cannot take this back from the people'. I will go into a little more history for the benefit of honourable members opposite. It was only the changes to legislation made by the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) in 1973 which brought this current situation upon us now. He was the man who in 1973 lacked the foresight to see what his alterations to legislation would cause. Now he is trying to offer himself as the alternative Prime Minister of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Before beginning my speech I was asked to speak for only 10 minutes in order to allow other speakers to speak, as the debate on this legislation is to finish at 9 o'clock to allow other legislation to come on. I sum up my remarks on this Bill by saying that we are debating a proposition whereby the Government is stating to the people of Australia that, if somebody is suffering dire consequences as a result of industrial action, provisions exist to support them and assist them through that situation. </PARA>

That is what it is all about. If Labor speakers believe, to use words of the honourable member for Wills, that this is the most despicable and diabolical piece of legislation ever to come before the Parliament, it is time they went back into the history a little and noted the attitude of Chifley and Evatt and people such as that towards legislation of this kind. All the Opposition is doing is trying to grandstand, politic and rip at the hearts of people. There is nothing to what the Opposition is saying. It is trying to rip at people's hearts in emotional argument without foundation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech given by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) is indicative of the type of paranoia which exists in the Government ranks about strikes. The Government has an unreasoned approach to industrial relations. The type of outburst which we have just heard is one of the reasons that 40.2 per cent of strikes in 1981 were caused by managerial irresponsibility. When one looks at the honourable member for Fadden, who would claim to be a spokesman for the employer class, there can be no doubt that the figure was 40.2 per cent. In fact, it makes one wonder why 90.2 per cent of strikes were not caused by the inflammatory attitude of people such as the honourable member for Fadden. As I have said, Government members are obsessed with strikes and strikers. They have lost their reason and their ability to deal with industrial relations. They have reached the stage where they can no longer cope and are willing to bring legislation into this Parliament which will strike out at women and children. That is the depth to which they have sunk in their attempts to handle the industrial relations system in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 18 November 1981 I was very proud to join in the debate on the Social Services Amendment Bill (No. 3) when it first came before this Parliament. Unfortunately that legislation was passed by this House but it was successfully defeated in the Senate. I have no doubt that after the Government passes this legislation on to the Senate again this evening this Bill will be struck out once again. The Government will show its loss of reason by attempting to have an early election on whether one can beat women and children over the head because the husband or the breadwinner in the family might be in a position where he cannot work. As evidenced in the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and the explanatory notes he has issued with this Bill, the Government has taken a dishonest and a disgraceful approach to this matter. In both the second reading speech and the explanatory notes the Minister referred to the application of this renewed industrial action. In fact, the Minister and the Government know that to be blatantly not true. This legislation will militate against those people involved in lockouts and those people who, for no reason of their own, are involved in industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of examples have been brought forward by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). The most specific example which comes to mind is a circumstance in the car industry-an industry which is spread right throughout Australia-in which because of a decision taken by workers in one plant workers in another plant may be stood down. For example, when the workers at the Broadmeadows plant of the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd went on strike, workers in New South Wales were stood down. They had no vote in whether the Broadmeadows workers went on strike; they had no chance to change the attitude of the workers at Broadmeadows. Nevertheless, they were stood down and under this legislation their wives and children would have been deprived of any sustenance. The Minister for Transport in his second reading speech said that strikers make the decision to strike against the rest of the community. I think I have pointed out quite clearly that the people employed by Ford in New South Wales had absolutely no chance at all of affecting the strike that occurred at Broadmeadows. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has perverted the definition of the word 'strike'. In this legislation-this is made clear in the Minister's speech, in the speech of the honourable member for Fadden and in the speech of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender)-the Government has attempted to whip up an emotional climate of hostility towards people who are engaged in industrial action and more particularly against their families. It is important to note the situation in Australia in regard to strikes. According to figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the first six months in 1981, which are the latest figures issued on industrial disputes in Australia, 64.7 per cent of disputes lasted two days or less. Only 7.5 per cent of disputes lasted more than 10 days. To me those figures do not indicate a country which is wracked by massive industrial unrest. In fact, Australia seems to have a fairly reasonable industrial record. In those six months only 10 per cent were involved in any industrial action that lasted 10 days or more. </PARA>
<PARA> It is more informative to look at the reasons given for a number of strikes. As I said earlier, 40.2 per cent of strikes were caused by what the ABS classified as managerial problems and 19.2 per cent were caused by what the ABS classified as working conditions, the majority of which were safety conditions and things such as that. Only 24.9 per cent of the strikes in that period were caused by wage disputation. Less than a quarter of the strikes were over wage disputation. Nearly half the strikes were caused by managerial incompetence. That suggests to me that rather than the Government bringing in legislation against women and children it should be bringing some proper industrial legislation into this country which will attempt to educate management in circumstances that will allow it to be less inflammatory than some Government members have been in this debate this evening. </PARA>

The honourable member would not know what industrial relations was unless it involved going to some local government conference in Perth where he was surcharged by his own council. He is a man with a great record of negotiation! I think the most important thing that we have to look at in considering this legislation is how much it will save the Government. The Minister has not said at any time that this legislation will save millions, tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars. I put it to the Parliament tonight that this legislation would save only thousands of dollars. The best example that the Minister could come up with in his second reading speech was one isolated instance where $40,000 was involved. Honourable members can bet their lives that if there were any other intances the Minister would give us a whole schedule of how many millions of dollars this legislation would save. Quite frankly, it will save the Government peanuts. It is a method of beating trade unionists over the head and making an attack upon them and their children. It is typical of the type of action of this Government. It is all too keen to attack those who are least able to defend themselves; it is all too keen to attack the disadvantaged in this country. The Government's attacks on child care, pensioners and migrants have been outlined quite frequently in this Parliament in the last few weeks. This legislation is just another attack on women and children, the most disadvantaged group of people in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The people that I am most concerned will be affected by this legislation are the many migrants who live in my electorate. They are people who have recently come to Australia and are in the most fragile economic circumstances of any people in the country. They are trying to make a new living in Australia and are battling to find work and some way to exist. Sometimes they get involved in industrial disputes in the rather large manufacturing industries in my electorate, but they have no control over them because they started interstate and the employers have closed the plant down. Migrants do not understand why they cannot get some relief from the Government; they do not understand why this Government is trying to attack them in their attempts to make new lives for themselves in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important to look at this Government's stand as compared with that of governments in the rest of the world. I think it is quite fair and proper to contrast the actions of this Government with the approach of the communist Government in Poland. It is absolutely no different in its approach to trade unionists and their families. The approach of this Government in the repression of workers and workers' rights parallels very much what the military regime in Poland started to do in the last 12 months. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why this Government has absolutely no intention of debating in this Parliament the situation in Poland. On one hand the Government bleats. The present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) and his colleagues in the National Country Party are the ones who say every day how the trade unionists are trying to bring the country down. They say: 'We have to do something about them. We must have penal clauses in legislation to gaol them. We must have clauses in legislation to drive their wives and children into poverty'. They say that what the trade unionists are doing is terrible. But on the other hand the same spokesmen for the Government say: 'Isn't it terrific that the workers in Poland are going to bring the Government down?' It makes one realise that the split personality of the honourable member for Fadden is very much indicative of the double standard the the Government has in regard to most issues. I am quite happy, as are other members of the Opposition, to stand here tonight and support the wives and children of trade unionists and attempt to get them a fair go from this Government. We are more than happy to fight any election that the Government may try to win on this Bill. I have no doubt that when the Australian people are asked about their attitude to this Government and its attacks on the disadvantaged, women, children and pensioners, they will resoundly adopt the position of the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been heartily disappointed by the contributions that have been made to this debate by members of the Opposition. What the Opposition has not told us is that the legislation that presently exists is unique in the world. No other country in the world where people, of their own free will, decide to go on strike pays benefits to their families from the social welfare budget. That provision is unique to this country; it does not exist anywhere else in the world. That measure was brought in by a previous Labor Government, headed by Mr Whitlam. No doubt it was brought in to pacify the supporters of the Australian Labor Party in the union movement. In no way can it be justified as a measure that should be supported by the Australian people. The ALP is asking the Australian taxpayer to pay for those people who by their own determination want to go on strike. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), in his contribution to this debate, tried to tell us that his measure was designed to prevent strikes. It has nothing whatever to do with preventing strikes. Anybody in this country who wants to withdraw his labour has a perfectly legitimate right to do so. The real question is: Who pays? The Opposition wants the Australian taxpayer to pay the costs of those people who, of their own free will, want to go on strike. If they want to go on strike, that is their decision, and it is their constitutional right to do so. But if they do they must also expect to accept the obligations that go along with that decision and not to have them picked up by the taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the interjection by the honourable member for Wills. In his contribution to the debate he referred to the situation at Loy Yang. He tried to have the Australian people believe that all strikes were about safety conditions . He did not make one mention of people who strike for more money. Honourable members opposite have to accept the balanced situation; they have to accept both sides of the equation. Some people go on strike in order to get more money and then want the taxpayer to support them while they are on strike. If people go on strike and indulge in industrial action in order to help their own financial situations they cannot expect other workers who continue in their occupations and who pay their taxes legitimately to support them while they are on strike. That is a totally unfair and unreasonable expectation. That is the way in which Australian people will see the situation, and rightly so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point I make in the brief time available to me is that we must remember at all times that the money that is paid in benefits to the wives of striking workers is paid out of the social welfare budget. That reduces the amount of money that is available to those people who genuinely need help through the social welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition would have us take away money from these people who genuinely need to be supported by social welfare. Opposition members cannot have it both ways. They will say that they will pay out of the social welfare budget people who go on strike to try to get more money for themselves and to have more money in the bank and to be better off. At the same time the Opposition will say to the elderly and disabled people in this country that it cannot give them all the support they need because it has to pay union members who are on strike. I do not believe that the Australian people will wear that. I am surprised that a party which claims to be genuinely concerned about the disadvantaged people in our society supports such a measure. I challenge members of the Opposition, if they share that genuine concern for the disabled and needy in our society, not to support the point of view they have proposed and in fact to vote with the Government on this measure. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also surprised at the protestations that have been made by the Australian Democrats in another place. They too try to wear their hearts on their sleeves and claim to be concerned about the needy people in our society. They, too, are adopting exactly the same stance as the members of the Opposition in this place. It is my view that if the Australian Democrats in another place want to carry the burden of their own decisions they will have to think very carefully about how they will vote when this legislation reaches the other chamber. If they decide that they will not vote with the Government on this legislation they must carry the odium and responsibility for that decision. They cannot have it both ways. What the Democrats are doing is taking money away from the genuine needy and giving it to the greedy. That is what it boils down to, and that is what members of the Opposition in this place are all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I am disappointed that I do not have more time to speak tonight. I would have liked to make some other points but in order to give other members an opportunity to speak I will conclude my remarks. With the points I have tried to make very briefly I hope I have urged all members in this House to support the Government on this legislation. I urge members of the Opposition to show their concern for the needy and the genuine taxpayers and also to support the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before us tonight should be seen very clearly for what it is: It is a blatant and clumsy attempt by the Government to bludgeon unionists into submission by causing as much personal hardship as possible. Why is this legislation coming forward? It is coming forward simply because the Government thinks it can win votes by bashing unionists and their families. The Government hopes, by this tactic, to take away the attention of the electorate from the real problems of this community. The effect that seven years of Fraser Government has had on the Australian family can be seen in terms of interest rates, taxation policies, inflation, health insurance policy and the declining value of the pension. That is the real effect that the Fraser Government has had on Australia. The Government is attempting to disguise that effect by bashing unionists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation not only attempts to misuse the Social Services Act but also represents a fundamental abuse of the rights of a significant group of Australian citizens. The provisions of this Bill refuse payment of unemployment benefit to the spouses of those who fail the work test or those on strike even though the spouses in their own right qualify for that benefit: Even though the spouses qualify in their own right the benefit will not be paid to them. That is what this legislation is all about. Clearly, the legislation is totally insupportable. The Government cannot unilaterally deprive one section of the community of its rights in this way and expect to maintain the respect of the Australian community. The Australian community cannot and will not support this piece of legislation which attempts to achieve an industrial relations advantage by hurting the innocent parties affected by dispute through no fault of their own. Newspaper editorials support this view. I will quote from some of them. The Age comments:</PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment benefits should be regarded as a right for people jobless through no fault of their own. They are not a privilege and they most certainly are not a plaything for politicians. </PARA>
<PARA>We have seen tonight members of the Government using this issue as a plaything for themselves to try to divert attention from the real issues in this community . the Canberra Times reports the proposals in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a threat to the right of freedom of opinion, a denial of justice to taxpayers, and a perversion of the conventional definition of what constitutes unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for the reception these proposals will receive in society at large. The hypocrisy of the Government in this matter is all too clear. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) in introducing this legislation made no mention of the effect it would have on the children or the spouses of striking unionists. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A Government member has referred to a very important issue which I think highlights what this Government is all about. On the one hand, it brings in legislation which attacks children but, on the other hand, this morning in this Parliament the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) said that to protect the interests of children he had to implement the provisions of the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act in the Australian Capital Territory. That is having an incredibly divisive effect on this community, and it shows the hypocritical attitude of this Government. We see this in its handling of industrial relations issues. Its one policy is to attack unionists; this legislation attacks the children and the wives of unionists. What the Government does is deliberately provocative and contributes nothing towards stable industrial relations in this country. That is what members of the Opposition are aiming for and what the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) was talking about when he spoke in the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have constructive views; this Government does not. The situation in the Capital Territory today demonstrated this. I will prove that to the House tonight. The Australian Capital Territory has had rolling strikes by members of the Australian Teachers Federation, which action did not have universal support amongst its members; I acknowledge that. It did not have the total support of the Australian Capital Territory Council of Parents and Citizens Associations. What happened after 300 teachers were stood down under the CE(EP) legislation? There is now a unanimous support from the teachers. That action has brought them together and made them more determined. Half an hour ago I received a telex from the Australian Capital Territory Council of Parents and Citizens Associations. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The ACT Council of Parents and Citizens Associations deplores the application of the CEEP Act in the present industrial dispute involving ACT teachers in government schools and calls for the immediate rescinding of the directive to the Chief Education Officer to stand down teachers. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask Government members to listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA> This highly controversial and divisive legislation is inappropriate to a local school system where children are inevitably the victims of actions by any parties to aggravate or prolong industrial tension. Applying the CEEP Act will have damaging effects on the ACT schools system long after the present dispute has been settled. </PARA>
<PARA>But this is the action of this Government. That is what it wants; to provoke industrial reaction. It wants to destroy the whole industrial foundation of this country. It has no plan; it is purely provocative. This legislation before us tonight is a part of that attempt to provoke unionists. The Social Services Amendment Bill should be seen for what it is; a political ploy to try to beef up the Government's tarnished image in the community and to draw attention away from its disastrous mismanagement of the economy. My Labor colleagues on this side of the House and I hope that in the future the Government will concentrate on the development of effective social policies which provide maximum assistance to the most needy in our society and effective industrial relations policies which promote constructive and equitable means for the settlement of disputes, not the sort of legislation we have before us tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hesitated to enter into this debate because it is obvious that the Government has no business of any substance before the House and we are merely accommodating the Government at this point. But in case it should be thought that the Opposition ran away from this debate I take up the cudgels and point out that many of the speakers on this side of the House spoke previously when this proposition came before us. To date the Government has in no way given any justification for its proposition. Some of the speeches made tonight by honourable members on the Government side were quite deplorable. Clearly the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) has shown his lack of concern for the women and children of workers. His attitude, in seeking to take away assistance for supporting mothers, is well recorded and well established. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), with his constant interjections, is well known by this side of the House as being clearly on record as saying that he does not support the right to strike. I hope that he challenges me on that, but he had better check his Hansard before he does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The debate really should come down to a level where there can be reason on the merits of the issue. I refer to a report of some substance that was brought down by the South Australian Liberal Government. This report was written by Mr Frank Cawthorne, who was appointed by the Tonkin Government in November 1980 to review independently the South Australian Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Mr Cawthorne was President of the Industrial Relations Society of South Australia from 1978 to 1980 and wrote a special handbook for industrial advocates. Clearly it is not one that the honourable member for Fadden has read. Mr Cawthorne was previously the industrial research officer for the Public Service Board and industrial advocate for the South Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the Metal Industries Association of South Australia. I suggest that the gentleman has credentials that cannot be disputed. </PARA>
<PARA> In that lengthy report dealing with industrial relations Mr Cawthorne rejected some of the major industrial reforms proposed by the Liberal Party in South Australia and the policy on which the Tonkin Government was elected in 1979. The proposals he rejected included compulsory pre-strike secret ballots, cooling off periods and the use of sanctions generally in industrial disputes. I suggest that this attempt by the Government is just one of those things; a sanction against the trade union movement. The Cawthorne report rejects other sanctions proposed by the Liberal Party, including legislative codes of conduct, a requirement for unions to pay a monetary bond as a precondition to the granting of additional wages or benefits and heavy fines for unionists who strike during the life of their award. They were all rejected by Mr Cawthorne. Several other recommendations by Mr Cawthorne would reverse the thrust of both State and Federal government industrial policies in some areas. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is no need for an industrial ombudsman to protect individuals' rights. </PARA>
<PARA>He recommended that an existing limitation on the Industrial Commission's power to award full preference to unionists be removed from the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the tribunal be permitted to grant preference at the point of engagement and on termination of employment. That is in a report by someone appointed by a Liberal Government in South Australia and goes to the heart of some of the sanctimonious Bills that this Government tries to bring in to try further to subject the trade union movement. But the Government in another place has said that it is not concerned with the merits of strike action; it is concerned with the costs of strike action. Let us take that question of costs and see how dinkum this Government is on costs to the economy and to the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has been in power for too long. Its record in industrial relations is shocking but its record in industrial health and safety is abominable. More than 1,000 Australian workers are killed in the workshop every year. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) finds that humorous. I will repeat it . More than 1,000 Australian workers are killed at work every year. More than 300,000 Australian workers are injured at work each year. In 1979 the total cost of industrial accidents was estimated to be nearly $4 billion. The Government has said that it is concerned about costs and about the economy. What has it done about health and safety in the workshops?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing. Who could ever feel that this Government was genuine? It uses the industrial field as it treated the social welfare field when it kicked around the pensioners, when the pensioners became a political football. Now it is the workers in this country, both in the cities and in the rural areas, who suffer and who are used as political footballs by this Government. If we want to talk about this issue rationally I suggest that the Government should put forth people who have worked in the industrial field, the front men, those who have been up front dealing with industrial disputes and who know what they are about. I would have respect for Government members with those credentials. But if they do not know what they are talking about I suggest they shut up. In particular I suggest that the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) should shut up when it comes to industrial relations matters. He said: 'No one denies the workers' right to strike'. I suggest that is nothing but a pious platitude. Could it be that that same honourable member is speaking for his legal fraternity, the industrial mercenaries, the vultures of industrial relations, the only people who make a cop out of industrial disputes? Employers lose, workers lose; the only people who make anything are the industrial mercenaries, the lawyers. Their organisation would be the greatest closed shop in Australia, as is well known, and the doctors would be runners up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me refer again to the article on the Cawthorne report and mention a couple of points that he made about industrial mercenaries. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'There is no legal magic wand whereby industrial troubles can be whisked away', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'A significant step in industrial relations will be taken once it is generally accepted that given the nature of our society some conflict is inevitable, that there are no simple legislative or other answers to industrial conflict, that not all conflict is going to be resolved without resort to industrial action ( and indeed that not all industrial action is necessarily a bad thing), and that good industrial relations cannot be achieved through confrontation backed by the law. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the industrial mercenaries. </PARA>
<PARA> In my previous position I dealt for 12 years with industrial officers who were the front men in industrial disputes. I respected them because they were trying to achieve what most union officials were likewise trying to achieve but not at the sacrifice of their responsibilities to their members. Kinds of disputes need to be mentioned. Firstly, there needs to be a recognition that trade unions are a proper and legitimate part of the industrial scene in Australia. They are not renegades. They are not something that has been imported from Moscow. They are very much a part of the industrial scene, very much a part of the Australian scene. They are associations registered under the Acts of the parliaments of Australia. They have a role to fulfil in the industrial scene, a role that is recognised by fair-minded people of Australia. The traditions of the trade union movement within Australia are respected by honest Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The function of a union is to assist workers in maintaining and improving the standards of their working lives. Because of the very nature of the role and function of trade unions they are in an adversary position with the employer. This Government seeks to destroy the effectiveness of the trade union movement in its legitimate role to maintain and improve living standards. This attack, on the wives and children in most cases of workers, is aimed at destroying the workers' legitimate and legally recognised association of trade unions. I do not think that the Australian people will fall for this humbug that this Government is putting up. I am sure that the Australian people believe in trade unions, believe they are part of Australia and believe they need to be protected against the kind of vultures that we see in the industrial field, in the legal system and on the Government benches. </PARA>

The suggestion was made that I misappropriated money in terms of a trip to Perth from Carnarvon which on that occasion cost $ 176. The Shire of Carnarvon, in open session, voted that I, as president of the Country Shire Councils Association of Western Australia, should have my fare to Perth paid so that I could attend as the president of a meeting of some 200 to 300 delegates of local government. At a later time the auditor raised the point that the Local Government Act in Western Australia provides for attendance at that conference of only two delgates and two observers. He said that the shire had no right to authorise the payment of the fare although it had so decided and the ticket had been ordered by the Shire Clerk. I might add that any suggestion of foul play on my part must be a reflection on that Shire Clerk, a working person. In fact that person ordered a ticket on the instructions of the council and the auditor suggested there was no provision in the Local Government Act to do so. Consequently a letter was sent to me by the auditor, not by the council, asking me to repay that money. I put it quite clearly that I have refused to do so. My reason for speaking tonight is not that I worry too much about the money but that the problem will arise in Western Australia when some day a truck driver in Wyndham will aspire to be the president of the Country Shire Councils Association-and he will probably also be a member of the Transport Workers Union of Australia-and he will be confronted with the provisions in the present Local Government Act which will mean he will have to find $500 out of his own pocket for the purpose of--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was mentioning, in this debate the Government is telescoping three major statements by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) into one shortened debate. What we are talking about here is a massive expenditure by the Government on defence. We are not arguing about the expenditure on defence but we are talking about something of the order of $3,000 worth of equipment and this House is not having an adequate opportunity to discuss this expenditure by the Government. The Government has a very poor record, as all members of this House will recognise, in informing the House of its thinking behind its defence expenditures. The Parliament, and particularly the committees of the Parliament, have had great difficulty in trying to get the necessary information on the very significant issue of defence on which to base an intelligent debate in this House. That is as it may be. It has been characteristic of the Government for many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to draw to the attention of the House a comment that I made some years ago, in fact in October 1976 just prior to the release of the Government's White Paper on defence. At that time I pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> There are already signs that the future defence debate in Australia may degenerate into a political auction over equipment. Just as rhetoric does not constitute a defence policy, neither does a shopping basket full of assorted military goodies. The purchases must be related to total defence requirements and not to individual services' isolated bids. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on in that article, which was published in the Pacific Defence Reporter, to point out that announcements of equipment decisions should explain their rationale. I was very interested to note that the British Government, in its recent White Paper on defence, which foreshadowed the disposition of HMS Invincible, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We have done this in terms of real defence output-the roles our forces undertake and how they should in future be carried out-and not in terms of organisation. It is increasingly essential that we tackle the business of defence this way and manage it in terms of total capability rather than service shares. </PARA>
<PARA>That kind of approach is foreign to this Government, which continues to approve single Service bids in the vain hope that they will add up to a defence policy. It is for this reason that I, on behalf of the Opposition, move the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> Delete all words after 'That' and substitute in their place-</PARA>
<PARA> this House requests that as a matter of urgency the joint parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence consider and report on-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the relevance of an aircraft carrier to Australia's current and perceived strategic environment;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the role of an aircraft carrier in the defence force structure of Australia ;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the effects of the purchase of an aircraft carrier on the future defence procurement program;</PARA>
<PARA>and that the Committee be requested to report to this Parliament on this matter not later than 1 September 1982, unless an extension of this date is approved by the House. </PARA>
<PARA>That amendment will be seconded by the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) who will speak to the motion next. </PARA>
<PARA> I have pointed out already that the Minister's statements on both the FA18 and the acquisition of the aircraft carrier are singularly deficient in providing a rationale for the purchase. No attempt was made to consider other options in performing the ascribed anti-submarine warfare role of the carrier. First, one should ask: Do we need a seaborne air platform for this task at all? One of the purposes of the FA18, as described by the Minister, is long range maritime interdiction. The P3Cs-that is, the Orion aircraft-are being equipped with Harpoon missiles. We still have the F111s for reconnaissance and they can be fitted for anti-shipping and anti-submarine warfare. These are the kinds of considerations that are not discussed either in the statement by the Minister on the FA18 or in that by the Minister on the acquisition of the Invincible. We can look at the whole question in a new light. Let me make one point: Australia itself is an aircraft carrier. It ranges the two oceans of our immediate concern -the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Where is there in any of the Government 's statements a consideration of the option of using land-based aircraft as distinct from a handful of helicopters on a seaborne platform which has, on all expert advice, very limited capacity? It is outside the realms of reality for any navy, let alone the Royal Australian Navy, to patrol effectively Australia's long sea lines of communication which cross the Indian and Pacific Oceans. No navy in the world, not even the United States Navy, would be capable of undertaking that responsibility. But there are focal points where hostile submarines are likely to operate and these can be protected because they are close to our shores. For that reason the use of land-based aircraft is an option that should be considered but it has not been taken up by the Minister or by the Government in either the debates in this House or the statements that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the consideration of role and performance there is in the Minister's statement no attempt to relate the purchase to Australia's current or perceived strategic environment. That is precisely why we have placed such a term of reference in the amendment which we propose. Not only is there no statement relating to Australia's current or perceived strategic environment; the Minister also absolves the purchase from any rationale at all. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no single scenario or contingency for which this ship is being acquired. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a curious statement and a damning indictment of the manner in which the Government approaches defence. The Government is attached to a replacement syndrome-that is, replacing one item of equipment with a similar item. As the Minister no doubt would readily admit, that does not require much intellectual effort but it does detract from our total defence effort. The purchase of the aircraft carrier is a splendid example of this Government's penchant for fighting the last war. We all know and agree that the ship is cheap; but are we- I ask this question very seriously-to behave like a tourist in Hong Kong who goes broke trying to save money? The Minister, evidently to his own satisfaction , dismisses in a few lines the very real crticisms that have been raised by members of the Government-certainly in the Senate-of the vulnerability of carriers in modern warfare conditions. We know that no decision has yet been made as to whether the ship will retain the Sea Dart air defence missile system. Even with the Sea Dart there are grave doubts that the Invincible is capable of defending herself against missiles, submarines, aircraft and other surface craft . We know also that the ship will not have any vertical short take-off and landing aircraft of the Harrier type. The Minister has already indicated that. With the United States version of the Sea Harrier, the AV8B, which is currently valued at something in the order of $20m each, there is a reasonable doubt that we will ever see such an aircraft aboard the Invincible. A carrier that is so defenceless will require a large escort of destroyers, frigates and land-based aircraft cover. This type of deployment will distort not only our naval force structure but also at the same time our total defence structure. It makes a nonsense of the whole Government justification of the purchase. I have been invited to talk about justification. I will quote what the vendor of the Invincible had to say about the product that he was selling. We have been talking about the vulnerability of the Invincible. On 23 February 1982 in the House of Commons, the Secretary of State for Defence, Mr Nott, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot afford to deploy the air defence and anti-submarine escorts that would be necessary to protect the carrier . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If the mother of navies, the British Navy, is in a position to say that, what would a much smaller navy such as Australia's be in a position to do? Mr Nott went on to say-it should be underlined in Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> I don't believe any Government would order a carrier today. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement was made by the person who was selling the carrier. The Australian Government has accepted the carrier at a cheap price, but nothing is cheap when the whole concept will distort not only the naval force structure of Australia but also its whole defence structure. It is for these reasons that we propose that the matter go to the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, the Defence Sub-committee of which is currently undertaking a review of the Australian Defence Force structure. It is a very appropriate group of members of the Australian Parliament to consider a matter that has been dealt with by this Government very lightly. </PARA>
<PARA> I want in the time available to me to take up a point that follows from a question that I put on notice to the Minister for Defence some four months ago and to which I have just received a reply. It is in relation to the United States production of the FA18 aircraft. There are very real doubts about not only the production volume of the FA18s but also their production rate. The Minister indicated in his statement on the FA18s that he realised there was a risk. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The chief risk appears to be the possibility of reduction in the production rate in the early years of the program, thus increasing production cost. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only is there a very real doubt about the production rate but also there is a very real doubt about the production volume. The Minister, in his reply to my question, said that the target for the United States Navy was some 1,366 aircraft. The fact is that the total already has been reduced by 300 because the United States Marine Corps has purchased the Sea Harrier version of the AV8B aircraft. The Pentagon deducted those aircraft from the bid by the United States Navy for its 1,366 aircraft. So, it is already 300 down in terms of volume. When we come to the question of the production rate, the last figure I can find is that the United States Navy will take only 534 aircraft in the fiscal years 1983 to 1987. That figure is 233 fewer aircraft than were planned in 1980 for the same period. So not only is the production volume down but also the production rate is down. This means only one thing-that the unit cost to the Australian Government will increase. I would very much appreciate having the Minister's response to these comments. I think that the end result will be a significant increase in the presently estimated price of $21.5m for each aircraft. I predict that before delivery the cost will rise to at least $25m in 1981 prices, which is the basis for the pricing of $21.5m. We are going to be caught because already there has been a reduction in the volume and there will be further reductions in the rate of production. This will bring about a heavy increase in the unit cost of the FA18. </PARA>
<PARA> I again ask the House to support the amendment because this Parliament needs the facts, the information on which it can make a decision particularly about the Invincible. It is one of the more curious decisions that have been made by this Government. I think that on both sides of the House there has been a lot of concern about the purchase. The only way to clear this up is to have a full investigation by the appropriate committee of this Parliament, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendment. None of us can vouch for the accuracy of the report which appeared in the Weekend Australian which purported to be a summary of a paper on the Defence Department's latest strategic guidelines on policy and equipment. According to the report there is no relationship between the Department's contemporary strategic thinking and the most recent of the Government's purchases, the Invincible. As I have said, I cannot vouch for the report as I am not privy to the documents. I can say that every point outlined conforms to every bit of public official evidence I have heard and read as a member of the Defence Sub-committee of this Parliament's Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary, it establishes five priorities as the considerations which should govern our strategic doctrine, force structure and procurement. They are: Firstly, intelligence collection and surveillance of areas of approach to our southern regions; secondly, a strike capacity as a deterring influence and for strategic operations; thirdly, a capacity to combat air and sea borne operations against widely dispersed targets in northern Australia; fourthly, air defence of Australian forces, facilities, population and industrial centres particularly in the north; and, fifthly, the need for highly mobile ground forces to defend a wide range of geographically dispersed civil and military facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the report it is alleged that our defence officials identify the north as our primary area of strategic concern and stress the need for competent air defence. Nowhere is there featured a requirement for an additional anti- submarine warfare capability, yet this was the justification of both the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) for the purchase of the aircraft carrier. In other words, what will be the focal point of our Navy, in large measure the determinant of the nature and priority of future naval equipment purchases, is unrelated to any strategic objective that the Government's advisers see as essential. It is unrelated to any likely threat that they can foresee to the security of this country and is worthless in the areas that they define as of most importance in planning the defence of this nation. I do not believe governments need to agree with their advisers. There are some positions adopted by the Department both in evidence to the Committee and in this leaked set of documents with which I do not agree. For example, I do not agree with the proposition that we should focus our planning exclusively or substantially on the most immediate level of threat, which is essentially one of low level harassment and limited lodgment. I believe effective deterrence is to determine the maximum level of threat that Australia would be capable of deterring from within its own resources and to structure our defence base accordingly. On the way to achieving this objective we will pick up a capability to deter lesser levels of threat. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there are dangers in the current approach of the Department. They are these: Firstly, in circumstances where limited resources are available concentration on the most immediate threat might well produce imbalances in our Defence Force which will be difficult to remedy in a crisis of greater magnitude than anticipated. For example, with a correct emphasis on our maritime strike capability, we might nevertheless neglect the importance to our deterrent capacity of a sufficiently mobile and capable ground force. Such a force would increase substantially the forces necessary for a successful invasion of this country. Such a force would increase substantially the forces necessary for a successful invasion of this country. Secondly, such a concentration again might well cause us to neglect important aspects of our defence infrastructure; for example, aids to communications such as appropriately located roads and railways , dispersed facilities for military operations and self-sufficiency in productive capabilities. The closure of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory is a betrayal of those obligations. Similar considerations ought to apply to Williamstown. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, concentration on immediate low level threats gives too much latitude for state of the art purchases with the risk that important capabilities which quantity at the expense of some quality might provide. In regard to the purchase of the FA18s such attitudes may well have caused us to rule out too early the desirability of a mix of aircraft, such as some FA18s and some others cheaper but able to be purchased in larger numbers. The purchase of such highly expensive items might also set back the purchase of AWAC aircraft and other aids to the effective air defence of this country. It does not matter much if we consider the risks to be low but there is a problem if our calculation is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA> These leaks are indicative of a deep disturbance in the Defence Department. They signal a fear that the Government has made a decision which will have consequences that are highly damaging to our defence capability. The article that appeared in the Weekend Australian is not the only indication of a degree of concern within the Defence Department. I draw the attention of honourable members to an article which appeared in the Pacific Defence Reporter of August 1981 which, according to the editor, was from two officers senior in the Service . It presents an excellent argument against the purchase of the aircraft carrier . I seek leave to have that article incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THE CASE AGAINST THE CARRIER</PARA>
<PARA> The article on 'The new carrier and the TFF' in the June issue of PDR was read with much interest. One of our staff officers has drafted a reply to Mr Grazebrook. We hope that it will promote some discussion on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> This was the opening sentence in a letter written by two highly responsible officers in two of the Services to PDR. To protect the writers, and the author of the paper, we have refrained from publishing their names.-Editor</PARA>
<PARA> With decisions on both the TTF and carrier still not finalised, the article by A. W. Grazebrook in the June PDR was most timely. Unfortunately the article contained a disappointing combination of fact, half truth, unsubstaniated assumption and innuendo which robbed it of the impact its timing should have assured. The random scatter of this unfortunate mix has produced an article that demands comment but almost defies step-by-step analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> Our current maritime force structure contains, or will soon contain, three assets with a stand-off capability to sink ships at sea. These assets are: those naval escorts to be Harpoon-fitted, the Oberon submarine and the Harpoon-fitted P3 Orions. Each of these assets has capabilities that suit it to particular situations about which the following generalisations can be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Conventional submarines lack mobility and must be in the right place at the right time. However, when in the right place, submarines have the unmatched combination of highly-sensitive passive sensors, covertness of manoeuvre, and high capability weapons that enable them to consistently attack ships from outside the range of ship's sensors. This proven capability gives them the ability to sink specific units whether a group, or a number of units either grouped or singularly. Dollar for dollar, a submarine in the right place is the most efficient asset available for sinking ships (or submarines) at sea. </PARA>
<PARA> The P3 Orion has outstanding mobility that gives it the ability to carry out a single-handed surveillance and attack mission throughout a large area. Weapons load is limited but a number of aircraft in co-ordinated operation overcome this limitation. Its chief disadvantage is the inability to always distinguish specific targets among medium and high densities of shipping when forced to operate outside the range of modern surface-to-air missiles. </PARA>
<PARA> Surface ships need assistance in over-the-horizon targetting and reconnaissance and are themselves vulnerable to cruise missile attack. They can, however, carry a large number of missiles and maintain a continuous presence for protracted periods (provided they are part of a properly structured force). </PARA>
<PARA> Overall our existing maritime strike assets are all capable of various degrees of autonomous operation, are complementary, and when fully optimised, possessed of a considerable maritime strike capability. </PARA>
<PARA> Except in the simplest of scenarios, aircraft such as the F-18 or F-111s are not capable of autonomous maritime strike operations. </PARA>
<PARA> The often protracted nature of pre-strike reconnaissance and the extra problems then presented by strike direction suggest that the involvement of existing assets would necessarily be at such a level that these assets could mount a sizeable attack by carrying and firing their own weapons. In short, except in the simplest circumstances, such aircraft are weapons carriage and delivery platforms only and as such could probably only usefully contribute when all the other assets, necessarily in the area, had fired their not inconsiderable number of weapons. The usefulness of such capability obviously depends on individual threat scenarious, but the substantial potential of existing assets suggests that this area is well covered, and that supporters of the TFF as a maritime strike asset seem to have jumped on the Harpoon wagon and tailored their threat to meet their potential assets. </PARA>
<PARA> In modern warfare the cruise missile and the submarine launched torpedo both represent a serious threat to naval surface units. Indeed when such a threat appears, albeit from a single submarine or cruise missile platform, naval surface units seldom even transit except as a group. Twenty-five years ago ships were judged by their individual capability against a submarine: 15 years ago the judgment was based on performance as one of a pair; now they sail in groups and aim to detect submarines in time to avoid them. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, ships seldom hunt submarines. Kill capability as a design aim is a thing of the past: today's criterion is survivability when one of a group, surrounded by other ships and supported by helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and (sometimes) friendly submarines. Submarines killed by the group are killed in self defence: even groups of ships don't go out hunting submarines. </PARA>
<PARA> When the 500-knot skimmer cruise missile is added to the submarine threat we have today's multi-threat environment. Ship's anti-aircraft missile systems are generally regarded as most effective against all types of manned aircraft and preparation for an ''iron bombs'' attack on a modern force would sensibly include some white scarfs for the briefings. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not so for cruise missiles which fly very low, have a very small radar cross-section, can be launched in salvos and home actively. To counter this threat Close In Weapons Systems (CIWS) such as Phalanx have been developed, and while trials prove that such systems can reduce the effect of cruise missiles they add to the already vast and complex array of defensive system ships have been forced to fit to achieve a reasonable survivability quotient. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the ascendency of the submarine and the cruise missile over the naval surface ship, much naval surface posture has become defensive, with avoidance of conflict and survivability foremost in the criteria of design philosophy and tactics. To wrest the initiative and maintain the naval surface units status as the ultimate across-water power projection tool, those powers with the assets, such as the USN, have attack Carrier Battle Groups (CVBG). These battle groups are based on a huge carrier with AEW and fighter assets to counter the air launched cruise missile or bomber threat and a full spectrum of ASW assets to counter the cruise missile and attack submarines. Every avenue in the multi-threat situation is covered and in the majority of cases a battle group can look after itself and still have significant capability to project power. Like the gorilla whose master replied ''wherever he likes'', to the question ''where does the pet gorilla sleep?'' the battle group is a very powerful force that can go just about where it likes. Nevertheless, to project power as they do, such groups must devote vast resources to survivability, with 24-hours a day AEW, ASW and CAP air effort and similar efforts by surface units.</PARA>
<PARA> Only with a force as big as a CVBG can part of the effort be directed away from survivability to capability. The self-defence air effort, for instance, must be maintained 24-hours a day and show a surplus before air assets can be used in power projection. Survivability, when it involves the destruction of the enemy, is of course also capability. However, the point here is that to just break even against the combined submarine and cruise missile threat posed by only a relatively few submarines and missile delivery platforms requires something approaching a CVBG, and to convert survivability into offensive capability can take full CVBG performance. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a limit to how far a battle group can be scaled down and retain these qualities. Anything less than 24-hours a day from the self-defence air effort will leave the group vulnerable. A group denied these air assets when either threat is present fights without the assets that keep the enemy at arms length and must grapple with an enemy that is vastly superior in the clinches. Australia cannot afford a full scale battle group or even a scaled down one. Operation of the type of carrier group we can afford against a determined enemy equipped with modern conventional submarines and a cruise missile capability would most probably mean very heavy losses for us. Land-based air assets could reduce these losses but our present force structure and geography restrict severely the potential of help from this source. Rather than the gorilla that sleeps where he likes, our surface naval forces could, in such circumstances, be better likened to the small monkey on a chain who sleeps when and where he is put. In today's multi-threat environment, with carriers, it's very much a matter of get big or get out. </PARA>
<PARA> Two operation considerations that add to the vulnerability of naval surface vessels are fuel and refits. Destroyers and frigates have a relatively short- range and need tankers or port refuelling for protracted or long-range operation . Guaranteeing fuel is normally only a logistics operation during peacetime, but in war the availability of tankers and port facilities within Australia's huge area of interest may be a critical factor. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more important than the refuelling problem is the need for refit. The long hours ships spend at sea means that lengthy overhauls (refits) are unavoidable. This is not a problem when numbers are such that capability is maintained by a planned refit program. However, with small numbers the need for refit obviously reduces the force capability. A single unit provides the extreme example: it is either available or it is not. In general terms, with three ships planners can expect two to be fully operational some of the time and one all of the time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of all surface naval units operated in small numbers to have one ship fully operational at all times needs two ships, as one is almost permanently in refit or work-up. This fact is often overlooked when cost- effectiveness comparisons between various defence assets are made. A squadron of P3 Orion aircraft and an FFG 7 are about the same price but the squadron is capable of continuous operation for years and the ship isn't. Continuous operation requires two ships, not one. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the ultimate in vulnerability is a single unit, the only one we have, in dock for refit when its capability is needed at sea. </PARA>
<PARA> Current submarines and cruise missiles find surface ships, even well equipped naval vessels, very vulnerable. Only CVBGs can produce the combined abilities to adopt a capability posture rather than the more usual survivability posture lesser groups must assume. Battle groups cannot be scaled down past a certain point (in general terms this point is when their self-defence air assets cannot operate 24-hours-a-day) and carrier operations is one area where you get big or you get out. </PARA>
<PARA> Adding to this battle vulnerability are the need for guaranteed fuel for ships planning remote or protracted operations and the fact that refit and work-up periods are so time demanding that two ships are needed to guarantee one ship at sea at all times. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is that with carriers that what we need is big ones, not little ones, and two, not one. As the little one we are planning to buy will cost, with aircraft, at least $A1,000m, and big ones, fully equipped, cost tens-of-billions we obviously cannot afford a viable weapons system of this type. </PARA>
<PARA> But $A1,000m would buy a third squadron of P3Cs and a squadron of submarines. The P3Cs could provide the necessary fixed-wing ASW air assets for naval ships operating in Australian and adjacent waters and would contribute to the area ASW efforts. The extra submarines would increase the size of our submarine force enough so that their relative immobility would be reduced in importance by their greater numbers and the submarine force could then provide both anti-shipping and a very effective area ASW capability. </PARA>
<PARA> These P3 and submarine assets, properly used, would significantly reduce the capability of an enemy to operate either surface ships or submarines within Australian waters and waters adjacent to Australia and would consequently contribute to the safety of all shipping in many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Additionally, these assets represent the spreading of capital outlay over many relatively cheap individual units rather than on a single expensive unit. When the survivability quotient is also considered, this produces a force capable of graceful degradation during protracted operations over a wide area, not the vulnerable 'all eggs in one basket' asset with a capability to work in only one area at a time, some of the time, represented by the carrier. </PARA>
<PARA> While this force structure would provide a more efficient and durable counter to both the submarine and the cruise missile, it would not obviate the need for the maximum possible self-defence for all naval surface vessels and some means of countering the shadowing aircraft and the subsequent cruise missile. An Air Early Warning Capability (AEW) combined with a long-range air defence missile ( the range of which would ideally exceed that of the cruise missile) would obviously be a worthwhile combination in this area and even in a relatively rudimentary form should represent a considerable threat to a shadowing patrol aircraft. Without constant AEW, VSTOL fighter type aircraft in the number possible on a small carrier represent almost no threat to a shadowing aircraft, consequently the use of AEW aircraft (even though land base) and missiles would be a substantial increase in capability over the small carrier with VSTOL fighters option. This AEW capability would be additional, not alternative, and would require funds not now planned. But something must be done. </PARA>
<PARA> To buy more surface vessels but not increase the survivability of existing units would be folly. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the relativities of maritime warfare assets have been presented as generally understood today. The P3Cs and submarines are the best ASW and maritime strike assets we have and it seems logical that we should be optimising our known strengths and avoiding our weaknesses. Our force must be able to take damage and continue to fight, perhaps in a number of areas at once and for protracted periods. One 'eggs in one basket' carrier will not do this for us: more P3s and submarines will, at the very least, place us well along the road to achieving that capability. We can't afford a gorilla but we don't want a monkey on a chain instead. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House, and the Minister. The Government is well aware of this division and I think it has been panicked into this decision by two assessments which really are an insult to it. The first is an assessment by the advocates of the aircraft carrier that they are losing the internal debate and that they must act now if they are to benefit from the inertia of the oft alleged replacement syndrome which afflicts governments and the Department. The syndrome is the last planning cliche in the mind set of those responsible for decisions that can legitimise the purchase. Even though the Invincible was ruled out earlier by the advocates of an aircraft carrier as a suitable replacement for the Melbourne, it has been dragged in as the only thing kicking around that can be bought at short notice. The second assessment-and I think this is a really quite critical assessment-is that the Government is responding to carrier advocates who see it as being on a downward electoral slide. They know that the ALP will not support a carrier purchase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why does the Government respond in the way in which it does to our defence problems? It appears to have no defence doctrine. It hopes for an ignorant electorate that will permit it to go on announcing purchases of equipment that either are not going to be purchased for years, though the implication is that they will arrive tomorrow, or are unrelated to any clear purpose. It likewise announces intentions to proceed with capital facilities then chops them back at the slightest hint of budgetary problems. It does all this because deep down it does not believe in the direction of all clear headed defence thinking in this country. It does not believe in a defence doctrine based on the defence of Australia. It says it does but the fact is that when it comes to dotting the i's and crossing the t's of defence policy, when it comes to detailed planning it cannot sustain the relentless intellectual effort necessary to achieve the objective. It wants to move away from the doctrine of defence self reliance to one based on forward defence. We do not call it forward defence; we call it co- operation with allies in strategic concern, a contribution to regional defence. There is no other explanation for the purchase of this carrier and for many of the other Government defence decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The carrier has value if added to an American carrier battle group. It has value if we want to intimidate Fiji, New Zealand, New Caledonia or whatever. It has absolutely no value to the defence of Australia. I really believe that this purchase of the carrier is an indication of a quite substantial shift in the orientation of Government defence doctrine which has yet to be explained to this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to Australia is that very real threats to our security will not be dealt with, that our defence force structure will be distorted and that important equipment purchases will be delayed or dropped. The Navy will suffer from this as much as the other two services. My State and the northern and western reaches of this country, which on all defence analysis, along with the Northern Territory and the North of Queensland, ought to be the focus of defence planning at the moment, will suffer most of all. Where is the patrol boat base in the north-west of Western Australia that keeps being promised but which the Government managed to slide out of in the last Budget? When will HMAS Stirling be properly utilised by the Royal Australian Navy rather than being left purely as a visiting spot for allied visitors on rest and recreation visits? When will work on the upgrading of our northern air bases be completed and will they ever have proper air defence systems? I would also like to know whether the development of those airbases was included in any of the cut-backs or delays that were announced a couple of weeks earlier. Will the Government ever give serious consideration to the defence infrastructure of that area to ensure that road, rail and air connections do permit a rapid transfer of ground forces to the area?</PARA>
<PARA> It is time that serious consideration is given to the relocation of the Orions from Salisbury in South Australia to Pearce or Learmonth. The initial capital costs would be considerable but so would be the long term savings. It is time too that the potential of Cockburn Sound and Fremantle as an Australian submarine base was properly realised. None of this will be possible under this Government because it has no real convictions about the need for the defence of Australia. It will dream up a threat for electoral purposes while knowing the threat is remote and then plan our forces in a way that tacitly acknowledges the remoteness of that threat. It is I believe a deeply intellectually lazy Government when it comes to the question of defence. I believe that its decisions are now regarded by many people within the Minister's department as too costly to be pursued in terms of the security of the country. I think that the amendment that we have moved is an absolutely vital amendment at this stage. I want to talk about some other matters but I have decided to conclude at this point as I see that my colleague the Chairman of the Sub-Committee on Defence has entered the chamber. I would like to give him some time to put his views before the proceedings conclude. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dealing with the Government's decision to purchase the Invincible and the FA18 as our new tactical fighter I would like to refer to the manner in which the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) and his advisers, both uniformed and civilian, conducted this most demanding and complex operation. Their attention over what was finally a period of years in relation to the FA18 aircraft and many, many months in the case of the Invincible was impeccable. Consider the momentous factors involved. First, consider the expenditure, as the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) mentioned, of possibly $3 billion-and maybe it will go beyond that. Secondly, consider the daunting consideration that these fighter aircraft and the replacement aircraft carrier have to take us into the next century. We should also consider the all worrying inhibition of deciding whether these major contributions to our air defence and maritime defence were merited when balanced against our general defence requirements. Finally, we should consider the most important factor of Australian industry participation. Would this purchase stimulate activity which would lead to the employment of many Australians and give industry a much needed boost? Well, in the case of the FA18 it very clearly will. I am sure that in the case of the Invincible, industry participation will undoubtedly go beyond what was indicated by the Minister when he addressed the House in relation to the purchase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is quite remarkable that when the Minister for Defence announced the decision of the Government to purchase the FA18 there was no significant objection from any section of the community. In fact the reaction to this momentous decision was quite remarkable when contrasted with the decision to purchase the F111 aircraft. We know the regrettable agonising that went on and on in relation to that decision by the Australian Government. I think the reason for this reaction is that it had become very clear to the Australian public that very deep and significant consideration had been given to the decision finally to purchase this aircraft. The same applies to the purchase of the Invincible. I must confess that, probably through ignorance and not really understanding in the first place the scenario in which the Invincible would have to fit, I was somewhat hesitant about coming to a decision as to whether or not this was a suitable purchase. I had to depend on the views of people who I believe know very much more about these things than I. </PARA>
<PARA> I had to fit the purchase into the scenario of the briefings I received when I visited Washington and, more particularly, Hawaii. Those briefings provided a background for the role into which this superb aircraft carrier must fit. The picture, as presented to me by Admiral Long and his advisers, is that prowling around the Indian Ocean-we talk a lot about the Indian Ocean without giving much consideration to the Pacific Ocean-are probably 30 to 40 Soviet nuclear submarines. If they are not nuclear submarines at least they are highly armed. But we do not consider that there is probably an equal number of Soviet submarines in the Pacific area. There is a sophisticated base of operations in the northern Pacific which I am told by people at this level is as equally developed and capable as the base that is provided for the Warsaw Pact nations. Therefore it became quite obvious that we had to have a weapon that could deal with submarines. I would agree with the honourable member for St George that we would like to have it both ways; we would like to have an aircraft carrier with a great strike capability that would go beyond submarines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning I asked the Minister for Transport ( Mr Hunt) a question concerning the current consideration of an application to allow passenger jets to land at Sydney during curfew hours. The Minister, in his reply, was very careful to deal only with an application from Trans Australia Airlines for an all-hours operation of the Airbus. I agree. I think all honourable members on this side of the House would understand that the Government is unlikely to favour TAA's application until Ansett Airlines of Australia is in a position to compete on an equal footing. Later this year Ansett will bring into operation its Boeing 767s. I am reliably informed that a deal has already been done and that an agreement for both aircraft to operate during curfew hours will be forthcoming. The justification will be that the domestic airlines are in grave financial difficulties and that night operations will assist them financially. It will be claimed also that the aircraft-that is, the Airbus and the Boeing 767s-have lower noise levels than other passenger aircraft and would meet noise abatement criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The spectre of night operations will become a reality before Christmas. The one -quarter of a million residents of Sydney who are already directly and adversely affected by aircraft noise will be subjected to regular flights throughout the night. There is no such thing as a quiet aircraft at 3 o'clock in the morning. We would have no objection to 24-hour operations by airlines at a second Sydney airport which was well removed from residential areas. But the Fraser Government has failed to face up to its responsibilities. It continues to dither and delay on constructing a second airport. The only way that Ansett, TAA and the international airlines can operate financially and effectively is to have an airport which is available 24 hours a day. We have made that point time and again. That second airport is a vital necessity for the financial well-being of the airlines. The Opposition has opposed and will continue to oppose putting another nail in the coffin of the curfew at Sydney Airport. If the airlines want -as they do-24-hour operations, it is for them to put pressure on the Federal Government to ensure that a second airport is built for Sydney. I represent the people of St George who are directly and adversely affected even now by the operations of aircraft but who would be more so affected by aircraft operating curfew hours, particularly passenger aircraft. Any suggestion, recommendation or decision by this Government that the aircraft will operate through curfew hours will receive our opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are far too many cases where small businesses are threatened, not by the operations of the market or by bad luck, but by the indecisive and bungling intervention of government. Nowhere does this appear more the case than where tariff quota policies are concerned. I believe the House should be aware of the damage that is being done to Australian small businesses by inconsistent and arbitrary government controls which take the form of granting or withholding import quotas or the quixotic variation of import controls against the interests of both small businesses and consumers. Officialdom has in fact dealt in tariffs and in percentages of tariffs and has sold the right to import more to the highest bidder with the result that an entire trade appears to have grown up in the purveying of official licences to import.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This situation has been glaringly evident in regard to the importation of footwear. The House might think that the local shoemaking industry has been more than adequately protected as a result of a sudden decision by the Whitlam Government to restrict imports, a decision imposed on the industry in September 1974, and which disrupted many transactions which had been entered into in good faith by Australian importers. However, since 1974 importers of footwear have been subjected to a bizarre numerology invoked in an effort to reconcile the conflicting claims of importers and the protected local manufacturers. To carry out this design, a bewildering procession of combinations and permutations, all to be enforced by weird calculations, has been foisted upon importers. Let me put before the House the weird mathematics which have been conjured up to impose the latest vagaries of policy on importers of footwear. </PARA>
<PARA> The base performance of importers has been measured. This has been declared to be their imports for the period 1 July 1978 to 1 July 1980. As a strange sequel to this, an interim quota was worked out to set the number of imports to be allowed each importer at a basic tariff for the period 1 September 1980 to 31 December 1981. In each case this was to be, for these 16 months, 16/12ths-that is the fraction-of the base performance figure; that is, the total import of shoes between 1 July 1978 and 1 July 1980. This number, and only this number, of shoes could be brought in by each importer. The level of trade in fact was to be frozen at the level of the base period, irrespective of any new circumstances and any changes in the state of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> The same petrification of the trade is to continue for the next seven years, for during this period each importer will be allowed to bring in each year 42.85 per cent of its base period import performance at a 40 per cent duty. Each year the right to import 7.15 per cent of the base period amount will be auctioned off by companies bidding by tender. Finally, if a company at present wishes to import more pairs of shoes, either because it has not matched the winning tenderer's bid, or because it is simply seeking to stay in business, it can continue to import more shoes at a penalty rate of $15 per pair of shoes on top of the basic tariff of 40 per cent of the shoes' value. </PARA>
<PARA> As an actual example of the kind of official harassment this system means in practice, I wish to put before the House the experience of one Australian firm, Philip Graves Pty Ltd. Mr Graves is a constituent of mine. This firm has been in existence for over four years as an importer of high quality shoes. The shoes it deals in cost at factory level in Europe $45 to $55 per pair, and it is hard to see how they can outsell Australian products in Australia. Yet Philip Graves Pty Ltd has been placed, with the most detrimental results, in the vortex of this officially imposed confusion and has suffered adverslely in the wheeling and dealing that has resulted. To put it precisely, the company was allowed to import during 1981 some 2,000 pairs of shoes at a tariff of 34 per cent. However , from January 1982 it is allowed to import only 811 pairs a year at a tariff of 40 per cent. To import more the company must tender for a further increase in its own quota. However, it has not been able to match the winning tenderer's bid of an increase of the basic tariff to 71 per cent, which would mean the shoes retailing in Australia at $185 per pair as opposed to $155 per pair under the basic 40 per cent tariff. The only alternative is to import more pairs at the penalty rate which, as a result of normal market operations, means that the price per pair of shoes is raised to almost $188. So overall the company is now in a situation where it can bring in each year only 42.85 per cent of its 1978 to 1980 imports without penalty. Its business is to be shackled, for the next seven years at least, to the performance of those two years irrespective of the state of the market and its present or future opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the purpose of all this? The shoes imported by the company cannot outsell the local product. Also over-protected under this scheme are the large firms which juggle quotas, wheelers and dealers in quotas, and of course the bureaucrats who decide such unaccountable arithmetic. How is the fight against inflation served by this esoteric numerology? I call the House's attention to this matter. Why, in a free enterprise economy, should such firms face ruin because of arbitrary official arithmetic? It is time that the whole process was subjected to closer scrutiny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently I attended an international conference on disarmament and detente held in Vienna. I wish to repeat some of the remarks which I made in my opening address to the conference because I believe that the whole question of the pursuit of peace is of concern to this House and to the nation. Indeed, the frightening pace at which the world is moving towards nuclear war has become an issue of great concern to many Australians, as will be demonstrated in the rallies for peace to be held throughout Australia in April. The decade of the 1970s was designated by the United Nations as the decade of disarmament and yet it witnessed the greatest increase in production and trade in arms since the end of World War II. During this period total world expenditure on defence and armaments amounted to four trillion dollars-an amount of money so astronomical as to be virtually incomprehensible to the average person.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thus we find that the conservative Reagan Administration in the United States of America has increased defence expenditure substantially and plans even more increases. On projected figures, the United States defence expenditure in 1985 will reach a level almost equal to the $US300 billion-estimated in 1982 dollars- spent at the end of World War II and will surpass the real value of United States defence expenditure in either the Korean or Vietnamese conflicts. At the same time, if these trends continue, expenditure on defence by the Soviet Union is also expected to rise sharply. Thus there is a real danger of a nuclear holocaust engulfing the world. The confrontation in Europe between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces and Warsaw Pact forces has escalated to extremely dangerous proportions. This confrontation will be heightened further by the proposed deployment of 464 cruise missiles and 108 Pershing II missiles by NATO countries, under United States control, by 1983. The United States Administration justifies this by talk of a threat posed by the SS20 tactical nuclear missiles of the Soviet Union and its allies. </PARA>
<PARA> In this climate of suspicion, insecurity and fear every nation and every people are inexorably involved because there is no such thing as a limited nuclear war. No nation can hope to escape from the horrors of such a holocaust which threatens to wipe out civilisation. It is our view that both of the super-powers must bear responsibility for the escalation of the arms race and the current increase in world tensions. We recognise that the primary responsibility for this increased tension lies with the current ultra-conservative government of the United States. President Reagan is, in our view, the mouthpiece of the military industrial complex in whose interests it is to increase as much as possible the production of weapons systems. His Government has shown very little interest in questions of disarmament, notwithstanding its rhetoric about peace. President Reagan went as far as to propose the abolition of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Whilst, due to pressure, he has not done so he has placed in control of that agency Eugene Rostow, a man who has publicly said that he is dubious of the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks and other existing arms control agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> To escalate further the situation the United States Administration has revived and strengthened the doctrine of linkage by which it seeks to make progress in disarmament talks dependent on what it terms 'the Soviet Union's willingness to cease intervention in the internal affairs of other nations'. These claims are hyprocritical in the extreme. The United States Government has a woeful record of gross interference in the affairs of other nations, such as Vietnam and Chile . It is presently engaged in attempts to destabilise the Nicaraguan Government and it is behind the repression in El Salvador. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has publicly condemned the United States Government on these matters. We have called for an end to United States intervention in Latin America. We have called on the United States to ratify the SALT II Treaty and to begin immediate talks on arms and reductions as envisaged in SALT III. Nevertheless, we as democratic socialists also believe that the Soviet Union must bear responsibility for the current arms race. The official Soviet position is that it does not want military superiority but wants to maintain parity with Western powers. However, it appears to us that the doctine of parity must also be subjected to critical scrutiny. When one has enough missiles to destroy the world 50 times over, is it really necessary to increase these so that one has the capacity to destroy the world 70 or 100 times over simply for the sake of parity? We do not believe so. This is not to say that we advocate wholesale unilateral disarmament on the part of the Soviet Union. However, we believe that , particularly at this critical time in world history, an action by the Soviet Union to reduce some of its arms deployment would be an enormous boost to the peace process and would be applauded by peace loving peoples throughout the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to pay tribute to Dr Clyde Fenton, a truly great Australian, in fact a national hero, who recently died in Melbourne aged 80. Dr Fenton's name may be unfamiliar to honourable members but I am sure that his work, which has become a legend, will be well known, especially to those who are familiar with outback Australia. It was Clyde Fenton who originally started the Northern Territory aerial medical service in 1934. In fact from 1934 until the outbreak of World War II, based in Katherine, Clyde Fenton was the entire aerial medical service. He was its pilot, mechanic and doctor. Most of his activities were confined to the northern half of the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To give honourable members an idea of the enormous challenge he faced I point out that in the course of those six years he covered a quarter of a million miles and flew over 3,000 hours. The important thing about Clyde Fenton's approach was that he saw the potential of air travel for health care in remote areas. He did not see the aeroplane merely as a flying ambulance or as a taxi to get doctors to their patients. Rather he envisaged an integrated form of health care for patients in remote areas. He first arrived in Darwin in 1928 by ship on his way back to Melbourne. For five months he stayed and helped Dr Cecil Cook, who at that time was performing two functions-handling administration of health and quarantine and being chief protector of Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1928 he approached the Reverend John Flynn of the Australian Inland Mission about a job as doctor-pilot. However, Flynn was adamant that the two jobs were incompatible and maintained his stance of one man one job. Fenton then left the Territory. In March 1934 he was appointed medical officer at Katherine. He returned to the Territory with a de Havilland Gipsy Moth which he had bought for 500 pounds. He later crashed this aircraft at Victoria Downs station on a trip to the Ord River. His aircraft was eventually replaced by what I suppose would be called one of the first aircraft loan guarantees ever undertaken by the Commonwealth Government. At the time the only aircraft available in the Northern Territory was a Gipsy Moth, belonging to Qantas, which Fenton was urging the Government to obtain for him. Qantas refused to part with the aircraft until the Government either paid for it or guaranteed a loan. Fenton went to the Northern Territory Administrator who sent a telegram to Canberra arranging a loan guarantee within an hour. The new aircraft was registered VH-UOI but for the rest of its life was nicknamed 'IOU' because of its debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the stories relating to Clyde Fenton's exploits in the air tell of his dare-devil attitude to flying, his cavalier disregard for regulations and his continual disputes with civil aviation authorities. My mother recalls personally some of his adventurous pranks in Darwin such as the occasion when people were sitting in the gallery of an open-air theatre and Fenton flew his plane between the screen and those watching the movie. On another occasion when he was offended by not having been invited to a garden party at Government House he flew over the function and dropped flour bombs in brown paper bags on the guests . One of his friends said: 'Dangerous as he is in the air, I'm still prepared to fly with him; but drive, never again!'. </PARA>
<PARA> Nonetheless it has been said that Clyde Fenton often risked his life to get medical help to those in need. He flew over treacherous country, often at night, with no navigation aids, no radio for communication and often not knowing where he was. He became lost more than once and certainly had more than his fair share of crashes. Fifty years later we in the Northern Territory are still benefiting from Dr Fenton's vision. The Aerial Medical Service is an important part of health care services in the Northern Territory. It is relied on by many people in outlying areas where medical practitioners are few and far between. For his services he was made a member of the Order of the British Empire. At the end of his book Flying Doctor Clyde Fenton quoted two lines of poetry which sum up his achievement. He said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is regrettable that I have to speak tonight on a matter of grave urgency in an attempt to save the life of a man who is being subjected to brutal treatment in a South Korean prison. I am referring to Kim Dae Jung, the former leader of the Opposition in the South Korean Government, who is at present undergoing a life sentence for conducting what would be construed in Australia as legal activities. It is ironic that I should have to make this appeal to save the life of a great democrat in a house which only recently welcomed a parliamentary delegation from the South Korean Government. I hope that in honour of their visit the South Korean parliamentarians will take note of a request from this chamber that their Government show clemency to Kim Dae Jung. I, and other members in this House, are not alone in our protests at the treatment of Kim Dae Jung. Many parliamentarians and people who represent governments all over the world have called for his release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The latest information that I have is that Kim Dae Jung is critically ill and is suffering from serious ailments in a cell which is bitterly cold and confines him in cramped conditions. It is clear that his gaolers are attempting to so weaken him that he will eventually die. He is reported as saying that he has little sleep because he is suffering heart breaking pain. The South Korean Government must know that during the trial no witness or evidence was produced by the prosecution except alleged confessions made by the accused. This made the court proceedings a mockery of real justice. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kim's only crime was that he had been associated with a left wing movement; but he denied that he had taken part in any riots and pointed out that he was a practising catholic. Mr Kim admitted that he had attended political meetings, made speeches and distributed some political funds to supporters in preparation for his election campaign. In fact, Kim Dae Jung did nothing more radical than many other honourable members on this side of the House and probably on the other side of the chamber also. Even his original arrest was illegal in that he was kidnapped from Tokyo despite strong protests from the Japanese authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Korean Government should realise that the Kim Dae Jung problem is not just a matter of the fate of a South Korean democratic figure but a matter directly concerning the democratisation of the South Korean society and the peaceful reunification of the whole country. I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) to join me in appealing to the South Korean Government to allow Kim Dae Jung to return to his family and, if he so desires, to a life of peace in Japan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity in the adjournment debate tonight to speak of a tour that the Federal Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) recently made of the Bruce Highway, which is that part of the national highway between Rockhampton and Townsville. The tour was undertaken at the invitation of Senator Collard from Rockhampton, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) and me. The invitation had been outstanding for some time. Four weeks ago the Minister, in the company of Mr Hinze, the Queensland Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Police, travelled the road in a convoy. I think it was probably the best experience that the Ministers could have had in that they were able to feel the conditions of the road and to see where the funds expended on our roads and national highways go. More importantly, they were able to find out what that stretch of highway is like. I think I am quoting fairly correctly the Minister for Transport when I say that he commented that it was probably the worst section of Commonwealth highway that he had ever experienced. I agree with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of the trip we hope that some assistance will be undertaken and that additional funds will be provided by the Federal Government to enable the road to be put into a better condition. The national highway system is peculiarly the responsibility of the Federal Government. I understand that the submission to be made to the Government will be a joint one and that Queensland will take the unique step of agreeing to fund a portion of the national highway. Many problems are associated with the highway, particularly that section of it to which I have referred. I will speak later about road safety. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems is that a section of the road is of gravel construction. No bitumen has ever been laid on it, but that position will be rectified shortly. Many bridges go under water in flood times, thereby stopping traffic at both ends of the section of road involved. Narrow one lane bridges have been in use of the last 30 or 40 years. The pavement is over 20 years old, and pavement life in normally only 15 years. All in all, the Minister acknowledges that this is a bad road. Whilst it is not typical of all national highways in Queensland there is a lesson to be learnt from it. </PARA>
<PARA> Road deaths must be associated with road conditions. Whilst the handing over of the Queensland system to the Commonwealth in 1974 left a lot to be desired, I think we have to recognise the fact that there will never be sufficient funds in Australia to make sure that roads are brought up to the standard of those of America. I believe that road deaths are matters of concern for every person who drives on the road. They must look to the safety not only of themselves but also of others. The three great causes of accidents and death have been determined as drinking, speeding and impatience. A combination of these three factors leads to the tremendous road death toll. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the American experience in relation to speeding. American roads and main highways are certainly in a much better condition than ours. The Carter Administration reduced the speed limit from 100 kilometres an hour to 80 kilometres an hour. In the 12 months immediately following that move there was a reduction in deaths from road accidents of, I understand, some 40 per cent. There was a reduction by some 50 per cent in the number of accidents that affected the health of people. Fuel consumption dropped by 25 per cent. A special highway patrol makes sure that people drive at 80 kilometres an hour. People become accustomed to driving at that speed and as a result reap the benefits of fewer deaths and accidents and lower fuel consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> I have maintained that the proper speed for a driver should be the combination of these factors: The driver's ability-this should be the subject of very severe tests by the police-the nature of the car that is being driven, the climatic conditions and the road surface. After this combination of conditions is taken into account it is up to the individual driver to suggest the speed at which he or she can drive. I maintain that, because of the condition of the Bruce Highway and the roads in Queensland and the rest of Australia, that speed is less than 100 kilometres an hour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add a few more remarks about the problem of peace in Europe. Let me say something about the immediate problems. Everyone is aware of the escalation process there. Talks are taking place in Geneva to see whether some reversal of that process can be achieved. I am not optimistic that these talks, as presently structured, will succeed. The reason is that the United States Administration and the Soviet Union have positions which are very far from each other. President Reagan has put forward the so- called zero option whereby the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation powers will scrap their proposal for introducing the Pershing and cruise missiles by 1983 in return for the Soviets removing all SS20 missiles aimed at Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the Soviets perceive this offer as one sided and unfair, and we understand that point of view. However, it should be pointed out that the very fact that an offer has been made and that talks are taking place in the current tense atmosphere are testament to the success of the peace movement in Europe. The continued protests of the people of Western Europe have forced the Reagan Administration at least to make an offer and to talk. This is an optimistic note in a gloomy situation. Because of the unsatisfactory nature of the United States proposal from the Soviet point of view, President Brezhnev has made a counter offer in which he proposes the so-called zero option. This has two points. The first is that if NATO scraps its plans to deploy the Pershing and cruise missiles the Soviet Union will automatically reduce a considerable number of the SS20s. Secondly, if NATO reduces some of its existing nuclear weapons the Soviet Union will reduce its SS20s by an equivalent number. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there is merit in the Soviet proposal, it is widely perceived in the West as not going far enough and not being sufficiently balanced. This is the perception not simply of conservative governments; it is also the perception of the social democratic governments of France and West Germany. However, unlike conservatives in the West, we democratic socialists perceive merit in the Soviet proposals and see them as providing the basis of negotiation. However, more importantly, we believe that a compromise between the United States and Soviet positions is possible and can be achieved. In this regard social democratics and democratic socialist governments throughout the world are working towards bringing together the Soviet Union and the United States in an attempt to achieve such a compromise and to begin a real process of reduction of nuclear armaments in Europe and throughout the world. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Action is currently being taken to transfer the management of the accommodation and catering functions of Commonwealth Government migrant centres to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is the Government's expectation that staff associated with these functions will be made offers of employment by the new operator.

The extent to which these objectives can be achieved will be subject to negotiations with the successful tenderer. Steps are being taken to resolve these matters as quickly as possible. However, in view of the complex nature of the contractual arrangements to apply, it is likely to be some months before the transfer of the migrant centre functions will be effected.</PARA>
