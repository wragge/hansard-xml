<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services, by stating that last Thursday the Minister invited the Leader of the Opposition or anyone else to provide information about the existence of any affidavit which the Leader of the Opposition claimed was held by the Channel 9 television station and which he also claimed named the Deputy Prime Minister as having been involved in a decision relating to the investigation by the former Narcotics Bureau into activities of the Nugan Hand bank. Can the Minister inform the House of the result of this investigation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Barton for his question. I have received no information from the Leader of the Opposition concerning the allegations he made here last Thursday, despite the fact that on a number of occasions, both inside and outside this place, I have asked him to do so. I might add that I have not received any information from any other member of the House or from any other person in the community. Because the Leader of the Opposition attempted to cast such serious allegations against the Deputy Prime Minister, I initiated investigations over Friday last and the weekend. Those investigations took the form of interviews with departmental officers both within my Department and outside it. I had requested of the Australian Federal Police that police investigations be carried out with people who may be able to provide information on this allegation. Finally, a thorough search of as many files as possible was conducted. That search and those examinations failed to reveal anything of an affidavit or, on the advice that I received, of any ministerial involvement in any decision relating to the former Narcotics Bureau inquiry into the activities of the Nugan Hand bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The result of all this makes it perfectly clear that the Leader of the Opposition has failed to produce any information whatsoever in support of the allegations he made in his attempt to discredit the Deputy Prime Minister. More than that, there is no information available to me of the existence of any affidavit or that any Minister was involved in the decision relating to the status of the inquiry into Nugan Hand. It would appear that the affidavit which the Leader of the Opposition alleged existed was certainly not in the hands of the Channel 9 organisation, as he claimed. I end on this note: Unless the Leader of the Opposition has something to offer today, we can draw only one conclusion- when I say we, I mean honourable members in this House and the people out in the wider community of Australia-that the Leader of the Opposition used the forms of this House to condemn and discredit falsely an honourable member of it. He did that without any information or evidence at all.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce: Is it a fact that over 50 per cent of employment in the production of motor vehicle parts occurs in the State of Victoria and that Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, Gisborne and Wodonga have heavy concentrations of automotive industry? Is the Minister aware of predictions by the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers that up to 60 per cent of this employment, or about 7,000 workers, could be lost in Victoria as a result of the Government's motor vehicle policy? If so, can the Minister advise the House where these workers can expect to find jobs in view of the Government's acknowledgement that its economic policies have no chance of reversing the resurgent growth in the level of unemployment?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="962" SPEAKER="Lynch The Rt Hon Sir P.R." NAMEID="YI7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="FLINDERS" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI7">Sir PHILLIP LYNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main thrust of the new industry package for the automotive industry is to enhance the longer term viability of the particular sector to which the honourable gentleman has referred; that is, the Australian automotive component manufacturing sector, and at the same time to provide directly for that sector's work force. The Government has always accepted, and does now, that this will involve both employment gains and losses within the existing sector. The new package ensures that a more efficient industry, but still substantial in terms of size and employment, will exist at the end of the 1980s. Completely built up imports, as the honourable gentleman is aware, although partially liberalised, will still be subject to restraint. At the same time the base local content requirement for vehicle manufacturers has been maintained at 85 per cent .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only way to achieve the Government's objectives in what I believe to be the best interests of the industry-that certainly includes the component industry-is to encourage further progress towards a more specialised export oriented industry. As part of this process some companies making very high cost parts solely for the domestic market will be faced with difficult but necessary commercial decisions if they are to meet the challenge of intensified international competition. The companies making lower cost components-this includes a number of Victorian companies in the areas the honourable gentleman has mentioned-will clearly stand to benefit directly through exporting world car components to overseas vehicle producers and indirectly by supplying plan producers' components for products which are destined for export. Some companies which are now high cost producers will be able to take advantage of export sales to improve their overall competitiveness and viability.</PARA>
<PARA> As for the impact on particular States or regions, it is not for the Government to anticipate the commercial decisions which will be taken within the post-1984 policy framework. We have never denied that there will be gainers and losers but the honourable gentleman surely ought to be the first to admit that this industry needs to be placed on a more competitive basis, able to move increasingly into an international framework, and that the thrust of what the Government has done will certainly be of assistance in the component industry in developing a more viable area of the automotive industry generally.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to his speech yesterday in which he expressed strong support for further increases in sales taxes. If the Treasurer considers that the sales tax structure is and can be progressive, why in the last Budget did he lift the sales tax rate on the top range of luxury goods by only 9 per cent but double the sales tax rate on what he described as 'lesser luxuries, like household furniture and floor coverings, refrigerators, crockery and cutlery'?</PARA></TALK.START>

What I did was to cast very serious doubt on the veracity of the reasons advanced by another place for rejecting the Government's Budget measures. I also took the opportunity of pointing out the utter inconsistency in the Australian Labor Party's avowed opposition to all forms of tax avoidance and tax evasion on the one hand, and its unremitting opposition to any extension of the indirect tax base, which is the only really lethal weapon against the cash economy, on the other hand.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs aware that over the last year or two large numbers of young Filipino women have migrated to Australia to marry eligible middle aged Australian men and that most of these marriages were arranged by professional Filipino marriage agencies? Does the Minister agree that many of these marriages have been highly successful but that in some cases prospective husbands outlayed up to $2,000 more than two years ago but have yet even to meet their future wives other than through letters and photographs? Is the Minister satisfied that the marriage agencies involved are acting in a bona fide way and not extracting money by false pretences? What efforts are being made by his Department properly to inform the parties involved of their rights and of the delays which may occur before the arrangements can be consummated? Finally, does the Minister have any other advice to offer these husbands in waiting?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="963" SPEAKER="Macphee The Hon I.M." NAMEID="6I4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="BALACLAVA" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6I4">Mr MACPHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that the honourable member and several other honourable members have been concerned about this issue. As a general observation, history is replete with examples of that sort of frustration and very rarely, to my knowledge, is government intervention able to help. In fact, the honourable member gave me warning of his concern and several other honourable members have raised other aspects of this issue with me. Both the Government of the Philippines and this Government are doing their best to analyse the situation, but I have no reason to doubt, on the information given to me so far, that the activities of the majority of these marriage agencies are bona fide. A number of them do provide counselling services in addition to arranging introductions. I should also say that most are Australian-based rather than Philippines-based. Any extensive and expensive delays, such as have been referred to, as a result of the activities of these agencies are certainly to be regretted. Sometimes unavoidable delays occur as a result of normal migration processing or Philippines Government requirements. I can do no more than say that perhaps the husbands in waiting should be patient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall that in the debate in this House on the Estimates last year the honourable member for McPherson raised the matter with me. I referred to another aspect of the problem in an answer which I gave then-I believe my comment is still valid-when I said that sometimes a cooling off period is not bad in terms of the ardour of some Australians who have taken four weeks annual leave and found that they could comply with the marriage banns and so forth while they were on holidays. There are several aspects of the problem. As far as my Department's resources allow, counselling of prospective marriage partners, both sponsors in Australia and applicants in the Philippines, is undertaken to ensure that the people concerned really understand each other's cultures and what is involved in the marriage. I must say that there is some evidence that misunderstandings have occurred but, other than giving counselling before marriage and after settlement in Australia, there is very little that the Government can, or perhaps should, do to intervene in the matter. Within our laws there is nothing to impede or prevent a marriage because of a short courtship. Sometimes these long distance relationships do involve complications of the kind referred to. I am sure that the honourable member is not suggesting that we can refuse entry to anyone wishing to come here for the purpose of marriage to an Australian resident. Following a number of discussions that I have had with honourable members, we are conducting a study of the success of marriages of the kind referred to. At this stage we have no reason to think they are any less successful than is the average Australian marriage. To the contrary , the early results indicate that probably, in terms of breakdown of marriages officially recorded, their record is rather better.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to advertisements in this morning's Melbourne Press which promote a six-month building society deposit at an interest rate of 16.25 per cent? Is it a fact that such an interest rate is about one per cent above the building society lending rate in Victoria? Is it also a fact that this apparently imprudent interest rate policy has been forced upon the building societies as a result of the severe credit squeeze taking grip in Australia, which has driven short term interest rates to a current level of 21 per cent? Will the Treasurer abandon his deliberate policy of attracting capital inflow with high interest rates and instead immediately release some of the $2.8 billion in the bank funds that are locked away in statutory reserve deposits, in order to ease the crisis that is facing many financial institutions ?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no crisis facing many financial institutions, and it is a misreading of the situation at present to imply that. So far as the conduct of monetary policy over the next few months is concerned, as I indicated in answer to a question last week, the Government and the authorities, and in particular the Reserve Bank of Australia, will need to perform a significant balancing act. A number of instruments are available, including the release of some statutory reserve deposits. This may be required at appropriate times and in appropriate measure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no truth in the allegations. Public plant breeding will not be affected in any way by the introduction of plant variety rights. Public plant breeding has long been a highly popular and well regarded program in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If they retain their funding by State governments or raise their own funds in the way they do now they will continue in exactly the same way. Plant variety rights will have no effect on them at all. As to the second part of the question in respect of home gardeners or farmers being able to continue with seeds and plants presently available, again plant variety rights cannot in any way affect the supply of seeds or plants. Plant variety rights can be introduced only for a newly bred plant if, firstly, the breeder seeks to have it accepted under the legislation and, secondly, the plant is accepted by the Australian Agricultural Council. Therefore, plant variety rights cannot in any way affect the availability of seeds and plants presently in the community. The only way they can disappear is if people no longer want to grow them. I think that is a different matter entirely.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the restructuring of air fares as a consequence of the adoption of the Holcroft report on domestic air fares, there was a substantial rise in air fares between Canberra and Sydney and between Sydney and Melbourne. Undoubtedly this has resulted in a much lower level of passenger use on those airline services servicing Canberra. I have had a number of complaints from members of this House and also from the public about unscheduled or unexpected cancellations of air services to Canberra last year. In October of last year I asked the airlines to adjust their schedules more in line with the passenger flow so that they would not be placed in the position of having to cancel services at short notice, so inconveniencing the travelling public. I had an assurance that they would endeavour to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier this year there were further cancellations. I have since written to both airlines asking them once again to review their services to Canberra to ensure that they do have scheduled services here that are more in keeping with the numbers of people travelling to and from Canberra.

If honourable members receive complaints about cancellations of services between Sydney and Canberra or between Melbourne and Canberra, I will be very pleased to have them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot confirm the actual figures that the honourable gentleman has quoted but I am aware that, since the imposition of military rule in Turkey, there have been widespread violations of human rights. I am also aware that, prior to the military takeover in Turkey, there was an extremely serious terrorist situation with, according to my information, approximately 20 deaths a day occurring. I understand that there has been some improvement in that respect but there is no getting away from the fact that it has been at the very considerable expense of human rights in that country. The Australian Government has made known its views. Our views are strongly against the sorts of actions referred to in the Amnesty International report and in a report of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From time to time the Government has expressed its concern to the Canadian authorities and has sought information about the practices regarding the seal hunt. The Government has announced its intention to introduce legislation to protect the export and import of wildlife so that it can, more effectively than at present, comply with the obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species agreement and protect the trade in endangered species. It is proposed that the legislation will contain provisions to enable restriction and prohibition of the export and import of flora and fauna that may not be on the endangered list but about which there is justifiable concern. Certainly when that legislation has been introduced and becomes law consideration will be given to the use of the legislative powers to prohibit the importation of seal products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The responsibility for the decisions are matters for the Canadian Government. We have ascertained that the seals in question are not endangered. We are continuing to seek further information to ensure that that is the case and that the level of the seal hunt is not raised so high that it endangers the seal. We are deeply concerned about the way in which the hunt is conducted and have brought the concern of the Australian people to the attention of the Canadian Government. So far as we are aware at present there is no importation of seal products into Australia, but the matter is being kept under close study.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to a Social Welfare Policy Secretariat paper entitled: 'Alternative strategies to meet the income needs of the aged'? It makes the point that no figures are available for revenue foregone on tax concessions for superannuation schemes, but suggests figures of between $1m and $2m-a rather wide range. Now that the Lowe by-election is over, will the Treasurer move some Treasury staff from costing the health policy of the Australian Labor Party to the costing of actual Government policies so as to assist us and the community at large to have more intelligent discussions on policies to meet the income needs of the aged?</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, those sorts of calculations can be made fairly easily. The honourable gentleman asks a very important question about the extent of revenue forgone in respect of different concessions. Some of the figures are not easy to calculate. My attention has been drawn to the study by the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat. If the honourable member for Prospect were to examine the Budget documentation of the past few years he would notice that there has been a significant increase in the volume of information provided covering the area generally classified as taxation expenditure. The provision of that information is designed to provide a more accurate measure of the overall cost to the Budget of the provision of certain taxation concessions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to both questions is no. Appearing in this morning's Press was a rather incomplete report of some comments I made yesterday at the National Congress of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia. In answer to a question I indicated that opinions on different forms of taxation varied very widely in the community and that there were people who supported the Government' s side who had some different views on taxation from those of the Government. What the report did not record, in which respect it was very deficient, was a very precise statement of the Government's position on capital gains and wealth taxes which I made to the Congress. Amongst other things I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make it plain that some of the things Mr Kelleher-</PARA>
<PARA>He was one of the other contributors-</PARA>
<PARA>has recommended, particularly in the capital taxes area, are plainly against the present policy of the Government. The present Government is opposed to capital gains and wealth taxes and I shouldn't leave this congress in any doubt about that particular point. I know there are different views on this in the community but I don't want there to be any misunderstanding about that particular point of view.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a very plain, unambiguous, succinct statement of the Government's position. So I say to the honourable member for Bradfield that there is absolutely no ambiguity about our position on capital gains and wealth taxes. We do not have any vague positions which involve tightening up, whatever that may mean, the provisions of 26AAA, whatever that may mean, as are entertained by honourable members on the other side of the House. We have a completely unambiguous opposition to capital gains and wealth taxes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Treasurer to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures which show that, of the increase in the total inflow of foreign investment in Australia, over one-third was investment simply in buying the shares of Australian companies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite plain from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question that he believes it is possible to operate a selective stop-start approach to foreign investment. The plain truth is that unless this country is prepared to have an assured flow of foreign investment and unless we are to provide a set of guidelines which provide long term encouragement and security to foreign investment we will have to settle for a lower standard of living. The Australian Labor Party imagines that we can have the benefits of foreign investment without having the debits of foreign investment. That sort of dream world may be attractive in theory but in practice it simply does not work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the last four or five years this Government has very patiently built up international investor confidence in Australia. That has involved providing a set of foreign investment guidelines which maximise the benefits of foreign investment in Australia but, at the same time, ensure that this Government is second to none in its determination to protect a fair share of the development of the resources of this country for Australian equity. I can assure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that I have had more criticism directed at this Government's foreign investment policy from those who want it to be more liberal than from those who want it to be more restrictive.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that stamp duty is applicable to house transfers in the Australian Capital Territory. It is worth remarking that on a house mortgage transfer of about $40,000 the amount involved in the Australian Capital Territory is $768. Under the Government of New South Wales the amount is about $980. So there is a significant concession as far as home owners in the Australian Capital Territory are concerned. I would have thought that as a man representing the Australian Capital Territory the honourable member would be aware that the matter he raised does not come under my portfolio-it is under the excellent administration of my colleague the Minister for the Capital Territory. That Minister shares with me the important task of having served on the joint Commonwealth-State Ministerial Council on Housing Costs. As Chairman of that body I know that at the appropriate time the Minister will be making representations to ease the burden of stamp duties in the Australian Capital Territory. The States may also be seeking to ease the burden.

That certainly spells disaster for the Australian Labor Party in Tasmania. The sooner an election takes place in Tasmania the better. As to the main thrust of the honourable member's question, I can only say that there were applications for extra export licences from Tasmania for the selling of apples. It is normal for the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation to advise me on these matters. The Corporation takes a number of criteria into account in making its decision.

Irrespective of anything that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) may say now explaining his position, serious harm was done to me last week. It will be recalled that the Leader of the Opposition sought leave to move a motion which called on the House to take a particular view about certain allegations that had been made and called on the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to respond to the allegations forthwith. The Leader of the Opposition proceeded immediately in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister concerned has been privately identified as the Deputy Prime Minister--</PARA>
<PARA>There followed some procedural actions which culminated in the House not permitting the matter to be brought on for debate at that time. The Leader of the Opposition was given leave later to have incorporated in Hansard the transcript of an interview in which a person claimed that a Federal Minister had directed that no overt action be taken by the Narcotics Bureau in respect of the Nugan Hand organisation. This, by the way, is different from the words used by the Leader of the Opposition in the motion which he sought to move, but I will let that pass. The Leader of the Opposition then said:</PARA>

There is no question but that the charge made against me by the Leader of the Opposition was completely without foundation. The fact that he made it in a way that contravened the Standing Orders-of course, you reacted to that, Mr Speaker-does not matter as far as the public is concerned. The charge was made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It did not end with the reports on radio, television and in the newspapers on Thursday and Friday last, because on Friday-the day after the Leader of the Opposition made his allegations-Australian Associated Press circulated a report, dated that day, saying that Mr Hayden had continued naming me in relation to this matter. I do not believe that the Leader of the Opposition did in fact continue to name me last Friday, but that AAP simply rehashed the story from the day before. The point is that, once the allegation is made, it is sown in people's minds and it can even continue to be published. I should say that I understand AAP killed the story, but the fact remains that the allegation had already been widely repeated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might be argued that the mere existence in Standing Orders of the requirement that allegations can be only made on a substantive motion affords sufficient protection to the member being attacked, because he can respond in debate. But quite clearly, from my experience over the last few days, that is not sufficient protection because a member who wants to, can make his allegation and have it widely published without putting the allegation in a motion. Even the convention and courtesy of notifying a member beforehand that an accusation or allegation was to be made seems to have gone out the window. Last Thursday I was frankly bewildered by the claims of the Leader of the Opposition but, fortunately, I was able to react immediately to give a categorical denial. If a member is not present when such claims are made, the problem of effectively denying them is even more difficult. Perhaps, one's normal reaction to the consequences of these allegations is to want to launch a political tirade against one's accuser. However, such a reaction, while it might be self- satisfying, would not help correct what I see as a serious deficiency in our Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen that allegations can be made in another way, and that they can have the effect which the maker of those allegations seeks to achieve. That is why I believe the House should ask itself whether consideration needs to be given to affording greater protection to members who are attacked in this way. Should it ask itself, for example, whether a member making allegations against another should be required, should the House so decide, to produce proof or evidence, at least of a prima facie nature, of his allegations. Should it further ask itself whether, the member having made the allegation being unwilling or unable to produce such proof or evidence, the House should then be able to decide whether the member should be dealt with in some way-perhaps through a motion for the member's suspension from the service of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it very clear that I am not talking about anything that would circumscribe a member's privilege. Privilege is an essential part of the rights of a member, and without it he or she could not carry out, without fear, the duties of a member. What I am talking about is the need for responsibility in the exercise of privilege. It is a powerful right. It demands great responsibility in its use. What I am talking about is the need for responsibility in the exercise of privilege. It is a powerful right. It demands great responsibility in its use. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that the study proposed by this motion could raise a number of important issues. I have deliberately phrased the motion in general terms to give the Committee, should the House so agree to the motion, wide latitude to explore those issues and to report them back to the House. The only thing I would add at this stage is to repeat that while it might be argued that the Standing Orders already provide sufficient protection for honourable members and while it can be argued that in theory they do, the fact is that in practice they quite clearly do not. Obviously every member of this House is exposed to the type of maligning that I received last week. To allow this situation to continue unchallenged would, I believe, encourage the unscrupulous to abuse the privilege of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me commence by saying that the outline of principle by the Deputy Prime Minister represents a commendable set of standards of propriety in this Parliament that the National Country Party always expects others to follow. The Deputy Prime Minister said it has never been his practice in his long years of service in this Parliament to vilify another member of the Parliament. The grave of the late Rex Connor opened up in silent and aching protest at such a mendacious statement. In the history of this Parliament there has never been a greater bunch of scandalisers, a greater gaggle of people prepared to calumniate the character of other people than the three people at the head of the National Country Party today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be my inclination and, I suspect, that of my colleagues-but according to our practice we will have a discussion about this at our party meeting and there we will determine our party attitude-to object to this proposal. Apart from being a grave incursion on the privilege of the Parliament it is of course nothing more than a flimsy pretext for the Deputy Prime Minister to present a statement to the House in a rather devious manner. He has proposed that there should be some sort of penalty such as the suspension from the service of the House of honourable members who breach the propositions he has brought forward. He and his colleagues the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) would scarcely have been in the Parliament in the past several years if such a rule had applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me just go over some of the facts. Let us put to one side the brittle moralising we saw displayed this afternoon by the Deputy Prime Minister. Let me remind the House of some of the experience we have had in this Parliament in recent years. I start more recently. In recent weeks there was the assault against the integrity of the Leader of the Opposition in the State of Victoria, John Cain. Who was the main offender? No one else but the Prime Minister. Why did he embark upon that course? Because he thought it was one way in which to deal a savage blow to the electoral standing of the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria. Why did he want to do it? Because a State election is about to come on in Victoria, and the Labor Party is about to win it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back a little further. If this sort of rule had applied in this Parliament how much progress would we have made in relation to the rather nasty, rather seedy circumstances which were associated with established attempted interference in the redistribution of electoral boundaries in the State of Queensland by at least one Minister of the Fraser Government at that time. The Opposition raised the matter. The Government sought to suppress all discussion of it, sought to intimidate by moral implications against the people who raised such matters, and effectively aimed at muting the Parliament. I declared early in the piece that there should be a royal commission into what clearly was a scandal. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) also raised the matter vigorously and frequently. Finally the Government was forced to convene a royal commission of inquiry. In the meantime, a senior Minister was forced to stand down from the Ministry. The upshot was that a senior Minister, no longer a Minister because of our raising the matter was excluded from the Cabinet for the impropriety for which he had been responsible in seeking to interfere in electoral redistributions. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also the instance of computer contracts being let by the Federal Government to meet the requirements of a government department. It was raised in this Parliament that the Prime Minister had inappropriately-nae, improperly- sought to interfere in these processes. It was established beyond any doubt that those allegations were justified. The consequence was that the tendering procedures were suspended. Subsequently, if I recall latter events correctly, fresh tenders were called. The point is that if we had not been allowed to raise the matter in the Parliament, as was the case in respect of the Queensland electoral boundary redistribution scandal, there would have been no integrity, no propriety, no justice in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975, need I remind honourable members, seeing that it is the National Country Party that is suddenly moralising, it was the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, who claimed that he had documentary evidence of Labor members of the then Government receiving financial kick-backs in relation to overseas loans. He never produced it. He did a stack of damage but there was not one bleat of protest from the people who were happy complicitors and who are today moralising. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion is nothing more than a flimsy device to allow the Deputy Prime Minister to make today in this Parliament a statement about something which embarrassed him last week. If the matter had been handled properly by the Government then, if it had not sought pre-emptorily to terminate discussion midway in a sentence, the outcome would have been considerably different. If the rather foolish and simple Minister for Administrative Services had not challenged me repeatedly to repeat the allegations which had been made in the morning the outcome would have, I expect, been considerably different. It is the foolishness of these people that gets them into trouble. Those matters to which I last alluded are matters which I want to speak about. I trust, in view of the moral discomfiture that the Deputy Prime Minister has been displaying and the concern which the Minister for Administrative Services sought to project at Question Time, that they will be keen to hear from me. There are pertinent matters which ought to go on the record. I repeat that the allegations of Mr Volkman are far too serious to be ignorned and they have to be followed up. It will be test of the dinkumness of the Government as to whether it allows me to make a statement to the Parliament at the conclusion of this discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All this motion seeks to do is to refer to the Standing Orders Committee for consideration and report whether the Standing Orders adequately protect a member of this Parliament. I suppose I may at least assert some measure of neutrality on the protection of members of Parliament. Looking at my old friend and former member for Grayndler in this place, Mr Daly, who is in the Speaker's Gallery, I say that I am not aware that in my 27 years here I have ever asked anything said of me to be withdrawn and in my friend's time I am not aware that he asked for anything to be withdrawn.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe in hard debate. I believe in blunt debate. Indeed, I believe in passionate debate and I find it quite one of the most intelligible things in this world that men and women develop a capacity to get angry in the presentation of their views. But, clearly, the use of privilege in this Parliament in relation to members one to another, between and among each other, is a very great power that exists. One may also say that the use of privilege in this Parliament in relation to the world outside is a great power and it should be used with caution. It is very easy to blacken the name of a man or a woman in this Parliament and it is equally easy so to do in respect of someone outside it . </PARA>
<PARA> Before I turn to the origin of this matter, I suppose that the report which the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) illustrated and which appeared in the Daily Telegraph would, on all legal considerations, emerge as a fair report-I use the word 'fair' in its technical sense-of what happened in Parliament. But there is no gainsaying the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister, if one looks at the report, has been grievously smeared. I do not use that term pejoratively; he has been smeared in the estimation of many readers of that newspaper. That applies equally to many other newspapers that have been published since this began. This matter began when my friend the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) raised it at 2.16 p.m. last Thursday. He said, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to move: That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) views with the greatest alarm public allegations today that a senior Minister of the Government has been responsible for preventing any action being proceeded with against Nugan Hand . . . </PARA>
<PARA>May I ask the honourable gentleman, what is meant by a public allegation? Does that mean any individual who makes an allegation? Is that to be the basis upon which the House is required to make an adjudication? This afternoon the honourable gentleman-I would like to trust that it was a slip on his part-said words to the effect that the right honourable gentleman was provided with an opportunity to issue a statement of repudiation. I hope the House has not lost its capacity to be critical and will not allow that assessment to go unchallenged. I believe wholeheartedly in this simple principle; if the Opposition seeks to diminish it, it will destroy it: That a person who makes an allegation against any man or any woman carries with him or with her all of the responsibility for proving it. Has this been done in this instance? The Opposition takes the view that that principle is of no avail. I seek to remind the House that that principle has been protected through the centuries and it would be a shame if we allowed ourselves in the national Parliament of this country to be persuaded by any means whatsoever to seek to diminish and, indeed, to destroy that principle. My honourable friend, the Leader of the Opposition, continued that the Minister concerned had been privately identified. What does privately identified mean? If a person has an allegation to make, let him state it and let him state it with clarity. No crown prosecutor could walk into a criminal court and say: 'He has been privately identified'. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is the person concerned? I do not know Mr Volkman. I am bound to say-it may be a further illustration of my ignorance-that I know absolutely nothing about the gentleman and know absolutely nothing about the matter that is under discussion, other than to say that I am deeply concerned that we could be placing ourselves in a position in which the rights and privileges of this Parliament could be eroded. I am sure that my honourable friend, as he reflects on what is asked for in this motion, will take that into consideration. Indeed, he said: 'I have not made up my mind. I am disposed to vote against it but my colleagues and I in the Caucus and our Executive will consider it', or words to that effect. It applies to both sides, indeed it does. I hope that the honourable gentleman will take that into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> When the matter was raised later in the afternoon-Hansard does not record precisely at what time, but I would say it was of the order of half past five- the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA> First of all we should get the decks cleared and understand accurately what was moved in this House this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA>I am left with the impression that no notice of the motion proposed by the honourable gentleman was given to the Deputy Prime Minister. Again, a fundamental principle of natural justice is involved. If one has a charge to make against a man one should give him notice of it and of its particulars so that he will know precisely what charge he is to meet. If one turned up in a criminal court and acted like that the judge, to use an expression that has been used recently, would give one the cane. Then the honourable gentleman said in support of his argument:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister does not dispute that. It is reasonable to view those allegations with alarm. They were transmitted on a responsible media outlet-Channel 9. </PARA>
<PARA>What is the argument to which he seeks to attract us there? Is it that, because something appears in a newspaper or appears on a television program, ergo it is true? My honourable friend's logic is far better than that. I do not think he is doing his training as a sturdy economist any credit whatsoever. One can illustrate the allegation aspect very easily. Some of my friends have said in my presence that they regard the Leader of the Opposition as being an accomplished economist. Thus, the allegation is made. But if we were to take a vote as to whether there was substance in it I believe we would find that the overwhelming majority of people in this House would be dead against the honourable gentleman.</PARA>
<PARA> He went on, in dealing with this Volkman, whoever he may be-I gather that he has had some association with this investigation-to quote him as stating:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, so far as the investigation is concerned my information is that a Minister of the Crown, a Federal Minister of the Crown, directed that no action of any overt nature take place . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The expression used is 'my information'. I have had occasion recently to complain about what I regard as one of the most disgraceful performances on the part of any human being; that is, to resort to anonymity of accusation. It goes back to Titus Oates and the fact that hundreds of people went to the gallows because of anonymity of accusation. If Mr Volkman has this information, as he claims he has, he has a clear duty as a citizen to take it and put it in the hands of police authorities-not to go on a television program or approach a newspaper and make the allegation, saying: 'My information is . . .'. The man repeated it on a number of occasions. Finally, the Leader of the Opposition went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> These allegations are in a sworn affidavit which, I understand, Channel 9 has. </PARA>
<PARA>It is my honourable friend's understanding. Has that also been washed away? Does that affidavit exist-an affidavit referring to a matter of such grievous importance to the Parliament, the nation and the people? Again, I say that there is a clear obligation on this man, Mr Volkman, to put that information in the hands of the authorities. I say, without heat or in any sense of animosity, to the honourable gentleman sitting opposite that this is a very grave matter indeed and that it will do this House no harm whatsoever to have the matter referred to the Standing Orders Committee for consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have to get this matter into perspective. This Parliament has Standing Orders to protect its members against imputations. If an imputation is made a member has the right to ask that it be withdrawn, and it is usually withdrawn. Here it is being argued that perhaps the protection is inadequate. Honourable members must have the protection of privilege in order to raise matters which we are obliged to raise if they are brought to our notice. We do not want a Standing Order that will inhibit the use of privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us make this clear. Despite what the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) has just said, this was a matter of public notoriety; it was made public on a national television program, some hours before the Parliament sat, by an ex- officer of the Commonwealth. He was not just an individual who came in off the footpath to make an allegation. In fact, he had been in charge of some of the investigations into this matter, so the credibility of what he said had a fair amount of public support. This allegation was made at a very early hour.

This was a question of privilege in this House and the Government gagged the motion which would have enabled the Prime Minister to say there was no foundation at all to what was broadcast across the nation that morning and that this man was not to be believed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. We are not in the small debts court but another action is pending where it might be appropriate for the file to be produced. Perhaps the Government could look at this matter if it is so convinced about it. The transcript available from Channel 9 says that the man had information that representations had been made, by a senior Minister. The only way anybody could find out would be by looking at the file because one would know what representations had been made, if any at all had been made. So it is not a question of the man himself having the information. The allegation made is that something on that file would indicate that somebody suggested that the investigation should not be pursued so vigorously. That is what it was all about . It is a very simple matter which can be easily cleared up. It is only a matter of asking whether there is any merit in what that man has said. It has been put here that the matter could not be raised, even despite the fact that the man was at one stage a senior Commonwealth officer in charge of the investigations into the matter which was subject to ministerial control. Is he now to be denied the chance of suggesting that some improper action was taken by a Minister?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZE4">Mr LIONEL BOWEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I want to make concerns allegations that are made in Parliament. Certainly many are made. I think that to prevent their being made is a very serious matter, certainly if it is sought to prevent their being made when they are vexatious. When a senior officer investigating a matter makes an allegation concerning ministerial interference in a very confined area, it certainly can apply to only one or two Ministers in charge of that investigation . Representations would have been made by one Minister to another. Let us fine down the issue. At the time one Minister was in charge and either he received representations or he did not. It is as simple as that. Despite the barrage of abuse from the other side of this House, this matter would not be within the knowledge of just one Minister. It would have involved representations from a Minister to the Minister in charge of the investigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us get the issue very clear. The Opposition is entitled to raise an issue and to ask whether there has been some interference or whether representations have been made. This is a normal procedure. Usually in such cases the Government would answer yes or no. If the answer is no and a file can be produced, let us look at that file. That would answer all the accusations of interference. The officer concerned would not be talking about telephone interference; he would be talking about something which would be recorded on the file. That indicates the seriousness of the accusation at the present time. Such an accusation cannot be refuted by a mere denial made in this House. It can only be refuted by its being proven that no representations were made by one Minister to another, by its being shown that there is no evidence in the file of that having occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have before us a motion seeking to prevent, under the Standing Orders, any such accusations being made or any investigation being undertaken. Let us make it very clear: Even in matters related to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation the Opposition is entitled to access to information. The easiest way for the Parliament to be satisfied that no representations were made in this case is for us to have access to the relevant file. It is as simple as that. All the Leader of the Opposition asked was that the Prime Minister deny that such representations were made, but the Leader of the Opposition was gagged when asking that that be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely one of the Ministers concerned, particularly the Minister in charge of the matter at the time, should have had the initiative, when he heard of the broadcast, to come into this House some hours later and say that there was no truth in the accusation. That would have been a very simple thing to do. Because that was not done we now have, by way of this motion, a suggestion that something horrendous is being done for the first time. That is utter nonsense. I ask honourable members to recall what happened to the Australian Labor Party in the past when accusations were made against it about secret commissions, money and everything else. People were put in their graves as a result of that. Conspiracy charges were laid against them. All sorts of issues were involved. Money was paid to Sankey and nobody was able to produce any evidence about who paid it. The rotteness of that conduct might give reason to say: 'You want to do something about the Standing Orders'. What is proposed now would inhibit the freedom of a member of Parliament. All that we are asking is that the accusations of the officer be thoroughly investigated and that the Parliament be shown evidence to the effect that what the Ministers are saying is true. That is the simple issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an extraordinary situation where the Government constantly seeks to gag serious debate on controversial matters. It ends up making much more of the issues than they deserve to have attended to them. If one had been allowed to discuss the matters raised last Thursday at the point at which they were raised it is conceivable that the development would have been much different from what it was. What transpired was that in the midst of the first sentence I uttered after moving the motion, the gag was applied and the matter was left up in the air. Then some 3 1/2 hours later from memory-some several hours later-the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) returned to the Parliament and made a statement on the matter. In the course of my response to him he constantly heckled with interjections challenging me to repeat allegations that had been made in the afternoon. Only a part statement had been made in the afternoon. But the result of all that was that because the Government bumbled in its handling of the matter, because the proper place for discussing this matter, the Parliament, was prevented from doing so, this matter lingers on. I have some papers, for whatever their value is. I made it clear last week that while we were concerned about the allegations we did not endorse those allegations. They were matters that should be tested or explored by the Parliament. I say the same again: For whatever these are worth they should be matters that I address myself to in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been the subject of certain imputations by members of the Government. I might say I take it with greater grace than the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) or the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) because I am prepared to debate these things in a fair, open debate-I am not trying to rig the debate. Because I have been the subject of those sorts of comments I think it reasonable that I should be given time to discuss these matters. Mr Volkman has been spoken to over the weekend. He reaffirms what he has already said, privately and publicly, and he has added to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a considerable debate earlier this afternoon in which it has been suggested that accusations or imputations should not be made against members unless there is some substance to those accusations or imputations. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has inferred that in some way he has been denied an opportunity to present in this place facts that emerge from statements that were made on television last week or have been confirmed by the person concerned subsequently. The Government has nothing to hide in this matter. We are concerned that if charges are to be made against anybody they should be made by way of substantive motion. The matter cannot be left hanging in the air with some suggestion that there is substance in some allegation made by the Leader of the Opposition and that there is no opportunity for this Parliament to debate it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time, I repeat that the Government believes quite strongly that the matters which have been referred by resolution of this House to the Standing Orders Committee demonstrate the concern of the Parliament that unjustified, unwarranted and unsubstantiated assertions should not be made. In those circumstances and understanding that the matter does need to be aired, the Government will not object to the Leader of the Opposition making a statement. </PARA>

They relate to the discussion on this issue in the Parliament last Thursday. Then, like now, the unparalled incompetence of the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) caused an imbroglio which perhaps could have been largely avoided. There rests the responsibility for the problems with which the Government has been confronted. I want to start off by stating-I will come back to this later-that last Thursday I was advised privately that Mr Volkman, a former narcotics agent, whom I do not know and whose allegations neither I nor the Opposition endorse-but we are worried about them-had declared privately the identity of the Minister to whom he was referring in his allegations on Channel Nine television. I checked with a media outlet other than Channel Nine, as a matter of curiosity, and found that it had been advised directly of the identity of the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member may derive great humour from the matter but I give it to him here. I moved a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders-this appears at page 890 of the parliamentary record-to enable me to move that the House viewed with great alarm the allegations of Volkman. They were evidence of Nugan Hand's involvement in heroin deals, laundering money, connections with organised crime and the Central Intelligence Agency. I then went on to move the second part of the motion which stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . requires the Prime Minister forthwith to respond to these allegations and to assure this House that neither he nor any other Minister who has served or serves with him has taken or caused to be taken any steps which would prevent or hinder inquiries into any of the above matters or matters related to them. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me a matter of eminent practical common sense that any ordinary citizen would understand that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) should immediately repudiate those allegations. The Prime Minister's colleagues cannot deny that they were aware of my intention to take action in this Parliament. I arranged through the Opposition's Whip's office to have a message conveyed to the Government Whip's office that action would be taken in the Parliament about which the Prime Minister should take an interest. I moved the motion. I then said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the allegations have been made publicly today. We neither ensorse them nor --</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the House then moved a gag. Earlier I had pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister concerned has been privately identified as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), but in these circumstances--</PARA>
<PARA>And the gag was applied. I was then forced to move that the Standing Orders be suspended. It was my intention to go on-my last words were 'but in these circumstances'-and to indicate what this was the sort of matter that could have been extinguished immediately.

It just will not learn. Later in the afternoon, while I was speaking in the Parliament, the Minister for Administrative Services said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Repeat the allegations you made two hours ago. </PARA>
<PARA>That appears at page 925 of Hansard. He said that in a very provocative and impliedly threatening way. So I accommodated him; I repeated them. Having repeated them, he complains. I went on to say that the Deputy Prime Minister had denied the allegation and I accepted that. But there are certain facts which cannot be written off as easily as that. The allegations have been made and they have been made on more than one occasion by Volkman, a former narcotics agent. He has identified the Minister whom he believes to be responsible. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why don't you wait? You got into enough trouble last week by putting your mouth in full speed gear and your mind in neutral. Volkman identified the Minister concerned. Two former colleagues of his have expressed support for the general thrust of his allegations, including the interference with proper processes aimed at shooting home criminal responsibility to Nugan Hand. I put that on the record very clearly and early as evidence that just cannot be written off as simply as the Minister would want.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why is it that Volkman will not talk to the police task force? He is on record as saying why-a not unreasonable statement for a number of reasons but particularly in view of his experiences, which I shall relate in a few minutes time. The Canberra Times of Sunday reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Sydney: Mr Joe Volkman, a retired Customs Bureau investigator who made the allegations about the cover-up of the Nugan Hand inquiry, was visited yesterday by two Federal Police officers. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> But Mr Volkman said he had been asked to nominate the Minister involved in the cover-up. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I told them I was not able to talk to them', he said. 'There would need to be a proper forum for the thing to be put to the test. There have been too many cases of policemen investigating police'. </PARA>
<PARA>On the face of it, that is perhaps a not unreasonable statement, but on the basis of evidence that Mr Volkman claims substantially to exist-he made that claim at the weekend-I think that his caution in this matter is understandable. This is what Mr Volkman says, and I put it on record that at this stage Volkman is concerned for his welfare and life--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am telling the House what Volkman is concerned for, because he is involved in making allegations about an area in which some pretty heavy operators have been in action. It may well prove-I put this on record again-that these allegations, as serious as they are, do not stand up to a proper inquiry. But they are serious. They are being made repeatedly. They are being treated by responsible media outlets as the sort of credible assertion that should be tested. That is what we are saying. We are saying that a police inquiry cannot do this. What I am saying is that there should be a royal commission of inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is Volkman's alleged experience: He said that he went before the Williams Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs and gave evidence in camera. That, he says, is why his name does not appear on the list of witnesses. In the course of his evidence, he referred to the activities of certain of his colleagues, whom he identified. Their activities were, to put it in the most euphemistic sense, quite improper. He found subsequently that a search warrant was executed on the premises in which he resided and that the transcript of the evidence that he gave in camera was seized. He was then subsequently subjected to threats about what would happen to him for splitting on his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not stop there. Volkman claims that, subsequent to that, he was charged with bird smuggling. He was charged in the magistrates court. He was acquitted after the case was called forward. He says that nine months later the Attorney- General filed an ex officio indictment against him resurrecting the charge. He regards this series of events as intimidation at the highest level. He is concerned about his security. He has no confidence in the processes which the Minister has put in train to investigate these allegations. He is prepared to appear before a royal commission, in spite of his previous experience in relation to the seizure of the transcript of evidence, and give all the information of which he is aware. </PARA>
<PARA> I put this point to the Minister and the Government. If it is good enough to have a royal commission of inquiry into the Builders Labourers Federation and into the Ship Painters and Dockers Union, it ought to be good enough to have a royal commission of inquiry into these very serious allegations. They go much further than the allegations against those two unions, as serious as they are. I acknowledge that they are serious but, as serious as they are, these allegations go further. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what happened on Friday morning. The Sydney Morning Herald, under the heading 'Ex-colleagues support allegation', said:</PARA>
<PARA> The claim by Mr Joe Volkman that investigations into the Nugan Hand bank's involvement into heroin trafficking were stopped were supported yesterday by two former colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Phillip Bailey, 36, who left the Narcotics Bureau through ill health in January, 1981 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Another former colleague . . . who refused to be named. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But there is endorsement of the allegations, provided by two former colleagues, one of them Bailey, a name to which I shall refer again very shortly. The Weekend Australian-a not terribly reliable or consistent record to rely upon, I acknowledge-of Saturday morning, under the heading 'Customs men call for public inquiry', said:</PARA>
<PARA> Customs officers demanded a public inquiry yesterday into the 'blocking' of investigations into the Nugan Hand bank-and the possible involvement of a federal minister. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say in direct quote from a Mr Spanswick of the Customs Officers Association:</PARA>
<PARA> 'We spent months fighting for a royal commission or some other form of public inquiry into this department, because we knew of serious problems which senior management refused to confront. </PARA>
<PARA>The quote continues:</PARA>
<PARA>'All we got was an investigation by senior officials of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>The quote ends for my purposes. The whole point is that the Government's attention to this very serious matter has not reflected the sort of application, the sort of zeal and the sort of determination that one would expect, given all the seriousness of its implications. </PARA>
<PARA> Very shortly before the House commenced today a file of documents was provided for me. They are relevant to this matter. On the front page is a hand printed note. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Not certain whether original exists any more. Bailey photostated it to protect himself when papers disappeared off it. </PARA>
<PARA>It will be Volkman's allegation that relevant papers have disappeared from crucial files relating to his allegations. That is a serious allegation and it deserves to be tested not by a police task force, no matter how competent and diligent it may be and how much integrity it may hold; it should be tested by a judicial inquiry. It is Volkman's assertion that he is aware of and that others are aware of the disappearence of relevant documents on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned about the drug aspects, about the laundering of money, and about the association with organised crime-all allegations by Volkman. But we are particularly concerned about the allegations of a security association in relation to Nugan Hand and the allegation flowing from that that the Government has been less than keen in pursuing this matter. The Central Intelligence Agency specifically is in fact referred to in some of the documents that I have. The second matter, which is again hand printed, says:</PARA>
<PARA> Attention to file note (second page) which indicates documents relevant to be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a curious sort of matter to refer to. Apparrently relevant documents have been destroyed. The third matter says:</PARA>
<PARA> Reference to report of Haydock-Wilson re summary para 6. Haydock-Wilson wanted to reveal source of original informant. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at a couple of these documents. I attend to these documents publicly rather gingerly. I do so because certain sources of the former Narcotics Bureau are identified. It may be that they are already publicly known; I do not know. But at this stage, anyway, I would not propose to use those names. Certain other documents refer, in a rather diverting if not salacious manner--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RK4">Mr HAYDEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Being punctilious about legal terms wastes time in this chamber, and follows the standard set by the Government. I was making the point that there are some personal references of a salacious nature which would have, perhaps, a salacious interest for some. As people are identified I would not propose to detail them and, indeed, I would not propose to table the documents here and make them available until I received authority from the person who arranged those documents to be supplied to me. However it would be my aim to recommend to that person that the documents should be made available to the Minister for Administrative Services. It may be argued, however, that this and other information which I understand exists, is the sort of information that should be tendered not to the Government, not to a police inquiry for reasons I have already outlined-I think one understands the justification for that concern-but rather to a properly set up judicial inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have here a document which is headed: 'Commander, Eastern Region' and which is subtitled: 'Nugan Hand'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Will you please therefore ensure that until further notice from me no active external inquiries are embarked upon in relation to this matter but that any information that comes to attention is transmitted by the Regional Intelligence Unit to Mr Haydock-Wilson, OLIA. </PARA>
<PARA>That is signed by Mr Brian C. Bates. I noted a reference to this document in the Weekend Australian on Saturday morning. I noted that an unsourced third party claimed that Mr Bates had initiated this action on his own behalf. That is disputed by Volkman. I understand that it would be disputed by others. If that is so, it is a matter of great contention and therefore one that ought to be tested by a judicial inquiry. We cannot just accept Mr Bates's statement were he to make it. At this point he has not made it. It is attributed to him through non-personally identified third party sources. Even if he were, I would not find that good enough in the light of the persistent declarations by Volkman. I repeat, and I will repeat umpteen times, Volkman may well be wrong, but he is saying these things publicly. The way in which the Government has handled this has been most unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> Haydock-Wilson was referred to in that document as the person to whom any information obtained should be transmitted. He is the sort of person one would want to see fully tested before a royal commission of inquiry when one reads a comment such as that which appears above his signature, which is above his name and which said:</PARA>
<PARA> Without naming names it might be advisable to indicate to Mr Nugan the source of the original information. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that is an extraordinary proposition. Haydock-Wilson is referring there to a person who is named in these documents who had associated with Nugan Hand and with Nugan and who was a source of critically important information about the criminal activities of Nugan Hand, as I understand it, and who could, without being named, be generally indicated as a source of the original information to the Australian Narcotics Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an extraordinary proposition that in any way at all an investigating authority would propose to drop clues on the track of its quarry as to where it was getting information from, especially when dealing with a business where offenders play for keeps. That is not an extreme statement to make, certainly in the light of experiences overseas and also in this country, where recently people's lives have been terminated because they did not fulfil certain requirements of them by narcotics operations that are international in their ramifications. Here we have a senior officer-without naming names-proposing:</PARA>
<PARA> It might be advisable to indicate to Mr Nugan the source of the original information. </PARA>
<PARA>What is quite clear here is that something strange was going on within the Narcotics Bureau and that effective investigations had been brought to a dead halt by interference and that Mr Bates had signed a memorandum to that effect. At this point, there is no satisfactory explanation why such an extraordinary line of action should have been adopted. It is the view of investigating officers serving at that time publicly declared variously and frequently enough- for gosh sake-that with more determination they could have effectively brought Nugan Hand to account earlier. As it was, it was never brought to account. There was always this evidence of obfuscation, of making the waters murky so that it was not possible to penetrate what was going on. I come back to ask: Why is there this extraordinary behaviour and, more especially, why, when there is an alleged association with the Central Intelligence Agency?</PARA>
<PARA> Is there an alleged association with the CIA? That has been said by Mr Volkman. It is a very serious matter and more especially in the context of certain events in the middle of the last decade and of allegations which have been referred to in newspapers. I quote from a record of a meeting with a certain gentleman whom the Narcotics Bureau was seeking to recruit. He had contact with Nugan Hand. The record states:</PARA>
<PARA> X said that Houghton was still affiliated with the CIA. </PARA>
<PARA>Houghton was the person who has been quite often written about in, certainly, the National Times, among other newspapers, as operating in this country on behalf of Nugan Hand and as a member of that organisation. They and other sources-I believe others, but certainly the National Times-asserted, or implied at least, a security link. Let me go on to page 6 of this record on the official file about the source of this information, that Houghton was still active with the CIA . It states of the informant:</PARA>
<PARA> He did not appear to be anything other than truthful and the facts that he mentioned, such as they were, appeared to all be checkable or to be already known to us. </PARA>
<PARA>The implication of that is clear enough. Houghton did have a CIA connection. He was active as such and also active as a member of Nugan Hand. In all the circumstances there is enough justification in these documents alone for arguing for a royal commission of inquiry into the allegations of this man Volkman. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us test them properly. Let us cease trying to hide or to conceal the nature of the allegations and the extent to which there is any substance behind them. The Government's behaviour in this Parliament has been clumsy in the extreme in the way in which it has sought to muzzle any sort of informed discussion about a matter that concerns the general public. Of course the general public is concerned about such serious allegations and of course members of parliament must reflect that concern. They would be recreant to their responsibility should they fail then to raise the matter in the Parliament. They would be doubly recreant should they fail to do so after the Government has had several hours available to it in which to respond to them. Last Thursday allegations were made publicly on Channel 9 television. The Government did not seek to respond to those matters. It did some two hours after we raised the matter in Parliament. But we raised it after several hours had elapsed after the original mention on television. </PARA>
<PARA> The tactic of the Government has been consistent on two levels: First, to try to gag debate and, secondly, to try to smear the motivation, the character, of anyone who raises this matter. If the matter had been handled properly last Thursday, the allegations would have been raised then. It would have been pointed out, as I pointed out, eventually given the opportunity, that the Opposition does not endorse these allegations because we do not have evidence available to us one way or the other. We are not set up to undertake a judicial inquiry or to make a judicial assessment of these matters. But they are being made repeatedly. They are being made publicly. They are being endorsed by people as various as former officers who served with Mr Volkman and by Customs officers who have also gone public on this matter. There is sufficient evidence in these documents to justify an addition to the concern that people feel about these matters. There should be a royal commission of inquiry into these very serious allegations. Mr Volkman has made it clear--</PARA>

They are serious enough in themselves. Added to that was the allegation that a senior Minister, not responsible for the administration of that particular area, was involved in blocking the proper processes of inquiry into these matters. That adds to the seriousness of the allegations. The documents from which I have quoted confirm that there was some blocking at least of a proper process of inquiry into these matters. One's concern is justifiably heightened by that sort of process. In all of those circumstances there is enough public information available to justify a royal commission of inquiry. Added to that are the allegations that Mr Volkman has made privately, in which he has identified the Minister-I suggest you do not challenge me unless you want me to name the Minister again.

A representative of Channel 9 told me of that fact and claimed that there was an affidavit in existence. The point is that the allegations have been made. They are diminished in no way in the nature of their seriousness, whether an affidavit is available to Channel 9 or not. The allegations are quite major in their seriousness. They go right to the heart of the Government's credibility. The best way to kill this matter is to set up a royal commission of inquiry. We do not want to go through the lingering, harrowing experiences that we have gone through in the past, some of which I mentioned this afternoon.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the difference. I will come to that in a moment, too. That is the only difference between what was said last Thursday and what has been said today. The only similarity between last Thursday and today is that on both occasions the Leader of the Opposition has made a total fool of himself. First of all, let us go back to Thursday and see how the matters unravelled as we heard the accusations made. Much has been made of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition would not have dared to come into this place to make such substantial accusations against the Deputy Prime Minister except that he was needled into it, that somehow he was forced to do it by the provocative actions of the Government and its members. Let us get the facts straight. The Leader of the Opposition came into this House and moved a motion. He did not follow the usual courtesies. Nobody was advised with substantial time that he was going to move that motion nor about what he was going to do. Obviously, he deliberately failed to do that because his plan was to come in here, move that motion and, immediately after, name the Deputy Prime Minister as the person involved. That is hardly the action of a decent man who was demanding justice and a revelation of the proper facts of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next thing that happened was that he said that he would not have dared mention the Deputy Prime Minister again, except it was the needling of the Minister for Administrative Services-that is me-that got him going. I looked back on the record and I note that I interjected four times. The poor old Leader of the Opposition, the man who pretends to be Prime Minister of this country, was provoked into naming the Deputy Prime Minister again because I interjected four times. On Thursday, the Leader of the Opposition maintained that he justly named the Deputy Prime Minister because of an affidavit which he had. Today we learn that he had to base that statement that he had an affidavit on something somebody from the media told him and he has named Channel 9. He will not tell us who the person was from Channel 9 who told him that Volkman had identified Mr Anthony. I do not know about whom he is talking. But I can talk about Channel 9 and some of its representatives. As a result of the accusations made by the Leader of the Opposition I requested the Australian Federal Police to go to Channel 9 and find out, as much as they could, the truth of the matter. The first thing that they were told by a representative of Channel 9 was that no affidavit existed. I have here a report which was made on 16 March by Detective Sergeant Moody of the eastern division of the AFP. He had telephoned one Mr Patrick Lindsay of Channel 9. The record of interview that he has provided me with states:</PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay says he knows nothing of an affidavit, only what was said by the Leader of the Opposition in the House. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> He knew that the Leader of the Opposition had named Mr Anthony but has no knowledge of where he, Hayden, got it from. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues, in my view quite rightly:</PARA>
<PARA> Lindsay said that he is a fool if he could not support these accusations. </PARA>
<PARA>I accused the Leader of the Opposition of telling untruths in this place last Thursday. I used a stronger word. But he is indicted out of his own mouth again today when he claims that somebody at Channel 9, somebody whom he will not name, told him that the affidavit existed. I again ask the Leader of the Opposition whether he wants to clear his good name. He is the one who is always talking about mendacity in this House. I have here a record of an interview from the man responsible for the interview on Channel 9 and he says that he had nothing to do with an affidavit and he thinks that Hayden is a fool if he could not support the allegations. Well, so much for the affidavit.</PARA>
<PARA> After the affidavit question came up I went to some trouble to try to establish just what was the truth of the matter, not so much as to come in here and be able to score substantial points on the Leader of the Opposition but to make sure that the allegations were properly investigated and that if anybody was involved appropriate action would be taken against them. That was the main aim of having the inquiries made. So that the House will know what the form of those inquiries were, let me outline them. I asked the Australian Federal Police to make inquiries. The police carried out investigations with an inquiry to Channel 9, with an inquiry to Mr Patrick Lindsay to whom I have referred, an inquiry to Mr Liebmann who interviewed Mr Volkman on television, and inquiries to persons who were named by the Leader of the Opposition, which I will come to in a moment , Mr Brian Bates and further Mr Harvey Bates, which I think will also be of interest to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we come to today's allegations, fresh allegations. But what do we have? Once again we have the Leader of the Opposition telling us that Mr Volkman somewhere, sometime, to someone-none of which we know-had named the Deputy Prime Minister. Again I ask the Leader of the Opposition: Where did Mr Volkman say this? When did he say it? To whom did he say it? Then we will be able to test whether the Leader of the Opposition has been telling lies today or not. I have a record of interview with Mr Volkman. In looking through the record of interview that the police have provided me with, it is clear that Mr Volkman makes it clear to the interviewing police that he cannot remember ever naming the Deputy Prime Minister when he went on that television interview. I cannot ever remember seeing a record of interview which shows that the Deputy Prime Minister was named. So we have to ask the Leader of the Opposition whether he really believes that anybody listening to this debate can believe him on this matter. It simply just does not add up. You have to do much better than that it you are going to make the sorts of accusations you have now made twice in this House if anybody is going to believe you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;March 1978. The letter reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I desire that this Bureau should not for the time being engage in any active external inquiries into this matter. Until such time as I indicate otherwise, I wish this to remain purely an Intelligence gathering and holding matter, oversighted from Canberra by Mr Haydock-Wilson, OLIA, to whom subsequent information reports connected with the matter should be directed by Regions. </PARA>
<PARA> Will you please therefore ensure that, until further notice from me, no active external inquiries are embarked upon in relation to this matter, but that any information that comes to attention is transmitted by the Regional Intelligence Unit to Mr Haydock-Wilson. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that what Mr Bates was directing there was that there should be no overt inquiry but that it should remain a covert inquiry. That picks up the quite interesting point in the debate that began here last Thursday because I think this is about the fourth time we have caught out the Leader of the Opposition in telling untruths.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr Speaker. This is the fourth error that he made. When he came in here he moved his motion which went like this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This House views with the greatest alarm public allegations today that a senior Minister of the Government has been responsible for preventing any action being proceeded with against Nugan Hand in spite of clear evidence . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let me read that bit again:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . has been responsible for preventing any action being proceeded with against Nugan Hand . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It can be seen from the record of interview with Mr Volkman that Mr Volkman did not say that at all. This is the fourth error I am pointing out. What Mr Volkman said in his interview is this:</PARA>
<PARA> Well so far as the investigation is concerned my information is that a Minister of the Crown, a Federal Minister of the Crown, directed that no action of any overt nature should take place. </PARA>
<PARA>There is clearly a mine of difference between what the Leader of the Opposition pretended that Mr Volkman said and what he actually said on television. They were quite different. The investigation was not being stopped and nor did Mr Volkman allege that it had been. What he was saying was that somebody was directing that it should now be covert and not overt. It might be interesting to know what Mr Bates said in the letter that he wrote. Again, as it had been brought to my attention and we were determined to get to the bottom of what was going on, I asked the Federal Police to take an interview from this gentleman. Mr Brian Bates said:</PARA>
<PARA> No Federal Minister of the Crown gave any direction to me that the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics into the activities of the Nugan Hand banking organisation were to be suppressed. This was alleged by Mr Joe Volkman, a former Customs Officer on a Sydney television program yesterday morning. I am very disturbed by the allegations made by Mr Volkman, who for a period did perform duty with the former Narcotics Bureau. I can only assume that Mr Volkman's allegations related to a Bureau memorandum which I sent in March 1978 to the then officer-in-charge of the Sydney office of the Narcotics Bureau.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the letter that I just read. Mr Brian Bates's letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In this memo I instructed that investigations into the Nugan Hand Organisation were to continue to be of a covert intelligence gathering nature and were not to involve active external inquiries until further notice. This instruction was given as a result of decisions taken by the management of the Narcotics Bureau and not as a result of any directions from or discussions with any Government Minister. During the term I served as a senior officer in the Narcotics Bureau no Government Minister attempted to supress any investigations. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Brian Bates said. I thought it was also important that not only Mr Brian Bates should be interviewed but also Mr Harvey Bates, a former Commissioner of the former Narcotics Bureau. He also has been interviewed by the Australian Federal Police. He has stated that the decisions of the Bureau relating to the inquiry by the Bureau of activities into the Nugan Hand Bank were taken at the operational level by him and other officers of the Bureau and that they were made without interference or pressure of any kind being brought to bear on either him personally or the Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just go back over what I have just said. The Leader of the Opposition pretended to put forward a motion which I suggest he quite rightly knew was subtly different from the accusations by Mr Volkman and having suddenly changed it he then started off on this farrago of allegations in his attempt to smear the Deputy Prime Minister, and we all know why-just before the Lowe by-election. Unfortunately, he managed to do it because the Deputy Prime Minister has already shown us how last Friday the Daily Telegraph handled this matter. I have no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition now basks in some sort of pleasure and satisfaction out of the effect that he got even though it was based on four errors, I think is the word I am supposed to use. I can only go on the advice that I have got and on the records of interview in which both the Commissioner of the then Narcotics Bureau and the officer who was responsible for taking an operational decision have told the police in a formal interview-that is, that they took the decision to go covert instead of overt, that they did it without any direction from a Minister and in fact they went further and said, without any consultation with any Minister. I think that perhaps I should also give the explanation given to me as to why that operational decision was taken. It is a simple one. People will have to make up their own minds whether it is correct, but the Bureau did have a reason for making the operational decision that it made. I think it was in February 1978 that the Bureau decided that the Nugan Hand group, particularly Mr Nugan, knew that the Narcotics Bureau was on to it and was carrying out an investigation into the affairs of the group. On that basis the Bureau decided that it would call off the external investigation and do it on a covert basis. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WM7">Mr NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition has already made a fool of the honourable member. He should not get into the act as well. In March 1978 I said that that letter had been sent. However, the point I would like to make is that the information flowing into the Narcotics Bureau, as I am advised, did not stop . The Narcotics Bureau continued to receive information from its various sources as the intelligence gathering effort continued. Finally, all the information that it received went to the various royal commissions and finally to the Australian Federal Police files. So much for the document that the Leader of the Opposition used. I make the point again that the Leader of the Opposition, as well as using Mr Volkman, somewhere, somehow, to somebody who has never been named-there is great doubt about this-also said that he has documents which he will not table, which we cannot see and which were given to him by somebody we do not know. Has anyone ever heard anything so pathetic? This man came into the chamber and tried to defend himself for trying to smear the Deputy Prime Minister in the way he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us consider Mr Volkman. It is a sensitive matter which I now go on to and I will make sure that I keep within the bounds of the normal forms of this House. The one point that I want to make is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on a number of occasions when he was debating the original motion before the House earlier today, kept saying that Mr Volkman was a narcotics agent in charge of the investigations. That is simply not true. I do not think, like the Leader of the Opposition, that he was saying this deliberately; it was probably a slip of knowledge on his part and I accept it as that. Mr Volkman was not in charge of the operation. Who is Mr Volkman? He is a discharged narcotics agent; he no longer works for the Bureau. Suffice to say that Mr Volkman will be appearing in the Sydney Court of Petty Sessions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say no more about the matter. The Leader of the Opposition can look at it and establish what the facts are. To summarise the last two days of debate -Thursday and during today-it can be seen that the Leader of the Opposition has been caught out on every single issue that he has tried to put up. In the first place he said that he had an affidavit. He then had to come back in here and say that he did not have an affidavit. His excuse was that somebody had told him that there was an affidavit but we do not know who that somebody was. In fact, I have illustrated that at least one person from Channel 9 thinks he was a fool for saying it without proper back-up. Today he came in here and used two sources of information to say that what he said originally was correct or provides a substantive case that somebody has to answer. The basis of that was that Mr Volkman somewhere at some time to somebody-again, all unknown-also made similar allegations. As I said before, he will have to do better than that to convince anybody that he ever has. Finally, he produced documents which he refuses to table or to tell us where they came from. I think it is a great pity that we have not seen the documents. As I have demonstrated today we are quite happy to have the documents examined; at least one of them-the one written by Mr Bates. It has now been made perfectly clear what the officials had in mind when they wrote that letter and when they decided to do what they did.</PARA></TALK.START>

On only one issue do we seem to agree with the Leader of the Opposition and that is that the activities of this group are of the most serious kind and deserve the most serious and intensive investigation. That is exactly what has been happening. I think it is important to take the Leader of the Opposition through the investigations that have been conducted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been a number of public inquiries that at least touched on the sorts of allegations made by Mr Volkman and certainly could have been exposed by any officer of the Narcotics Bureau or any other government or non- government organisation if they had wished. I refer to the Woodward Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and the two reports from it and to the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, the Williams Royal Commission, and the two reports from it. Stemming from the second report of the Woodward Royal Commission, the governments of New South Wales and the Commonwealth set up a joint police task force. On the initiative of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) the inquiry was extended to include the Nugan Hand group. Not only is there a joint police task force; there is also a management committee made up of officials of the Commonwealth and State governments. If that is not the basis for a fair dinkum examination, I do not know what is. It has policemen from both forces. To the best of our ability the best officers available are selected. I do not suppose I can say much more that that. The management committee consists, on the one side, of people from my Department and , on the other, of people from the Premier's Department. We cannot get much better than that. If that is not a fair dinkum inquiry, I ask the Leader of the Opposition what he wants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Mr Volkman or any other officer will not reveal the information he has, I can only suggest one other course of action, which I will come to in a moment. But I ask the Leader of the Opposition to consider seriously his position. If he has documents which are so important, and if a man is in fear of his life because of those documents, which I take it he has implied is the case, for heaven's sake let him give them to his mates in the Labor Party in New South Wales and let them handle it. If that is not neutral ground, I do not know what would be from the point of view of the Leader of the Opposition. He has been asking for a committee of inquiry-I take it into the Nugan Hand group and the allegations that have been made by Mr Spanswick of the Customs Bureau, by Mr Volkman and, ad nauseam, by him personally in this place during the last few days. I am afraid that he has demonstrated his ignorance yet again. Has he forgotten that we have set up the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking, which is now looking at the activities of Terence Clark and the Mr Asia syndicate, and will look at the Nugan Hand group as well? So I appeal to the Leader of the Opposition again. If he has documents or information-or his mates who keep telling him that others have information-would he please present the facts to Mr Justice Stewart. We would welcome it. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to see his responsibility and get such information to the Royal Commission so it can be examined. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one other point about the subject of the files, which has been raised. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked for our files on the case. I would be delighted to meet that request, but unfortunately all the files that would be relevant to this inquiry are with the Stewart Royal Commission. I hope that he goes through them with a fine tooth comb in order at least to check whether the allegations that have been made here by the Leader of the Opposition are true. If, as he believes, the files reveal that that is so or that things are missing, I am sure Mr Justice Stewart will turn them up. The Commonwealth Government has been determined to seek out the facts on the Nugan Hand group. We have pursued inquiries in all the ways that I have described because we are determined to ensure that whoever may be implicated, wherever he is, is brought to justice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to inform the House of decisions on refugee policy and procedures which have been taken by the Government following a review of our refugee and special humanitarian programs. The review was initiated following my overseas visit in June-July 1981, which involved extensive discussions with government leaders and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees on the composition of the refugee and displaced persons population presently around the world. This was the first comprehensive review of Australia's policies on refugee resettlement since the establishment of Australia's current machinery in May 1977. The review closely examined the nature of the outflows, the motivations of those involved and the continuing appropriateness of Australia's response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The guiding principles of the review were those embodied in the Government's stated refugee policy of May 1977, in particular that:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia fully recognises its humanitarian commitment and responsibility to admit refugees for resettlement;</PARA>
<PARA> The decision to accept refugees must always remain with the Australian Government;</PARA>
<PARA> Special assistance will often need to be provided for the resettlement of refugees in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> It may not be in the interests of some refugees to settle in Australia. Their interests may be better served by resettlement elsewhere. The Australian Government makes an annual contribution to the UNHCR, which is the main body associated with such resettlement. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the review was to ensure that Australia's response to refugee situations was appropriate to the needs of the people caught up in those situations. Another important consideration was the need to reassure the Australian community that people being brought to Australia for resettlement as refugees under generous arrangements are indeed refugees. During my visit last year I reached the conclusion, commonly held by many involved in both the Indo- Chinese and Eastern European refugee situations, that a proportion of people now leaving their homelands were doing so to seek a better way of life rather than to escape from some form of persecution. In other words their motivation is the same as over one million others who apply annually to migrate to Australia. To accept them as refugees would in effect condone queue-jumping as migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of this, the Government's primary concern is to maintain the humanitarian focus and integrity of Australia's obligations accepted by our commitment to the United Nations Convention on Refugees. In other words, in order to be humane to those most in need we must apply the definition of refugee carefully and arrange priorities accordingly. In that way we are also fair to others who seek to migrate in the appropriate manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The grant of refugee status and the special and generous entitlements that flow from it are means of ensuring that people exposed to or who risk persecution may be offered sanctuary and protection. This is a proper and humanitarian response from a nation such as Australia where the values of human dignity and compassion are strongly held. Our record in providing assistance to refugees is an admirable one and all Australians have reason to be proud of that record. The 400,000 refugees who have resettled in Australia since World War II and the $96m which has been contributed since 1978 to provide assistance to refugees around the world are adequate testimony. </PARA>
<PARA> Humanitarian though this has been one should acknowledge gratefully that as a nation we have benefited enormously from the acceptance of refugees. They have broadened our attitudes and greatly enriched our way of life. They have achieved an excellent reputation in varied fields of employment. They are playing a significant role in helping to break down prejudices and to make us more receptive to new cultures and new ideas. As a consequence I believe we are now a less parochial people. Moreover, as individuals, they commit themselves totally to this country for, unlike migrants, they know there is no going back to their old home. </PARA>
<PARA> The manner in which refugee problems are solved is a complex and difficult process. Importantly, it involves a balance between compassion and realism. The provision of a durable solution, to use the language of international instruments dealing with refugees, involves judgments about the best solution for the situation of the people involved. It does not follow that resettlement in other countries is always the best or the most appropriate solution. For most refugees, the most desirable solution is for an individual to be free to return to his home in safety and with hope. Only when this is not possible does the question of resettlement in other countries arise. It follows that an important task for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is the development of arrangements to repatriate refugees where this is possible. In recent years the High Commissioner has been responsible for a number of successful repatriations in Africa and Asia. At the present there is some prospect of further repatriation arrangements being developed to allow some Indo-Chinese in camps in South East Asia to return to their countries of origin under appropriate conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> In a world beset by political turmoil and upheaval, the number of people who have been uprooted from their countries and have become displaced is growing daily. The High Commissioner for Refugees estimates the number of displaced persons as being approximately 10 million. A high proportion of these people are not, however, refugees within the accepted definition of that term set out under the United Nations Convention. That definition is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> A person who owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. </PARA>
<PARA>The phrases 'is outside the country of his nationality' and 'well founded fear of persecution' constitute the key elements of the definition. As may be readily appreciated there are difficulties in defining absolutely the conditions and circumstances which bring about a situation in which a person may be validly judged as being within the terms of the definition. However common sense and humanity usually point to the salient factors. Thus a threat to life or freedom on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinions or membership of a particular social group is categorically persecution. </PARA>
<PARA> Many, perhaps most, people who become caught up in a mass movement can make only slight claims to having suffered persecution. Many people who voluntarily leave their country to take up residence elsewhere are motivated by a variety of different factors-economic reasons, the desire for change, family considerations or other reasons of a personal nature. In some cases the reasons for leaving may also include a dislike or abhorrence of the political systems or ideology operating in their homeland. In some cases people may face some form of discrimination in their daily lives. Motivations to leave are often complex but, unless these motivating factors are accompanied by a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, refugee status should not apply. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a solemn humanitarian obligation to ensure that our limited program places are reserved for the genuine refugees. We must exclude those people whose claims for refugee status are suspect. This is a most difficult task. But it is one that must be carried out if we are to fulfil our undertakings under the United Nations Convention, maintain the Australian community's support for the Government's policies and ensure that persons who should be subject to review under immigration policy are not able to circumvent those policies by being accorded refugee status incorrectly. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, the Government has decided, after consultation with other governments, both those of first asylum countries and of resettlement countries, major community groups within Australia and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, that Australia will:</PARA>
<PARA> Tighten refugee selection criteria and procedures for all programs with the particular objective of excluding from refugee entry those persons who do not meet the criteria allowed for in the United Nations Convention;</PARA>
<PARA> under this revised procedure refugee determination will be made according to the application of these criteria on an individual basis;</PARA>
<PARA> despite these changes, persons who cannot meet the refugee criteria may be eligible for entry under special humanitarian programs or migration criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements will be brought into effect as soon as possible. Selection assessments will be made by Australian officials who will be operating under criteria which is quite consistent with the United Nations Convention definition . These new procedures will replace the former practice of relying on mandate status accorded by UNHCR. While in no way derogating from the helpful role played by UNHCR in assisting us with determinations in the past it is entirely appropriate that Australia should now employ its own procedures. The decision to do this brings our practice into line with arrangements provided for under the Convention itself. This arrangement will ensure that determinations of status are made responsibly and with compassion. As in the past, our refugee officials will continue to work closely with the High Commissioner for Refugees whose role will continue to be an integral and important element in the development of the Government's refugee policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In this latter context, I would like to say that the Government and indeed the world community is particularly indebted to the office of the High Commissioner for its efforts on behalf of refugees. Honourable members will recall that the office of the High Commissioner was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1981. I would like to take this opportunity to say that the Government will continue its strong support for the High Commissioner's efforts in providing humanitarian assistance to all refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision taken by the Government on individual determinations has not been taken in isolation. As I have said elsewhere, the decision was arrived at only after careful consideration of the approach being taken by other governments and UNHCR and, where appropriate, after extensive consultation. Countries of first asylum are continuing to accept a heavy share of the refugee burden. There are many countries in this situation around the world but I have in mind here particularly the countries of South East Asia and Austria which are generously providing temporary refuge for a large number of asylum seekers and, in doing so , continue to demonstrate a humanitarian willingness to provide assistance to those who seek it, pending the development of durable solutions for those people . </PARA>
<PARA> Where persons have been classified as refugees, Australia will continue to give priority consideration to those refugees with family in Australia. This again is also in accordance with international practice. The Government has decided to terminate two minor programs-those for White Russians and Christian minority groups in the Middle East. The claims of those of the White Russian group and Middle East Christians will, in future, be assessed against other criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> The program for White Russians commenced post-World War II and has accomplished its objective. The program-under which 12,000 people have come to Australia-will wind down with effect from 30 June 1982. This date has been decided upon in order to ensure that any persons who still wish to be considered have adequate time to come forward. Any future claims by such persons will be considered against normal criteria for migration. The program for Christian minorities from the Middle East ceased as a refugee program with effect from 31 December 1981. Persons in this group are eligible for consideration under the provisions of the special humanitarian program along with other Middle East minority groups experiencing similar difficulties, discrimination and hardship. Persons within those groups are assessed on a case by case basis and, on the basis of their present general circumstances, they are more likely to be accepted under the special humanitarian program than as refugees. The record of some individuals may, however, justify their being accorded refugee status, and the appropriate priority and assisted passage, which is not available to persons coming under the special humanitarian program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided to increase the program for refugee resettlement from South America. There is a growing number of South American nationals who are in need of resettlement. Accordingly, we have, in consultation with the UNHCR, enlarged both numerically and geographically our South American program to cater for persons from South America who can satisfy criteria for refugee status and resettlement in Australia. The situation of refugees in this area and their needs and wishes with regard to resettlement are still being assessed by Australia and the international agencies. At present the numbers seeking resettlement in Australia are quite small. This is because of geographically inspired traditional attitudes-most think automatically of resettlement in North America or Western Europe. Generations of displaced persons from South America have settled in North America and Western Europe. It is natural that the overwhelming majority now displaced will seek to go there also, especially as they often have relatives there. Gradually, however, more will come to Australia and join the small but successfully settled band of South Americans already here. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also decided that it will no longer announce individual program ceilings for particular refugee groups. This will enable us to have maximum flexibility in responding to different or changing situations without creating undue expectations. The outcome of those decisions will be obvious at the end of each financial year. In line with these moves we have also been looking at other ways of dealing with the problems of displaced people other than those who are refugees. I expect, for example, that the recently announced special humanitarian program will provide new alternatives to refugee resettlement, particularly for those in difficult circumstances or with family ties in Australia who cannot satisfy refugee criteria. Displaced persons who do not qualify for refugee status are now being interviewed in various parts of the world and I would expect the next financial year's intake figures to reflect substantial benefits to individuals and to Australia as a result of this program . </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of concern for South East Asia and Australia has been the continuing outflow of persons from Vietnam. I have had a series of discussions with my counterparts in Malaysia and Thailand about ways in which it might be possible to deter the outflow of persons making extremely hazardous journeys in small boats from Vietnam. The plight of people on those voyages has often been frightful and has aroused pity, horror and anger simultaneously in the hearts of those of us who have seen the results of those experiences. For this reason, we have been negotiating with Vietnam for an orderly departure program from Vietnam to Australia. Without such an arrangement, desperate people will always find a way around the moratorium on illegal departures imposed by Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> In all of my dealings with Australians of Vietnamese origin I have stressed the fact that negotiations on an orderly departure program from Vietnam of their relatives might not be possible for some time. I am, however, delighted to announce to the House today that following a negotiating visit by officers of my department to Hanoi last week, an arrangement has been reached in principle with the Vietnamese Government. The arrangement, which comes after some years of negotiations, is based on globally applied migration procedures. The emphasis of the program will be on the reunification of families parted in the tragic circumstances of the last seven years. It is hoped that movement to Australia will begin after procedural arrangements have been finalised over the next couple of months. The successful conclusion of this arrangement is a pleasing and positive development and, I consider, reflects a willingness on the part of the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to resolve a difficult humanitarian problem in a spirit of goodwill and co-operation. In talking of co- operation, perhaps I could observe at this point how important to Australia has been the new aspect of our relationship with South East Asian countries as a result of the refugee program. </PARA>
<PARA> The decisions I have announced today will be of significant benefit to genuine refugees who wish to resettle in Australia. It will mean that Australian resettlement opportunities will be available only to those most in need and whose claims are legitimate. Those not satisfying refugee or special humanitarian criteria must compete for migration to Australia with one million other migrant seekers annually. I am particularly pleased to recognise the role of the Parliament itself in a parallel study of these questions and to note that the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in its report on the Indo-Chinese problem commends our management of the problem to date in both its domestic and international aspects and shares my view of the changing nature of the outflow and the need to adjust our approach. In identifying myself with the Committee's report I wish to extend my personal thanks and congratulations to the officers of my Department for the splendid job they have done under extremely difficult circumstances. Australia has reason to be indebted to them and proud of them. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the present review, I can renew assurances to people in Australia that our generous humanitarian response is directed only to those in genuine need. This is particularly important to people who are seeking to bring their families to Australia under normal migration criteria. These measures do not represent any diminution of Australia's commitment as a major refugee resettlement country. On the contrary, we are extending that humanitarian commitment. The present overall program for refugee and special humanitarian entry is now 24,500, the highest intake ever in this category. My recent announcements of an increased intake of Polish refugees in this current year illustrate that Australia stands ready to respond to new and sudden refugee situations. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's response to the Polish crisis is well known but should be restated briefly here. In conjunction with the UNHCR, Austria and all major resettlement countries, we have processed applications of Poles outside Poland in accordance with their wishes. The majority have not sought resettlement but have preferred to extend their temporary legal status wherever they now are until the situation in Poland becomes clearer and they can seek reunification with their families either in or outside Poland. No Pole outside Poland has been induced to seek resettlement by the actions of other governments and very few have sought to leave those European countries nearest to Poland. The reaction of all interested governments has been most humane and responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach has also been advocated by Australians of Polish origin and close consultation is being maintained between them and my Department. As a result, the global figure for refugee and special humanitarian programs announced in the 1981-82 Budget has been increased by a further 2,000 persons to help relieve the congestion in Austria and Germany amongst Poles who are determined not to return to Poland. Special procedures have also been introduced to cope with the unexpected volume of migration applications as distinct from refugees. Of the order of 4,400 Polish refugees and over 1,400 Polish migrants are expected to arrive in Australia this financial year and, in addition to that, there will be approximately another 1,600 East European refugees. This intake is expected to be numerically higher on a per capita basis than that of any other country. We are not, however, endeavouring to outbid other countries but are working with them to meet the best interests of the displaced persons and their families. This situation is under continual review and we will continue to make the appropriate response in terms of changes within Poland and the interests and wishes of the individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> I might add that while our global approach to these humanitarian programs gives us great flexibility there is no prospect of our extending other programs at the expense of our principal regional obligations regarding Indo-Chinese refugees. The decision to tighten criteria while increasing our intake is a realistic and fair response to a changing situation and is not a reflection on the integrity of those members of the Australian community who came to Australia as refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been dealing primarily with the processing of refugees overseas. The same definition and criteria are used for persons claiming refugee status in Australia and in the application of that policy within Australia similar considerations apply to those I have mentioned. Thus, it should not be easier or harder to be accepted in Australia as a refugee than it is outside Australia and persons who arrive illegally or on visitor's visas ought not to be able to stay permanently in Australia unless they are refugees or otherwise produce the most compelling compassionate reasons. That indeed is the law of Australia agreed upon unanimously by the present Parliament. Just as persons cannot circumvent Australian immigration law and policy outside Australia, they cannot do so inside Australia. People without refugee status or the special humanitarian criteria announced by me in this House on 18 November last cannot gain preference over other applicants for migration. Similarly, persons who come to Australia either illegally or as a temporary entrant cannot stay in preference to others in a similar situation simply because they do not wish to return home. If they were able to do this we would have no control at all over our immigration policy. Indeed, with over a million visitors coming to Australia each year we would have no policy if every tourist, stowaway or deserter were allowed to stay on some pretext, thereby circumventing migration interviews, health checks and security clearances. </PARA>
<PARA> Random settlement by persons not going through immigration procedures overseas could cause enormous dislocation to our labour market and to our internal stability and security. The whole point of our immigration policy is to meet Australia's requirements. For this reason the Government established a Determination of Refugee Status Committee to examine all claims in Australia for refugee status. That Committee contains senior officials from all relevant departments and has an observer from the UNHCR. It is swamped with applications, mostly from persons who have only very slim claims to refugee status. That Committee makes recommendations to me and such is its professionalism that I can recall rejecting its advice on only rare occasions.</PARA>
<PARA> All of that will seem logical and fair to almost all Australians and would generally not require a statement at such length. I do so simply because a vocal minority of Australians of East European origin refuse to accept the appropriateness of that policy. Such persons desire us to accept anyone who arrives in Australia from a Soviet bloc country in Europe regardless of whether that person had any record of political or other activity which might have brought him or her within the definition of refugee referred to earlier. That simply has never been the policy of this or any other Australian Government so far as I have been able to ascertain. Some cases might have given that impression, especially before we had so many applications and the formal machinery for ensuring consistency. But we do now have that machinery and when the confidential records of cases are compared, consistency is achieved. Because cases must be treated confidentially by the Determination of Refugee Status Committee-the DORS Committee-neither it nor the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs feels really free to comment on cases lest the interests of individuals be harmed. This is often so even when other people make aspects of the case public. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of that situation is the recent highly publicised case of the Romanian soccer player, Mr Gheorge Viscreanu, who sought but was not accorded refugee status. His application, as with every other claimant, was examined and determined in full accord with principles and procedures as set out by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Honourable members will recall that the Determination of Refugee Status Committee concluded unanimously that on the basis of the information obtained from the detailed interview with Mr Viscreanu he had no well-founded fear of persecution. A representative of the UNHCR as an observer of that Committee participated fully in its deliberations. It was on this basis that refugee status was refused. Neither in his ill-advised media comments not in his interviews did Mr Viscreanu ever say anything critical of his Government, country or his life at home. On the contrary, he acknowledged that he and his family were well treated. Consequently, when assurances were received by the Australian Government from the Romanian Government that Mr Viscreanu would not suffer any reprisals following his return home there was no reasonable ground for his staying. We need to bear in mind that literally hundreds of thousands of other people who visit Australia on visas similar to that of Mr Viscreanu are refused the right to change of status when their reasons for wanting to stay are never less than his and sometimes-because of family connections here-are greater. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus it will be clear that for Mr Viscreanu to have been allowed to stay thousands of others would have had an injustice done to them. The fact is that he was induced to stay by someone more intent on publicly embarrassing the Romanian Government than on considering Mr Viscreanu's wellbeing. Others in the soccer team who received similar approaches declined to leave the team. I have no doubt that once the glamorous aspects of Australian life lost their novelty and he realised that at the age of 20 he would never see his family again he would have undergone the same change of heart as Miss Gasinskaya about whom I have spoken in the Parliament before. People who induce others to seek to stay in Australia and who try to get media attention in the process often lose sight of the interests of the individuals and disrupt their lives for many years to come. In the case of Mr Viscreanu certain media interests paid Mr Viscreanu's Australian sponsor for exclusive story rights. Exclusive stories from secret hiding places might have provided sensational scoops but were not relevant to the functioning of the DORS Committee or my consideration of its recommendation. Nor was the publicity of any benefit to Mr Viscreanu. </PARA>
<PARA> Our policy is a most humane one and it is administered most fairly. We can only deal with refugee applications individually and we cannot accept people merely because they come from totalitarian countries. To do so when they are not refugees and have no other special compassionate reasons would only prejudice persons from democratic countries whose claims to remain in Australia are as strong or stronger. Our immigration policy is non-discriminatory on the grounds of race; our refugee policy is likewise. The refugee criteria are universally applied in order to ensure that the concept of refugee status is not diluted to the ultimate detriment of genuine refugees. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not use 28 minutes because I do not think it is necessary for me to do so. However, I will send the honourable member a copy of what I say in case he is not in the chamber. There can be no confusion as to where we on this side of the House stand in regard to the taking of refugees into Australia. We consider the policy in this area to be of enormous importance. Personally, I think perhaps what Australia has done in the last six years on the question of refugees has been far more influential in our region than any initiative we may have taken in any other policy area of foreign affairs or defence. It seems to me that our neighbours have a much different view of Australia as a result of what Australia has done in a most humanitarian way over the past six years specifically in regard to the Indo-Chinese refugees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I say too much about the Minister's statement, let me put it in the context of what we are up against when we start talking about refugees. The most talked of figure of the number of refugees in the world is about 10 million. This is contained in the annual report of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and I think that the Minister also mentions it. My inquiries from the United Nations tell me that it regards somewhere between 10 million and 16 million as the number and that 14 million is regarded as a quite conservative figure of the number of refugees in the world. The figure is broken up in the following way: There are 6.3 million refugees in Africa; 3.1 million in Asia, which includes 1.4 million from Afghanistan; 200,000 in Latin America and 3.5 million in the Middle East. I am informed that the count is made on the basis of their having been registered as refugees with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers those figures it seems that what Australia is doing perhaps pales into insignificance alongside the total number of people in the world who are displaced. This raises the point that Australia and all the other countries, such as the United States of America, Canada and France, which are taking steps to try to see that some refugees are given a new home, can never possibly entertain the idea that we can continue with this plan in the hope that we can overcome the massive problem. More people are being displaced each day than we can take into our own countries. Political settlement must always receive the priority of what we are doing in this area. We think it is of enormous importance that the Government does more in the political arena about the refugee question. Some problems may look as if they cannot be solved but it seems to me rather ironic and sad that the Government, which said so much about Afghanistan during the Olympic Games, has gone silent on the matter when 1.4 million Afghans have been pushed out of their country by the invading armies of the Soviet Union. The only way we will be able to solve that question is to put sufficient pressure on the Soviet Union to get out of Afghanistan so those people can go back to where they want to go. Those people do not want to come to Australia and the United States. They want to return to the place they call their home-that is, Afghanistan. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one question on which the Government has gone silent. Obviously it has gone silent because our trade with the Soviet Union has quadrupled in the last four years. Everything that we sell to the Soviet Union, such as wool, wheat and primary products, has become a far more important political weapon than talking about people who have lost their homes. It is estimated that something like 20 per cent of the population of Afghanistan has been either killed or displaced since the invasion by the Soviet Union. This Parliament is almost virtually silent on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area about which we ought to be saying more-I thank the Minister for including it in his remarks-is the question of Latin America. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said, on one occasion that I know of in the Parliament, that he felt that perhaps President Reagan had adopted the right path in relation to El Salvador. We are pushing people out of El Salvador as we tried to push people out of Nicaragua. Again there is no way that we can solve the problem of the numbers of people who will be displaced in Latin America. We ought to be adopting a far more constructive attitude in trying to bring about a political settlement in those areas in the way in which France and Mexico initiated the moves to bring about a political settlement in El Salvador so that we are not faced with the problem of making up our minds about how many people we can take from these areas. This situation applies in many parts of the world. Australia is a small country. I suspect that when we travel overseas we realise how insignificant we are in world events and how insignificant our influence is on these matters. However, our voice ought to be continually raised. Taking 20, 000 or 25,000 refugees-as magnificent as that may be on the local scene in Australia-is only a token effort towards the total settlement of having up to 16 million people settled back in their respective countries. On those matters it seems to me the Government ought to be more vocal. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question to which I wish to refer also concerns refugees-how many there are and what percentage they comprise of our total migrant intake. I think that we have been enormously fortunate in the way in which refugees have been settled in Australia. Since World War II something like 400,000 refugees have been settled successfully in Australia. We can break this into different periods of history. The more relevant question now concerns the number we are taking at the moment, or have taken during the last three or four years, and from where they came. The Minister's statement makes it pretty obvious in terms of Indo- China, now that we have, thankfully, made a proper arrangement with the Government of Vietnam, that people coming out of Vietnam in the future will go through the normal channels of migration. They will not be classified as refugees. I will refer to that in a moment because I know that a number of members of the Vietnamese community in Australia will not be terribly happy with that interpretation. They think that many of their people who are being persecuted within Vietnam should be classified as refugees because of the way in which they are being treated. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I have held the post of Opposition shadow Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, I have pushed for more parliamentary activity on this matter in an effort to overview what we are doing. According to the figures given to us by the Minister our refugee intake will be-leaving aside the movements between New Zealand and Australia-somewhere in the vicinity of 25 per cent of our total migrant intake. As that figure has grown, it means that there are fewer opportunities for would-be migrants from other areas to make application and be successful in reaching our shores. Such decisions can cause some friction. I have raised this matter because it seems to me-we are not sure what the immediate future holds, but there is a great deal of concern in the community- that perhaps if the Western world is on the brink of another short term recession that the labour force will suffer as a result. This raises the question about our capacity to settle successfully the numbers of people which we are now entertaining. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not protest on behalf of my side of the House about the numbers because we have spoken about the matter on a number of occasions. We have said publicly, both inside and outside of the Parliament, that we find no great cause for alarm . Of course, the unemployment figures which were published last week showed a very steep decline in employment opportunities in Australia. Obviously people will be concerned about what the future holds. If the trend for the rest of 1982 and 1983 follows a similar path to that indicated in the unemployment figures of last week, surely there will be a lot more discussion in Australia about the number of people who come here and the great difficulty that refugees suffer. My remarks are not confined to any particular group. Even if any migrants do have professions they usually have to work in a semi-skilled or unskilled area. They are concentrated in that area of employment which is suffering the worst consequences at the moment in Australia. We have to keep our eye on the situation. I will cite some figures to the Parliament in a moment regarding what is happening to refugees as far as the labour force is concerned. The Opposition is very much a part of the sentiment that will continue to allow Australia to be one of the countries taking refugees. We have done some work on the question of what other countries are doing. This is not a decision that Australia can take in isolation, nor is it a position into which we should be conned by other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The rhetoric on refugees can become rather acute at times. One hears people overseas saying what they intend to do in encouraging people to leave their home countries. A similar situation now exists in Poland. When the Poles reach Austria the Austrians ask around the Western democracies where they should send all these Poles. There is a certain reluctance on behalf of those people with the loud voices, who told the Poles to leave Poland in the first place, to see them settled. Austria has been left with an enormous burden of trying to settle these people in its community. As the Minister said in his statement, in some cases it suits a lot of Polish people, especially those who have been separated from their families, to stay as close as possible to Poland. That is because they have hopes of reunification with their families when things settle down in Poland, or perhaps they think that it may be easier to get their families out if they stay in Austria. Nonetheless, there has been a reluctance, it seems, on the part of the United States of America particularly, to follow through its sabre rattling with a better attitude towards settling the Polish refugees. I am told that the United States of America has pledged to take 9,000 of them in 1982. Numerically, compared with us, that is a pretty poor performance. I know that the Americans put up a Congressman called Derwinski-one would not have to be Einstein to guess his background-and he said that it would go from 9,000 to 100, 000 this year. However, in talking to people who are part of the congressional committee on immigration and refugees-a committee which I have told the Minister we ought also to have here-there is no doubt that there are strong views against any large escalation of the intake by the United States of refugees from anywhere in the world, so it is unlikely that Ed Derwinski will get his way. </PARA>
<PARA> Canada is pledged to take 6,000 refugees from Eastern Europe, but there is a mix up there because of the sponsorship scheme which Canada has, apart from its official scheme. It may be that there will have to be more international negotiations about the sort of things that ought to be done in regard to acceptance of refugees, so that each country is carrying its fair burden. We should not say to the Australian people: 'You will carry more than your fair share'. Perhaps a case could be made out that we should carry more than our fair share of the people who come from our region. But Poland is hardly in our region . The Polish people who have left their country, through whatever circumstances, and are left in want in Austria should be treated fairly by all the people in that country or whatever country it may be. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to give some idea of the figures, 963,000 Indo-Chinese refugees were resettled up until 1980-44,000 in Australia, 435,000 in the United Stated, 252, 000 back in China, 70,000 in France, and 70,000 in Canada. Of course, those figures will change as a result of the debates taking place in each of those countries. Between June 1976 and June 1981 72,972 persons came to Australia under refugee status-50,040 from Indo-China, 9,296 from part of Eastern Europe, 3,926 Jewish people from the Soviet Union, 7,470 people from Lebanon, 666 White Russians from China, and 1,574 others. That also, I think, gives some idea of the emphasis that we want placed on the Latin America area, to which the Minister referred in his statement, because the people from that area come into the category 'others'. Obviously this is an area which has been ignored. Traditionally they have looked to Western Europe and the United States. Judging from the attitude of the United States in sending back people who are reaching there from El Salvador-some of them, I would think, to almost certain death-we shall have to have a far more humane attitude to those people who are trying to get out as a result of the conflict in that country. We should never lose sight of the fact that the only way in which we shall solve that problem in the long term is with a political settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> I want also to refer further to the Minister's remarks. He talks about passing off many of the groups of people to the special humanitarian program. It may be that it will be a very difficult task for any government to treat the special humanitarian program on the basis of individuals, because there are many groups of people in the world who are among minorities in their own countries and who are being persecuted by a majority government. They do not see the persecution in individual stands. They see the persecution of the community. I refer to what the Minister said last year in his statement of 18 November, as reported at page 3068 of Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> This program has been developed within the broad philosophy of the Government's refugee policy. It will enable Australia to provide a humanitarian response, outside formal refugee programs, in instances of substantial discrimination or human rights violations against oppressed minorities anywhere in the world by governments irrespective of their political persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Oppressive regimes and governments whose policies have little regard for basic human rights inevitably cause an outflow across national borders of members of minority groups at risk. We are becoming inreasingly aware of the plight of such people, whose numbers are increasing also. Often, these displaced persons are unable to satisfy the internationally accepted criteria of defining refugees. </PARA>
<PARA>I understood from the Minister that perhaps at sometime in the not too distant future he will be following up that statement by telling us how he sees the special humanitarian program operating. Reading from his statement today, there will be a fair overlap of application by people who consider themselves eligible under the special humanatarian program and people who may have previously seen themselves as part of the total group of refugees applying to come here. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that last year, on 20 October, a document, which may have been sent to all of us, from the Vietnamese community in Australia outlined the problems that it saw with the changing attitudes that were occurring in Australia as a result of the debate about who was a refugee, because we were sticking strickly, as the Minister said in his statement today, to the United Nations definition-that one had to be outside one's country, that one could not go back, that one was afraid of persecution. We recognised that and classified the person in question as a refugee. But the Vietnamese community wrote to us and said: 'If you are going to do that, you will be ignoring the plight of many of the people in our country who still want to get out of Vietnam and who are still being persecuted for a number of reasons'. This document states:</PARA>
<PARA> Since the first groups of people who left during the last few days of the Saigon regime up until now, there have been about 630,000 refugees coming out of Vietnam. Yet we must remember there were 1,200,000 soldiers in the Republic's Army, over 200,000 police and between 600,000 and 800,000 pubic servants before April 1975. That is we have not counted the few hundred thousand people who worked for the Americans and the allies, in various capacities. Now, if we take into consideration their families, including wives, children and others, we are in for some 10 million people. Comparing this figure with the number of people who have already left, we see the fallacy of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the argument of people who say that those who want to leave Vietnam have already left. Then the document poses the question:</PARA>
<PARA> If there are so many people, how can any country help all? From our first hand experiences, we know the desire to runaway from tyranny is always there, but that is not going to be the decisive factor. The overriding factor is whether the people have the ability to do what they wish to do. As of now, that important factor is diminished every day. The good boats are gone. It is increasingly difficult to find boats in the country. It is getting more and more difficult to find the fuel (State owned and even the State is short of it). The equipment for sea going such as compasses and sea charts are no longer available . In addition the Government's patrols are getting tougher and tougher and more and more efficient. People may say you can buy off the officials. That is partly true but you can buy only one locality, not all of them along the way. Therefore the chance of being arrested is always big. It is also known that the longer people stay in the country, the less able they can afford the price to buy off the officials. </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. There were persecutions in Vietnam as a result of people not wanting to serve in the army in Kampuchea. There was persecution because the person happened to have been a professional person. There was persecution because the person had faith which was not in favour with the regime. In spite of the arrangement which we on this side of the House would welcome whereby the Vietnamese Government will allow orderly departure, perhaps many of these things can be fixed up. But if it is to be on the basis of family reunion, which is now one of the major criteria for the operation of the immigration laws as they will apply from 19 April, there are many people in Vietnam who consider themselves being persecuted, who will not have a member of their family outside Vietnam and who, according to our laws, we are now cutting off. I do not know that there is terribly much we can do about it, but we have to take that into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude, I want to refer to the problems of the refugees once they have arrived in Australia. I realise that the Minister's statement dealt only with the question of intake and the interpretation of 'refugee', but I do not think it is possible for the Parliament to discuss the matter without looking broadly at what may happen to these people when they arrive in Australia. That, indeed, is the essence of how successful we will be in the future. If they are not settled satisfactorily, our refugee program is going to drift with the tide and end up on the rocks. In spite of how humane we may feel, if the majority or a very large proportion of the people we bring here cannot find employment or cannot keep their families and if there is friction between the local community and the new arrivals, obviously a lot of people in the community will be very upset and angry and they will question the wisdom of continuing with this campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in comparison to other immigrant categories, a very high proportion of refugees enter the labour force. About 44 per cent of all migrants who arrived in 1980-81 entered the labour force compared with 54 per cent of refugees. As I said earlier, an extremely high proportion of refugees is semi-skilled or unskilled. In 1980-81, 92 per cent of refugees were in this group compared with 51 per cent of migrants. The refugees appear to have a higher unemployment rate than any other migrant group. The figures show that about 20 per cent of recent refugee arrivals were unemployed at the end of 1981. This figure compares with 10 per cent unemployment for general eligibility migrants, or a national average, as it was then, of 6.3 per cent. One need go no further to establish that refugees have a far more difficult task in settling into this country than other migrants. It may be that the post-settlement services which we have are not adequate or it may be that we are looking at figures that are produced at a time when the overall economic recession in this country is making it increasingly unfavourable to people in this category-semi-skilled and unskilled-to come into the country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, I think our refugee program is of enormous importance to any cultural differences which may be in our makeup. I think it is enormously important on how people see us because it has meant, particularly in the last six years-I pay credit where it is due-that we have safely buried, for all time, the white Australia policy. There may be groups of people or individuals in Australia who are not totally happy with that, but nonetheless that is what the last six years has done; it has been an enormously important step for Australia. Inasmuch as we have taken that attitude primarily to the people who were displaced in Indo-China, we must now balance the books and see that people who are unsettled in other areas are looked at in the same even-handed way that we went about the problems in Indo-China. We must sit down with other countries which are taking refugees to see that we are all sharing the responsibility of the numbers of these peoples that can be settled. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 'State of the Nation' speech delivered by the Prime Minister last Tuesday we were told that, by 1985, Western Europe and North America expect to have 28 million people unemployed. That is not the sort of scenario one would draw as likely to make people more enthusiastic about taking migrants and refugees. Such predictions can lead to a challenge to build up in communities to migrant and refugee intakes, so we might face even greater problems in the future than we have. I think that aspect has to be looked at. Most of all, if we are going to do something deliberate and positive about the enormous problem of refugees in the world, we have to be consistent about our political attitudes in order to get these people settled back in their own countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We did not need all the fanfare and nonsense that the Prime Minister carried on with in relation to the 1980 Olympic Games. We needed a consistent opposition to the positioning of Soviet troops in Afghanistan. We still need it. It should be highlighted because of the way those people have been treated. We should tell President Reagan that he is wrong in his policy towards Latin America. We should support the French and the Mexicans in trying to bring about a political settlement in that area so as not to displace thousands more people. We should take the initiative wherever we can to see that the problems are solved in a political sense and not give the appearance, as we may have done in the past, of lifting everbody's hopes in Asia, Latin America or Africa that for all time we are going to be able to take increasing numbers of refugees. Our refugee program should not be aimed at telling the people who live in those unfortunate circumstances that Australia, the United States of America, France or Canada is the end of the rainbow. This is not the sort of policy that should be involved in rainbow-type politics. Leave that to Doug Anthony and Phil Lynch when they talk about their resources boom. When we are talking about people, we know that we can accept a certain number, but that it will not solve the problem. We should not lift their hopes too high. We should always be truthful with the people who come to live in this country about what we are able to do. We should be truthful with our own community about what we are doing and why we are doing it so that we can carry out the program successfully, but we should at all times take a consistent approach to the political problems that are causing such high numbers of people to be displaced from their own countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin by congratulating the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) on a detailed, comprehensive and exceedingly thoughtful address to this House. May I also say that I commend very much what the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) said in his very thoughtful address and note in passing that he used his full allocation of 28 minutes, as no doubt the exuberance of the situation and his own interest in this most compelling subject drew him along.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to comment upon some aspects of the Minister's statement and upon one of two of the points raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. I welcome the decision which has been made to tighten the criteria and procedures for immigration and to determine eligibility on an individual basis. I think the determination of eligibility on an individual basis and the tightening of the criteria for refugees is a right and just decision. It is one which recognises that our capacity to take refugees is limited and that the humanitarian duty is owed to those who are genuine refugees. This House will be aware that not so long ago a boat-load of so-called refugees arrived on the shores of this country and after examination it was found that they had in fact come with carefully prepared stories to present to the Australian authorities, with the purpose of convincing the authorities that they were genuine refugees from Indo-China. The falsity of the stories was discovered and deportation orders were made. It is exactly that kind of situation that we should not have to face. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, no matter how generally compassionate one may feel towards people who wish for a variety of reasons to leave Indo-China-for example, Vietnam-but who are not themselves there subject to persecution but who wish to leave for economic reasons in order to have a more pleasant life and to resettle in a country which offers them much greater opportunities, we must always recognise that, if we allow those people to be automatically classified as refugees, we would be closing off the avenue for other people who are genuine refugees and also closing off from coming into this country other people who would apply under our migration program. It is perfectly plain and it is acknowledged by all sides that we can take only a limited number of people into this country. The honourable member for Port Adelaide made the point, and made it very forthrightly, that over the last six years the Government's record in the field of settlement of refugees in Australia has been an outstanding one. He said, and I agree with him entirely, that this has altered perceptions of Australians in South East Asia and elsewhere throughout Asia. That such an alteration in perception is necessary goes almost without saying when one considers that we are a country situated in South East Asia, and therefore it is simply not open to us to seek to pursue what used to be called the white Australia policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree entirely with the reasons put forward by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. I agree with what the Government has done in that area and I agree with the Opposition's attitude to the settlement of refugees and to the abolition of the white Australia policy. It may be said in passing that the Government's record of resettlement of refugees from Indo-China contrasts very favourably with that of some other countries. The honourable member for Port Adelaide instanced some. May I just instance one other country. Japan, I think, by July 1981 had resettled 1,510 refugees from Vietnam, which is hardly a major contribution to the difficulties that that problem occasions us all. The next point that I should like to comment upon is the break through. I hope that there has indeed been a break through in our relations with the Vietnam Government. I hope that that break through will mean that the migration of people from Vietnam will be dealt with in an orderly, humane and just fashion. It remains to be seen whether this is so, but the Minister and all those who have worked on this matter are to be commended for reaching what appears at this stage to be an agreement in principle. </PARA>
<PARA> Next, I should like to comment on the decision no longer to announce individual programs for particular groups. I think we all agree that this decision is correct because quite obviously not only are the expectations of particular groups raised, since they come to think that they have, as it were, a right to have an allocation of a certain number in every year, but also so long as that kind of program is in place it can mean that others, people who are refugees, people who need to be resettled throughout the world, who need resettlement here , will suffer. One knows that refugees are like tides. That they come and they go depending upon political events. A war occasions a vast outpouring of population because of the misery that people experience and we must be flexible enough to meet the infinite variety of changing circumstances so that where the need arises we can move to give some measures of assistance to the people who are in need. I noted this comment by the Minister in his statement:</PARA>
<PARA> I might add that while our global approach to these humanitarian programs gives us great flexibility there is no prospect of our extending other programs at the expense of our principal regional obligations regarding Indo-Chinese refugees. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope-I think I correctly understand the Minister-that that does not mean that there will be any iron-class allocation for Indo-Chinese refugees which must always be met, notwithstanding the other claims that may arise from time to time . </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter on which I should like to comment is the announcement of the decision that those who leave Soviet bloc countries should not be allowed in as a matter of right. I agree entirely with that decision. One only need look at what took place not so long ago when there was a great outpouring of so-called refugees from Cuba. When they arrived in Florida many of them were greeted as people who had fled from Castro's Cuba and from communism. But an examination of the facts turned up some rather interesting refugees. It seemed that Dr Castro may have been cleansing his gaols at the expense of the United States of America . Many of the refugees who arrived there were not refugees and would be of no assistance to the United States. They would be nothing but a detriment to the country. Obviously enough, just because people come from Soviet bloc countries it does not follow that they have an entitlement to be regarded as having a certain status which puts them ahead of others. I am glad, therefore, that that statement has been very clearly made and that it is very clearly part of Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Port Adelaide, whilst paying a generous tribute to the Government's resettlement program, did say that what one should look at is the need for political solutions. In principle, I entirely agree with him. But one knows how very difficult it is to impose political solutions in this world. One need only look at the confused state of South East Asia, where the refugee problem is most acute, to realise how difficult the imposition of political solutions is. One need only look at Africa, to see the wars which are in progress there, the civil wars which have caused such vast dislocation to the populations, to know how really impossible it is, often, in fact almost always, to achieve acceptable political solutions. Let us by all means aim for them, but let us remember the political realities. The honourable member referred in particular to Afghanistan and to the Government's record there. I think there are one or two points that the House should be aware of in that respect. First of all, the Government's direct relief aid to refugees from Afghanistan has to date been $12m. Secondly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has never declared Afghans as refugees for resettlement. As I understand matters, repatriation is their wish and that is also the aim of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Of course repatriation would fit very well with the views espoused by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude with two remarks. In the first place, there is an acknowledged limit on the number of refugees we can bring into this country. That limit depends upon a whole variety of circumstances. It depends upon the state of the economy. It depends upon the strain that bringing in refugees may impose on the social fabric of the country. As well, the number of refugees brought in every year affects the number of people who are entitled to apply and to be received in Australia as migrants. So one needs always to engage in a very fine exercise of judgment as between refugees and migrants, how many refugees we can accept at any one time and where those refugees should come from. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I wish to make is that if we are to have a successful program in place for the assessment on an individual basis of refugee status, we need to have highly skilled staff. It is also necessary, if we are to get the maximum benefit out of this program, that we give the greatest amount of publicity to the Government's policy so that those overseas who may think that by one means or another they can get to this country and somehow be accepted as refugees when plainly they are not will realise that there is no easy entry into this country, except as a genuine refugee or as a migrant who is legally allowed into this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am terribly sorry to have to say that we have just heard one of the worst speeches I have ever heard. It was a typical speech from a Liberal WASP in the worst sense of the word. The White Anglo-Saxon Protestant view came through in the very worst sense of the term in the speech of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). He has never been under threat anywhere. He makes legalistic distinctions between what he considers to be real and unreal refugees. He shows no compassion whatsoever for people. He has a complete lack of compassion for or understanding of people who are living under totalitarian regimes. He slandered hundreds of thousands of Cubans on the basis of statements made by Castro that he was only getting rid of criminals. As far as Castro's Cuba is concerned, anybody who wants to leave is by definition a criminal. The honourable member for North Sydney goes berserk when someone makes an allegation against somebody like the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) who has every chance of defending himself but he is prepared in this House to slander hundreds of thousands of people who in many cases go to a hell of a lot of trouble and undergo a terrific number of risks to escape. He slanders them as being poor and terrible potential migrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He talks about people being under no real threat. Has he been to East Berlin? Has he seen what people have to go through to get across that wall, to go through the minefield, to get on a train from East Germany to go to West Germany ? The train stops and the military get on board and the muzzles are taken off the german shepherd dogs which get underneath the train to check for people. People try to get across the minefield and are subject to all of those things. Yet the honourable member for North Sydney slanders them as being economic refugees, people who want to better themselves. He says they are under no real threat. Undoubtedly they are under no real threat. Until such time as they take the step of getting on to the minefield or trying to get on to the train they are under no threat, unless they make public statements. But these people are under threat because they want to live in a free country, in a non-totalitarian country. Therefore, they are under threat. As far as I am concerned, it is a very depressing situation when a member who pretends to be a liberal in the good sense of the word, as it used to be used in olden days in respect of a person with liberal tendencies, has this complete and utter lack of compassion for people who live under a totalitarian regime. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SH4">Dr KLUGMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was commenting on the unfeeling remarks by the honourable member for North Sydney in this debate on a statement on refugees delivered by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) this afternoon. I pointed out that to my mind he had shown a complete lack of compassion for refugees. Whenever the question of refugees, or immigration for that matter, is debated in this House, I usually try to participate in the discussion. The reason for that and why I am concerned about the plight of refugees can be summarised this way. Firstly, it is a huge problem . There are millions of people who risk their lives because all else has been already denied them. Some 14 million people are actual refugees at present. There is no doubt in my mind that there would be many millions more refugees if people had the chance to leave those countries which produce most of the refugees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I am concerned because these flights of men, women, children, infants , teachers, labourers, writers, simple peasants, doctors and shop keepers tell us more about the world in which we live than any other phenomenon. The willingness to risk life, to lose all one has ever had and accumulated, to leave family, friends and the land where one has been brought up is as accurate a thermometer of the health and sickness of the countries from which people flee and of the countries from which people do not flee, and is as precise an indicator of an unpleasant situation in those countries as are the degrees on a clinical thermometer an indicator of the temperature of a patient. </PARA>
<PARA> We have United Nations charters on human rights, we have the Helsinki agreements, decisions and definitions of human rights. When we look at it, how laborious, imprecise and partial a measure those charters are of the violations of decency. A measure so much more exact is available. Where do people flee from and where do they flee to? Basically it is a question of people voting with their feet. As far as I am concerned, any country which has a significant number of refugees, and especially a country where refugees are prevented from leaving, is a bad country. The country which accepts refugees, or which at least does not have refugees, is basically a country in which people accept the set-up in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn for a couple of minutes to the position in my own electorate of Prospect to point out that the people of Prospect are concerned about refugees. We have large numbers of them. We have a large community of Russians or Ukrainians who came here straight after the war. We have about 6,000 Indo-Chinese refugees. We have a large number-some 2,000-of Assyrians, Christians from the Middle East and refugees from Iraq. We have a large number of South Americans from the Left, from the Right and from neither side. It is important often to remember that in areas such as South America the people who are refugees are quite apolitical. They know that whichever side is in power it is extremely unpleasant for them. They are dragooned by one side and by the other side into supporting them. I have contact with South Americans who are refugees from Allende's Chile and refugees now, obviously, from Pinochet's Chile. It is because such countries did not act in a particularly democratic fashion-in the case of Allende's Chile towards the end of the set-up there-that we have all these large numbers of people who have left. I point out to the House that 28 per cent of people in the electorate of Prospect were born overseas in non-English speaking countries. This compares with an average of 11 per cent for New South Wales, an average of about 10 per cent for Australia and of about one per cent for the electorate of Wannon. I emphasise those figures to show the lack of appreciation by such people as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for the problem of refugees. The Prime Minister does not take part in these sorts of debates but I am sure that the honourable member for North Sydney was stating the sort of position that the Prime Minister would adopt. </PARA>
<PARA> I deal now with the specific statement by the Minister. Basically, I do not disagree with the statement but I would like to raise a couple of points. The first one is that he refers in different parts of the statement, firstly, to refugees; secondly, to people who are eligible under special humanitarian programs; and, thirdly, to displaced persons. The Minister referred to the humanitarian program on the tenth page of the statement and to displaced persons on the twelfth page of his statement. I am not completely clear on what the clear cut definition is. I do not think it is as easy as just saying that one accepts the United Nations definition of refugees. On the fourth page of his statement the Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . as individuals, they-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, refugees-</PARA>
<PARA>commit themselves totally to this country for, unlike migrants, they know that there is no going back to their old home. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that is quite true. I think that at least some hope to go back to their own countries when they are free. It is hoped that a large number of those countries will become democracies and there will be no necessity to have refugees from those countries. On page 6 of the Minister's statement he deals with what could be called economic refugees. It is a term that I will deal with a little later. It is a term that I do not like. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Many, perhaps most, people who become caught up in a mass movement can make only slight claims to having suffered persecution. Many people who voluntarily leave their country to take up residence elsewhere are motivated by a variety of different factors-economic reasons, the desire for change, family considerations or other reasons of a personal nature. In some cases the reasons for leaving may also include a dislike or abhorance of the political systems or ideology operating in their homeland. In some cases people may face some form of discrimination in their daily lives. Motivations to leave are often complex but unless these motivating factors are accompanied by a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, refugee status should not apply. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that the position is not as nicely clear cut as that. If we go back about 40 years to the best known example of refugees to this century-I refer to the Jewish refugees from Germany or the political refugees from Germany-in many cases before 1938 or 1939 they would not have been considered to be refugees. Of course, that is what happened to them. In retrospect, it is quite clear that they were refugees but many countries did not treat them that way. It was considered that they were in no immediate risk and, in fact, they were in no immediate risk. There was no evidence in Germany at that time that they would be put in concentration camps or eliminated. I am talking about the mid to late 1930s before the War started when people outside Germany considered that they were not refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) referred to a statement made by the Vietnamese Association of Australia last year. The Council of Vietnamese Organisations in New South Wales is based in my electorate. I had a statement incorporated in Hansard on 20 October last year. They made the point, that it is not easy to differentiate clearly between economic refugees and others. Other people have realised it. Going back to statements made in 1978, I noticed one by the Social Democrats, USA, sponsored by A. Philip Randolph, Honorary Chairman, Bayard Ruston, National Chairman and Carl Gershman, Executive Director. One of the points they made was:</PARA>
<PARA> The dropping of the distinction between 'economic' and 'political' refugees, a distinction that is sometimes used to relieve those who would normally assist political refugees from feeling any obligation toward those who have fled. The use of the 'economic' classification has even, in violation of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, served as a justification for the forcible repatriation of refugees in some instances. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not simple to make that sort of distinction. The refugee problem turns on numbers. Australia cannot take all refugees, not even a large proportion, because this is simply not possible in domestic political terms. Nor can Australia take no refugees-as some advocate-because international pressures will not allow this and, as the boat people incidents indicate, refugees will come anyway. Our splendid isolation is a thing of the past. I do not think that is a bad thing. As far as refugees are concerned-I have had talks with the Minister and he has been co-operative-facts must be publicised, people must be told about it. I conclude with the last sentence of a letter which I received from the President of the Vietnam Association of Australia, Nguyen Anh Tuan, thanking me for a letter which I had written to the Sydney Morning Herald in support of the refugees:</PARA>
<PARA> Surely at a time when so much concern is being expressed about the treatment of whales, a little compassion can also be extended to human beings whose only crime is to prefer freedom to tyranny. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) said in his statement that this is the first comprehensive review of Australia's policies on refugee settlement since the establishment of the current machinery, which was set up in May 1977. The Minister added that the guiding principles of the review were those embodied in the Government's stated refugee policy of that date which dealt with the responsibility to admit refugees, the fact that the Australian Government was to decide who was to be admitted with the provision of assistance in special circumstances, and the fact that the interests of certain refugees might be better served by their being resettled elsewhere. It dealt also with the matter of regular aid to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party's position on immigration, refugees and deportation has, in some areas, common threads with the policies and statements expressed by the Minister. I wish to make a brief reference to Labor's policy on immigration generally, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> A Labor Government will establish a National Population Council, to consider and make recommendations on the relationship between population growth, immigration, the economy, the environment and the quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council will be drawn from groups representing community, demographic, economic, environmental, industrial and social interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor supports immigration at a level which is consistent with the national interest and Australia's humanitarian obligations. Within the immigration programme family reunions must have a high priority. </PARA>
<PARA> The ALP-</PARA>
<PARA> When returned to government-</PARA>
<PARA>will establish consultative machinery between the States and Federal Government to determine the level of immigration intake and of Federal financial support to ensure the States can provide adequate facilities, services and opportunities for all new settlers. </PARA>
<PARA> Family reunion sponsored by Australian residents shall not require maintenance guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA> As negotiated with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, the Australian Government after consultation with the States will select without discrimination on grounds of sex, politics, colour, race, creed or place of origin, and accept for permanent settlement, its fair share of the refugees being cared for by countries of first asylum. </PARA>
<PARA> Uninvited refugees seeking asylum in Australia as a country of first asylum should be cared for on behalf of the UN whilst arrangements are made through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees for their final settlement amongst member nations of the UN, including Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations will be opened with the New Zealand Government to resolve problems of abuse of the present free entry in either direction. </PARA>
<PARA>That displays, again, a common thread with the attitudes that the Government has expressed on that question. The policy continues:</PARA>
<PARA> There will be no discrimination in the immigration policy or any other areas of policy on the grounds of race, nationality, politics, sex or creed. </PARA>
<PARA> There shall be no distinction between Australian citizens, whether born in Australia or overseas, in legal, social or political rights. </PARA>
<PARA> A right of appeal against deportation orders and denials of citizenship to an independent tribunal with judicial status and jurisdiction will be established. This Tribunal shall be presided over by a judge and composed of members drawn from a cross-section of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> A complete review of deportation procedures will be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>The common thread to which I have referred can clearly be seen. The Minister's statement concerning an arrangement with the Vietnamese Government, however limited, is nevertheless welcome. The point has been made that the Minister's speech was extremely long, but perhaps that is the kernel of his statement. The arrangement with the Vietnamese Government is welcome because it is an indication that this Liberal-National Country Party Government is apparently prepared to speak with that Government. However, one cannot ignore, or lightly pass over, our earlier involvement in and with Vietnam. That involvement, with the American involvement, created in Vietnam the very climate that has led to the departure of hundreds of Vietnamese from their own country. I speak of those who are often referred to as the boat people. The American war in Vietnam-in which unfortunately the Liberal-Country Party Government of the day involved us- left that country devastated on a staggering scale. In southern Vietnam alone, about 16 per cent of the population was either killed or wounded during the war and 57 per cent was made homeless between 1965 and 1974. Many roads and bridges were destroyed and agriculture was severely disrupted. Internal refugees swelled the cities and towns which provided employment, primarily through the military machines and the service industries. They lived also, unproductively, on the various types of foreign-primarily United States-economic assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The sudden end of this war, which lasted 30 years, had a dislocating and destabilising impact. What happened in Vietnam occurred in many countries right throughout Europe. In fact, a breeding ground for potential refugees was created . It was a breeding ground that America and a Liberal-Country Party Government dragged Australia into. It is no use the Minister and others speakers talking of a humanitarian policy. It is no use looking for solutions to refugee problems. We need to start to look at the problems themselves. We need to avoid the creation of breeding grounds for refugees. We cannot undo that tragic war and the devastation of Vietnam but I believe we can do something to correct the evil of that war. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the cost, because inevitably everything is looked at in economic terms. The cost to Australia was 496 young soldiers killed in Vietnam along with 2,800 injured. The Fraser Government promised $6m for a reconstruction program but that was terminated for a political reason. It was convenient for the Government to use such a reason to take away that paltry sum of $6m in reconstruction aid to Vietnam. It cost even the United States, and some 50,000 people were killed. God knows how many were injured. The total cost probably never will be known. The reconstruction aid promised by the American Government was in the vicinity of $4 billion. It was a promise never fulfilled. This country and the present Government had best turn their attention to the problems that cause refugees to have to look to other countries, that cause them to leave their homes. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of South America, the Minister has said that more consideration will be given to refugees from that area. That is a statement welcomed by this side of the House. I point out that one of the problems in the past with immigration from South America was the failure to have sufficient offices of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs located in South America. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the third matter, deportation, we have had a number of situations that were not the kind of situations that one likes to see and that one would not see if political considerations did not come into it. I refer in particular, to the bikini girl incident. We have seen in the past people who, for their own political gain, have been allowed to stay in Australia while others have been forced to leave. I refer in particular to a case that I had to take up with the Department and with the Minister. It was the case of an 18 year old Greek seaman . Had that young lad been from a communist country-perhaps he should have worn a red bikini-he may have been given much more consideration, but he was not. He wanted to stay in Australia with his relatives. He was unceremoniously dumped in the Adelaide gaol. </PARA>
<PARA> Adelaide-I hope the Minister takes note of this-has no proper detention centre for people who are about to be deported. I understand there are adequate facilities in both Sydney and Perth but the facilities in Adelaide are a disgrace. The people who are forced by one circumstance or another to be incarcerated have to spend their time in the Adelaide gaol. The gaol has reached such a state that it is being pulled down; it is not even good enough for criminals. The proper approach to this should be one in which the politics of the situation are not given the weight that they have been in the past, and those who have to be deported should be given proper facilities and treated not as criminals but as people who are not to be allowed to stay in Australia. The detention centre in Adelaide is certainly no fit place for people to be incarcerated. </PARA>
<PARA> We have no great difference of opinion with the Minister in regard to the direction which his portfolio has taken. That is acknowledged and the Minister's work is acknowledged but I reiterate that we should be turning our attention to our responsibilities throughout the country, and throughout the world, to try to avoid situations where people in their own countries find that they have to become refugees. I believe that our involvement in Vietnam created a situation in which hundreds of thousands of people had to leave their own country. Whilst we might talk about humanitarian policies and approaches, I think it is a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating a statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) concerning changes to our arrangements for the selection of refugees under our refugee settlement policy. I welcome the statement from the Minister and I note that a principal part of it refers to the tightening of the refugee selection criteria and procedures for all programs with the particular objective of excluding from refugee entry those persons who do not meet the criteria allowed for in the United Nations convention. The Minister in his statement made particular reference to the fact that appropriate authorities had been consulted in the making of these changes, especially the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to make some comment about that because I believe that Australian authorities have a very high reputation amongst the personnel of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. That is something we should guard very jealously. I have discovered in visits that I have made to some refugee camps in South East Asia and in discussions I have had with UNHCR personnel that the work of Australian selection officers and the criteria that we apply have been highly regarded. It is fair to say that Australian policies and procedures have been regarded as being in advance of many other countries. I have heard only one criticism from the United Nations officials with whom I have spoken in some of those areas regarding Australian procedures and personnel. That criticism has been basically along the lines that Australian selection officers in the refugee camps seem to be a little too bureaucratic, that they seem to want to apply criteria very strictly without enough flexibility to accord with particular family circumstances that may arise in individual cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the other side of that coin is that the Australian selection officers are known to apply the rules very strictly, very fairly and very evenly . They are not subject to approaches from people who want special consideration because of their background, their political attitude or whatever, I think this is a reputation to guard very jealously. When I put this to the UNHCR officials they agreed that Australian selection officers were not subject to corruption; that they were not subject to being bought off; that it was not possible to gain entry to Australia by currying favour in a financial sense or another sense with an Australian selection officer. That is a reputation that we should guard very jealously. It is a reputation that is not shared by all countries in the refugee selection and settlement area. </PARA>
<PARA> I was particularly pleased to note that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in this statement outlined the fact that the Government has now reached an agreement with Vietnamese authorities about the manner in which applications from Vietnam for people to re-join family members in Australia can be processed in an orderly fashion. I think that for many of us in this House this has been a problem area for some time. I certainly have had drawn to my attention several cases of applications having been made and nominations having been put by relatives in Australia in support of relatives in Vietnam, seeking to bring about family reunions. Because of the absence of an agreement between the Australian Government and the Vietnamese Government about appropriate procedures by which family reunions can be brought about there have been cases of people waiting, for years in some cases, for some action to be taken. I welcome this development and I hope that within two or three months, in line with what has been suggested by the Minister in his statement, we will see some of these family reunions taking place. I will certainly be taking the opportunity to raise afresh some of the cases which involve family reunions between people in Australia and in Vietnam that I have drawn to the Minister's attention in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to comment on some suggestions that have been made that on occasions preference is given to various applicants for settlement in Australia on the basis of their political belief or background. I think that this is a criticism that certainly cannot be levelled against this Minister in particular. Indeed, it would be fair to say that he has been criticised, one might say, by some people for committing the opposite sin, for not giving enough attention to the political colour of the country of origin of the people who in some instances have applied for refugee status. I think we must realise that in many respects it is very easy for people to claim refugee status and to see that as an easy way in which they can circumvent the normal procedures to gain entry to Australia as permanent residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The thought seems to be that if people can in some way jump ship, overstay a visitor's visa, or put in a complaint about their lifestyle in their home country, they will be given preferential treatment over people who have applied and whose applications have been considered in the normal way, but whose applications have been rejected. In the days when Australia was seeking very large immigration intakes, when we were looking for figures of 180,000 or close to 200,000 immigrants a year, when we were looking for sheer numbers to staff industries in Australia, it may have been possible to give that consideration. However, in circumstances in which we face up to one million inquiries a year from around the world regarding settlement in Australia-the latest intake figure is slightly in excess of 100,000, I think about 111,000, in the last financial year-we must acknowledge that hundreds of thousands of people each year put in an application, have it considered, find it rejected and accept that decision in good grace. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that under those circumstances anyone who seeks to circumvent the normal procedures by placing himself or herself on Australian soil under unusual circumstances and then claims refugee status should have that claim examined very closely. I do not think that we should accept it automatically on the basis of the political colour of the country from which that person comes. After all, in many of those countries with regimes which we find abhorrent and quite contrary to our democratic standards we are nevertheless seeking to develop normal relations, we are nevertheless seeking to bring about normal family reunions because of people who are already here who nominate people in those countries. I suggest that it would make our position much more difficult if we entertained without due consideration applications from people who came here on visitor's visas and then sought to circumvent the normal immigration requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> It would make it much more difficult for the Minister to make representations to ambassadors from various countries in Eastern Europe and other places where there are governments with which we very strongly disagree if we were to put him in a position of saying 'Well, we will accept anyone who comes here and jumps ship or in some other way circumvents the normal requirements of our immigration policy. But forget about that. Nevertheless, we would like you to give special consideration to these other cases that have been drawn to our attention'. I think in those circumstances we would find that special consideration would not be granted by those countries, that the opportunities to bring about genuine family reunion when there are strong compassionate circumstances would not exist any more. So I believe that the evenhanded, fair, but firm approach which this Minister is taking on behalf of the Government is one that should be strongly supported by both sides of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) for this opportunity to speak. I have a special interest in immigration. I would be probably the only one in this House who came here as an adult migrant with a non-English speaking background. Of course, being a migrant I feel very strongly about the issues which were canvassed here today, especially the issue of family reunion. In the short time given to me-I do not want to take advantage of that and speak for too long-I would like to mention several issues. Some of them may be contradictory. On one side I may advocate that we should take more Polish refugees than the Minister is ready to take today because I know the plight of the people who are sitting in Australian camps waiting for somewhere to go to start a new life. Even though the Minister said that many of them want to stay near their homelands, which I accept, there are just as many who want to get as far away from those homelands as possible because of the turbulent times the Poland and Eastern and Western European economies are going through. They want to start a new life. I think that we can afford them that opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I am also conscious that our humanitarian commitment and other commitments to take refugees take a big slice out of our ability to accept as many migrants as possible for family reunion. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me get back to the refugee situation. We are somewhat single-minded-and I am critical of the Minister in this regard- as far as that situation is concerned. It is true that we have a responsibility to Asia and to Asian migration. It is true that we are responsible to some extent for the Indo- Chinese refugee situation. We went into Vietnam and we created a situation which led to extremes in that country. If we had not assisted in intervention in Vietnam there would have been a national front in government-Communist or non- Communist-and many more of the people chased out by the extremist regime would still be in Vietnam today. So we have an obligation, and I admit that obligation . At the same time I would like to see many more people coming here on a family reunion basis. Like other members of parliament, although probably a bit more so , I am approached by people who are unable to bring their sisters, brothers or close family members to this country from overseas. It happens that very often half of a family lives in Australia and the other half lives in Pakistan or India. My colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) said that we have got rid of the White Australia policy. I tend to disagree with him somewhat, in that we have not completely got rid of that policy. I know that we receive no more than 500 migrants a year from India. Yet there are 20,000 applications from people who want to come to this country. Most of these applications are made on a family reunion basis. Most of the applicants have mothers, fathers, sisters or other family members who have settled successfully in this country-people who speak English, people who play cricket, people who can fit in here. Yet we have closed the barrier. I often wonder whether we have done this because something is wrong with their colour, and we do not want to admit it. I think we should leave much more room for decisions to be made on a family reunion basis. It should not matter from where people come, whether from South America, England or India. We should let in people whose families have already settled successfully in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that I allowed the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) to say a few words because what he said illustrates the whole difficulty of this area. My colleague and old friend the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) said that he thought that the 28 minutes I took to read my speech was too long. Frankly, the reason I spoke for so long was to try to get across the complexity of this area. Yet, I think the speeches of the honourable member for Hotham, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) and the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) illustrated the fact that some members still do not understand. If they fail to understand how can their constituents understand?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hotham said that some of his points might be contradictory, and indeed they were. I respect his sincerity as I do that of his two colleagues whom I have named. But, with respect, they are all heart and eventually somebody has to face up to some crunch questions. There has to be some rational basis for working through our humanitarianism. As the honourable member for Port Adelaide said so well, we cannot take everybody. This is the last continent in which people can start a new life. We cannot take everybody who is displaced; there has to be some basis for taking people. He also rightly said that for the most part we have to find some way of settling their problems another way. He also said we are a small country in terms of influence and therefore the political role which we can play is going to be limited. There will be arguments on both sides of the House and within both sides of the House as to the role we should play. But we cannot take everyone who is displaced or, to use the words of the honourable member for Hotham, everyone who wants to work to start a new life. This is the last continent in which people can start a new life unless they can learn to live with the penguins in the Antarctic. The honourable member for Hotham says that we can afford to let them start that new life. Can we?</PARA>
<PARA> Members on both sides of the House are concerned about the labour market and another old friend of mine, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), will be raising a matter of public importance on this matter. We are all concerned about the labour market. We cannot go on with an unlimited flow of people no matter how anguished their personal situation may be. We have to consider the impact upon our own economy. The honourable member for Hotham has said we should take some more Poles. There is something very significant in what he said. He is reported in a suburban newspaper-the newspaper does not actually circulate in my area but someone has sent me a copy of it-as saying that we were taking only a thousand Poles or something or other. I hope my statement has put that to rest. Had he read my Press releases he would know that was not so. We have a global objective for the reasons that I outlined and which are supported by the Opposition. The honourable member pointed out the turbulent times in Eastern and Western Europe. That is so-there are turbulent times throughout the world economy. This economy is not without its difficulties as the Opposition reminds us and as we are well aware. Are we now to start taking everyone else who finds himself the victim of turbulent times?</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hotham also said that we would have had fewer Vietnamese refugees if Australia had not joined the Americans in intervening in the Vietnam War. A number of people on both sides of the House had views at the time of that intervention. I was not a member of the House at that time but I had a view. I maintained the view that the intervention was anti-historical. I might say that the honourable member's interpretation is just as questionable on historical grounds. The history of Vietnam is that there are three Vietnams. The civil war in Vietnam was one in which there was external intervention from the Soviets as well as the Americans. In fact, historically the north was more likely to conquer the south and the centre squeezed between the two. As a result there would still have been refugees. It does not really matter much how the problem came about. We in this Parliament and in this country in 1982 cannot do much about amending the wrongs of other regimes. What we can do is do our best internationally to bring about sensible political solutions and where we can on a humanitarian basis assist displaced persons, so we must. When they are displaced we have to determine the degree of persecution or discrimination. That is what we are concerned about. The whole point of my lengthy statement, which contained a measured amount of repetition, was to try to point out why and on what criteria we make certain distinctions between refugees and special humanitarian cases. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Prospect made an equally humane but equally irrational contribution to this debate. In the course of his remarks he was unfair to my colleague the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) who in fact made what I thought was a very rational contribution. The honourable member for North Sydney is not to my knowledge, and certainly from what he said today, a WASP. He gave an example of the Cubans, some of whom were identifiable as people from criminal institutions. This does not in fact mean that they were not refugees under the current regime in Cuba but they certainly were not all necessarily refugees. The honourable member was trying to illustrate the fact that not all displaced persons are refugees. That was the whole point of this contribution. It is fine for us all to have humanity but we also need to have a little bit of rationality and this is the purpose of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I am indebted to the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) for trying to return some rationality to the debate. The honourable member said that not all of the people who come to this country can be properly classified as refugees. I might also say that not all of those persons who place themselves in neighbouring countries poised ready to come to our shores are refugees. I read in the newspaper some more bleeding heart stuff about a family which went to Bangkok from Warsaw. The family said that it was advised to go there because it was easier to be processed as refugees in Bangkok than it is in Vienna. I do not know who gave that advice. Certainly it was not an Australian official. That has been verified. That family will have to be treated on the same criteria as I outlined today. These criteria apply to all persons claiming to be refugees, whether they are in Vienna, Pulau, Bidong or Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Casey made an important point concerning numbers. He mentioned the devolution or evolution of policy-devolution partly from the United Nations and evolution within our own experience. It is an assessment of needs and competing priorities. If there is one commodity which we are not short of in this world, it is refugees or displaced persons. Machinery has had to be evolved domestically and internationally to resolve those problems. It sounds clinical but believe me, Mr Deputy Speaker, when one is in the situation of having to make decisions about competing priorities, one has to be as rational as one can be. If that sounds cynical and too rational, it is a better alternative than being subjected to trial by media. People who want to fast in a city square in Bangkok or somewhere else are not necessarily to be given priority over somebody else who has patiently waited in line and patiently asked to be processed. It might make us unpopular and sound as if we are callous and heartless but, when one looks at the sheer numbers involved-the purpose of my lengthy statement was to illustrate that-I believe that what we are doing is fair and reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a limited debate. Lengthy though it might have been, it was limited in ambit. We cannot cover all of the political solutions and we cannot redress all of the past wrongs. We can only deal with human flotsam and jetsam in the most rational way and compare the degree of discomfort, persecution and discrimination as well as safeguarding the interests of people living here, often born of migrant origins and who are competing for jobs. Looking at the interests of others who want to migrate here and make a contribution is never easy. The lines are never easily drawn. We are doing our best. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hindmarsh spoke about a Greek seaman who wanted to stay in Australia because he had relatives here. Goodness me! As I said in my statement, we are attracting about a million tourists a year, most of whom have friends or relatives here. When they come here they all think that it is a nice place in which to live. As I said in my statement, we have no policy if we are to be governed by those kinds of considerations. The honourable member for Hindmarsh said that if this seaman had been from a communist country or wore a red bikini he could have stayed. That is not fair. I have gone to great lengths to try to explain the case by case analysis. The honourable member can disagree on what he knows of a certain case. I said on one occasion not long ago that I might not have come to the same conclusion as my predecessors regarding one or two cases, including the red bikini girl and the ballerina. The fact is that the Minister responsible and the committee which advises him do their best. Most of the information given is confidential and must remain so. When comparisons are made publicly they are made on less information than is ordinarily available to the Minister and the committee. I think that what honourable members and their constituents have to recognise is the fact that there are endless numbers of displaced persons around the world-at least 10 million to 16 million-not all of whom are called refugees by the United Nations, not all of whom are even marked as being people of concern, but all of whom are suffering great inconvenience. Not all of these people can be accommodated by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to a question which was raised by several speakers in the debate relating to mass population outflows. In conjunction with international agencies and other governments we have been trying to take measures which are designed to curb mass outflows. We have tried to work through the United Nations in support of an initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany to examine the causes of mass outflows. We co-sponsored a United Nations resolution to set up a working group, the membership of which we are seeking to expand. We are seeking to study through that membership the causes, means of prevention of mass outflows and to try to devise machinery by which we can ameliorate the conditions of the people involved in those outflows. Nothing involving those dislocations is easy and nothing that we do will ever do more than touch on marginal aspects of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> When the honourable member for Port Adelaide began his response to my statement he said that if we could do something more internationally by way of political initiatives we would be making a bigger contribution. He is correct. As far as the Polish situation or any other situation that exists in the world is concerned, this Government stands ready to initiate discussions when we believe the time is right, to take part in them if somebody else initiates them and, as we have been patiently doing-certainly during the whole of this calendar year and since 13 December when martial law was imposed-to exchange cables with all governments of similar democratic persuasions to see what we can do that is best for the people involved. This is one of the contradictions referred to by the honourable member for Hotham. He apparently wants to set some competing and extravagant ceiling for taking more Poles and in making a virtue of that we would be sanctioning martial law. Australia, the United States of America, West Germany or any other Western nation are not in the business of doing that. We have tried to take into account what the Poles themselves want. Less than half of the Poles living in Vienna-that is where the overwhelming concentration of Poles live outside Poland-have asked for resettlement in another country. They want the chance, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide acknowledged, to work out for themselves in an unpanicked way what is best for them and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> There are lots of reasons incorporated in my statement, as well as those which I have mentioned, for leaving things as they are. We have not set an upper target. If martial law is further imposed, instead of being relaxed, and if a need is perceived internationally to do something further, we will respond in the same spirit and to the same kind of degree that we have. We will share our international obligations. In respect of South America we intend to send again a senior official there to look at the situation. I do share some of the concerns expressed that we are not taking as many people as one would expect we might. I have said that before. Two years ago we sent the then Deputy Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I hope that we will be able to send the present Deputy Secretary to examine the situation at first hand and to report to me. I can only repeat what I said in my statement: Most refugees have traditionally gone to Western Europe and North America. Unless the barriers there are really put down, they will continue to seek asylum in these countries rather than here. But we are open to take them. Those who have come have settled well and we would welcome more of them. I conclude by referring to a couple of substantial remarks by the Opposition shadow Minister, the honourable member for Port Adelaide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This discussion deals with a matter of overwhelming importance for the people of Australia. One would hope that in the light of the election results on Saturday in Lowe and Western Australia that this Government would do two related things: Firstly, that it would stop the ludicrous and obscene ritual in which it engages each month of trying to pick one element or other out of the statistics and to confect some fantasy which puts an unrealistically favourable perspective on the employment and unemployment situation in this country; and, secondly-and as I say, relatedly-that the Government would accept that it has been obstinately wrong-headed in its economic diagnosis and prescriptions and that it would now move positively to undertake policies and programs calculated to improve what has developed into both an economic disaster and a social tragedy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me in the first place spend some little time establishing what is the factual situation. Looking at the overall unemployment picture, the facts are: We had a total of 482,600 people out of work in February 1982 or, in percentage terms, 7 per cent of the labour force. This figure represents a substantial increase of 58,500, or an increase of 14 per cent over the level for the previous February, when the unemployment rate was 6.3 per cent. It is the highest unemployment rate for three years, and it is the highest level of unemployment ever recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the deterioration has been among full time job seekers. The level of full time joblessness has jumped to 404,500 or an unemployment rate of 7 per cent. This figure is 46,100 greater than that in February 1981. It is the first time that the level has passed 400,000 and it is the highest rate for three years. In February 1976, soon after the Fraser Government took office, the total unemployment rate was 342,000 or only 5.4 per cent of the labour force, compared with the 7 per cent which it is now. In absolute terms, that is an increase of 41 per cent in the level over that period, which indicates a very substantial deterioration after six years in office of the Fraser Government-a government which pledged itself to restore full employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the figures in regard to those who are recorded as unemployed. Hidden unemployment has risen dramatically since 1974-75 and now accounts for at least a further 400,000 people who want jobs but who have stayed out of the labour force because of the persistent lack of job opportunities. In other words, taking the recorded figures together with the hidden figures, the actual rate of unemployment, or the imbalance between the number of jobs available and the number of those who would want to work if work were available, is probably over 12 per cent. Moreover, the average duration of unemployment has risen dramatically from around 13 weeks in 1975 to over 30 weeks during 1981. Even more revealing, in 1975 only 19.3 per cent of unemployment benefit payments were claimed by those who had been unemployed for six months or more, but by 1981 this had risen to almost 41 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> On all the evidence, things are going to get worse. The Government itself, in its Budget papers, predicts increasing unemployment during 1981-82. The Melbourne University Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research predicts an average unemployment level of over 460,000, or 6.6 per cent, by the second half of 1982, compared with 386,400, or 5.7 per cent, during the comparable period of 1981. The Victorian Chamber of Manufactures predicts a persistent 7 per cent unemployment rate by 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the general figures about unemployment, recorded and hidden. Let me turn to the situation in regard to youth unemployment. The February level of 136 ,100 unemployed teenagers looking for full time work represented 20.1 per cent as an unemployment rate; or, putting it in very simple terms, it meant that one in five of teenagers who were looking for full time work could not get it. This figure is a 7 per cent jump from the February 1981 level, when the unemployment rate was 18.6 per cent. In the late 1975 and early 1976 period, the figure was between 70,000 and 80,000 unemployed teenagers looking for full time work. That was then an unemployment rate of between 13 per cent and 14 per cent, compared with what is now 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for youth unemployment. I move to an area which these days is sometimes neglected too much-unemployment in the older age groups. We rightly look at the problem in respect of young people; we tend to overlook the problem in the older groups. It is not just youth who are affected; this is spread throughout the age spectrum. The major recent increases in unemployment have occurred largely among those aged 20 years and older. In fact, 81 per cent of the annual increase in full time unemployment to February 1982-that is, February on February-has been in the 20 years and over group, and the deterioration in unemployment over the previous three months to February 1982 occurred almost entirely among the adult age groups. </PARA>
<PARA> The duration of unemployment experienced is also far worse among the older age groups. The average duration of unemployment among adults-those 20 years of age and over-is twice as great as that among teenagers. There is in fact a very strong relationship between increasing age and the length of unemployment experience. For instance, the Australian Bureau of Statistics' labour force data for January reveal the following average duration situation among various age groups: For teenage unemployment, the average duration of unemployment is 17 weeks. For the 25 to 34-year-olds it is 29 weeks. For the 45 to 54-year-olds it is 52 weeks. Taking the top bracket, those aged between 60 and 64, it is 101 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, it is among the older age groups that the incidence of hidden unemployment has hit particularly hard. This is shown by the recent studies by Stricker and Sheehan in Melbourne and by the Social Welfare Research Institute of the University of New South Wales. Looking at the receipt of unemployment benefit, we find that it has been among the 25 to 44 years age group that the greatest upsurge has occurred. Over 31 per cent of unemployment benefit claimants are currently in this age bracket, compared with only 26.4 per cent during 1975. That has been reflected in the fact that the proportion claimed by those under 21 years old has fallen over the same period from 41.5 per cent to 36.6 per cent. The concept of the young dole bludger was always objectionable and not based in fact. On those figures it is clear, now that I have explained them, that we have this phenomenon of unemployment spreading right through the age structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I have been talking about unemployment. I have given the factual situation-unembellished; factual. That reflects what has been happening on the other side-what has been happening to employment growth. Without appearing to state what is, perhaps, too obvious, I must say that the slump in the growth rate in employment opportunities is, of course, the main cause of the worsening unemployment situation. Let us look at what has happened. Annual employment growth has slumped from around 3 1/2 per cent in the September quarter of 1980 to the miserable level of 1 1/2 per cent or less over the past three months. Looking at the simple basic economic facts, one can understand what is happening now and what is in prospect. That sort of growth in employment, 1 1/2 per cent, is totally insufficient to cover the basic economic factors of growth in the labour force and of what happens in respect of productivity. If we have about a 2 per cent increase in the labour force and a 2 per cent increase in productivity, we must have a 4 per cent growth in output just to keep up with those basic factors, without starting in any way to cut into the backlog of people who are currently unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The employment situation in respect of teenagers has slumped dramatically since the middle of last year. I was referring previously to the unemployment situation, but I now go to what is happening in regard to the actual employment area. What has happened since the middle of last year is that, on an annual basis, teenage employment has been falling by increasing amounts since August of last year, and by December 1981 the collapse over the year-December on December- was 21,500 and by January 1982 this had worsened to 23,200. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make the point simply. That means that in January 1982 there were 23,200 fewer teenagers in full time employment than there were in the previous January. I said that that was in full time employment; that has been in total teenage employment. But most of that decline has been in full time job opportunities, with almost three-quarters of the decline being in the full time area. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been as dispassionate as I possibly can. I have not tried to embellish. I have tried to put before this House what the actual situation is, looking at both the unemployment side of the coin and at what has happened to employment growth. Now, clearly, to look for the responsibility in this matter, it would not be honest for me to say that one can explain every facet of unemployment in this country simply by blaming the Government for its misguided economic policies. I accept that in this country, and in other countries, certain basic forces are operating which make it more difficult to regain a full employment situation. I acknowledge that, but I do say without any equivocation that the Government's economic policies have been to a very considerable extent responsible for much of the difficulties. The overall economic strategy of this Government has undoubtedly contributed to the situation. Attempts by the Government to suppress inflation by reducing the Budget deficit and clamping down on growth of the money supply have restrained economic growth and have limited the availability of new employment opportunities. The only recent instance of reasonable employment growth in this country was during the second half of 1980. That was precisely because in that period the Federal Government deliberately relaxed its tight economic policies because it knew that it was coming up to an election and it wanted to have a more optimistic and rosy economic situation. As soon as the election was over the reins were put on again and we had the resumption of the contractionary policies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough for any of the Government's spokesmen to say that the Government is right and that there is no question about the correctness of its policies. There has been increasing criticism of this Government's strategies and policies from a very wide number of reputable sources over recent times. I will cite some of them. There is the Melbourne University Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, Professor J. O. N. Perkins also of the Melbourne University, and, most recently, Dr Peter McCawley of the Australian National University. The Federal Government, by its own budgetary admissions has acknowledged the unsatisfactory contractionary impact of its monetary and fiscal policies. </PARA>
<PARA> It has argued that reduced Government intervention and suppression of inflation are necessary pre-requisites for the stimulation of job growth in the private sector. This Government has had more than six years to test its theories. That is long enough for anyone, but they simply have not worked. The situation has significantly worsened as a result of them. It is time, on the evidence and on the basis of the criticisms of informed and responsible economists outside the Government, for a change of course. Let me make it quite clear that I go from the inadequacies of the general economic policies of this Government to be very critical of specific manpower policies which have also been totally deficient. I ask the House to remember these figures: The amount of expenditure by the Fraser Government on all manpower training and support programs had fallen in real terms by over 50 per cent between 1975-76 and 1980-81. Even with the increased Budget allocation of 1981-82, the decline in real terms over the life of this Fraser Government has been 44 per cent. That is a 44 per cent reduction in real terms on total expenditure in respect of manpower training and support programs. Individual programs have been correspondingly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the time has come, as I have said before, to stop the nonsense of asking 'What is the cost of undertaking job creation programs?' The real question for this society to ask is: 'What is the cost of not undertaking these programs?' This country can no longer tolerate or afford these heartless and mindless policies which have brought about this economic and social tragedy in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was roughly referring to what the socialists did in the 1972-75 period under the RED scheme. In relation to these matters it is worth recalling that trade unions these days do not give much concern to the unemployed. They give concern to the employed. Therefore, in this nation at present those people are the great unprotected and un-looked-after by the trade union movement, which makes judgments in relation to a 1960 economy under the totally changed circumstances of 1980 and in which the whole economic environment has altered. If honourable members listened to the Australian Broadcasting Commission news bulletin tonight, they will recall that the great New South Wales Premier has decided that, because of industrial unrest, it is likely that that State will move to a four-day working week and that power zoning will be introduced. This is a direct result of industrial unrest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not wish to do anything else but say that the Government does not deny that the preliminary figures of unemployment released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last week were disappointing. It was not a good result. However, there is no cause and this is not the time for panic. The movement in unemployment was not unexpected. The Government has acknowledged, and it is readily evident, that the pace of economic activity and the rate of employment growth moderated in the second half of last year. There was a tendency for this to be reflected in the unemployment figures late last year. The issue is not whether there has been an easing in the labour market. There has been, and this is consistent with the expectations at the time of the August Budget. More important is the clear and urgent need to place these estimates in the context of the broader economic and labour market conditions in Australia and overseas and to consider the meaningful and appropriate policy responses open to the Government. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates of unemployment for 1982 indicate 404,500 people, or 7 per cent of the labour force, were unemployed and looking for full time work in February. The month of February together with January and December traditionally records higher levels of unemployment than other months. The influx of school leavers into the labour market and the closing down of industry and commerce over the Christmas-January period are the major causes-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Too much reliance should not be placed on one month's figures. Any attempt to forecast the future by extrapolating the estimates for February is therefore clearly inappropriate and mischievous. More importantly, the figures should be considered in the context of the gains in employment which have occurred as a result of the Government's policies. In the 12 months to January 1982, employment grew by 102,200 or 1.6 per cent. In the two years since January 1980, the employment growth was substantial, totalling some 242,000 or 4 per cent employment growth. A particularly encouraging aspect of these figures has been the growth in full time employment, which has accounted for 85 per cent of the overall growth in employment. While employment growth has moderated in line with economic growth in recent months, solid gains have been achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An important area of concern about unemployment in Australia has been the extent to which it impinges on the teenager. While the overall unemployment rates are still too high, the estimates indicate the teenage labour market has fared relatively better than the other segments. The priority and emphasis which the Government has placed on youth through a variety of training and work experience schemes and support for apprenticeship training has undoubtedly been an important influence. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest unemployment estimates provide a timely reminder of the importance of ensuring that the economic and unemployment achievements of recent years are not squandered. In particular they emphasise that employment growth is inevitably linked to economic performance. Australia's economic performance compares more than favourably with most overseas countries. For example in 1981 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries recorded a growth rate of a little over one per cent, whereas Australia managed a growth rate of 3 per cent. Indeed in the last two years economic growth in Europe and North America has virtually come to a standstill with high and rising unemployment. It is hardly surprising that these overseas trends have begun to influence and constrain Australia's economic performance. Australia is a major trading nation and it is quite impossible for this country to isolate itself completely from world economic circumstances and pressures. The high interest rates and the reappraisal and deferment of some resource projects provide examples of this economic interdependence. The level of wages and overall labour costs have a vital bearing on Australia's continued economic recovery. It is being increasingly recognised in this country that the greatest threat to healthy employment prospects and, indeed, to sustained economic growth, derives from excessive wage demands. In this regard, I would refer honourable members to the remark of the former member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Frank Crean, who saw quite clearly, at a time of burgeoning wage demands in 1974 that one man's pay increase is another man's job. The experience in Australia in the first half of the 1970s and in a number of other countries provides ample evidence of this nexus, as do the unemployment estimates released last week. </PARA>
<PARA> The significant wage increases agreed upon over recent months, the levels of industrial disruption and the large number of hefty wage claims currently in prospect have obviously influenced the ability and willingness of employers to maintain and expand employment opportunities. Since the end of indexation we have witnessed over half the work force obtaining wage increases, some of which were considerable. The accelerating rate of wage increases must not continue, as wages spiral must be avoided, otherwise, not only are the employment prospects of the existing unemployed and school leavers at risk but also so is the job security of many Australians now in employment. The irresponsible and selfish conduct of those who put their own short term interests ahead of the nation as a whole will lead to an uncertain environment for investment and development and dampen the prospects for strong employment growth. Those who press for excessive wage rises and shorter hours and who do not hesitate to use the strike weapon to push their claims, would do well to pause and consider the effect of their actions on the community, particularly the unemployed and the school leavers who will find it much harder to get and keep a job. </PARA>
<PARA> This then is the context in which the unemployment estimates should be considered. The Opposition has again put forward a strategy based on expansionary fiscal and monetary policies and massive job creation. The proposed panacea is not new, nor is it inappropriate. However, by the way of response, I would like to draw on the communique released following the recent ministerial level meeting of the OECD Manpower and Social Affairs Committee attended by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown). The meeting emphasised that efforts to combat unemployment could be successful only in the framework of effective anti-inflationary policy. The communique further recognised that labour costs must be kept in check in the current circumstances and that the encouragement of investment provides the essential basis for employment growth. These issues-I might add that the communique reflects the views of employment ministers of a variety of political persuasions-are exactly those aspects which this Government has emphasised are of fundamental importance to bouyant and sustainable economic growth. The Opposition's proposals are, in most instances, diametrically opposed to these widely held and internationally recognised views. A larger public sector and a lax fiscal and monetary policy will only reintroduce in a far more accentuated form the imbalances and rampant inflation evident in the Australian economy in the mid-1970s. The task of managing the economy in the present international economic circumstances is too important and delicate a task to seriously contemplate these measures from another age. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition continues to promote-despite international trends to the contrary-the value of massive public sector job creation schemes. The fundamental point is that these schemes do not and cannot provide sustainable employment in the long term except at massive cost. Indeed their very introduction on a massive scale prevents the establishment and maintenance of conditions designed to generate substantial employment opportunities. Further, the Opposition's wages, industrial relations and other manpower-related policies are designed to fossilise the labour market and accentuate the basic problems. In particular, they fail to recognise that a sense of realism and flexibility needs to be imposed into the labour market, and economic thinking generally in Australia is to take advantage of the opportunities in the future. The behaviour of the Australian trade unions contrasts sharply with that recently displayed by a number of American trade unions where the difficult economic conditions have injected a sense of realism into their wage claims. In conclusion, there is no disagreement that Australia, in keeping with most Western industrialised countries, is experiencing historically high unemployment levels. We are fully aware of the possible economic and social consequences and the range of manpower programs is directed at these. The important issue is that governments maintain meaningful and relevant policies. The recent OECD conference has reaffirmed the correctness of the approach of the present Government. </PARA>

His statement was at least an admission of failure, if not an abject surrender. On 11 March the Australian Bureau of Statistics released unemployment figures showing 482,600 people out of work in February. This meant that the figure had risen by 43,000 from January. The national unemployment rate has now reached 7 per cent, a rise from 6.3 per cent in February 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) tonight dealt in detail with the specific figures. I propose to deal with the attitudes of this Government to unemployment. But before doing that there are a couple of matters which I want to mention in relation to the speech of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore). Following the example of his Prime Minister, the Acting Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Moore) when commenting on the figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, attempted to transfer the blame for unemployment to wage claims and industrial disputes. He has repeated that attempt again tonight. That is something which the people of this country will not tolerate any longer. This Government is here to govern. It is time that it stopped trying to transfer responsibility elsewhere. It must accept responsibility for almost half a million Australians out of work because of the failed economic policies of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also referred to the Opposition's policy. Clearly he does not understand the Opposition's policy or was attempting to distort it. It is not simply a question of job creation. It is an overall economic planning proposal, including manpower policies, which will remove the obscene situation in this country where we have shortages in skills and yet an outrageously high rate of youth unemployment. It is the overall economic program that the honourable member for Wills was referring to and not simply job creation. If the Minister does not understand that, it is a tragic reflection on his mentality. He also indicated this evening that there is no reason to panic with these figures. Having regard to the fact that unemployment in this country, taking into account hidden unemployment, is probably now at about 13 per cent, I wonder when the Minister will panic? At what stage is this Government going to panic?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right. Instead of positive action this Government attempts to make the problem of unemployment less significant. It is a matter which does not concern this Government. A classic example of this tactic was the decision of the infamous razor gang to stop the collection and publication of Commonwealth Employment Service statistics on unemployment which on a regional basis provided the number of registered unemployed and the number of jobs available. Even those figures did not give the true statistics on unemployment. The honourable member for Wills referred to the 400,000 hidden unemployed but the CES figures were nevertheless too revealing for this Government, so it decided to change to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures based on a survey and subject to sampling and questioning errors and not related to regions as were the CES figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An analysis of the CES figures on a regional basis clearly shows why this Government decided to discontinue the collection of such figures. The figures released by the CES in Dandenong between 1975 and 1980 are an example of why this information is no longer available. Other regional figures in Victoria give the same sad reflection of the failure of this Government. The Dandenong CES figures in August 1975 showed 2,400 people registered as unemployed. By 1980, after almost five years of Fraser Government, that figure had increased to 4,075 . That is a staggering increase of 70 per cent in the number of registered unemployed in five years and that does not take account of the hidden unemployment referred to earlier. During each week of this Government the number of unemployed in that region went up by 6.5 persons weekly. No wonder the CES figures have been discontinued. During the same period, August 1975 to August 1980, the young unemployed in the area really felt the full force of the inhumane policies of the Fraser Government. The number of young registered unemployed more than doubled-from 826 to 1,749. Since August 1980 the unemployment position in this region has continued to deteriorate, and that is why these figures are no longer available. The present Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N.A. Brown) refuses to face this issue. When confronted on this matter he accused me of distortion. I repeat tonight the challenge to the Minister to allow the CES at Dandenong to collect and publish figures as at August 1981 on the same basis as it was done up to August 1980. This will give the answer as to why the regional figures are no longer available. The answer is that because this Government prefers to hide local unemployment figures. If that challenge is taken up the question of who is distorting the figures will be patently obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> The previous Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), left a legacy of massive unemployment as a grotesque monument to his and the Government's incompetence and callous attitude to the unemployed. He refused to admit that job creation programs were necessary . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. As the honourable member for Swan has indicated, it was an exercise in futility. The Minister replied in the obsessive rhetoric that is the hallmark of this Government, that is, the need for expenditure restraint rather than action on unemployment. This absurd attitude has been continued by the present Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. There are not enough jobs available yet both Ministers have refused to introduce any policy which has an element of job creation. The attitude of the present Minister was clearly demonstrated in his Press release of 30 August last year when he stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a time when the economy is growing and with it employment opportunities for the young, the Government considers the most practical way of helping young people is to provide increased education, training and work experience opportunities. In that way they will be able to improve their skills and better compete in the growing labour market. </PARA>
<PARA>Even if it is conceded that the Minister has the ultimate capacity for self- delusion, surely he does not believe that humbug.

In fact, it still persists with its dogmatic opposition to job creation. This Government is incapable of governing this country. Already the Prime Minister has attempted to distance himself from the Victorian election. Why? It is because he knows the electors in that State will reach the same decision as did the people in Lowe. One of the major issues in both elections was and will be the total failure of this Government on unemployment. On this issue the Fraser Government has reached the depths of political depravity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To establish the veracity of the matter of public importance proposed by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) and supported by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, that is, the further sharp deterioration in unemployment in Australia and the responsibility of the Federal Government for this situation, both spokesmen have to establish two aspects. Firstly, they have to establish that recently there has been a significant worsening in the unemployment situation and, secondly, they have to sheet home the blame for that situation-even if they do establish it-to the present Federal Government. The honourable member for Wills cited statistics that certainly do indicate some recent deterioration, and I will deal with that in a moment, but he produced not one scintilla of evidence to sheet home the responsibility for that deterioration to the Government. Meanwhile the honourable member for Holt offered as the answer to the current problems the Labor Party's proposals for economic planning-the failed panacea of the Labor Party of more and more government intervention. The unshakable faith that Labor members have in the inherent wisdom of government is amazing when all the evidence is to the contrary-that in fact the most efficient and equitable economic system is that which is subject to market forces and not central direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No one denies that there has been some deterioration in the unemployment figures on the basis of the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for February 1982. But on the basis of recent experience it is stretching the vocabulary to describe the situation as a sharp deterioration. The 7 per cent unemployment indicated by the February survey of the ABS is a disappointing increase in the light of the success which has been achieved by the Government over the last three years in reducing unemployment. But that February figure must be viewed in the light of the traditional higher levels of unemployment at that time of the year because of the influx of school leavers into the labour market and also the close down of industry over the Christmas-January period. As the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) has said--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I play a straighter bat than the honourable member for Wills, as I will show. Also, as the Minister said, one month's figures must not be taken in isolation because they do not give a true picture. Those figures need to be considered in the context of the favourable employment growth over the last three years. Over that period the annual increase in employment has ranged from 120,000 to 180,000 per annum. The figures must also be viewed in the context of the current international labour market performance, and on this basis Australia compares very favourably. As a major trading nation, Australia cannot isolate itself completely from the international economic environment. This has been acknowledged by the honourable member for Wills. The important thing is that the policies of the Australian Government minimise the detrimental impact of the international environment and the current international economic recession. This is where the performance of the Fraser Government is in marked and favourable contrast to that of the previous Whitlam Labor Government. Whereas the Whitlam Labor Government inherited an Australian economy which, as is demonstrated by a range of economic indicators applying at that time, was far healthier than those of the other industrialised countries, when the international recession hit it implemented policies which dramatically worsened that situation. Very quickly those same indicators showed that the Australian economy was performing far worse than those in the other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Worst among those policies, it allowed-indeed, encouraged-the rapid increase in wages with minimum award adult male wages increasing by 36 per cent and average weekly earnings by 28 per cent as against price increases of 16 per cent for 1974. This pronounced real increase in labour costs was entirely inappropriate in the changed international economic environment of the mid-1970s. It was first and foremost this domestic situation which caused unemployment to soar with employment in the private sector falling by over 150,000 in that 1974 period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why don't you talk about 1982?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Mr CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. One must place these factors in their historical context. When it came to office in 1975, the Fraser Government initiated policies to redress the imbalances that had been created by Labor's policies, especially on the wages front. Its inflation first strategy of public spending restraint, wages restraint and limiting money supply growth slowly but surely achieved a favourable turnround in the economy, demonstrated by a range of economic indicators which since 1979 have included the labour market. I demonstrated that a moment ago by showing that in the three years since 1979 the increase in employment has ranged on an annual basis from somewhere between 120, 000 and 180,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This marked turnround in unemployment means that in each of those years the increase was something more than for the five previous years combined. But despite this significant improvement, unemployment remains unacceptably high. This is especially the case in the context of reduced but nevertheless continuing high inflation. Of course, this fact is borne out by the February figures that have been quoted. This situation is not the responsibility of the Federal Government as the honourable member for Wills and the honourable member for Holt would have us believe. Certainly, they produced no evidence to sheet home the blame for that situation to the Government. The reason for continuing high unemployment is that community expectations, combined with industrial, economic and political power, have allowed the present Government to treat only the symptoms and not the cause of the problem. The Fraser Government has been very effective in treating those symptoms to the envy of the industrialised world and thereby has achieved a significant improvement evident in our economy. But, unless it can treat the cause, our economy will not be restored to optimum performance. That basic cause is the absence in Australia of a free market in a range of economic activities, but most notably in the price of labour. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost everybody in our community, from low income earners to high income earners, from unskilled workers to the most skilled professions, has virtually been able to set a price for his labour which he chooses. For any commodity in a market economy, including labour, there is a price at which it will all be sold- that is, clear the market. Whether through the industrial muscle of a trade union or a professional organisation, or whether by influencing the political process to regulate markets to maintain artificial price levels, especially by excluding foreign competition, in Australia over a long period the price for labour has been set at a price higher than the market clearing price. If a shopkeeper consistently sets a price for an article above the market clearing price, some will be left on the shelf. Similarly, if the price of labour is consistently above the market clearing price, some will be left on the shelf; that is, unemployment will result. The more the price is above the market clearing price, the higher will be the level of unemployment. We were reminded of this only a few moments ago by the Minister when he quoted the former Labor Treasurer, the Honourable Frank Crean, who said that one man's pay rise costs another man his job. I understand from the remarks of the honourable member for Wills that to some degree he also agrees with that concept. That provides the basis for a bipartisan approach to the problem of employment which the honourable member for Wills has been advocating in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> It is especially the case that wage increases greater than productivity increases must destroy jobs. The February figures, which indicate some increase in unemployment, have been directly influenced by this factor because recently there have been large wage increases, reduced working hours and also cost increases as a result of industrial disruption. Clearly, if jobs are to be provided for the unemployed, wages and salaries must fall to the market clearing level. I believe this requires a marked change in the attitude of the whole Australian community which, in its selfishness, has become geared to expecting more and more. In particular, this changed attitude must permeate the trade union movement if there is to be any hope of success. When the honourable member for Wills was formerly the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions he often made a great song and dance about unemployment, as he has done in this debate tonight. But all such concern evaporated when the ACTU argued its case for higher and higher wages before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. To argue in this way is to raise the expectations of the Australian wage earner beyond what is an economic reality. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, if we are to tackle this problem of unemployment, whether this Government is to be effective in solving it or whether we are to achieve it on a bipartisan basis, it is only on the basis of a changed attitude in the community that improvement will be achieved. </PARA>

<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-79 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as has already been the case with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That if, as is likely, the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests .</PARA>
<PARA> That it is also quite clear, on past evidence, that these interests will have the full backing of the Queensland government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government .</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people under its constitutional powers since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your Petitioners' sincere belief that it failed to act in 1976 and thus, failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Aboriginal people of Queensland have stated that they want land rights and self management.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government make use of its constitutional and legislative powers to grant full land rights and self-management to the Aboriginal people of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposals announced by the Minister Senator F. Chaney to amend the Social Services Act limiting the sum of money to be retained in a current cheque account to $2000 for a single pensioner and $3000 for a married couple are unacceptable in that:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is a most important one. Although the hour is late it is vital that we discuss the report as soon as possible. I will commence the discussion this evening by referring to a very specific aspect of the findings of the Dix Committee-those relating to management structure vis-a- vis what could be called the necessity to examine the industrial relations problems that have bedevilled the Australian Broadcasting Commission for some time. The Dix Committee proposes a management structure which involves the Parliament, the Minister for Communications, a board of directors and a national broadcasting consultative council. The great weakness with this issue-I speak from my earlier experience as Postmaster-General-is the problem of getting into people's minds the necessity for flexibility and creativity when dealing with commissions such as the ABC, the Australian Telecommunications Commission or the Australian Postal Commission. It is very clear that the rigidity of the Public Service Board has prevented some commissions from attracting the best personnel. Certainly, it has prevented the personnel from remaining and caused a lot of industrial strife. It is important, if there is to be an effective management structure in this area, that representatives of the staff be on the board of directors. That is essential. We did it-I think effectively-with both Telecom and the Postal Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to address honourable members quickly on a couple of specific matters. In this very creative, skilful area-unique in the types of personnel needed-we must have people with technical training. The personnel concerned fall within what could be called the engineering group and the operating group. Unfortunately over a considerable number of years there has been virtually a demarcation dispute within the structure of the ABC as to who was entitled to what rate of pay, according to whether one was an engineer or an operator. At one stage during their respective careers, the slaries of an engineer and an operator would be virtually on a par, or perhaps the engineering group would be getting more than the operators. It is recognised that the engineering group completes approximately six years training and the operating group about three years, so this very essential section of the whole technical structure of the ABC has been in some sort of turmoil in terms of equality of remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Service Board has not helped one bit throughout that period. The difficulty is quickly identified. It is that the Public Service Board structure- married to what is now called the Department of Industrial Relations-is still looking at the personnel of the ABC as though they belonged to the Public Service. For example, it must astound honourable members to find that the creative people who design costumes for productions of the ABC are virtually equated with those who work in the Australian Government Clothing Factory. That is the Public Service Board approach to the issue. Honourable members can readily understand what sort of disaster it causes to tell creative people such as I have described: 'As far as we are concerned, you must be equated with something that we have now. In your case it would be the Government Clothing Factory.'</PARA>
<PARA> A similar attitude obtains in the other area to which I have referred, that of the engineers and operators. There has been a running contest to try to get wage justice, but it has not been forthcoming. I want to refer to a recent case to show what the arbiter thought represented justice. It dealt with this very matter-an application by engineers and lecturers for wage justice, and the determination was made as recently as last October. It was an attempt to restore engineers to a level that would be at least one of parity with the operators and commensurate with their position of many years ago. The ABC was not able to give the Commissioner a clear indication of its views. It has never had independent views because it has always had to do what the Public Service Board has directed . Thus the Commission has not the flexibilty or ability to give its employees wage justice. The Commissioner said:</PARA>
<PARA> Having carefully considered all of the implications . . . I have decided thta it is in the best interests of the . . . group-</PARA>
<PARA>He refers to the particular group concerned-</PARA>
<PARA>and of the ABC and its staff generally for the nexus which has existed with the APS to be now broken. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that was pretty clear. If honourable members look at the nature of this decision they will find that it was designed to give employees justice dating from a period in 1980. It was made in percentage terms, and with a further percentage increase to pick up other factors that had applied since indexation, vis-a-vis Telecom and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission. In other words, the analysis by the arbiter indicated clearly that, because of the evidence submitted to him and because of what had happened in other areas, these people were given an increase in salary. Having been alerted to the fact that further increases are being sought, particularly by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and the possibility of a general $25 increment being granted-and of an increase being granted to metal trades employees-I am worried that within a matter of weeks there will be further movement in the Public Service structure ; in other words, that offers will be made to people within that structure on that basis. The operators, who are the ones who have been what could be termed running in tandem with the engineers, are likely to get that increase because that is the way they have always operated. The ABC-anxious to guarantee that it could at least remain on air, because technically, without the assistance of the engineering staff, programs could neither be produced nor put on air-sought, in desperation, a little guidance from the Department of Industrial Relations. It wanted to know whether it could give the engineering group the remuneration that would be given to the other group. An incredible answer received from the Department, as recently as a few days ago, clearly indicated that as far as it was concerned the engineers would get no further increase. The engineers might well decide not to continue working. Over a number of years there have been all sorts of difficulties in the ABC, for the very valid reason that these people have not received justice. Consider some of the problems that the Commission has had in trying to remain viable with a depleted technical and professional staff. The number of engineers has dropped from 700 to 400. It was suggested that 728 were needed, but the Commission now has 420, a shortfall of 308. Is it any wonder that the equipment is not up to standard, that there are faults in production, and all these things are happening solely because it is the Government's economic strategy to say that it cannot afford to extend to such people salary justice. It is essential, when we consider the submissions made to the Dix Committee and the decision by the arbiter concerning the breaking of the nexus, that the Commission be able to determine its own wages and conditions, as does the British Broadcasting Corporation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to read to the House what was said on the adjournment debate on 29 November 1962, at page 2820, when the then member for Ballarat, Mr Dudley Erwin, made a personal attack on three members of the Opposition at that time. Dudley Erwin was a backbench member of the Government. He later became a party whip and still further on was appointed to the Ministry of one of the conservative governments of this country. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I ask why certain members of the staff of the Russian Embassy, particularly one Mr Ivan Skripov, a first secretary of the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, has been a regular visitor to this House and has been cultivating the friendship of certain members of the Australian Labor Party , in particular the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). Have these members been inspired by this Soviet diplomat to ask questions on a number sensitive foreign policy issues, and have they been briefed for foreign policy debates?</PARA>
<PARA>That was a smear or an allegation made under privilege against members. Within a few months, Skripov was persona non grata in this country and because of certain allegations arising out of this speech which were made in the newspapers of the day, I took libel action. In March 1964, when evidence came before the court, it was found that an article had been written by a John Bennetts of the Melbourne Age in July of 1962 giving all the detail's of Mr Erwin's speech several months before the speech to which I have referred was made in this Parliament. If people look at page 2820 of Hansard of 29 November 1962, they will find that Mr Erwin was reading under privilege his speech, which would have been written by Mr John Bennets. The fact is that on two occasions two honourable members drew to the Speaker's notice that at that time it was against Standing Orders to read one's speech on the adjournment debate. </PARA>
<PARA> This speech contained smears and allegations. The court case was so significant that it went through a jury of twelve, the Full Supreme Court of New South Wales , the full High Court then on to the Privy Council. It then came back to a second trial and then a further appeal to the Full Supreme Court. Two counts went on to the High Court and one count came back to a third trial. It was only then that Australian Consolidated Press surrendered and apologised to me. That smear was made by a Government member. It was not an isolated smear; I have heard other smears throughout my years in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) spoke on a subject. They were both here at the time when that allegation was made. Yet it seems to me that an endeavour is being made to develop double standards in this Parliament whereby because members are Ministers or Deputy Prime Ministers there is a standard for them and another for others. I mention also the allegations made against my colleagues Jim Cairns and Rex Connor. I could name other members who were smeared by Government members, but they did not get the defence that it seems to me the Deputy Prime Minister is seeking. </PARA>
<PARA> It disturbs me that today, when I sought to raise some of these issues, I was gagged by the Deputy Whip of the Government. He would not allow this evidence to come forward even although Government members had smeared other members in the past. I have referred only to my own experience. I have seen many members throughout the years smeared. Now the Government wants to put forwared a motion. I am disturbed about the first part of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the Australian community as a whole welcomes the recent pay rises granted to members of the armed Services. Certainly, as the member representing Victoria Barracks and Garden Island in Sydney, I do. The decision is an essential part of the new defence policies being developed by the Government. However, one serious anomaly stands out. I refer to the inexplicable neglect of a small but significant group, the 90 chaplains to the armed Services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1981 pay rises announced by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) on 15 December last year meant that a private had his pay increased by $1,900 a year, a major by about $3,700 and a major-general by over $8,000. Service allowances paid to officers of the rank of major or below to allow for the special circumstances of service life have been increased from $1,652 a year to $2,500 a year. I certainly agree in general with what the Minister said last year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has accepted that the existing salary structure in the Defence Force requires revision to eradicate anomalies and inequities which have existed for many years and to enable it to fulfil contemporary needs. </PARA>
<PARA>However, why is this small group of 90 chaplains to be excluded so that the starting salary of a chaplain-$17,469 a year-is now less than that of the highest grade corporal, at a starting out salary of $17,700 a year, and considerably less than that of a captain, the rank which is customarily seen as a chaplain's equivalent, at a starting out salary of some $22,739 a year. A chaplain of 18 years' seniority now receives $27,471 a year while a captain of five years' seniority receives $28,286. The only change is that a new rank of principal chaplain has been introduced, at a salary of $29,000 a year. What reason has been advanced for this neglect of chaplains? I turn to the report of the Committee of Reference for Defence Force Pay which was presented to the Minister for Defence on 4 November 1981. The committee said:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems clear that the conditions of service for chaplains in the Defence Force have surpassed by a considerable margin those conditions which apply generally to chaplains in the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet, according to my information, in terms of movement alone this is not the case. In the average Uniting Church parish a Minister can reckon on a stay in the one parish of five to 10 years. In the Presbyterian and Anglican Churches, the period of tenure is much longer than that. How can this compare with the frequent movements of service life? A chaplain will find that within a decade his children have attended more than 10 schools. The report recommends that an independent review be completed on chaplains' pay scales. I understand also that the Department of Defence is reconsidering the situation. Nevertheless, what concerns me is the lack of interest in any value on the work of chaplains in our armed forces that is revealed by this dilatory approach. Quite apart from the spiritual services provided to those who seek them, chaplains have invaluable roles to play in the provision of welfare to all ranks and in the maintenance of morale. Their duties extend from lecturing in colleges and apprenticeship training schools to marriage counselling. They share the roughest of conditions with the men and are generally on call 24 hours a day. Why are such services not given their due? Do we want them to be belittled and whittled away or do we want those who provide those services adequately recompensed? Do we want recruits of the highest calibre added to their numbers? As I have said, only about 90 chaplains serve over 60,000 personnel of the armed services. Surely we can afford to be more generous to this devoted group who for the first time have been excluded from the pay rises offered to all other personnel of the armed services. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make some remarks on the whole issue of immigration, following the debate on immigration that occurred today. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) in his remarks, especially in his reply to comments made in the debate, sought to throw cold water on certain humanitarian concerns of honourable members and talked a great deal about the onerous difficulties involved in maintaining a sensible immigration policy, especially in the area of refugees. No one denies that serious difficulties are involved when people have to be turned away or their applications have to be delayed. Everyone knows that over one million people are applying and only just over 100,000 are being admitted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I was disturbed to hear the Minister imply that the economic difficulties we are witnessing at the present time should be the major consideration in setting limits on the level of immigration and refugee intake. I think that shows a severe deficiency in the Government's policy. There is no general population policy on which the Government bases an immigration policy. The Government simply proceeds by a series of ad hoc adjustments and measures, without determining a general policy on population growth and the role of immigration in that context. Last year in the review of demographic trends we were told that Australia had reached the stage of zero population growth; that is, without immigration there would be no natural increase in population, our numbers would remain stagnant and perhaps would even reduce. We were told also- this has been repeated many times by Ministers who have not wanted to grant increases in the pension or who have wanted to reduce the rights of pensioners- that the number of old people in Australia as a proportion of the total population is increasing dramatically; indeed, by the mid-1990s the number of Australians over 65 years of age will increase by 50 per cent and those of over 70 years of age will increase by 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Those facts show that there is a need for a coherent population policy. Unless we force people to have more babies, immigration is absolutely necessary to resolve that problem. The Minister should be emphasising that fact rather than conceding to those minority sectors of the community which seek to blame the economic problems on immigration. We have had enough debates about the causes of economic problems. I believe that no credence should be given to honourable members on either side of the House who try to blame immigration for our economic problems at the present time. What is required is more research and discussion towards developing a population policy which takes into account the various factors concerned and which places the role of immigration in its proper perspective. Most other nations have a population policy of that kind. We need to work towards developing such a population policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, let me make a couple of remarks about the refugee policy. The Opposition accepts the importance of refugees as part of our total immigration intake, although I am not entirely sure that there should not be some separation between refugees on the one hand and what is probably called migration on the other hand, so that people who want to migrate to Australia are not affected by changes in the total number of refugees taken in. Perhaps in an overall population policy we ought to think about separating one group from the other. I do not have time to elaborate on this point tonight, but I will do so at another time. I still believe that the measures outlined in the Minister's statement allow him to assume a part of an unbalanced policy in terms of where the refugees will come from. We still do not have set down principles which state that the refugee policy should be balanced so that refugees from all sections of the world where they exist have an equal right to apply for entry to Australia and to come to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I remind the honourable member for Burke that it was in 1974 that the previous Labor Government clamped down on immigration for reasons of unemployment and the economic problems in this country. It was the previous Labor Government that made that the principal determinant of the immigration intake of the time. As a result, in the following year, after 1974 when those restrictions came fully into play, we saw the lowest immigration intake in this country that we had seen for many years. There was a virtual elimination of family reunion cases as a result of the Labor Government' s policies. Since then we have seen a gradual rise in immigration in a controlled, planned and rational way, to the extent that last financial year we had an intake of about 111,000. That is on the increase. We are getting a gradual increase in the immigration intake in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that it is this Government, and this Minister in particular, that have developed the requirements of humanitarian concerns, of economic factors and of the sort of social factors that we must take into account in developing an attitude towards immigration and in balancing the various components of a total immigration policy. The Minister has not sought to give credence to those who are trying to blame immigration for the economic problems of this country. Indeed, I suggest that on many occasions the Minister has stated that he acknowledges the very valuable contribution which our immigration intake has made to the economic development and progress of this country. The immigration intake has indeed introduced into our economy a dynamic factor which otherwise would have been lacking. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no use just taking a simplistic view of this issue. One must adopt a balanced view. If one goes back to the sort of immigration program we had in the 1950s and 1960s one must acknowledge that then we were looking for sheer numbers , to a very large extent, to man the factories, to provide the pairs of hands we needed for our work force. In these days of technological developments, when industrial developments rely on technology rather than the employment of sheer numbers of people, we have to be very careful about balancing the immigration intake. We have to ensure that we have reasonable opportunities for employment to offer those whom we admit to this country, a wealthy and lucky country, a fortunate country, as well as making available a reasonable number of places to those who find themselves in unfortunate situations as displaced persons. I think the speech given by the honourable member for Burke is a discredit to him. It does not acknowledge what was actually done by the previous Labor Government to immigration policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem when talking about Aboriginal culture and customs is that many white Australians have no understanding of the first settlers in this country, the Aboriginal people. I do not say they lack sympathy because if they had the opportunity to travel to the northern areas of Australia to meet and talk to Aboriginals in their own settlements, as I have done, they would appreciate the problems. I want to say a few words tonight in relation to a letter I have received from the Chairman of the Central Land Council of the Northern Territory, Mr Stan Scrutton. As he points out in his letter, the issue of sacred sites is of fundamental importance to Aboriginal people as it is an issue both of justice and of religious tolerance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government of the Northern Territory is attempting to promulgate legislation with the aim of watering down the definition of Aboriginal sacred sites in the Northern Territory. It is clear that the intention of this legislation is to make sure that the determination of whether a site is sacred or not will depend not on the criteria established by Aboriginal law and tradition but on criteria determined by the Northern Territory administration. It is also clear that the reason for the proposed legislation is to enable the developers and government instrumentalities to proceed with the construction of buildings, factories and mines, without the impediment of having to take into account the religious traditions of the Aboriginal people. I quote from the Central Land Council Press release on this matter:</PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult to convey the enormity of such activities to the European mind. It was like condoning the desecrating of a war cemetery to build a sewerage farm or the bulldozing of a cathedral to sink a mining shaft. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed legislation was introduced without consultation with the Aboriginal people and, I understand, may also require an amendment to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act by the Commonwealth Parliament. One of my reasons for speaking tonight is to alert the House of Representatives to this grasping piece of proposed legislation with the aim of ensuring that any approach to amend the Commonwealth Act is rejected by this Parliament. It would seem that the Northern Territory Government has completely lost sight of the real nature of the Aboriginals and their attachment to the land, particularly their sacred sites. The sites are related to the Dreamtime, a period measured in thousands of yers, not in the mere 250 years of white European settlement. Only the Aboriginal people who have been taught Aboriginal laws and customs can identify the sacred sites. Songs and corroborees are associated with them and they are a vital part of tribal ceremonies. The land, animals, trees and plant life of the sacred sites are of great religious significance to the Aboriginal people. The changes proposed by the Northern Territory Government will result in the destruction of the sacred sites and this will ultimately lead to the destruction of the Aboriginal people as an independent race with a separate identity and a separate culture.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to quote from an address given by one of our most distinguished Australians, Dr H. C. Coombs. Dr Coombs, when speaking on an Australian Broadcasting Commission Guest of Honour program, said:</PARA>
<PARA> In taking the land, we did not merely deprive Aborigines of property. We took also the source of their livelihood, the very foundation of their society, the basis of the rights and obligations on which it was built, and above all the source of the religious convictions which gave purpose and justification to their lives. </PARA>
<PARA>I call on the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) to recognise the attack by the Northern Territory Government on the rights of the Aboriginal people by resisting pressures from vested interests which seek to turn back the clock and introduce legislation that can only result in a renewal of spiritual degredation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just recently a report from the Mackay Regional Development Bureau came into my hands. I thought it would be interesting to quote some of the figures in the report which refer to my electorate of Dawson. The Bureau estimates that for the year ended June 1981 total exports from the Mackay region amounted to nearly $1 billion-the figure was $978.72m-and accounted for 5.12 per cent of total Australian exports. As Mackay represents about 75 per cent of the population of the entire electorate, I then took into account some of the export aspects that were not covered by the Mackay figures. For the year ended June 1981 the value of sugar was $556m, coal exports amounted to $710m, beef approximately $80m and tourism $40m. When I threw in about $10m for other activities I was left with the startling figure of $1.4 billion which represents 7.3 per cent of total Australian exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to pay a tribute to the Bureau for bringing this information to my attention and to the attention of the people it serves. But more importantly the report gives me an opportunity to indicate to the House that there are wealthy electorates such as Dawson throughout Australia which contribute not only to our export trade but also generally to the revenue of governments, State and Federal . In fact, looking at the figures for the year ended June 1980, the electorate of Dawson contributed the greatest amount of personal taxation of any Federal electorate in Queensland. In addition, tax paid by mining giants such as Utah certainly made a major contritution to Commonwealth coffers. Wealth collected from this source will further increase. Within the last fortnight I did a rather extensive tour around the coalfields in the northern section of the Bowen Basin where Mt Isa Mines Ltd is developing a port facility at Abbot Point. An expansion program is being undertaken at Collinsville itself. The newest in the Newlands mining lease at Newlands will have an attached satellite town of Glenden catering for a couple of thousand people. This total development will cost in the vicinity of $550m. At the bottom of the electorate, further development is being carried out at Middlemount. In fact, this development trained its first coal from German Creek only a couple of week ago. That development will cost $400m. If we couple this development with the contemplated coke works to be sited near the Hay Point export harbour, we are talking about another $1 billion. The Condor shale oil deposits at Proserpine just north of Mackay are under investigation now to the tune of $23m to see whether the shale oil in that area might be developed. Added to that, the Comalco company is talking about smelters and refineries around Bowen. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to point out that private enterprise, using Australian capital and some overseas capital, is developing the division of Dawson and north Queensland. Very little contribution is being made to this expansion by the State or Federal governments. I realise that Federal revenue has to be spent in areas such as welfare, health and education. But these are non-productive areas in that they generate the same amount of expenditure each year. I believe it behoves Government, particularly the Commonwealth Government, to make sure that the wealthy electorates , those that are producing the wealth for Australia, are also given some assistance. I feel that if assistance in respect of roads were given to electorates such as Dawson and indeed all those electorates in north Queensland, productivity would improve, and wealth would increase, resulting in additional revenue to the Commonwealth. The biggest difficulty I have is justifying the expenditure of Commonwealth revenue from the point of view of what is required in return. Roads, both national highways and secondary highways , are certainly a major item. Also of importance are water research and water facilities. In fact, something along these lines is being done in respect of the Burdekin Dam. However, more needs to be done in this area. In addition, attention should be given to soil conservation research to go hand in hand with the development of the grain lands west of Mackay. </PARA>
