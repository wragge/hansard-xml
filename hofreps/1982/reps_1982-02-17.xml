<PARA> That the Budget imposition of additional sales tax to both existing sales taxed items and to previously exempt goods:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) will add to the regressivity of the tax structure by imposing a similar burden on all sections of the community-regardless of the capacity to pay tax;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) will be highly inflationary and a disincentive to economic performance in key sectors of manufacturing industry, e.g., car manufacturing, textiles and footwear, boat-building;</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Tampons, sanitary napkins, vaginal deodorants and similar sanitary products to be re-classified under Therapeutic Agents (not under ''Cosmetics'' as at present), in order to bring them under the scrutiny of the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. We believe manufacture must be under the strictest hygienic conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) After re-classification, we urge an immediate government-funded inquiry into all aspects of manufacture and content of these products. This must lead to : (i) contents of product and instructions for correct usage to be shown on packaging; (ii) removal of synthetic fibres, chemicals or ingredients that are potentially or actually harmful to users.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Allocation of extra funding for ongoing research by the National Health and Medical Research Council into these products, results of this research to be made public to ensure all health workers and potential users are fully informed.

<TITLE>Excise on Beer</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The hotel industry in Australia is long-established and a valuable part of the community of this nation, providing places where the people may partake of the three basic needs of life: a place to eat, a place to drink, a place to sleep.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The hotel industry is accepted throughout the nation as occupying an important place in the social and economic activities of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The hotel industry is almost entirely within the private sector and makes a large contribution to the government in taxes of various kinds.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The hotel industry has a need to sustain an appropriate level of turnover and growth, to make profit, and to sustain and improve the level of employment.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The hotel industry of Australia is gravely concerned at published reports that the Government intends to increase excise charges on beer in the forthcoming Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Sales of beer constitute the major source of income of most of the industry' s 5811 hotels in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The very steep rises in beer excise in 1975 and 1978 severely retarded the growth of the Australian hotel industry.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. Any further increases in excise on beer in the 1981 Budget would further retard the industry at a time when growth is essential to maintaining economic viability and the ability to serve the constantly growing needs of the community .</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Such is its significance as a community requirement, beer occupies a place on the consumer price index, and any alteration to its cost to the community would have an inflationary effect.</PARA>
<PARA> 10. Any increase in excise would result in and force the hotel industry to pass on such increases to the consumer by way of higher prices for beer.</PARA>
<PARA> 11. Higher excise would be only the starting point for an upward spiral in beer prices because of the presence of other factors, such as State licence fee taxes , which are directly linked to excise rates.</PARA>
<PARA> 12. The hotel industry of Australia already is gravely handicapped by heavy excise and other tax imposts, its growth is at a standstill; and, inevitably must decline if beer excise is increased.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that honourable members of the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Recognise the importance and place of the Australian hotel industry in the social and economic life of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Accept that the viability of the hotel industry is essential to the maintenance of employment opportunities and stability of the industry is essential to enable it to continue to provide for the hotel needs of the nation in this period of growing population and increasing tourism.</PARA>
<PARA> And further, that honourable members of the House of Representatives resist and reject any move to increase excise on beer.</PARA>

<PARA> That neither the guardian's allowance nor the child allowance is indexed.</PARA>
<PARA> That sales tax increases on such basic essentials as clothing and shoes will severely disadvantage single parents.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence on a matter . Yesterday in the censure debate there was a restriction on time in accordance with what appeared to be Standing Order 91. I put it to you that a mistake was made in the time allocated. Standing Order 110 states that a censure motion has precedence over other business. Standing Order 91 states that on a censure motion the mover is allowed 30 minutes and the Prime Minister or anybody deputed by him to speak is allowed 30 minutes. In other words, time limits are provided for censure motions. The motion moved yesterday was a censure motion pursuant to Standing Order 110, and it received precedence. When you asked the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair)-I am not arguing this point-whether he accepted the motion as a censure motion he replied 'no', meaning, I think, that he did not accept the censure but was prepared to accept the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of this the debate had to proceed pursuant to a motion not otherwise provided for and the time limit for my leader was reduced from 30 minutes to 20 minutes. This also affected the time limit of other speakers in the debate. I thought I would make the point. I am not complaining, but I think there was a misunderstanding when the Leader of the House was asked whether he accepted the censure. He said 'no' but he really accepted the motion which is what the whole tenor of Standing Order 110 is about. We received the precedence but we did not receive the proper allocated time pursuant to Standing Order 91. I raise the matter now because there may be other censure motions from time to time and we would not want any misunderstanding as to our rights in the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was aware that this issue as to the difference in time could arise , and I had prepared myself before the event. Standing Order 110 provides that if a motion is moved a Minister may declare that it is accepted by the Government as a want of confidence motion. I asked the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) whether he accepted the motion as a want of confidence motion. It was to that question that I understood him to say 'no'. Accordingly, the time for speeches was 20 minutes. Standing Order 91 relates to a censure or want of confidence motion accepted by a Minister as provided for under Standing Order 110. That was the reason why I put the question to the Leader of the House. My understanding was that he declined to accept it as a want of confidence motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, perhaps I can speak at this point. The motion was presented under Standing Order 110 which contains two elements. One of them is the acceptance by the Government that there is a motion of want of confidence in the Government. But because the Opposition has moved such motions so frequently, I felt that the currency was debased. The motion certainly was very similar in its general form to the matter of public importance listed by another member of the Opposition for that day. In those circumstances I did not accept it on behalf of the Government as a motion of want of confidence in the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That this House expresses its deep sympathy to the family and friends of Dr Neil Aggett, who died in mysterious circumstances in a prison cell in South Africa in which he was enduring solitary confinement, and requests the Speaker to convey this message to those concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>I am very glad of this opportunity to seek the support of the Parliament for this motion which, in effect, highlights a transgression of basic human rights. Dr Neil Aggett, as most honourable members will know, was a white South African who worked with a non-white trade union. He died in mysterious circumstances in a prison cell in South Africa, a cell in which he was enduring solitary confinement. He was in that prison cell because he was hauled there under the South African Terrorism Act for unspecified reasons. No charge had been laid against him at the time of his death. At the time of my speaking in this Parliament, as far as I know the South African Government has provided no satisfactory explanation for this outrageous situation. I believe it is important to have bipartisan support for this motion immediately. To achieve this I have drafted the motion in what I describe as 'softer' terms. However, the implication of the message is quite clear and I am very grateful to the Minister for Foreign Affiars (Mr Street) for having seconded this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Anticipating that the motion will be passed, Mr Speaker, I hope that you will convey the feeling of the Parliament to the appropriate people. If you give me the call later I will give notice of a stronger motion on this subject in the hope that we can debate the matter at greater length on another day when more members will feel free to take part. I realise that man's inhumanity to man is being practised in many countries, black and white and on both sides of iron and bamboo curtains. I only wish that we could bring all such cases to the attention of sensitive people of goodwill, as we are bringing forward this motion today. As this cannot be done perhaps we can make this case of Dr Neil Aggett representative of all those cases. It is a clear transgression of civil liberties being perpetrated in a country which has known better in the past, in a country where there are no excuses at all. I hope that this motion will be passed unanimously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Representatives of the Sinai Multinational Force of Observers, known generally as the MFO, are discussing with Australian officials the composition and terms of Australian participation in the MFO. I am pleased to be able to say that discussions are proceeding very satisfactorily. Some matters are still to be resolved but I anticipate that agreement will be reached in the near future. As will be appreciated, our contribution needs to be integrated carefully with that of other participating countries and for the terms and operational conditions to be broadly similar throughout the Force. The necessary documents constituting the agreement itself are now being prepared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian contribution will be approximately 120 persons and eight Iroquois helicopters. The main group will comprise members of Royal Australian Air Force squadrons who will provide air crew, maintenance and airfield services for the Australian helicopters and will also perform air traffic control duties for the MFO as a whole. We will also provide up to 10 staff officers for the Force commander's headquarters and may contribute a small number-perhaps up to four-of the Force's military police investigation unit. The Australian contingent is to be established at El Gorah in the northern part of the Sinai by 20 March this year. That is the date specified in the protocol establishing the MFO.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the distance involved in order to meet that date, it is necessary for HMAS Tobruk to depart Australia on Thursday, 18 February-that is tomorrow- with helicopters and support equipment. The main Australian contingent will leave by air nearer the establishment date which, as I mentioned a minute ago, is 20 March. To answer the final part of the honourable gentleman's question, in keeping with the earlier announcement, Australia's contribution will be of limited duration. It is likely to be two years, depending upon the terms to be agreed between the MFO and the other participating countries. Any renewal of the commitment would require agreement by the Australian Government. The Australian commander will consult the Australian authorities before complying with any order which he believes may not be consistent with the agreed purposes of the force. The Australian Government, of course, reserves the right to withdraw the contingent should this prove necessary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Prime Minister. I refer to his latest efforts of last night to try to slide out of earlier firm commitments for substantial income tax reductions this year. I ask: Is it a fact that the $330m revenue involved in a full year in the event of rejection of sales tax measures represents about $1 per week for taxpayers on average? Is it a fact that income tax revenue will increase by some 25 per cent in the forthcoming financial year and that the increase will be of the order of some $5,500m, the equivalent of an average income tax reduction of some $18 a week? Is it a fact that even allowing for inflation of 11 per cent and real growth in government revenue of one per cent the Government could still provide a total income tax reduction in excess of $2,700m with comfort in the forthcoming financial year? Will he give a firm and honest undertaking that there will be income tax cuts at least of this order in the 1982-83 Budget, a promise that for a change will be kept?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is much too early yet to know whether there is any substance at all in the Leader of the Opposition's figures in relation to next year. He knows quite well that both the Treasurer and I, at the time of the introduction of the current Budget, indicated that we were trying to put ourselves into a position where we would be much better placed in a responsible way to introduce income tax cuts. The Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats know quite well that the very modest broadening of the base of indirect taxes-the additions to indirect taxes-was an essential part of that policy. Therefore, the action of the Leader of the Opposition in which he has now been joined by the Democrats, who do not seem to know what foot they stand on, is taking $330m of revenue away from next year, and is coupled with the actions of the strikers affiliated with the Australian Labor Party on Bass Strait, who have reduced revenue by $200m to $300m in this year. If that is continued next year we will have an overall reduction of over $500m next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that this is a deliberate act on the part of the Australian Labor Party to try to make it very difficult indeed for us to introduce income tax cuts in the next Budget. It just demonstrates the total and absolute humbug and hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition, who poses as somebody who once introduced a responsible Budget, but it was not responsible. It had inherent in it a deficit approaching $4 billion. If there were an equivalent deficit today it would approach $8 billion. What would that do to interest rates, to inflation and to unemployment?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the June quarter of 1981, 53 per cent of the industrial disputes in Australia were in New South Wales. In 1981 there were many stoppages in the electricity generation and maintenance areas. There were many stoppages in electricity construction in New South Wales during that year. In one month alone-in February of 1981-over two-thirds of the working days lost in Australia were lost in New South Wales. In the first 10 months of 1981, 44 per cent of the working days lost in Australia were lost due to strikes and industrial stoppages in New South Wales-almost two-thirds more than in Victoria over the same period. It is well worth noting that New South Wales, as a result of the Wran Labor Government's policies, is very much the strike capital of Australia. As a result of that, in recent times unemployment has been falling in Victoria while it has been rising in New South Wales. That clearly is a direct consequence again of the actions of the Wran Labor Government.

Mr Wran said that there would be no black-outs and no reductions in efficiency. He said that there would be no increases in costs. Then he made deals to reduce the number of hours worked each week from 37 to 35. As a result of the obviously increased costs, maintenance was clearly cut with the result that three out of four of the Liddell generators have to be rebuilt and reconstructed.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YI7">Sir PHILLIP LYNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Significant progress has been made and is being made in the development of an internationally competitive Australian manufacturing industry with less complicated, lower and more stable levels of protection. In recent years the average nominal rate of assistance to manufacturing has declined from 24 per cent in 1968-69 to 15 per cent in 1980-81, a fall of almost 40 per cent. In effective rate terms, the comparable figures are 36 per cent, declining to 24 per cent. This decline in protection includes the results of decisions to accept in recent years the overwhelming majority of IAC recommendations, in particular the outcome of the tariff review which is now nearing completion. I may go beyond that and say that further reductions are in train as a result of decisions to phase down in stages assistance for more than 20 product groupings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unlike many other countries, Australia relies principally on the tariff for the protection of its industries and that, self-evidently to honourable members on both sides of the House, is a more visible form of protection than that which applies in most markets around the world. If one is taking an overall judgment about the level of protection, it is fair to look at the recent record of import performance. Total imports to this country grew by almost 68 per cent in the three years to 1980-81. Honourable members are aware that a substantial proportion of imports to this country from developing nations do enter at concessional rates. On the latest figures which are available, Australia's per capita level of imports of textiles and apparel is almost twice that of the European Economic Community, two and a half times that of the United States of America and almost five times that of Japan. The level of footwear imports from ASEAN countries is seven times that of the EEC, 11 times that of the United States and 120 times that of Japan. The assertion here is that our record of tariff reduction is creditable by international comparison.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable gentleman quite rightly raises, in the context of making judgments about the level of the tariff, the recent exclusion of the textile, clothing and footwear industries and also the passenger motor vehicle industry. These industries account for only 12 per cent of Australian value added, with the majority of manufacturing being at around 88 per cent. This is still to be reviewed by the IAC. I should qualify that, of course, by referring to the fact that these industries are naturally subject to a wide range of assistance levels from zero to almost 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I state in reply to the honourable gentleman that the IAC general reference on the lowering of Australian protection will be in report form to the Government I think towards the end of this month or certainly in the early days of March. It will be a matter for the Government to take decisions on the basis of that report, having regard to all of the factors involved. The Australian tariff has been, in the history of this country, one of the most controversial issues which this Parliament has dealt with. It will remain so. That allows for genuine differences of view on both sides of the House and between individual members on both sides of the House.</PARA>

The honourable gentleman was right when he said that, when those tax scales were introduced, about 90 per cent of taxpayers paid the standard tax rate. That percentage now stands at around 80 per cent. I suspect that the honourable gentleman's projections are highly suspect. Whatever the level of taxation is now under this Government, when we hear the Leader of the Opposition saying that he is a high tax man and when we hear his shadow Treasurer saying that in 1983 there will be a mammoth task of convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax, it is perfectly plain that the Australian Labor Party wants a much higher level of taxation. There are arguments about a capital gains tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to reports, particularly in New South Wales, alleging that the Commonwealth Government has cut funding for technical and further education in 1982. Those reports go on to blame the Commonwealth Government for cut-backs in New South Wales, particularly in the pre- apprenticeship area. The facts are quite different from what is claimed in those reports. In 1982, the Commonwealth has increased its funding in real terms in every category within the TAFE area, be it in the recurrent areas, for which we have a limited responsibility, or in the capital area, in which over the past five or six years we have taken unto ourselves an increased role and an increased responsibility. Indeed, in December 1980 quarter prices the total increase in New South Wales is from $62.4m in 1981 to $71.8m in 1982. The charges that the Commonwealth has reduced funding in real terms in New South Wales and that, as a result, technical college courses have to be cut back are quite inaccurate. If there have been cut-backs in funding and in the provision of courses in New South Wales the responsibility for that rests squarely on the shoulders of the New South Wales Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me make a special reference to the pre-apprenticeship area. Last year, with our approval, New South Wales used some of its transition funding to fund pre- apprenticeship courses. The amount sought from the Commonwealth for that purpose in 1981 was $262,000; that is, $262,000 of the New South Wales share of transition money was sought. This year it has sought only $105,000 for this purpose. The New South Wales Government is responsible for determining the priorities in this area. So, on two scores the New South Wales Government is vulnerable: Firstly, if there has been an overall decrease in funding and an overall decrease in the level of the provision of courses in the TAFE area in New South Wales, it is a matter for the New South Wales Government; and, secondly, insofar as pre-apprenticeship is concerned, in the context of transition New South Wales sought to use less of its allocation in that area this year than it did last year. It is that Government that determines the priorities and it is that Government that needs to stand up and accept the responsibility.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the honourable member for Wills would be interested in a sensible answer, if the Leader of the Opposition would allow me to give it. That is obviously one of the reasons why we want to be in a position to reduce, in a legitimate and responsible way, the general burden of income tax. I hope there will be co-operation from the Opposition in putting Australia in a position where that can be achieved. Passage of the measures which either are before the Senate or will come before the Senate will obviously be a help in relation to that. When one is talking about taxation on pensions it is worth noting that it was a former government through the present Leader of the Opposition, as Minister for Social Security, which first introduced taxation on pensions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In proposing this matter of public importance for discussion, I seek to bring before this House an issue which is of increasing and acute concern to the great majority of Australians. The crushing increase in the tax burden which has occurred during the six years of the Fraser Government has drastically affected the living standards of all but the very wealthy in Australian society. It is on behalf of all those who are struggling under the weight of the Government's tax policies the low and middle income earners, the unemployed, the pensioners and all socially disadvantaged persons, all those who are appalled at the Government's refusal to alleviate the escalating tax burden, that I call for immediate action to reduce taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The case for reduced taxes cannot be disputed. this case is summed up under the following points. Firstly, this Government since it came to office-even before then-created legitimate expectations in the minds of people that it would reduce the tax burden. It is an expectation continually confounded by the Government's action in increasing the tax burden. Secondly, low and middle income Australians are now bearing a much heavier burden of direct and indirect taxation than when Labor was last in office. That burden is getting heavier all the time. Thirdly, the burden of increased taxes is being exacerbated by the additional burden of increased interest rates. Fourthly, the state of the economy requires reduced taxation to stimulate economic activity and to take the pressure off interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government came to power in 1975 with an avalanche of tax cutting rhetoric proclaiming that it would reduce taxes and that it was a low tax party. Time does not allow me to go through all those statements which are well in the minds of all honourable members in this House, having been mentioned many times in the last six years. But it has undoubtedly been a key part of this Government 's rhetoric that it was supposedly the low tax party. Despite these promises, re -run throughout six years in office, this Government has shown by its actions that they are nothing more than a massive deception of the Australian electorate . In no field has the Government's performance failed so dismally to live up to its promise as it has in the field of taxation. Any examination of the facts-any examination whatever-will show that the Government is not a low tax government and that it never has been. On the contrary, the indisputable fact is that the Fraser Government is the highest taxing government in the nation's history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member will see what the facts are in a moment in respect of a comparison between Labor and the present Government. Between 1981- 82, the total Commonwealth taxation receipts were estimated to represent 25 1/2 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. This compares with 23.3 per cent in the last year of the Labor Government-I ask the honourable member who interjected to take note-or an average of 22 1/2 per cent over the three years of the Labor Government. If Commonwealth tax receipts, as a proportion of gross domestic product, this year were the same as in the last year of Labor, 1975-76, Australians would be paying $3,200m less tax which is equivalent to $13.60 a week less tax for each Australian household.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The table shows that the increasing tax burden has not been spread evenly across all taxpayers. On the contrary, the burden has been predominantly borne by ordinary wage and salary earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Net pay-as-you-earn receipts-that is, taxes collected from wage and salary earners-have risen from 41.7 per cent of total tax revenue in 1975-76 to 45.7 per cent this year. As a proportion of total wages and salaries and supplements paid, net pay-as-you-earn collections have risen from 41.7 per cent to 45.7 per cent over the same period. At the same time, taxes collected from non-pay-as-you -earn taxpayers-those with incomes from business, property or dividends- have fallen from 13.1 per cent of total tax revenue to 9.5 per cent. From 1975-76 to 1980-81, the last year for which statistics are available, tax payments by pay- as-you-earn taxpayers increased by 101 per cent while total wages and salaries and supplements grew by only 72 per cent. Over the same period tax payments by non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers grew by 56 per cent while their incomes grew by 94 per cent. Such figures amply demonstrate the effect of Government action in amending the tax scales very much in favour of high income earners and its abysmal failure to control tax avoidance and evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, over the same period company tax collections have fallen as a percentage of total tax collections and indirect taxes, which hit hardest at those on the lowest incomes, have increased as a proportion of total taxes. So it is clear that the increasing tax burden is falling squarely on the shoulders of Australian wage and salary earners while companies and those with incomes from professions, business, dividends and interest are, as a group, paying a smaller share of taxation thanks to the Fraser Government's tax policies. If the shares of income tax paid by wage and salary earners, companies and those receiving non-wage incomes were unchanged in this current financial year from those in the last year determined by a Labor Government-1975-76-wage and salary earners would be paying $1,500m less income tax this year, non-wage earners would be paying over $1,300m more income tax this year and companies would be paying $500m more income tax this year. These figures give a clear indication of the direction of this Government's tax priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is clear that wage earners have borne the brunt of the increasing tax burden, that burden has not been spread equally amongst them but rather has been loaded on to the vast majority of low and middle income earners. Those with very high incomes, on the other hand, have received substantial tax reductions thanks to this Government's tax policies. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables which detail the change in the income tax burden resulting from the Government's changes to the income tax schedules, firstly, for a taxpayer without dependents and, secondly, for a taxpayer with a dependent spouse and two children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. These tables clearly show that the vast majority of taxpayers are worse off as a result of the Fraser Government's tax policies. In fact, 98 per cent of all taxpayers are paying a higher proportion of their incomes in tax this year than they did during the last year of the Labor Government. All single taxpayers whose incomes have risen in line with average earnings and who earn less than $32,000 this year will pay more of their incomes in tax this year than they did in 1975-76. Furthermore, the increases are much greater for those on the lowest incomes. For example, a person earning $9,500 this year whose income has risen only in line with average weekly earnings since 1975-76-that is, it has gone up by 88 per cent-is paying almost 150 per cent more tax or an extra $7.77 a week than he would be paying if his tax had gone up only as fast as his wages. An income earner on $17,000-around average weekly earnings-will be paying 97 per cent more tax compared with an 88 per cent growth in earnings. Similar results apply to taxpayers with a dependent spouse and children. Taxpayers in this category who earn less than $37,700 a year and whose incomes have risen in line with average weekly earnings will be paying more of their income in tax this year than they did in 1975-76. Only those on very high incomes are better off. A single taxpayer earning $47,000 this year, for example -about three times average earnings-will be $4.53 a week better off while someone earning almost $95,000 will be nearly $50 a week better off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These examples clearly show the crushing inequities of the income tax policies pursued by this Government. These inequities have resulted from the Government's failure to fully index taxes against inflation, as it promised in 1975 so strongly to do, and reflects from now on the abandonment of tax indexation altogether which means that the number of taxpayers paying tax at more than 32c in the dollar will rise from a half a million in 1977-78 to about 2.1 million this year. This situation also threatens to take average weekly earnings into the 46c tax bracket next year which will subject all pensioners to tax within a year. Inequities have also resulted from the Government's failure to act decisively against tax avoidance which on the Government's own highly conservative figuring is costing around $1,000m a year or about $4 a week extra tax for every wage and salary earner to make up for the activities of the tax bludgers. The inequities in the income tax system have been compounded by huge increases in petrol tax which has gone from $264m in 1975 to $3,440m this year and sales taxes which are to go up an additional $500m this year alone. In addition most taxpayers are struggling under the burden of higher interest rates which have increased the repayments on an average bank home loan of $30,000 by $ 15 a week over the last two years and they are paying higher costs for health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the developments which I have just outlined it is little wonder that the great majority of taxpayers are crying out for tax relief-relief which is thoroughly justified on the basis of equity to the taxpayers. It is also something which is justified on the basis of economic responsibility. The Government argues that to give such tax relief would be economically irresponsible because, firstly, the impending blockage of the sales tax extension to a whole range of new items would reduce its capacity to cut income tax, and secondly, to reduce taxes now would destroy the Budget strategy and put more pressure on interest rates. Let me briefly deal with those two points. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the first one let me say that I will deal with it more fully in the sales tax debate which is to follow this discussion but I note now that the amount of revenue at stake in respect of sales tax for this financial year as a result of the Bills which are to come before the House this afternoon is only $ 59m. Yet the Government is saying that because it cannot get this $59m that will make it more difficult for it to cut income tax. What a load of nonsense that is . The Government is talking about $59m which represents 0.1 per cent of budgeted tax revenue for this year and it is saying that because it cannot get that revenue it cannot possibly give any tax cuts at present. The full year effect is $330m, and although it is a substantial sum of money in itself, it pales into insignificance when it is compared with the amount of money which this Government will get next year from personal income tax unless there are tax cuts . Using the assumption that was used in this year's Budget, that is that there would be a growth in wages and salaries of 13 1/2 per cent and an employment growth of 2 per cent-those assumptions may be way out but I just use them for the purpose of the exercise-there will be a $5 billion increase in personal income tax revenue in 1982-83. I suspect that the basis of those calculations is quite likely to be out and that the wages and salaries increase will be higher and the employment figure much less, but the overall basis is likely to be reasonably accurate. A $5 billion increase in income tax revenue next year, if this Government does not amend the tax scales, dwarfs the $330m it is talking about in respect of sales tax and shows what utter nonsense it is to argue that tax cuts cannot be given because of some blockage of sales tax legislation in the Senate. I think that puts that one into perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point is that the Government says that it must maintain the Budget strategy. It does not seem to realise that the Budget strategy is absolutely in tatters. There is no Budget strategy that is working at present. All of the Government's frenetic attempts to try to maintain the Budget strategy are absurd and totally inappropriate to the needs of the economy at present. The fact is that the Budget strategy is in tatters. This Budget strategy was supposed to be one which would take the pressure off interest rates. Anyone who knows anything about what is happening in the Australian economy at present knows that interest rates are soaring and that, therefore, the basic objective of this Budget, which was to take the pressure off interest rates, has totally failed to be realised. Interest rates are soaring at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not seem to realise that the major reason for that increase in interest rates is that an enormous credit squeeze is occurring. The rate of growth of the money supply is running well below target. There has been a 7.7 per cent annualised rate of growth in the first six months of this year compared to a 10 per cent to 11 per cent target rate of growth. That is a low rate of growth of money supply. That inevitably means a shortage of credit which means that there is likely to be an increase in the price of money-that is, an increase in interest rates. This Government is maintaining a policy of keeping a very low rate of growth of money supply. One of the basic assumptions made in its Budget about the increase of money supply growth has not come to fruition. I will mention why later in another debate. This means that the Government is pursuing a Budget strategy which is helping to bring about a credit squeeze which is forcing up interest rates. In these circumstances it would be far better to have tax cuts which would take the pressure off interest rates by increasing the rate of growth of money supply, stimulating the economy and certainly helping us to recover from the deepening recession which is occurring at present. All of the economic indicators at present are pointing towards deepening recession. Employment growth has virtually ceased. We need a stimulus to the economy and tax cuts are the obvious way in which to do that. This would stimulate the economy directly through expenditures. Also, by increasing money supply growth, there would be less pressure on interest rates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very much welcome this matter of public importance because it provides an opportunity to say a few objective and unemotional things about the subject of taxation and to try to put into proper perspective the various calls that are occurring at present all across this country from a large number of quarters for taxation reductions to occur. I want to make one or two fundamental propositions to the House about the relevance and the desirability of personal income tax reductions at present. I assume that the matter of public importance presented by the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis) was, in fact, related to the question of personal taxation reductions . Of course, it is eminently popular to call for taxation reduction. One of the easiest, one of the most painless, political clarion calls that anybody can make is to call for personal income tax reductions. Such a call is normally popular. It is normally greeted with acclaim and with support. It is normally regarded as the most eminently reasonable and sensible thing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the House whether, on all tests, personal tax reductions-that is what we are talking about-at the present time would be desirable. I put it to the House that if we were to reduce taxation we would have to do it either with a commensurate reduction in expenditure or, alternatively, by expanding the size of the Budget deficit. I give the honourable member for Gellibrand credit, and I mean this very sincerely: He believes in expanding the deficit. He is a person who does not worry too much about the size of the deficit. In fact, he believes that big deficits are good economics at the present time. That would be a very interesting proposition to anybody who examined the present state of the economy of the United States of America. It would be an interesting proposition to most responsible economic opinion, which is to the effect that the greatest single cause of high interest rates in Australia at the present time is the impact of a huge domestic Budget deficit upon the level of the United States interest rates. I have no reluctance at all in putting it to the House, and in putting it to the House very sincerely on behalf of the Government, that, in the present budgetary and economic circumstances of Australia, it is not economically desirable on any score to have personal taxation reductions. I welcome this opportunity to say that and to say that without ambiguity and without equivocation on behalf of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make it clear to the House that, at the time when the last Budget was introduced, no promise of any kind, of any shape or form, was made by either the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or me that personal income tax reductions would occur during the current financial year. The honourable member for Gellibrand, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) and the Leader of the Australian Democrats in another place (Senator Chipp) know that it is completely misleading the Australian people to say that we made any such commitment and that we have in some way gone back on that commitment. What we said at that time , not only in the Budget Speech but also in countless speeches made around Australia after the Budget Speech was made, was that, faced with a choice between a personal tax cut of $500m or $600m at the time of the presentation of the Budget and aiming for a deficit of only $146m, we gave greater priority to the latter option because we believed that to reduce the Budget deficit was the best we could do to take pressure off interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> It is convenient for the honourable member for Gellibrand now to say that interest rate pressures have re-emerged. I put it to him and to the House that, if we had budgeted for a deficit of $1,000m in August last year, interest rates in Australia now would have been very much higher than they are. For the honourable member for Gellibrand to come into this House and suggest that a combination of a Budget deficit then of $1,000m and a $100 billion deficit that now faces the United States people and faces the entire Western economy would not have been disastrous for interest rates in Australia is to completely misunderstand cause and effect in economic matters. What we set out to do at the time of preparing the last Budget was to put a premium on reducing the call of this Government on borrowings throughout our community and thus to reduce the call and the pressure from this Government on the level of interest rates. We believe that was the correct strategy and if we had our time over again we would follow that strategy again. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good pretending that it makes economic or social sense to provide a tax cut today which is to be paid for tomorrow by higher inflation levels and higher interest rates. That is precisely the course of action that is being urged upon us by the honourable member for Gellibrand and, indeed, by others around Australia who make calls for personal income tax reductions without giving proper recognition to what is involved and without displaying a willingness to state how they believe those reductions should be funded; whether they should be funded by a larger deficit or by reductions in expenditure. In the last Budget we decided upon a modest broadening of the sales tax base. It is a very odd situation that legislation designed to broaden the sales tax base, which in fact would have reduced some of the regressive elements that are in the present indirect taxation mix in Australia-I repeat that the sales tax measures we proposed in the last Budget would have made indirect taxation in Australia less regressive-should have been voted against, both in this place and in another place, by the honourable member for Gellibrand and his party, which is supposed to be against regressive taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the narrow base of indirect taxation in Australia at the present time is the reason why all the surveys cited by the honourable member for Gellibrand and the Labor Party show indirect tax to be regressive. The more the base of indirect taxation is broadened provided food is excluded, the less regressive the tax becomes. The honourable member for Gellibrand and Senator Chipp of the Australian Democrats ought to recognise that what they are doing in voting against those sales tax measures is rejecting a reduction in the regressive nature of indirect taxation in Australia. They are rejecting not only a sensible change in the taxation mix in Australia but also a reduction in the regressive nature of indirect taxation in Australia. A broadening of the taxation base would bring about a significant reduction in the regressive elements that now exist in indirect taxation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time, levels of taxation were raised. Of couse, they are fundamental to this debate. I have never disputed the fact that as a straight percentage of gross domestic product, taxation collections now are higher than they were in 1975 and 1976. But I put it to the House and I put it to the Opposition in particular that in making a fair comparison between what governments take out of a community one has to extend one's examination beyond taxation collections and look at what governments borrow from a community which has to be paid back by future generations. I believe that an irresponsible reduction in taxation is only a fraud against future generations because all it does is to load future generations with the responsibility for repaying huge borrowings made by governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the reasons why we have interest rate pressures and one of the reasons why domestic capital markets all around the world have very high interest rate pressures are not only the volume of current borrowings that governments have to undertake but also the responsibility of rolling over past debts. When a government runs up a debt, not only has it to borrow the money in the year in which it incurs the debt but also has it to roll that debt over in future years. The Australian capital markets face the enormous problem of rolling over government and semi-government debt which has accumulated over many years. The idea that a deficit is a one-off, once-yearly event, here today and gone tomorrow, is a total misunderstanding, once again, of cause and effect in economic matters. I again put it to the House that those who believe that it is economically or socially responsible to provide for a tax cut today by loading future generations with enormous additional debt burdens, are, in my view, committing a significant fraud against those future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that, although as a percentage of gross domestic product total taxation collections this financial year will be higher than they were in 1975- 76, if the tax collections in 1975-76 and the domestic Budget deficit then as a proportion of gross domestic product were combined the total would be significantly higher than the total of those two factors will be for 1981-82. That means that this Government is making a lesser call on the resources not only of the present generation but also of future generations in following a fiscally responsible approach to the provision of taxation cuts. The fact is that on any reasonable international standard the overall level of taxation in Australia at present is about five or six percentage points below the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course I, as Treasurer in this Government, would love to be in a position to make a big fellow of myself and give a massive taxation cut tomorrow, as would the Prime Minister and every other member on this side of the House. It would be a very popular thing to do and it is very easy to buy that kind of popularity. The question that we have to ask ourselves is how would that be financed. The honourable member for Gellibrand does not have the responsibility of having to provide that answer but at least he has the courage to say that he would do it by going into greater deficit. At least we know where he stands. He is not only a bigger deficit man and a capital gains taxer but also a person who at least is prepared to come into this House and say how those taxation reductions would be financed. If the honourable member for Gellibrand had his way now we would finance taxation reductions by having a bigger Budget deficit. We on this side of the House do not believe that a bigger Budget deficit in the present state of the world economy and in the present state of the Australian economy would do anything other than drive interest rates even higher. For the honourable member for Gellibrand to suggest that it would bring interest rates down because, according to him, we have some kind of credit squeeze at this time is for him once again to misunderstand cause and effect so far as economic affairs are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing this Government has never been prepared to yield in the six years it has been in office is the belief that governments have to discharge some kind of responsibility and on occasions forsake popularity for responsibility so far as economic decision making is concerned. A taxation reduction in the last Budget would have been immensely more popular than the Budget we brought down. A taxation reduction now would be immensely more popular than the stand the Government is taking. But, in the long run, the Australian community would pay for that with a higher level of inflation and a still higher level of interest rates. In blocking in another place a very sensible broadening of the sales tax base the Opposition and the Australian Democrats have put back the cause of sensible reforms to the Australian taxation system. We rely too heavily in this country on personal income tax as a source of revenue. We need a greater reliance on indirect taxation. It is harder to evade and it is a more efficient method of collecting taxes. The Opposition and the Democrats, far from supporting the cause of taxation reform in Australia, have put back the clock of sensible taxation reform for a considerable time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One could be forgiven for believing that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was responding to a matter of public importance concerning the appropriateness or otherwise of a Budget deficit. If he wants to go into matters of that kind anyway, since he has aligned the economic policies that he and his Government are adopting with those that are being employed by the Thatcher Government in Britain, we could well draw parallels between the situation which is developing in Australia as a result of the deliberate adoption of those policies by this Government and the results that have stemmed from the Thatcher Government's policies in Britain. It is all very well for the Treasurer to refer to the possible effects of the proposed deficit in the United States but the matter we raised as a matter of public importance was the need for tax cuts to alleviate the increasing burden of taxation on low and middle income earners. It is all very well for the Treasurer to try to rationalise the position in which he and his Government find themselves at present but the fact remains that the atmosphere of high expectation of tax relief and tax cuts that has been built up throughout the nation has been deliberately encouraged and engendered by both the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer. Statements have been made by the Prime Minister in relation to taxation relief. He referred to this as early as 1975 and similar statements have continued to be made with increasing frequency and often with increasing emphasis. The Prime Minister, in his 1975 policy speech, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will reduce the tax burden. We will put an end to Labour's tax rip-off. </PARA>
<PARA> We will make a start towards this in next year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1976 the Treasurer, when he was Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax indexation is not only a social reform of immense importance but it is also designed to encourage consumer spending. It will also make governments more honest with the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> We know of the chequered career of tax indexation and that no tax indexation will apply next year. Apart from the appalling direction of the Australian economy at present, there is no single matter of greater national importance than the question of taxation and taxation equity. The burden of taxation is increasingly being placed on the shoulders of those people to whom specific reference is made in the matter of public importance-low and middle income earners. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a tax against the poor. In fact, there is increasing evidence that the burden is being directed, probably quite deliberately, increasingly towards the poor. I refer to the case of pensioners in Australia. I have made the point before that because of the application of this Government's policies age pensioners are in effect the highest marginally taxed people in Australia. If anyone refutes that, I refer to the following as an example: The pensioners who earn, say, the allowable income on top of their pension before the pension becomes affected-for a single pensioner, $20 a week and for a married pensioner, $34.50-are already within the income tax paying bracket. After the May increase ordinary pensioners on the base rate will be only $6.50 a week below the tax-free threshold anyway. Let us take as an example the single pensioners or the married pensioners who earn more than the allowable amount of income out of every extra $2 that those pensioners earn the Department of Social Security, in the first place, takes $1. So they are left with $1. From that dollar, because they are already in the tax-paying bracket, the Taxation Office takes another 32c. So, out of the $2 they earn, the Social Security Department and the Taxation Office take a total of $1.32, or 66c out of every dollar. A person with a taxable income of $200,000 pays a marginal tax of only 60c in the dollar.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is an obscene iniquity, to subject pensions in Australia to such a tax impost. At present over 250,000 pensioners are paying tax and we are fast approaching the position where all pensioners will be paying tax on their base pensions. The Treasurer has tried to suggest that this will not be until 1983-4. The evidence is that it will be sooner than that, possibly within 12 months. The Treasurer has admitted that people on average weekly earnings will be into the 46c in the dollar tax bracket by the end of this year, so all the income earners are moving up. Despite the claims that have been made by this Government and by its spokesmen about the Government being a low tax government, the indicators prove the contrary. For example, as a percentage of gross domestic product, total Budget receipts have grown from 25.1 per cent in 1975-76-the year of the last Labor Budget-to 27.5 per cent in 1981-82. So this Government stopped the great tax rip-off! As a percentage of GDP, total taxation revenue has grown from 23.2 per cent in 1975-76 to 25.5 per cent in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has the taxation burden increased under the Fraser Government and under this Treasurer but also the proportional burden that is being carried by pay-as-you-earn taxpayers-the wage and salary earners in Australia who constitute the vast majority of Australian taxpayers-has also increased. If we take their contribution as a percentage of total taxation revenue we can see that in the last year of the Labor Government they paid 41.7 per cent of total taxation. In this current financial year they are paying 45.7 per cent. If we take the amount that they pay out of total individual income tax we can see that in the last year of the Labor Government they were paying 76.1 per cent of total taxation. This year they are paying 82.7 per cent. The evidence of our concern and the concern of the Australian people, the Australian taxpayers and the low and middle income earners for whom we alone speak in this Parliament in connection with taxation matters, is irrefutable and undeniable. The inequity grows. It is growing because this Government was responsible for making claims and promises which have not been fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference has been made to the application of tax indexation as being the principal means by which taxation equity could be maintained and the growth of taxation could be restrained. I have already referred to the history of this matter ever since it started. Let us look at the contrast between these two statements: Firstly, in 1976 the present Treasurer-I have referred to this quotation before, but let me repeat it and contrast it with the most recent statement-said:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax indexation is not only a social reform of immense importance but it is also designed to encourage consumer spending. It will also make governments more honest with the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA>It became apparent to the Government-the Prime Minister admitted this-that tax indexation was not politically effective because the community did not understand the way it worked. It was important from the point of view of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer-despite all their rhetoric to the contrary-to introduce any forms of taxation relief and taxation reduction immediately before an election. What happened with the Treasurer's statement following the health insurance changes and debates? In April of last year the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> the government has now decided that discretionary adjustments to taxation scales and allowances are preferable to tax indexation. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that, despite all the claims made before about the value of indexation. Let me now refer to two contrasting statements made by Mr Fraser, the Prime Minister, in connection with this matter and the increasing burden involved. In the 1977 election campaign he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have ended the big tax rip off. From February 1 further tax cuts will come in for every Australian wage and salary earner . . . the Australian people will not accept a return to high taxes. The Government will bring taxes down further- not increase them. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1979 the evidence of the increasing tax burden became increasingly apparent. In response to that, during an interview when Mr Fraser was challenged on the extent to which taxation was increasing-</PARA>

It is the double standards of the Opposition that concerns me and the fact that members of the Opposition in their speeches in the Parliament do not want to deny money or pensions for our aged. They do not want to deny funds for the sick. They do not want to deny education for our youth. At the same time they say that if they came into government they would expand the Public Service. They talk about and support all those things that require money. Yet, on the other hand, somehow or other they think that they have the magic to reduce taxation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition. Let us look at some other statements that have been made. This statement was also made by the Leader of the Opposition, but in 1978-not too long ago. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sort of taxes I'm interested in seeing us introduce are things like capital gains tax, high marginal tax rate in the top . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition talks about capital gains tax. We can look at the capital gains and wealth taxes policy of a Labor government and a part of the Australian Labor Party platform. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> A Labor Government will:</PARA>
<PARA> Enhance the equity of the tax system by taxing large accumulations of personal capital . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Once again a capital gains tax or a wealth tax is mentioned. It is all through the policies of the Labor Party. Is it any wonder that the Leader of the Opposition is having trouble in Caucus at the moment just because he has brought forward a statement, as there happens to be a by-election in Lowe? Is it any wonder that the newspapers are reporting that there is a bit of dissatisfaction in the Labor Caucus? Because of the Lowe by-election he has said that there will not be any capital gains tax. But when one looks at all the past statements and at the Australian Labor Party's platform it is clear that if, by some means, the Labor Party came to power it would impose a capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the history of this Government and at some of the things that it has done to give relief in the personal income tax area. Our Government introduced the tax-free threshold. It was a Labor Government that made age pensions taxable. Look at your record and see what you did in the period 1972-75 . I repeat that our Government introduced a tax-free threshold below which age pensioners do not attract tax. We also modified the tax scale, reducing the scales to a three-tier system. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that should be pointed out-this shows that we care for the ordinary people and for families-is that this Government doubled the spouse allowance of $400, as it was in 1975, to $800 per annum. In fact, as recently as 12 months ago we increased that allowance by $203. This increase alone has meant that a family may earn $635 per annum more and not be taxed on that income. </PARA>
<PARA> I also direct attention to a situation which distorts the statistics. The Government introduced the practice of the family allowance being paid to wives directly. Previously it took the form of a tax deduction. This illustrates how sometimes statistics become distorted. That was a most generous move on the part of the Government. In fact, today the family allowance for two children is $36. 90 a month, for three children $58.60 a month and for four children $84.60 a month. I repeat that previously such payments were made through a deduction from taxable income and thus were excluded from income tax revenue figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, in the last Budget the Government proposed a rebate of 32c in the dollar for basic health cover. At page 230 of Budget Paper No. 1, the following statement is made:</PARA>
<PARA>Gross PAYE receipts-</PARA>
<PARA>That refers to personal income tax--</PARA>
<PARA>. . . are estimated to increase by 21.9 per cent in 1981-82 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, in this financial year. That is a regrettable situation. In the 1980-81 year receipts increased by 15.1 per cent and the year before by 16.2 per cent. Those figures are too high. I regret them, but let us compare them with some of the increases that occurred in the Labor years. In 1973-74 you increased personal income tax collections-PAYE tax-by 28.6 per cent. You had broken a record, but in the following year you did better than that. </PARA>

<PARA> That in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Adelaide Airport: Upgrading for International Services. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal is for the upgrading of facilities to enable the operation of direct international air services into and out of Adelaide Airport. This is not presently possible because of the absence of customs, immigration, health and other facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The work will consist of the following elements: A single storey terminal building including facilities for arriving and departing passengers; an apron to accommodate two Boeing 747 aircraft adjacent to the new terminal; a taxiway to connect the new apron to the existing taxiway system; widening of some taxiway fillets to allow regular use by Boeing 747 or other wide-body international jet aircraft; and engineering services, access roads, car parking areas, and improvements to the Airport electrical reticulation system. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $10.9m at January 1982 prices. I table plans of the proposed work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few points on the reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works of the construction of an international terminal in Adelaide. I believe that, in considering the upgrading of Adelaide Airport for international services, a public hearing should take place in Adelaide and that it should be held in the districts surrounding the Adelaide Airport. Such a hearing should be well publicised so that the residents living close to the Airport can have time to prepare submissions and also attend the hearing. There is deep community concern on the question of safety, noise- including the the breaking of the curfew-and pollution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the recent public works hearing in Adelaide on the proposed airport extensions for wide-bodied jets-the hearing took place on 3 December-attendance was overflowing. I will make mention of the type of concern that the public there have. A report in the Adelaide Advertiser on 4 December, the day immediately following that hearing, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> People living near Adelaide Airport whipped up their own noise problem yesterday at a Federal parliamentary committee hearing called to consider the airport upgrading, wide-bodied jets and . . . noise. </PARA>
<PARA> The meeting, which spilled out of the West Torrens Council chambers into adjacent hallways, erupted at times with heckling and heated exchanges between the committee members and irate residents. </PARA>
<PARA> At one stage the chairman, W.A. Liberal MHR, Mr Bungey, threatened to close the hearing to the public, to a chorus of shouts and jeers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member opposite says: 'Hear, hear!' If honourable members opposite would like to attend the next hearing in Adelaide, I will certainly make sure that they get an invite and that the residents who attend know who they are. I hope they would also invite their State colleague, the member for Hanson, whose State electorate touches on the boundary of Adelaide airport. I hope he will attend. He was conspicuous by his absence at the previous hearing. He is prepared to make statements to the media regarding his concern for the extensions to the airport but he was not prepared to put his money where his mouth was and attend that public hearing. He will have to answer for that in the next State election; I can assure honourable members opposite of that. The Western Regions Councils Organisation representing the councils around the airport made a submission to the public hearing. Likewise the principal of the Thebarton primary school made a submission as did Thebarton Corporation councillors and a Thebarton doctor. The State member for Peake also made a submission. I did likewise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier I spoke to the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr McVeigh) and advised him that I wanted to speak in the debate on this matter. I sought the opportunity to have some material incorporated in Hansard. I am sorry that the Minister for Housing and Construction is not here. I seek the indulgence of the Minister for Trasnsport (Mr Hunt) in that respect, particularly in reference to a letter from a Mr Keith Bull, principal of the Thebarton primary school, in his submissions to the Standing Committee on Public Works in relation to wide-bodied jets. This submission was on behalf of the children, teachers and the school council. Since the submission also deals with the aspect of the international flights I seek leave of the House to have this letter incorporated in Hansard. I apologise to the Minister but say that the letter has already been before the Committee. It was read under oath in the normal way. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>December 3, 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Submission to: Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works</PARA>
<PARA>By: Keith C. Bull, Principal, Thebarton Primary School, Rose Street, Mile End, S .A. on behalf of the Children, Teachers and School Council. </PARA>
<PARA> I make my submission concerning the introduction of wide-bodied jets and the possible development of West Beach Airport as an international airport on two grounds, namely, noise and safety. </PARA>
<PARA> The school is in the direct flight path of planes using West Beach Airport. I understand that commercial jet aeroplanes pass over the school on landing at a little under 200 metres high. Approximately five planes per hour on average, pass over the school between 9 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. which is the lesson time of the school. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit that the learning programme is already adversely affected to a significant degree by the continual interruptions created by the jet planes. A teacher speaking to a class of children, a child speaking to a teacher, or another child, has to stop speaking when a jet flies over. It is physically impossible to be heard unless one yells. In 1976 the then Department of Civil Aviation took decibel readings outside the school when jets were flying over on their approach for landing. The officer taking the readings told me that they registered between 105 and 110 decibels. </PARA>
<PARA> Every aspect of school life is affected by the jet planes. When we hold an assembly, we use a public address system which has a ten point setting. This setting is placed on eight so that the children who are up to thirty metres from the amplifiers, may hear over the combined traffic noise of Henley Beach and South Roads. I have been told by people who live on the windward side of the school, that the amplification can be heard over one-and-a-half kilometres away. However, when a jet plane flies over the school, all speaking has to stop as the person on the microphone cannot be heard. On occasions, when planes have to circle before landing, the whole assembly is rendered to no avail. Meetings of parents in the school held at any time, are affected in the same way as are telephone calls and all interviews with senior staff and teachers. Lessons held in the school yard are affected in the same way, with even longer pauses being made necessary before the teacher or a child may continue speaking. </PARA>
<PARA> How low the planes are may be judged by the fact that on a sunny day, the shadow of a plane going into land, completely covers my office. When a particular set of circumstances coincides, which I do not completely understand, but which I believe has to do with height and angle of turn of the plane and wind velocity, then the windows of the school vibrate. The whole noise situation is intensified when planes are taking off rather than landing.</PARA>
<PARA> All of the above places the children of Thebarton Primary School under a severe disadvantage in relation to their learning. When I am told that even more jets and of a possibly noisier kind, are to use the Airport and that the development of the Airport is to be accelerated, then my concern for the children in my charge is heightened to a very considerable degree. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that society as led by Government, must very carefully consider what is done in the name of progress, but which may also be seen as being done in the name of greed, compared with what is being done to one of this nation's greatest and indeed priceless assets, namely, its children. </PARA>
<PARA> This need for care of our children is accentuated when one considers the safety aspects of what is proposed. I understand that recommendations for international airports used by such planes as wide-bodied jets include a three kilometre cleared space on the approach, with a further two kilometres of low density use of the land. Thebarton Primary School is within three kilometres of the runway at the Airport. Australia's air safety record, I acknowledge, is excellent. However I understand that West Beach Airport's passenger traffic has doubled in the last decade, and is likely to double again in the next. Presumably, the likelihood of accident is increasing at the same rate. Do we need a jet plane with a full load of passengers on top of a school full of children, before we have the courage to admit that Adelaide's Airport is in the wrong place at its present stage of development, let alone any further development through additional planes or increase in status to international?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already got one; I want it moved. The Tonkin Government has been sitting on a promise that the State and Federal officers standing committee on airports would bring down a decision on the location of the new international airport. That promise was given some eight months ago, so time is running out. Let us hear from the State Liberal Government where it intends to put the airport. It would be fine if it put the airport in the electorate of Boothby. I am sure the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) would like that! I could suggest that it be located in the electorate of Kingston but, since that seat is about to change hands, I would not want to impose such a problem on one of my future Labor colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thebarton Primary School is one of seven schools under the flight paths around Adelaide Airport. Jet planes coming into Adelaide Airport pass over that school at less than 200 metres. On average five planes per hour pass over the school during the hours of 9 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. During 1976 the then Department of Civil Aviation took decibel readings outside the school when jets were on their landing approach. Those readings were as high as 105 and 110 decibels. Children and teachers are expected to cope with this sort of thing. I remind honourable members that on average five planes per hour pass over the school. Almost every aspect of school life is being affected by the jets. Mr Bull, in his submission to the Public Works Committee, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that society as led by Government, must very carefully consider what is done in the name of progress, but which may also be seen as being done in the name of greed, compared with what is being done to one of this nation's greatest and indeed priceless assets, namely, its children. </PARA>
<PARA>This school is not being subjected just to noise. Some months ago I raised in this House another problem at this school. In addition to noise and pollution from planes, it is subjected to the highest recorded lead levels in Australia. Of course, no Liberal Government has ever shown any concern for the people who happen to live in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of international flights through the Adelaide Airport would result in greater hardships to those kids and their teachers and to the residents. More important, perhaps, is the question of safety which was raised in the submissions by the headmaster, the residents and myself. I want to mention in this House the problems faced by the district. First of all I want to outline briefly to the House the points that I put to previous hearings of the Public Works Committee. They were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That the Federal and State Governments declare the site for a new airport with international facilities outside the inner metropolitan area of Adelaide; that a definite commitment is entered into to develop such airport; and that a commencement date be announced. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That provision be made for the noise-proofing of residential homes, hospitals and schools within a certain perimeter-similar to the legislation covering Heathrow Airport in London. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) That there be no lifting of the curfew; and that an assurance regarding this be given immediately by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) That only such work as is necessary to maintain proper safety standards should be undertaken until items (1), (2) and (3) are agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of safety has been of very great concern to the residents. On 11 November last authorities under the Department of Transport conducted a mock exercise and it was just that. I contacted the people in charge and asked for details of that exercise, which was called 'Splashdown'. The exercise involved a simulated crash of a Boeing aircraft off the coast and a number of injured passengers being found lying on a wing in the water. Various authorities, such as the fire brigade and the ambulance service, were involved in the exercise. The director of Adelaide Airport was kind enough to give me the debriefing notes . I could not believe my eyes when I read the notes. It was like a script from Dads Army. There was a series of foul-ups in the controlled exercise on 11 November and if they were repeated in a real accident they would spell disaster. The exercise simulated the crash of a Boeing 727 aircraft in the sea two nautical miles off Semaphore with 80 passengers on board. Survivors were picked up before the exercise got under way by vessels which officially were not there. Most of the command problems occurred before the exercise began. Rescue boats could not find the boat ramp. Some survivors got lost. Seriously injured survivors were left behind while others were sent to hospital. Radio communications were so badly affected that urgent messages were delayed. The medical team from Queen Elizabeth Hospital was 40 minutes late because of wrong advice. The Department of Transport command post vehicle could not find the command post and the radio receiver in the vehicle was unusable during the entire exercise. Had the exercise been staged nearer South Glenelg, a more likely spot for such an accident, rescue boats would have been required to be transported to Outer Harbour, some miles away, for launching. This litany of mistakes and foul-ups in a controlled exercise clearly illustrates the magnitude of the disaster we could expect in the event of a real jet aircraft crash in a residential area surrounding Adelaide Airport. To imagine that it just cannot happen is nonsense. The recent crash in Washington of a Boeing 737 into the Potomac River with 81 dead could turn out to be a relatively small disaster against what we would see in Adelaide in the event of a jet aircraft ploughing into the suburbs of Thebarton and Cowandilla. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been 13 reported incidents of near-misses at Adelaide Airport between 1979-September 1981, the latest being on 22 September. I think there is plenty of evidence to justify the proposition I have put to the Public Works Committee and to the House that the international airport proposal should be delayed until the Federal and State governments declare where the new airport will be located. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chairman of the Public Works Committee I wish to comment very briefly on several aspects that were raised by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott). Firstly, the Committee will be holding public hearings in Adelaide. The exact site for the hearings is yet to be determined but they will be held in Adelaide and every effort will be made during those hearings to allow all interested people and organisations to put their views to the Committee. Indeed, in the most recent inquiry in relation to Adelaide Airport, the inquiry into wide-bodied jet facilities, special arrangements were made to allow letters and views of residents and so on to be fully accepted and studied by the Committee. We will be doing the same in this further inquiry. I can point out that we made special efforts to ensure that two of the main organisations which were interested in the airport development were given special opportunities to present their cases and to attend additional hearings of the Committee. If necessary this will be done again. It was unfortunate, I think, that there were interjections at the previous hearing. To a large extent these were due, I have since found out, to a misrepresentation or a misreport in one of the local papers which gave the public the idea that they could come along and put their views to the Committee without prior notice and understandably some people having that in mind were unhappy when they were not able to do so. Every effort will be made to take into account the views of all people and all organisations who wish to give them. Certainly the hearings, as always, will be adequately advertised.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the House for more than a couple of moments. One of the things that are always in evidence in this type of debate is how people are prepared to ridicule anyone representing an area with an airport by drawing attention to the penalties which are paid by those people who live near airports. It is always fashionable for those people who usually represent the air travellers, not the people who have to put up with the consequences, to ridicule anyone who suggests that airports ought to be subject to at least some reasonable rules which comply with decent living standards. The Adelaide Airport is one of a number in Australia which are in considerable trouble. Honourable members opposite if they were to visit California and see the Los Angeles situation would find that extraordinary lengths have had to be gone to in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I briefly want to raise one point. It seems that in this House we regularly have massive Budget alterations for international air travel. We seem to be extending international air travel beyond reasonable levels on a State by State competitive basis. I do not know what the economic justifications for that are. They may be good, they may not be good. I briefly want to raise a matter which does not involve anywhere near the level of expenditure involved in this work at the Adelaide Airport and it is a question which has been before the Department of Transport for a long time. I refer to the Geelong regional airport which to my knowledge has not been funded. I understand that funding has now been refused . I understand the State Government says that it is the Federal Government's fault and the Federal Government says that the State has refused to contribute. I would be very obliged if at some stage the Minsiter for Transport (Mr Hunt), who gave me undertakings before the last election that decisions were being made but that the Department of Finance was holding them up, could indicate whether in fact the Commonwealth has agreed to provide funds and if so on what terms and who is withholding progress. It is difficult in local communities, especially those that are starting development late. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I raise with the Minister relates to Qantas Airways Ltd moving out of the Avalon airfield. I would like to know whether some arrangements can be made for private charter use of that airfield on special occasions. It would seem to be an awful waste of time to try to build up another edifice when there is already a perfectly good airport available, on which the Commonwealth spent a considerable sum of money some years ago to provide for increased traffic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I firstly want to refer to the comments of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) lest there should be any mistake. Honourable members on this side of the House are not against any reasonable conditions being applied to the operations of the Adelaide Airport but they do see a need for major upgrading of both the domestic facilities at the airport and for South Australia to have access to international tourism. At the moment South Australia is missing out on the great potential expenditure that international tourists bring to this country. This major upgrading of the Adelaide Airport will mean a great deal for South Australia. The expenditure of in excess of $10m on capital works will itself create employment both in works and in the provision of the materials for those works. In the longer term this project will mean tourists will be able to come direct to Adelaide. The South Australian Government, together with the Federal Government, has done a great deal to promote South Australia for the benefit of South Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members on this side of the House have been forthright in promoting South Australia's views and promoting South Australia's recommendations for Commonwealth expenditure on capital projects in that State. This work is one of those projects we have been pushing. South Australia needs the airport to be upgraded. We need the tourists. The South Australian Government has done its bit ; it has encouraged the tourist industry and indeed will soon be opening a new international hotel in South Australia. There is no reason why South Australia should not be the launching point for tourists going to places like Ayers Rock and other places nearer Adelaide such as the Barossa Valley and areas within my own electorate such as the Coonawarra wine areas and indeed Southern Vales. I see no reason why South Australia should miss out on international tourist trade . Many people overseas want to come to South Australia to visit their relatives and friends and I see no reason why they should be at a disadvantage when compared with every other State which has international airport facilities. I therefore support the reference of this proposed work to the Public Works Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly wish to support this project and say that I am pleased that the work the South Australian Premier has done in conjunction with the Federal Government has been able to resolve this problem of international access to Adelaide and will in effect be an avenue, as the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) said, for direct entry into many of the tourist attractions of southern and the centre of Australia. I want to express my disappointment, however, that the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) has seen fit to take what seems to be a negative attitude to what is such a vital work in my State. He is noted for taking an ambivalent attitude to major projects which affect the welfare of his own constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We know very well, as he interjects now, of his attitude to that yellowcake episode at the Australian Mineral Development Laboratories within his district. That is not something to develop in a debate on this reference but it is an indicator of the quality or should I say the lack of quality of his approach to these major works. In respect of the Adelaide Airport it is interesting to know that for the sake of his own constituents he is willing to wish this work on anyone else's constituents in South Australia. May I say that this attitude is no way in which to approach the problem of our State which requires a boost at this time. Such a boost is necessary because of the depredations of previous State Labor governments. I bring that point to mind to remind the honourable member for Hindmarsh that there was a conjunction of State and Federal Labor governments for three full years in the middle 1970s. They did nothing to meet the type of problem that the honourable member for Hindmarsh now puts before the House in relation to noise, safety requirements and other factors surrounding the Adelaide Airport's position. The honourable member for Barker says we on this side of the House and those of us who support the proposal are in no way deaf or blind to the problems of residents who live in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The member of the State Parliament whom the honourable member for Hindmarsh refers to has been most assiduous in giving attention to this problem over the years before the honourable member for Hindmarsh thought of leaving his cosy union job to come into the House of Representatives. The facts of life are that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is willing now-in a position, of course, which has no authority-to take in opposition a view that he will hold up the development of South Australia for years to come on the basis that we get an international airport somewhere outside of the city. I ask him: How many people in South Australia outside the direct environs of the airport will agree with him that the State should forgo this facility because of his parochial local view? He knows that very few people indeed would want Adelaide-and South Australia-to remain the only mainland capital without international airport facilities. I commend this proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to defend very briefly my colleague the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott) in the attack that has just been made on him by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall). The honourable member for Hindmarsh has put forward a sensible and responsible position. He has merely asked that the Public Works Committee, when it considers this proposition , take seriously the views of his electors around Adelaide Airport on questions related to the environmental impact that any further development of that airport will undoubtedly have. This is a problem with every airport. An extremely selfish attitude prevails in the ranks of many honourable members, particularly Government members, when it comes to considering what happens to persons who live around airports when they are not in their electorates. This is why it is extremely important that when the Public Works Committee comes to consider the proposals for expansion at airports it considers very seriously the attitudes expressed by members like the honourable member for Hindmarsh.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fact that this Government has had before it since 1979 recommendations from the Law Reform Commission to implement British legislation on injurious affection; not any new legislation, but legislation which was implemented in Great Britain and in a number of other countries that would provide compensation for people living near airports. If that sort of compensation were provided we probably would hear a little less from the honourable member for Hindmarsh and a little less from me and other honourable members who represent constituencies with airports in the middle of them because we could be confident that our constituents were going to have their interests met when those airports were developed. As I understand it from the remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh in connection with this motion, he is not proposing that absolutely no development should take place in the same way that I have not proposed that absolutely no development should take place at Perth Airport. What I have wanted and what he wants for his airport is that government departments, government officials, and members of the Liberal Party take seriously the needs and problems of people living around airports. That is all that is being asked for here. He was not proposing to make a statement on the effectiveness or otherwise -mainly otherwise-of the South Australian Government in its development projects . In this House we ought to take seriously the problems of those of us who do have Commonwealth installations in our electorates which have an environmental impact. It is very important that community consensus is geared to accept airport developments which are necessary. We will not get that community consensus when we get clown-like speeches such as that we have heard from a couple of the South Australian Liberal members today in their attacks on the honourable member for Hindmarsh. </PARA>

We now know from the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) that the Committee that has been set up has recommended the Two Wells area. This would be in line with modern day thinking on aerodromes. When we talk about aerodromes we have to look at what happened in Brisbane and the improvements at the Brisbane aerodrome. Everyone has been confused for years on where the second aerodrome in Sydney will be. We now have the opportunity to choose. This was the main point of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. Before we commit ourselves to paying over $10m on the existing Adelaide Airport we should make up our minds as to where the new airport will be and consequently concentrate our efforts on that new airport.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 1 to 5 (1982) and Excise Tariff Proposals No. 1 ( 1982). </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff changes made by Gazette notice during the last recess. The changes contained in Proposals No. 5 are new and arise from the Government's decisions in relation to the Industries Assistance Commission's reports on polyunsaturated margarine, surge diverters, vibratory road rollers-developing countries preference-and cutlery, industrial knives and hand tools-in respect of razor blades only. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 1, which operate from 2 December 1981, contain changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the IAC in its report on primary batteries. The Government decided to provide long term tariff assistance higher than the level recommended by the IAC. This results in a rate of 30 per cent reducing to 25 per cent after three years, rather than the immediate reduction to 20 per cent as recommended by the IAC. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures were decided upon in recognition of the defence significance of battery manufacture and the need to provide a suitable competitive environment under which structural change and new investment can occur with minimal employment consequences. These Proposals also contain tariff changes arising from an administrative decision to transfer rates of duty for zinc chromates from tariff item 32.07 to 28.47 and following a classification change by the Customs Co-operation Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 2, which operate from 1 January 1982, contain changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the IAC in its report on textiles, clothing and footwear. These supersede Proposals No. 8 (1981) introduced into this House on 18 August 1981. These later proposals are necessary to make provision for the additional duty rates that have since been promulgated under the tender quota scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 3, which operate from 12 January 1982, implement the Government's decision on recommendations made by the IAC in its report on certain bags, cases and similar containers. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendations in this report. The effect of this decision is to maintain current long term rates of duty but to eliminate the Canadian margins of preference applicable to certain disposable shopping bags falling within 42.02. These shopping bags will continue to be dutiable at rates ranging from 15 per cent to 30 per cent, similar to those applying to plastic bags of 39.07, thus avoiding any possible consumption or production distortions which might otherwise occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 4, which operate from 22 January 1982, implement the tariff changes arising from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the IAC in its report on fabricated steel structures. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendation that steel structures falling within 73.21 be dutiable at a long term rate of 15 per cent. This rate represents a reduction in duty for all goods under reference other than small bore welded pipes and tubes and seamless pipes and tubes, which were previously dutiable at 7.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The IAC recommended that duty reductions be phased in over two years. The Government has accepted that recommendation except in regard to large bore welded pipes and tubes. The duties applicable to these pipes and tubes will be phased in over five years in line with similar goods covered by the Government's decision on the iron and steel industry announced in April 1981. The IAC concluded that its recommendations would not have any adverse economic, social or employment consequences and that improved industry structure, more efficient resource utilisation and some reductions in prices should result. These proposals also contain administrative amendments in relation to: The definition of handicrafts to ensure that goods made of batiked fabrics include only those made up by hand; and item 43 of Schedule 2 which has been amended to restore concessional admission to coated fabrics of 39.01, 39.02 or 39.03. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals No. 5 introduce tariff changes arising from the Government's decisions on recommendations by the IAC in its reports on polyunsaturated margarine, surge diverters, vibratory road rollers, developing countries preference, and cutlery, industrial knives and hand tools, in respect of razor blades only. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendations on these goods. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of polyunsaturated margarine, duties will be reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent as recommended by the IAC and supported by the industry. A 10 per cent duty will also bring assistance on polyunsaturated margarine into line with that on other margarine products. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of surge diverters suitable for the protection of electricity supply equipment. the duty rate will be 15 per cent. This rate represents an increase from 2 per cent to 15 per cent on such goods having a rating exceeding 5kA. The IAC found that the difference in duty between large and small surge diverters had eroded the local industry's protection. The effective rate of assistance accorded by a tariff rate of 15 per cent is assessed to be slightly below the average for manufacturing industry. In respect of vibratory road rollers and parts therefor the developing countries margin of preference accorded Brazil will be reduced to 10 per cent. The IAC considered that modification rather than withdrawal of the developing countries margin of preference will be sufficient to remove injury to local producers. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of razor blades, import licensing on double edged safety razor blades will be discontinued and the rate of duty will be 10 per cent. Implementation of the decision at this stage has been undertaken due to the imminent termination of import licensing. The IAC advised the Government that the local industry's share of the domestic market could be eroded if duties or other restrictions did not apply. The Government accepted this advice. The changes contained in Proposals No. 5 operate on and from tomorrow. A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of all changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Excise Tariff Proposals No. 1 (1982) which I have just tabled formally place before Parliament alterations to the excise tariff. The alterations were introduced during the summer recess by Gazette Notice No. 2 (1981) under the authority of Section 160B of the Excise Act. Proposals No. 1 (1982) increases the excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil from $177.53 to $186.26 a kilolitre operating on and from 1 January 1982. This alteration followed determination of new import parity prices by the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick). The determination accords with Government policy on import parity pricing for Australian produced crude oil. In addition Proposals No. 1 (1982) decreases the excise duty on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas from $37.07 to $20.46 a kilolitre operating on and from 1 January 1982. This change followed a new average wholesale price for naturally occurring LPG being set by the Minister for National Development and Energy in accordance with Government policy. I commend the Proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills now before the House, the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos. 1A to 9A) 1981 (No. 2), are the same Bills as those which came before us twice last year, once when originally introduced and once as the subject of requests from the Senate. In August, as part of the package of the sales tax amendments involving increasing the sales tax on currently taxed items and other measures, the Government brought in a sales tax package of which the legislation now before us is a part. The parts were: First, to increase sales tax on currently taxed items by raising by 2.5 per cent the tax rates at each of the three levels then applying; secondly, by increasing the sales tax on a substantial number of items and reducing it on a few items under the guise of eliminating anomalies and inconsistencies; and, thirdly, extending sales tax at the rate of 2.5 per cent to a whole range of previously untaxed items. With the support of the Australian Democrats in the Senate and against the opposition of the Australian Labor Party, the first two parts of the package have been passed into law. But the third part has been blocked in the Senate through the Democrats supporting in most respects Labor's opposition to those measures. I remind the House that the Bills involve a tax of 2.5 per cent being applied to clothing, footwear, drapery, soft furnishings, man- chester, building materials, books, magazines, newspapers, packaging and wrapping materials and tools, in effect, seeking to extend sales tax to all goods not currently subject to tax, except food, medicine and wine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The attitude of the Opposition to these Bills is as it was previously. We maintain our view that the extension of sales taxes to such items is highly undesirable and we continue our implacable opposition to them. In this regard we welcome the fact that the Democrats have now found the courage of their convictions and, after months of procrastination and hand wringing, finally have decided to reverse their previous position of opposing the legislation until the last moment and then voting for it. Provided they are able to stick by the latest decision-on their history one could not be completely confident about that-these Bills will be rejected by the Senate and so become one of the bases for a double dissolution. I say on behalf of the Opposition that the Opposition would certainly welcome that. We are not at all fazed by the prospect of fighting an election on policies such as this. There is considerable opposition to these Bills in the electorate, as any honourable member who is in touch with his electorate will know. There has been a large number of petitions on this issue-I presented one yesterday containing about 12,000 signatures-and various other indications of widespread concern at this extension of the sales tax net to the items which I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition shares that concern for what it considers to be very good reasons. All these reasons have been covered in previous debate on these Bills, but I will briefly indicate again what they are. Firstly, we believe that this represents a repudiation of the pledge of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on behalf of the Government in March last year not to broaden the indirect tax base. After conducting between the time of the last election in October 1980 and March 1981 a review of the possibility of extending indirect taxation, the Treasurer came into the House on 12 March 1981 and said that the Government had decided not to extend indirect taxation because it would be inflationary. Five months later, with inflation at no lower level and the prospects for higher inflation looking worse, he announced in the Budget that the Government would, after all, seek to increase indirect taxes, but not by as much as it had previously considered. He said that, rather than the $3,000m extension of indirect taxation that the Government had been considering, the Government would now seek to increase indirect taxation by only a further $892m-for which we were supposed to be grateful. Nevertheless there was still a complete about face, in our view. The fact that the amount was less than the Government had previously been considering made it no less unwarranted than it had concluded it would be in March of last year. In our view there was a clear repudiation of the pledge to the electorate in regard to the non-broadening of the indirect taxation net. We therefore charge the Government with the repudiation of that pledge. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, an increase in indirect taxation is inflationary-the Treasurer admitted that in his 12 March statement-and therefore highly undesirable. The fact that the Treasurer announced in the House on 12 March 1981 that the major reason for not extending indirect taxation was that it was inflationary seems to us to be a good reason to view askance the measures which are now before the House, for the very same reason that they are inflationary. Certainly the measures are not inflationary to the same extent as a $3,000m increase in indirect taxation would have been but still, nevertheless, they are notably inflationary. The Treasurer, in his 12 March statement, said that a $500m rise in indirect taxation would add one per cent to the consumer price index. On that basis the rise in sales tax he sought in the last Budget, $892m, would increase the consumer price index by a little under 2 per cent-in fact, 1.8 per cent. That is based on his own figures. Such an increase is no minor affair. Maybe this Government, which says it is concerned to fight inflation first, really does not care about 2 per cent increases in the inflation rate. That seems to be a conflict in the Government's position, but apparently it is its view that a 2 per cent rise is all right. We view it rather differently. We see it as of considerable concern that the inflation rate would be boosted by some 2 per cent by these sales tax measures. The increases in sales tax contained in the last Budget and already imposed-they were passed by the Senate-in conjunction with the health insurance rearrangements have added 1.7 per cent to the December quarter consumer price index and we have now moved back into double digit inflation. We have a much greater expectation within the community of a higher level of inflation. Therefore, there is likely to be an exacerbation of inflationary expectations and activity and the continuance of inflation at higher levels is almost guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems absurd in the extreme for governments which say it is essential to fight inflation first then to undertake action which is patently inflationary. Health insurance rearrangements in the last Budget added 1.3 per cent to the consumer price index and the sales tax measures, if passed in full as this Government would like, would add another 1.8 per cent to the consumer price index. It would be incredibly absurd for the Government to add 3 per cent to the CPI when it says it is essential to fight inflation first. The whole rationale of this Government's economic policy is supposedly the need to do precisely that . It is just another indication, of which we have had so many in the course of this Government's period in office, that one of the major methods by which it seeks to fight inflation is by increasing prices. One has only to state it in that way to see what absurd policy it is. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason we oppose these measures is that increased sales taxes also represent an extension of regressive taxation, about which the Treasurer had something to say earlier today. I will come to his remarks in a moment. We mean by regressive taxation that taxes fall more heavily on lower income earners than higher income earners, and so the tax burden is shifted more on to those who are least able to pay. I have demonstrated quite clearly in previous debates on these Bills, by reference to work by Mr Neil Warren of the University of New South Wales, that indirect taxation does have this regressive effect. Mr Warren looked at the effects of various taxes on taxpayers in differing income brackets in 1975-76 and demonstrated clearly that indirect taxes bore most heavily on lower income earners by taking a higher percentage of their incomes. A move to more reliance on indirect taxation is therefore a move to a more inequitable tax system and one which we therefore strongly oppose. All that the Government has had to say in regard to this until today is that pensioners and other social security beneficiaries would be fully protected from such taxes by automatic adjustment of their incomes in accordance with movements in the CPI; that is, insofar as the taxes show up in the CPI, there will be an adjustment under the six-monthly policy of pension adjustments in line with movements in the CPI and so pensioners and other social security beneficiaries will be fully protected. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that there is some truth in this but it is by no means clear that pensioners will be fully protected by such pension adjustments because their expenditure is much more likely to be on essentials than that of wage and salary earners generally and may therefore be more affected by these tax increases than would the consumer price index, which is weighted on the consumption pattern of wage and salary households generally. In any case, many pensioners and other beneficiaries receive income apart from their pensions which is unlikely to be adjusted to take account of the increased tax, so it will obviously have some effect on them. More importantly still, the fact that the lower income earners may be partially protected from the tax does not reduce its regressive impact on the rest of the taxpayers. It will still bear much more heavily on lower income households of the non-pension variety than on higher income households and so it is still regressive and therefore to be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate on the matter of public importance raised earlier today the Treasurer claimed that the extension of the indirect tax base, as is proposed in these Bills, will make indirect taxation as a whole less regressive. That was an interesting line and I wish he had filled it out a bit more. Perhaps he will do so in his reply to this debate. I assume he was saying that, in regard to the current items which are subject to indirect taxation, if we were to extend the indirect tax base to other items and therefore reduce the amount of tax on the current items, we would have a less regressive indirect taxation system. I am not sure about that but I concede that it might well be the case. It assumes that there is to be some shift of the burden from the current indirect tax items to those which are now being taxed. There is no such move. This is a measure in which the Treasurer is increasing taxes on those items which are already subject to sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course over the last few years there have been mammoth increases in things like the crude oil levy. He is not suggesting that there should be any cut in those taxes. He is not cutting other sales taxes. He is not reducing excise on anything else or on the crude oil levy. He is extending the indirect tax base to these other items, imposing a tax on them and saying: 'Whacko, this is making the indirect tax system less regressive'. I just do not see how that is so, unless he is going to make compensating reductions in those other items, which he has patently not done in this Budget. Presumably he has no intention of doing that because he is all in favour of extending the indirect tax base and the proportion of total tax revenue which is raised by indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> So we cannot accept the Treasurer's view that what he has done is introduce some marvellous means of increasing progessivity in the tax system. I do not see it that way at all. I believe that what he has done is simply to increase indirect taxation. Extending the tax base is one of the ways in which he has done that. That is a more regressive form of raising tax revenue than are progressive taxes, such as personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth reason we oppose these measures is that they will adversely affect the living standards of Australian families. We previously calculated that the sales tax package of increases as introduced in the Budget would cost the average family about $4 a week. That calculation was arrived at by dividing the total revenue expected to be raised by these measures-the $892m-by the population of the country, allowing for the fact that some of the increases would not be passed on to Australian consumers. On the same basis the measures now before the House will cost the average household about $1.50 a week. This may seem a trifling sum to a well-paid Treasurer but on top of all the imposts on living standards arising from increased income tax, increased interest rates and the sales tax increases that have already occurred, this further impost on family living standards is of real importance. </PARA>
<PARA> People are concerned about it. They are concerned about another $1.50 a week that they will have to pay out in taxes in one form or another. This is made more important by the Government's refusal to abide by the undertaking it has given on many occasions, that is, that if the Government were to increase indirect taxation it would make compensating reductions to personal income tax. Where are they? The Treasurer has said today as emphatically as he possibly could that no personal income tax reductions were coming in the near future. So we have the increase in indirect taxes and there is no suggestion of any compensating personal income tax cuts. The Treasurer has ruled that out absolutely and completely. We have a situation in which family living standards will be affected-if these measures are passed by the Senate-by this increase in sales tax which is now before us. This increase would not be offset in any way by reduced personal income taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the main reasons we have given for opposing these tax increases. Of course, there have been other reasons, related in part to the inherent undesirability of taxing particular items in the group which are to be taxed, such as books. The tax on books has been described as a tax on knowledge. Rather than pursue those individual items now I wish to review the principal arguments used by the Government for wanting these sales tax increases. The first one is that a shift to more reliance on indirect taxation is desirable because Australia places greater reliance on personal income tax than do other comparable countries. This is something on which the Treasurer has placed considerable reliance. This argument seems to me to ignore the fact that although Australia does raise a higher percentage of its tax from personal income tax than is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average-I certainly acknowledge that-it also raises a higher proportion of tax from indirect taxes than is the OECD average. The Treasurer is making certain signs and I understand what he is saying. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that a comparison of our indirect taxes with the OECD average shows that not only do we have a higher proportion of our total tax revenue coming from personal income tax but also we have a higher proportion than the OECD average coming from indirect taxation. I think the Treasurer is being naive in the extreme in saying: 'Look, because we have a higher proportion of our total tax revenue coming from personal income tax we have to have increased indirect taxation'. The fact is that it is already above the average of comparable countries. If we look at the figures which come from the latest OECD revenue statistics we find that the OECD average of personal income tax is 32.56 per cent as against the Australian average of 44.32 per cent. If we add social security contributions by employees the OECD average moves up to 39.89 per cent of revenue coming from personal income tax and employees' social security contributions, which is still below Australia's figure of 44.32 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at indirect taxes. The OECD average is 29.35 per cent of revenue coming from indirect taxes. The Australian average is 31.71 per cent. Where is the need to increase indirect taxes? I suggest that the Treasurer should look at a third area where the comparisons with the OECD are very revealing indeed. If we look at the combined impact of company tax, employer social security contributions and payroll tax, see what the percentage is for the OECD and compare that with Australia, we see a startling difference indeed. These are all taxes paid by companies. The OECD average is 24.39 per cent of total tax revenue coming from those scources. In Australia the average is 15.41 per cent, about 9 per cent less. That seems to me to be something which is of considerable interest in that if one is going to say, 'Look, we need to rearrange our tax structure because it is out of line with that of other countries', one should have some regard to the taxes being paid by companies. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to some of that in a moment. I believe the Treasurer is way out of line in using these OECD comparisons. He has misused them completely and continously by talking about personal income tax and ignoring the fact that in the area of indirect taxes we are above the OECD average. There is no argument for saying that on the basis of international comparisons we need to extend indirect taxation in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, one other argument that has been used by the Government is that an increase in the percentage of tax raised by indirect taxes is desirable because of the intrinsic merits of gathering taxes in this form. The Treasurer used some of this argument again today during the discussion of the matter of public importance. He said that it is easier to collect, that it is more difficult to avoid and that there is less distincentive to personal and business effort. I agree that it probably is easier to collect but I do not find that a compelling argument in itself for moving to more and more indirect taxation. He says that it is more difficult to avoid. This is also probably true but it is not impossible to avoid indirect taxes. There have been tax avoidance schemes designed to minimise or completely eliminate sales tax payments for persons concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, in our view, it is a complete copout to say that preventing the avoidance of income tax is too difficult and that, therefore, we will move to a form of indirect taxation. This is just capitulation to high income earners who are avoiding taxes. It puts the burden more and more on lower income earners because of a lack of resolve to really crack down hard on high income tax avoiders, which seems to us to be a far more desirable way to go about raising more revenue, if that is what the Government wants to do. Of course, we have made many recommendations to the Treasurer as to what he should do in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, in this category the Treasurer talked about less disincentive coming from indirect taxation. Where is his proof that income tax at any level-perhaps apart from extreme levels of around 100 per cent, but at rates generally levied by other countries or this country-is reducing work effort? Where is the evidence for that? There is no evidence. I know of no study undertaken by any economist or econometricians which shows any relationship between tax levels and work effort. Recently a study was done by the OECD which came to the conclusion that there was just no discernible relationship between work effort and tax levels. I believe all this argument which is being put forward about the disincentive effect of personal income tax is totally based on hunch rather than on any sound investigation of reality. People faced with high marginal personal income tax may feel that they have to work harder to achieve a certain after-tax income rather than be dissuaded from work effort. Certainly, the studies do not show that it comes down strongly either way. So I dismiss this disincentive argument as a reason to move towards indirect taxation as one which has no basis in any scientific study and is simply based on hunch and prejudice. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the Government says that increases in indirect taxation are needed to enable a reduction in personal income tax to take place. I have already dealt with this argument to some degree in debating the matter of public importance today. It assumes that other tax measures cannot be taken. Of course, Labor has referred to other tax measures which should be taken. We have said that a resources rent tax should be introduced, that we should have a tougher approach to tax avoidance and that we should abolish the investment allowance, just to name a few examples. These would be far more equitable ways to raise revenue, if needed, by way of income tax. To say that indirect tax rises are needed to fund income tax cuts is to promise nothing, in effect, to taxpayers as a whole. What the Government is saying is, 'We will take more money off you in this less discernible way'-which of course is one reason the Government likes it-'by putting up the price of all the things you buy, and then we will make big fellows of ourselves around election time by giving you tax cuts'. In the end the taxpayer will be no better off-assuming eventually he gets the personal income tax cuts referred to. But what an absurd suggestion it is that one has to increase indirect taxes in order to provide income tax cuts. That leaves taxpayers as a whole no better off. What you have in the end is a less equitable tax system, one in which low income earners are paying a higher proportion of total taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> To argue further that indirect taxes are needed now to provide income cuts later seems to me to be absurd. The tax revenue at stake in this year from these proposed increases amounts to $59m, and in a full year $330m. That may be compared with the $5 billion, approximately, of personal income tax revenue that will be gathered next year if no change in the income tax rate scales is made. That is based on the same assumptions about employment and wage growth as were made in preparing this year's Budget. So roughly speaking, we can see that there is going to be a $5 billion increase in personal income tax revenue to the Government, if the tax scales are not adjusted. Thus, to argue that the Government needs the sales tax revenue which would result from the Bills before us in order to fund personal income tax cuts is an utter absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason given is that sales tax increases are needed, as part of the Budget strategy, to take the pressure off interest rates. This argument shows that the Government is a victim of its own propaganda. It still believes that its actions are taking the pressure off interest rates, but in fact they are putting more pressure on those rates, as is shown by what is happening to them at present in the market. This is because of the slow rate of growth of the money supply, brought about by the non-occurrence of money supply growth from external sources. </PARA>
<PARA> Months and months ago-in October of last year-when the Parliament was in session, the Treasurer rubbished the idea that any shortfall in money supply growth was likely because of the non-arrival of money supply growth from external sources-that is, by way of surplus on private sector foreign exchange transactions. He said that that was of no real concern. It is of concern. Half of the year has gone by. It is quite clear that there has been little or no impetus to money supply growth, such as the Government budgeted for, from external sources. It expected almost half of the money supply growth to come from that source. It has not arrived, and there is no real likelihood that it is going to, because the balance of payments current account deficit is much higher than the Government expected and there is not likely to be any great turnround in it in the next six months. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, because the Government is sticking by its Budget strategy and is maintaining its monetary policy in much the same way as presumably it would have done if that money had come into the country, we have been developing a credit squeeze of no mean proportions and a shortage of money, with a money supply growth of 7.7 per cent, on an annualised basis in the first six months of the year, compared with the Budget target rate of 10 to 11 per cent. That is one hell of a shortfall. The 10 to 11 per cent figure could certainly be argued as being too tight anyway, but when it is 7.7 per cent, with inflation running at 11 per cent, how are we to have enough funds around to provide for growth in the economy. We have not got it. As a result, we have this shortage of funds, this pressure on interest rates, and the Treasurer standing here saying, 'This policy is the best one that you can have to take the pressure off interest rates'. Quite to the contrary, it is putting the pressure on interest rates. What he should be doing in the present situation, instead of standing by his Budget strategy, is abandoning it because it is based on assumptions that certain things will happen which have not happened and which are not going to happen. I refer in particular to external money supply growth. As a result of what is happening in regard to the availability of credit and interest rates his strategy is turning into one which is pushing this country deeper and deeper into recession. The Government should be abandoning that policy and introducing other policies which would stimulate the economy, increase the rate of money supply growth, enable us to get out of the deepening recession into which we are now headed and stop the frightening escalation of interest rates which is of enormous concern to every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer would have us believe that any such tax cuts would increase the pressure on interest rates because they need to be funded by increased Government borrowing. The point that I have made-I make it again-is that it would not be necessary at present, because of the slow rate of growth of the money supply, to fund them by increased borrowing. An increased deficit at this stage would be, to some degree, thoroughly responsible because it would be within responsible monetary aggregates. We are not suggesting that the rate of growth of the money supply is irrelevant. Of course, it is important but what we do say is that it is absurd to be pursuing a policy which represents a large reason for the slow rate of growth of the money supply and one which is creating such interest rate pressure. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth reason that the Government has produced for Australians accepting sales tax increases-it is one which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in particular has been fond of using-is that, supposedly, there has been a large increase in real disposable incomes of wage and salary earners and therefore they can afford to pay these increases, which are said to be necessary to the Government's Budget strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the figures that have been used by the Prime Minister in respect of this supposed large increase in real disposable income are utterly false and misleading. I believe they do him no credit, nor do they do any credit to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner), who used them yesterday. What they are saying is that there has been, on an annualised basis, an increase in real average weekly earnings of $700 in the two years between the September quarter of 1979 and the September quarter of 1981. But that takes no account of the fact that, between September 1975 and September 1979, there was a $200 decline, so that real wages fell over that period. It takes no account of the fact that there was a very significant increase in the tax burden between September 1979 and September 1981. When you take account of that increase in the tax burden you find that there is a very substantial change in the situation, that for some taxpayers there has been no increase at all in real diposable income after tax between September 1975 and September 1981. That is to say, the real disposable income of a person on average weekly earnings, with dependent spouse and two children, was less in September of 1981 than it was in September 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, these examples take no account of the increase in interest rates, which is of great concern to all Australians. Therefore, the suggestion that there has been a large increase in disposable incomes which can enable Australians to afford easily these increased sales taxes represents an absolute misleading of the Australian public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These Bills are before us today with the now stated and changed attitude of the Australian Democrats threatening their passage through another place. To put it mildly, I am surprised at the decision of the Australian Democrats to reject these money Bills. Unquestionably, their explanation has a taint of political expediency about it. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) has stressed repeatedly that the proposed sales tax changes are an integral part of the Budget and central to achieving its objectives and that, as such, they ought not to be rejected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The effect of the Bills is to establish a new sales tax regime under which food , medicine and wine remain exempt. Items that are broadly classified as necessities, which previously were exempt, will be taxed at 2 1/2 per cent. When the proposals were introduced by way of the Budget they were accompanied by measures to increase existing sales taxes by 2 1/2 per cent and to remove certain anomalies. Significant exemptions would cause a substantial drop in revenue. Taken together they were estimated to increase revenue by $892m in a full year. As the Treasurer acknowledged, these changes represented a broadening of the tax base and a change in the tax mix. This, as the facts show, is desirable. Indeed last year I, like others, argued the Government's case for a broadening of the tax base. However, this was done on the clear understanding that any move towards increased reliance on indirect taxation would be accompanied by offsetting reductions in personal income tax. I recall, as others have done, the Treasurer's words to the House on 12 March last year after the taxation review was completed. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout its considerations of this issue, the Government remained firmly of the view that if a shift towards greater emphasis on indirect taxation were to occur, it should be accompanied by a noticeable reduction in personal income tax . </PARA>
<PARA>In the same statement the Treasurer said that the purpose of the review was to:</PARA>
<PARA>assess the desirability of altering the mix or combination of taxes, to the extent possible, in the context of reducing the overall burden of taxation; it was not to bring about and increase in the overall tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has defended the increased sales taxes on the grounds that they enhance the potential for personal income tax reduction 'in future years' as economic and budgetary conditions permit. Of course, the Government must always be guided by economic prudence but one can only speculate as to when circumstances might allow for such income tax cuts. We are now told 'not before this year's Budget'. The Treasurer has said that he gave no promise on personal income tax in his earlier speech but he did say that it was the Government's firm view that income tax cuts should accompany a shift towards greater emphasis on indirect taxation. We have had increased sales taxes but still await personal income tax relief. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to express my regret now that the action by the Senate in first deferring, and now by the Australian Democrats threatening to reject, these new Bills has made it harder for the Government to reduce personal income tax. However, this does not reduce the need for such relief. In recent years the burden of personal income tax has grown alarmingly, especially during the 1970s. Despite the significant contribution of the oil levy, now around 10 per cent of tax revenue, personal income tax represents 55 per cent of total tax revenues, down only slightly from the peak of 57 per cent in 1977-78. Of more concern is the fact that gross pay-as-you-earn tax is estimated to be 49.4 per cent of total tax revenue in 1981-82, almost equal to the peak in 1976-77, while net PAYE will be 45.7 per cent, an all-time high. I repeat: This is despite the contribution of over $3 billion from the oil levy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not overlook the effect that the change to family allowances has had on net personal income tax revenue. Between 1971-72 and 1980-81 net income tax on individuals grew at an annual rate of 19 per cent. Net PAYE tax grew at the same rate compared with growth in other income taxes of 16 per cent. By contrast, sales tax grew by 13 per cent a year, company tax by 14 per cent and total taxes by 17 per cent. Income taxes on individuals accounted for 52.5 per cent of the total increase in receipts, 44 per cent of this coming from those paying PAYE tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last six years the Government has made certain reforms in the taxation field. These have been spelt out by the Treasurer and important among them was the introduction for a time of tax indexation, one of the fundamental elements of Liberal Party policy in recent years. Yet full indexation applied only in 1976-77 and 1977-78 and half indexation of the standard rate scale applied in 1978-79 and 1980-81. Now it has been abandoned altogether. I am aware of the Government's reasons for not maintaining automatic adjustments but the Government has not, so far as I am aware, publicly abandoned its commitment to adjust tax rates for the effects of inflation and reduce the overall burden of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation and the tax system continue to take their toll on individual incomes. The Budget estimated that average wages would increase by approximately 13 per cent in 1981-82 although it now looks as though the increase will be greater. The Government's revenue from PAYE tax was expected to increase by 22 per cent, and I understand from the Department of Finance figures that this is running approximately on target. Average weekly earnings are approaching the level at which they will no longer incur the standard tax rate. Despite what the Opposition claims, there is scope for increasing reliance on indirect taxation so long as it is offset by personal income tax cuts, especially for low income families. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I do not set much store by international comparisons, Australia tends to rely more on personal income tax and less on indirect taxation as a source of revenue than most other countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Moreover, Australia relies heavily on specific taxes on a few items, namely, alcohol, tobacco, crude oil, petroleum products and motor vehicles, which in 1980-81 accounted for over 80 per cent of the total taxes on goods and services. In 1975 the Asprey Taxation Review Committee recommended greater emphasis on indirect taxes. As I have said previously, high income taxes stifle incentive and encourage tax avoidance and tax evasion. They also encourage speculative investment for capital gain and can stimulate wage demands . In the last year the average family has been squeezed on all sides-higher interest rates, higher government charges, dearer health insurance, dearer petrol and now higher taxes, both direct and indirect. They will have a direct impact on the willingness of the trade union movement to show restraint in its wage claims. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened carefully to what the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) had to say, particularly about regressiveness. The Australian Labor Party has made rather exaggerated claims about the regressive nature of indirect taxes, arguing that they fall most heavily on low to middle income earners. The Australian Democrats have agonised about a tax on so-called necessities. It is true that the low to middle income group spends rather more of its total income than do high income earners-that ought to be axiomatic-and more of its expenditure is devoted to basic items. On the other hand, expenditure tax is much more difficult to avoid than direct income tax and the amount paid will vary with expenditure patterns both within and among income groups. The Labor Party has conceded that, for the rich, paying income tax has become optional, making the present system inequitable. With the indirect taxes, greater discretion remains with the individual as to how his or her income is spent and, indeed, how the tax is paid. This is a very important point. Governments have to allow families to have maximum choice in deciding how to dispose of their incomes. Of course, this is contrary to Labor Party views about the role of government. The proposed tax on so-called necessities is very low while food remains exempt, and there is a degree of progression in the sales tax structure.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us recall the record of the Labor Party in government. All taxes increased. The Hayden Budget, of which the Opposition is so proud, significantly increased indirect taxes and revenue from sales taxes went up by 22 per cent and excise duties by around 20 per cent. In other words, the Labor Party taxed beer and cigarettes-a pretty good way of hitting the poor. Similarly, we do not hear the Opposition calling for cuts in the tariff duty on clothing or footwear. According to the Industries Assistance Commission, the average nominal rate of assistance for clothing and footwear in 1977-78 was 64 per cent. The average effective rate of assistance was 149 per cent. A 2 1/2 per cent sales tax pales into insignificance. The total assistance afforded to the clothing and footwear industries in 1977-78 was equivalent to a tax on consumers of $980m or over $200 per household. It will have increased significantly since then and, by contrast, the Democrats now say they will save families $1.30 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to reduce reliance on specific indirect taxes-the excises and the oil levy, which will show little growth in the future-it is necessary to cast broadly the sales tax net. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issue in this debate is not whether so-called necessities are taxed but whether there are any offsetting personal income tax cuts or other measures of relief particularly for low income earners. I note that those in receipt of most pensions and benefits will be automatically compensated through indexation. The new sales taxes, together with the increases passed in September, would have raised around $900m in a full year-a significant addition to revenue. This would have to have been made up in other ways if the sales tax changes had not been adopted in their entirety. Already delay of these Bills has cost the Government approximately $80m and would cost about $300m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, for the Labor Party this may not be a concern. It is expert in running deficits; the community suffered inflation to prove it. The Opposition has made some suggestions for increasing revenue, for example, a resources rent tax which it would impose on mining companies making, what it seems to be, excessive profits. One wonders how much revenue a Labor government would have collected this year. It would terminate the investment allowance but, of course, this would have no immediate effect on revenue. The Opposition would abolish tax avoidance-a worthy objective-though its record is rather less impressive. The fact is that in opposing the sales tax increases the Opposition has not shown where it would raise the additional revenue. Yet, as I recall, the whole thrust of the speech on the Budget made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) was to increase Commonwealth Government expenditure-a typical example of the Labor Party's approach to economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> One option is to increase government borrowing. However, the Government has quite correctly set aside this option because it would further aggravate the pressure on interest rates. While I applaud the Government's continuing commitment to restraint one option which also needs to be considered and which I raised in my comment on the Budget is the reduction of Government expenditure and greater concentration on those in genuine need. There is no doubt that sales tax increases add to the consumer price index although estimates vary as to the size of the increase we can expect. This highlights a problem referred to by the Treasurer in his speech in March 1981 when he said that to achieve a significant reduction in personal income tax would require offsetting sales tax increases that would substantially add to inflation. Indeed, the reason for the Government 's decision earlier in the year not to increase indirect taxes was, as the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . its concern at the impact on inflation and inflationary expectations of any significant shift towards greater reliance on indirect taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>One concludes that the only way significant income tax cuts can be achieved without severe effects on the CPI due to increased reliance on sales tax is through even greater restraint in government expenditure. That means concentrating assistance to those who genuinely need it and a willingness by less needy groups to accept lower levels of government benefits and services. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I have supported the sales tax Bills because they are an integral part of the Budget and the longer they are delayed the more confusion will be caused to business and the community generally. I have supported them also because they represent a move towards broadening the tax base. Unfortunately the increases in indirect tax have not been accompanied by a significant reduction in personal income tax as people had been led to expect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock ), I will try to restrict my remarks to the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) before the House and to sales tax in general. In fact, one would wonder from the remarks made by the honourable member for Kooyong whether he was speaking in favour of the Government or whether he was speaking against the Government measures. The Bills presently before us are similar to those introduced on two occasions last year. They specifically impose tax at 2 1/2 per cent on a range of items which were previously exempt from sales tax. Included in this category are clothing, footwear, drapery, soft furnishings, manchester, building materials, books, magazines, newspapers et cetea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other sales tax measures introduced last year and which have now become law have already affected people throughout Australia and have already added to the nation's increasing inflation. Briefly looking at those measures a little closer we shall see that the schedules increased by 2 1/2 percentage points included such items as radio and television receivers, record players, cameras, films, watches, jewellery and cosmetics which went from 27 1/2 per cent tax to 30 per cent for schedule 2. Schedule 3 covered goods increased from 2 1/2 per cent to 5 per cent and includes household furniture, appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and a range of household goods. Schedules 4 and 5 covered goods increased from 15 per cent to 17 1/2 per cent and covers motor cars, commercial vehicles, boats, confectionary, stationery, computers, soft drinks, potable spirits and imported wines and beers. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the total sales tax measures as outlined by the Government was to enable the Government to raise some $892m in a full year. The sales tax measures on goods already subject to tax which came into effect on 19 August 1981 and raising $550m in a full year can now be coupled with the tax on these other items originally scheduled to come into effect from 1 January. However, because of the actions taken by the Senate late last year the Treasurer was forced to announce on 28 October that the tax on these items would not now come into effect until 29 March this year and this would mean a subsequent loss of revenue of some $79m. The latest information to hand would perhaps suggest that these latter measures will be rejected by those discerning members of the other place across Kings Hall. </PARA>
<PARA> From the time when the sales tax proposals were introduced into this House in August, there has been a steady stream of opposition to them in this House, in the Senate and throughout the Australian community. Why has this been so? The answer is quite simple. It is because these sales tax proposals will cause further inequity in the Australian community. These sales tax measures, particularly the extension of sales tax into the necessities of life such as clothing, footwear, home building materials, educational books, household furniture and appliances, will have an overbearing impact on the cost of living and millions of ordinary Australian families and low income earners. The whole of year costs of $330m on those items subject to the current legislation being debated at present give a breakdown of $27.5m on newspapers, magazines and books , $7m on wrapping material, waxed paper and greaseproof paper, $96m for building materials for private dwellings and $104m for clothing and footwear. </PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax measures introduced under the guise of further spreading the tax burden are totally iniquitous and unnecessary and the Australian community has at last begun to realise the impact that these measures will have on the cost of living. As an indirect tax, the sales tax increases already imposed from 19 August have fallen heaviest on those in the lower income bracket. The increases proposed for those items on which tax will be imposed from 29 March will bite even more harshly into the incomes of families and low income earners. Of course , what we have seen is yet another one of the Government's broken promises. The Treasurer stated on 12 March last year, when he announced the Government's decision not to proceed with the introduction of a new broadly based indirect tax, that the Government was anxious to 'minimise the inflationary consequences of collecting additional revenue' and that it did not wish to 'move towards greater reliance on indirect tax without providing a noticeable offset in personal tax reductions'. Quite contrary to these promises, taxpayers have now been slugged with an extra $562m increase in sales tax in a full year which, as we have seen, has already added to the inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Increased sales taxes are completely reprehensible as they hit hardest at those on the lowest incomes. Many articles essential to the family budget have been hit. Sales tax on furniture, floor coverings, whitegoods, crockery and bedding has been doubled from 2 1/2 per cent to 5 per cent. Not only will increased interest rates mean a higher cost of buying one's home but also it will now be even more expensive to furnish it and live in it. Clothing, building materials, shoes, books and newspapers will now be subject to a new 2 1/2 per cent tax, with the tax on school books costing parents an extra $6m a year. The increased family allowance for large families will be eaten up quickly by the higher cost of keeping children in clothes and shoes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Housing Industry Association has estimated that the tax on building materials is likely to add $1,000 to the cost of building and furnishing a new home. The National Roads and Motorists Association has calculated that the cost of a new six-cylinder Holden Commodore has risen by $178 and of a four-cylinder Datsun by $150. Even the oil to run the car will cost 17 1/2 per cent more. The net effect on the family budget of all these increases has been a cost increase of over $4 a week. This will have a disastrous impact on family living standards , which have already been battered by rising interest rates and more expensive health costs since the last election. Added to the increase in income tax of over $11 a week for a family with a breadwinner on average weekly earnings, it means a massive tax increase of over $15 a week. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of Government members stated in the August and October debates on similar Bills that the increases would not have very much impact on low income earners. This was supposed to indicate that, as a result of the spending patterns of various levels of income earners, the burden of sales tax would fall more heavily on high income earners. This is nonsense, contrary to the facts and quite contrary to informed economic opinion. The Taxation Review Committee's report of 1975 under the chairmanship of Mr Justice K. Asprey showed quite clearly that taxation is quite sharply regressive at the lower end of the household income scale, nearly proportional in a wide middle band and progressive only at higher levels. The reason given was that indirect taxes are chiefly responsible for this occurrence. The Committee prepared a table showing taxes as a proportion of income for the year 1966-67 and, although the income levels are now largely outdated, I seek leave to have the table incorporated in Hansard because it shows how indirect taxes fall heaviest on lower income earners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows that the raising of taxes through indirect taxation, such as sales tax, adds to the regressiveness of the tax system and imposes a higher proportionate burden on people on lower incomes, thus making the tax system inequitable and unfair. Since this Government took office in 1975 there has been an increase in the proportion of total taxes raised from indirect taxes. That, of course, has added to the regressiveness of the tax system over and above that shown in the table prepared by Mr Warren.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One might ask why the Government is persisting with the sales tax legislation when there is such opposition from the community at large. The amount of taxation that would be lost if these measures were not to be proceeded with is small and is more than offset by the large increase in personal taxes payable to the Government through the effects of its inflationary actions on the economy. The only reason for the Government wishing to persist with these measures is obviously its desire to increase its income so that it will be in a better position to offer tax cuts just prior to the next election. It obviously hopes that the community's view of the Government's image will be suddenly changed from that of a money-grabbing Scrooge to that of a benevolent Father Christmas. The Government's efforts in this regard will be seen through by the Australian community as a shabby trick and the Government will be taught a salutary lesson by the voters of this country who have not forgotten the broken promises and actions of deception by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and members of this Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The insistence of the Government in going ahead with these measures also means, in my opinion, that it intends progressively to increase sales taxes on a greater range of items than those covered by the present legislation. It is obviously part of a long term plan to widen the tax base to incorporate a greater proportion of indirect taxation. This, of course, is in line with the recommendations of the Asprey report of January 1975 and the Department of the Treasury Taxation Paper No. 5 of October 1974, which recommended that governments should impose sales taxes on a wider range of items including food, clothing and services. The Asprey report stated that 60 per cent of personal consumption expenditure, including virtually all that on food, clothing and services, is not directly subject to tax. Because of the Government's decision to tax clothing, the recommendations of the paper must now assume greater significance as it is obvious that the Government will proceed in the future to implement the remainder of the recommendations by imposing a tax on food and services. To get some idea of the effect that taxes on food and services would have on the community we have only to realise that personal consumption expenditure on food is almost double that on the clothing and manchester area and that service expenditure is similar to expenditure in the clothing area. What this means, therefore, is that a tax on food and services would impose a further cost of at least $350m a year on Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA> In an effort to give some justification for increasing indirect taxes the Treasurer and other Government speakers have stated that there is a basic need in Australia to raise the level of taxation coming from indirect taxes because it is relatively low compared with that in other countries. This, of course, is not true, as was outlined by my colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis) only a few moments ago. The fact is, of course, that the proportion of indirect taxes raised in Australia is above the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development average and above the proportion raised by many countries, including Canada, Japan, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America which, incidentally, raises only half the proportion that we raise from indirect taxes.</PARA>
<PARA> The measures proposed by the Government are nothing more than a confidence trick on the Australian community, nothing more than a money-grabbing exercise to swell the Government's coffers at the expense of the lower income groups in Australia. The Opposition will continue to oppose this legislation. It is to be hoped that the Australian Democrats will show a greater degree of intestinal fortitude when these Bills are debated shortly in the Senate by rejecting the proposed sales tax increases in their entirety because of the iniquitous effects such increases will have on the Australian community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just about everything that this Government and its Treasurer (Mr Howard) are doing is contrary to the interests of Australian people and contrary to all of the pre-election promises made by this Government in 1975, 1977 and 1980. We have reached the stage where the money being ripped off the Australian people is more than double the maximum tax take of the Whitlam Government. This is some record for the so-called low tax government. The hardest hit have been the pay-as-you-earn taxpayers-the middle and low income earners. Non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are facing an increase of 5 per cent whereas pay-as-you-earn taxpayers are facing a massive 22 per cent increase . These increases are due to changes to the tax scale which have benefited the wealthy at the expense of the great majority of taxpayers, and to the Government 's failure fully to index taxes. It is clear that this Government prefers taxation by stealth and relies heavily on the secret tax of inflation which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his cohorts so roundly condemned in 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In debating these Bills once again I am delighted to see some of the Governments chickens coming home to roost. I suppose it did not occur to many Liberal or Country party members when they were slavering after Labor's blood a few years ago that they might be fashioning a rod for their own backs. Their squeals of indignation now, as their legislation is rejected in another place, will not evoke much sympathy from the Australian people. The Treasurer could hardly fail to appreciate the reception he got yesterday as he uneasily tried to find arguments to combat the censure motion. I point out to the House that it is a long established custom or convention that the Prime Minister defends a censure motion. I suggest that the Prime Minister ponders the truth of his own words of 2 March 1975 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The destruction of convention, the defiance of reason, the pursuit of power, without concern for the rights and privileges of minorities will give Australians little faith in the future of Australian democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister shows little concern for the rights and privileges of Parliament when he flouts convention. I understand that his record of speeches in this House is the worst of any Australian Prime Minister-approximately six speeches a year. I suggest that the Prime Minister also reads Ray Aitchison's book Looking at the Liberals in which Aitchison says:</PARA>
<PARA> If long established conventions of political behaviour are discarded, government is likely to become arbitrary, haphazard and even dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister might ponder the truth of those words. When I spoke in debate on these Bills on 14 October 1981 I put forward my opposition to the sales tax in numerous areas but I particularly highlighted the effect that such taxes would have on the building industry. I pointed out that the industry, already in trouble, would be decimated by the extra burden of a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on building materials. Nothing has happened in the intervening four months to change my mind. However, I am delighted to find the Democrats have again changed their mind. It is one of life's more tantalising mysteries to consider just what the Democrats decision-making process consists of. Do they adopt contemporary measures such as checking their biorythms?</PARA>
<PARA> There has been an 11 per cent drop in the number of flats and houses begun by private builders in December 1981 taking the figure to its lowest point for 12 months. Houses and flats begun in December totalled 10,746 compared with 11,856 in November. There was a similar drop in government building from 12,005 in November to 11,279 in December. The decline reflects a shrinking supply of home finance and buyers' ability to meet bank and building repayment tests under high interest rates. The additional 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on building materials is just about the last straw to the building industry. Builders, plumbers and electricians and all concerned with the building industry have inundated my office, as they have my colleagues' offices, with urgent pleas for help to re- establish the industry and to urge the Government to re-think this latest tax slug. The increase in housing costs which will flow from sales tax impositions will only further depress an already depressed industry. Back in the debate on 14 October the Treasurer in summing up the debate had this to say in defence of the sales tax:</PARA>
<PARA> Above everything else the Budget was designed to take the pressure off interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget has served above everything else to bring about a change in the climate of interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If we had the opportunity to retrace our steps--</PARA>
<PARA>which, I would point out to him, of course the Government has now got thanks to a hostile Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> I would not, nor would the Government, alter in any way the priority that we attached to bringing about a huge reduction in the size of the deficit and therefore take pressure off the money markets of this country, reduce the Government's borrowing requirements and as a consequence make a contribution towards controlling and, I hope, reducing interest rates. That strategy was clear. The strategy was right and that strategy is starting to work. We ought not to risk it. </PARA>
<PARA>Small wonder that the Treasurer's words yesterday were greeted with derisive scorn. We of the Opposition said at the time the strategy was wrong. We said at the time the strategy would not work and even the Treasurer must now see that it is not working. Interest rates have gone up and look like continuing their upward spiral. Fewer and fewer families can look forward to buying a home and high rents are an utter misery to low income earners and pensioners. Not even the increase in the subsidy to pensioners will be any help to them as rents are going up $12 to $15 a week in my area and I am sure that trend is being duplicated in electorates all over Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the sitting was suspended I was speaking about the effect that the high interest rates and the new sales tax were having on home owners and home buyers. Along with most honourable members on this side of the House we have discovered that home buyers are losing their homes. Many of those who, with a small deposit, bought their homes seven, eight or nine years ago have now found that the interest rates have risen to the extent that their monthly repayments are not even keeping up with their interest rates and they are forced out of their homes. This is a real tragedy for the Australian dream of owning a home. In addition people renting flats and houses are being evicted as they cannot keep pace with the high rents which are being forced up because of the high interest rates. So much for the Government's so-called successful strategy in the last Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government cannot even claim that its strategy is closing the gap in regard to unemploy- ment. National total unemployment figures rose by about 3,900 over December to the alarming figure of 437,200 last month. A total of 6.4 per cent of the work force are without jobs, and without hope of jobs. These are not the figures of the Australian Labor Party. These figures come from the Treasury. The latest statistics for February 1982 point out that the number of unemployed increased in January 1982 to 437,200-6.4 per cent of the work force. Let us make sure that honourable members realise that this is the work force we know about. This does not include the hundreds of thousands of hidden unemployed, including an enormous proportion of women. The Government cannot claim that its strategy is working in regard to the deficit. The Government has such a serious deficit overrun that it has instructed all departments to cut out all spending that it is possible to cut out. I will quote from an article reported in the Age of 12 February. It states that departments:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . have also been told to defer discretionary spending and spending on items where the timetable is flexible. </PARA>
<PARA> The new instructions, which went in a telex from the Finance Department to all Federal departments yesterday--</PARA>
<PARA>They became public because they were inadvertently phoned through to the Australian Associated Press-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . follow further discussion at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting of the serious deficit overrun. They are orders for how departments are to operate while estimates are being prepared of what extra spending cannot be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> The Finance Department warned other departments that where necessary their authority to spend would be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA>What does the Government intend to do about the overtime that public servants are incurring right now? If there is no money, perhaps the Government finds itself in the same position that the Whitlam Government found itself in in 1975. Perhaps it should resign if it cannot pay its bills. The Government cannot claim its strategy is working in regard to the deficit. The deficit is already running at $800m over target making a mockery of the notion that knocking back the revenue from the sales tax Bills will mean that tax cuts cannot be given. That is one of the ridiculous points that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) put forward this afternoon and yesterday when he spoke in place of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The revenue from those Bills would amount to $330m in a full year. The Government is already $800m behind. It is a weak, flimsy excuse for not proposing tax cuts. This Government, as usual, will try to buy votes at the next election by again promising tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot claim that its strategy is working in regard to the balance of payments. It has the second highest monthly balance of payments deficit for this financial year leaving the balance of payments, like government spending, way out of line with autumn Budget forecasts. The Government cannot claim that its strategy is working in inflation either because that has taken off well into double figures. Again, the Treasury tells us that the figure is 11 .3 per cent. The Government's favourite claim to keep inflation down is just a myth. In any case, sales taxes are directly inflationary. The Government will remember its jibes at Labor over inflation. It is now hoist with its own petard. Its strategy is in tatters and it is in disarray. Unless a new plan is announced immediately and unless government spending increases instead of decreases, small businesses and the building industry will be in tatters also. This legislation is inflationary. It is a complete absurdity to fight inflation, unemployment and interest rates by increasing prices. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to have a word about what the Government is doing to the sales tax on books. I repeat-I cannot find better words to say it-what I had to say on 10 September. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that any other English speaking country imposes a tax on books. In fact, even the United Kingdom, when Mrs Thatcher--</PARA>
<PARA>She is not known for her softness-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . imposed the value added tax, magazines, newspapers and books were specifically excluded. I wish to quote from a letter from the Library Association of Australia. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the simple realisation that books are not ordinary merchandise and nationally and internationally they rightly enjoy a special status and occupy a unique position in our lives. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . .  Books play a vital role in preserving and giving succeeding generations access to the cultural heritage of mankind. They are the fundamental tools of education from primary school through to university, and as general reading for continuing life-long education. </PARA>

<PARA> That Librarians and library users throughout the nation call for the exemption of books, periodicals and newspapers from the imposition of sales taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax exempt status of libraries and schools will not protect them from general cost increases which sales tax and its collection will cause. Indeed, exemption claims on millions of items per year will themselves add to the cost burden of both libraries and suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA> This tax is socially injurious and unworkable, and a burden on education, science and culture. </PARA>
<PARA>These petitions are being signed by hundreds of thousands of people throughout Australia. I think it is time the Government listened to the people. The philosophical commitment of this Government is directed towards ensuring that the most deprived sections of the community should bear the ever-increasing burdens of taxation. Pensioners should note that by the end of this year if things continue as they are almost all of them will be paying income tax. The Australian people have been king hit by this Government and its so-called strategies. However, there may be some early relief if the Government chooses to call a snap election or a double dissolution on the sales tax issue. It will be left in no doubt as to what the Australian people think about their economic strategy. As a curtain raiser, the people of Lowe will speak first and reject the Government's policies along with these sales taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1973, 1974 and 1975 the Australian people received an object lesson in how rough and tough government can be when plagued by the conservative parties. To date the Opposition tactics have not even begun to match the degree of ruthlessness displayed by honourable members opposite. However, the Government should not presume that the Opposition or the people will continue to take just whatever it cares to dish out. I urge the Government again to re-think on these sales taxes. The amount of money is not large compared with the extra taxation the Government is ripping off every year by not indexing tax. It is upsetting, confusing and bringing misery to a tremendous amount of people throughout the community. The Government has been elected by the people to legislate for the people. I believe that it should take note of the voices of the people. If it needs extra finance-it obviously appears that it does as the deficit has blown out-I suggest it gets really serious about getting after tax avoiders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member was here; she ought to know what happened. By increasing wages and opening up government expenditure-opening the flood gates- the Australian Labor Party in similar circumstances in 1974 ruined the Australian economy. In today's circumstances we have a responsible method of managing the economy with an ability to put pressure on interest rates to keep the level of inflation down and to have this country performing as well as any similar country. That was not the case in 1974 and the latter days of the Labor Party Government. That philosophy did not work at that time and it would not work if reintroduced now. From what we can understand from the Labor Party, it has a half-baked wealth tax cum capital gains tax policy. Perhaps the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke), who is sitting at the table, might be able to inform us just where things stand with the capital gains tax issue or the wealth tax issue and what sort of additional taxes the Labor Party proposes imposing on the Australian people. We know that, under a Labor government, there would be an increase in taxes connected with medical costs, underestimated by 50 per cent. Also, an additional tax has been talked about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem with direct tax-I think this is acknowledged by all members in the House-is that it denies people the incentive to earn additional funds, be it by working overtime in a factory or by seeking to advance themselves by way of study or courses which will improve their rewards in their place of work. The more people earn the more taxes they pay. Pay-as-you-earn taxpayers have no capacity to do anything but pay on a regular weekly basis that which is required by the Australian Taxation Office. They do not have avenues of minimising tax that may be available in other areas within the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The wage claims of the past few months are in part attributable to the concern that wage earners have about taxation. Of course, the avoidance of direct taxation is very difficult to detect, but this Government has spared no effort in endeavouring to expose tax avoidance schemes and to have them closed by way of effective legislation and providing the Commissioner of Taxation with discretionary powers to close loopholes in the Income Tax Assessment Act. We have, too, insidious problems within the direct tax economy. I refer to the problems that are caused by a cash economy, by the small subterranean cash payments that lead to a huge amount of tax avoidance. It is understandable that on a day to day basis people enter into cash transactions, but in so doing they avoid their responsibility to the rest of the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs reminds me that such occurrences have been noted in the past few days in connection with certain royal commission inquiries. Indirect taxes have the advantage that the user pays . The big spender is the one who pays the most tax. Tax avoidance in an indirect tax system is almost impossible and, of course, with indirect taxes those people who are involved in a cash economy contribute at least something towards the costs of their fellow man, be it for defence or social security purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has the objective of sound economic management. I think that the introduction of a selective and modest indirect taxation system in the last Budget extends by some $800m the Government's capacity to raise funds by way of indirect taxes. The expedient decision made in the past day or two by the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party will reduce by $330m that amount of money planned in the Budget. That is a dramatic reduction in the $800m planned in the Budget. In fact, the delays to date in having indirect taxation legislation approved by both Houses has cost revenue $79m, which is more than the amount allocated to the Home Savings Grants Scheme. Those people who are operating in the sales tax area should think about their fellow Australians. They should consider how those funds might have been used and what the options would have been had the Government had an opportunity to use those funds which it has not been able to collect. As much as $79m has been lost due to delays. The Home Savings Grants Scheme costs annually $74m. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation we are looking at tonight covers basically new areas of sales tax, including imposing sales tax on newspapers, books, wrappings, building materials, clothing and footwear. We are told that the decision made by the Senate, led by the Democrats, will save a family something like $1.30 a week. It is not a large amount, but that is the Democrats' estimate. I have seen other estimates from the Australian Labor Party, not of $1.30 but of $1.50. To an average person that seems a significant amount, until we start to analyse where that money is spent and by whom and what could have been done with it if it had been collected. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that honourable members opposite now need to look at the options they could have supported. I think we need to assess the statements made by the Acting Leader of the Australian Democrats at the time, Senator Colin Mason. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Can we now mess around with the Budget a little and if so how much? Clearly the Senate has the right to alter the Budget a little. It has an equal right to alter it a great deal. I suggest the difference is merely quantitative. That is a dangerous path that would lead the way to the re-enactment of the events of 1975. </PARA>
<PARA>Today the Democrats have had a change of heart. One would expect it to be an expedient change of heart. The complete loss of credibility that I believe will as a result accrue to the Australian Democrats will be reflected in the next election. Keeping people honest is not just a matter of losing one's principles when one makes decisions. Contrary to what the Australian Labor Party has stated , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has stated that this tax is not regressive. The Australian Labor party tonight for its authority quoted what a person from the University of New South Wales has said. The Labor Party matches that person's and its judgment, made on the run, against the whole of the expertise of the OECD, an economic group that has experience and deep understanding of the processes of indirect taxes. The amount of shortfall this financial year will be $132m and in a total year it will be $330m. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the main items and see whether the tax would be regressive. Let us consider the impact of sales tax on the cost of housing and building materials. For an average house built anywhere in Australia today it would mean an additional cost of $500. That is a total of the principal and the interest charged and amounts to a total of $1.39 a week extra for the purchase of such a house. Over the past few months increases amounting to 18 per cent have been granted in wages in the building industry. That will increase the cost of an average home by $3,600. The Opposition is quibbling tonight about $1.39 and it has approved and encouraged wage claims of that type. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the activities of local government and State government in this area. A local council in my area has put a surcharge of $2,000 on each block of land on which houses will be built. It has done that because it claims it needs that money to meet the cost of services that it will provide. Compared with sales tax revenue, that is a huge amount of money. If we are really serious about the problems of home buyers, a one per cent increase in interest rates will, on an average house, mean the payment of an additional $7.69 a week. The impact of sales tax in the housing area is insignificant. In fact, builders have said to me: 'We are pleased to have some sort of check on the cash economy in the building industry because it will force people who work on a total cash basis to contribute'. If we look at the clothing and footwear areas in exactly the same way we will find that the facts are different from the way they have been presented by both the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. For instance, for a pair of shoes which would normally be worn by school children, with an average price of $25, the additional sales tax will be 63c. If we allow a figure of 10 per cent, the total cost of living increase on that pair of shoes would be $2.50. An amount of 63c is a small amount to pay on a pair of shoes. </PARA>
<PARA> I am talking about people who are in need and who are buying at the lower end of the scale. I am not talking about the middle class or the pseudo- intellectuals who come into this place. I am talking about the average person with whom those on the other side of this place have not associated for years. The additional cost for an average dress for an Australian housewife, costing around $30, will be 75c. The additional cost on a pair of sneakers for a school child will be 28c. Moving to the upper and middle income brackets, a person who pays $100 for a pair of shoes will contribute in indirect tax $2.50 towards Federal revenue. We should compare that with the additional cost of 63c for a pair of children's shoes. I do not think the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats realise that the people who will pay this tax will be those with middle or substantial incomes. They are the largest consumers. Not only do they consume more but they also consume more luxury and high cost goods. On a uniform for a primary school boy the additional cost of the sales tax, spread over the whole year, would be $6.25. I can go on in regard to essential items of clothing for the family and indicate that the arguments the opposition has advanced cannot be sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> Many small amounts aggregated in this way can provide a number of options for assisting, once more, those people in need. I refer to the Homes Savings Grant Scheme. I have mentioned it already. An amount of $674m has been set aside to allow first home buyers to receive a grant of up to $2,000 if they have their savings in an approved account with an approved agency. In Australia last year 37,000 grants were made. An amount of $330m, which amount the Democrats have said they will not approve, would provide for 165,000 grants. To put it another way, we could supply grants to the same number of people not at the rate of $2, 000 per applicant but at a rate of $8,000 per applicant. Let us look at the amount of money required to provide an interest subsidy on an average home loan of $40,000. A 4 per cent subsidy would cost something like $100m a year. The $ 330m a year that we hope will come to revenue would give the Government the option of providing an interest subsidy for 60,000 homes to the extent of 12 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition and the Australian Democrats say that they are concerned for the underprivileged and for those who are being ripped off. They will save these individuals $1.30 a week, yet they will deny the options of worthwhile housing programs or worthwhile support for home buyers. In 1981-82, $1,040m will be provided for family allowances. The additional $330m would allow the family allowance to be increased by 33 per cent. I refer the House to Budget Paper No. 1 where the amounts are indicated clearly. Let us look at the situation of dependent spouses. It is claimed that they are in need of assistance. As members of parliament, we all understand the circumstances which make things more difficult for them. Under the Income Tax Assessment Act and the requirements of tax returns, the rebate during 1981-82 of $830 which is the current rebate for the dependent spouses, will cost the Government $615m. The amount that has so far been denied by the Senate would provide the option for a 50 per cent increase in the amounts allowable for dependent spouses-an increase from $830 to $1,200 under the Act. Compare that $8 a week for a dependent spouse and a family with the miserable $1.30 that is being saved by the glorious white knights on the other side of King's Hall. It is unbelievable that such a trumped up charge against the Government can be made for such a small amount of saving right across the board, involving all families wealthy or poor. The options which would have been available to the Government and which could have been offered to the community appear to be vanishing. It is the most poorly conceived decision I have seen for a long time in these Houses of the Parliament. The change of mind has indicated an on-the-run change of approach which will have long and lasting detrimental effects on the leaders of the parties that oppose this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government does not provide benefits in this way, what options does it have in regard to cutting expenditure? Reducing the size of the Public Service is an option. That is something the Government has sought to do since coming to power. Could the Government cut the supporting mother's benefit? I do not think that is an option. The Government could also consider its building programs. The Government's record in trying to contain public expenditure has not been equalled by any other government in the history of Australia. It has had remarkable success in containing costs and reducing charges and the benefits of that are flowing through to the Australian community and being turned to the best advantage. Choosing to accept only those parts of a Budget which an Opposition party or faction group happens to like can bring great changes to the way in which the Houses of Parliament operate. The size and cost of government may be larger than is wanted but poorly conceived decisions do not allow for proper management. An instantaneous change of direction which denies capacity for management can have serious and long-lasting effects. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn again to the taxes proposed by the Australian Labor Party. Of course, members of the Labor Party are all for tax cuts. They have not said where they stand on indirect taxes and whether they would increase them. They like the thought of imposing resource taxes, which are indirect taxes, and they like the idea of imposing special taxes for medical costs. They like also the idea of wealth taxes but they have not said exactly where they stand on tax matters. The Government has to say where it stands and the shift from direct to indirect taxes is a most sensible and equitable approach to spreading the responsibility and forcing those who are avoiding paying tax to make a contribution to the real needs of the nation. The smart attitudes and actions may prove beneficial in the short term but may also prove to be of real regret to those parties that have adopted and instigated them. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DI4">Mr MILTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Hindmarsh says, they do not like to hear the truth. I find it equally amazing that Government members hypocritically charge the Australian Labor Party with acting irresponsibly over our rejection of the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on clothing, footwear, building masterials and reading materials, which are the main items affected by the Bills before us. This is the second time that these Bills have been in this House and we are even more resolved in our opposition than we were when they were first introduced in this House last year. Since that time we have all been overwhelmed with an avalanche of written protests from our constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The impact of these taxes will fall most heavily on the poorer people because they are taxes on the necessities of life. By all means, let the Government tax luxury goods but clothing, building materials, books and tools are not in the luxury category. Even a pauper must wear clothes or risk imprisonment for indecency. Books and journals provide valuable information to the community and are essential in a society which believes in individual freedoms and in the ability of people to make their own meaningful decisions. If the provision of information is to be taxed it follows that the increased cost will mean that the poorer people will not be able to afford to obtain the information. Obviously, that is what this Government is aiming for-a society in which only the rich and the powerful will have access to information. Building materials are also essential. The proposed sales tax would considerably increase the price of a house even beyond the present high level which is far higher than most young people can afford. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been mentioned by other honourable members, but it is worth repeating because it must be hammered home to the Australian people, that the Government has no mandate to impose these taxes. They were not mentioned in the Government' s 1980 election policies and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said publicly that the Government would not consider the introduction of indirect taxation unless there was a comparable cut in personal income tax. The Treasurer has broken his word and the Government has deceived the electorate. Of course, it is clear that if these most regressive taxes had been part of the Government's election platform it would have been thrown out of office in no uncertain terms. Instead, in the last election campaign, it fraudulently fooled the electors by suggesting that the Labor Party would introduce a wealth tax-a totally untrue proposition-while all along it intended to introduce its own new sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether it is the Government's intention to introduce some new proposals before the electors of the Federal electorate of Lowe go the the polls . Perhaps we ought to have the honourable member for Mitchell campaigning there. I think he would win quite a few votes for us in that seat. How much longer will it take the Australian people to discover that this Government has remained in office for 6 1/2 years because of a blatant fraud and a deceit of the electorate ? While the Treasurer huffs and puffs about responsibilities he permits the growth of a tax avoidance industry which is now estimated to be worth $7,000m a year. It is not the low income earners who benefit from this most immoral of industries, but the rich and the powerful ruling elements of our society. The fact is that the Treasurer knows that low income earners are no friends of his Government. He can tax them with impunity but he will not act effectively to prevent high income earners from avoiding their legitimate taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point which has been made previously, but which it is important to emphasise, is the inflationary aspect of these new sales taxes. It has been estimated that the consumer price index will rise by 1.1 per cent as a result of these taxes. Inflation, which has already reached double figures, will climb even higher. The increasing level of inflation is another example of the complete ineptitude of the Treasurer in handling the economy of this country. Of course, he is now blaming the international economic scene and the Reagan Government for our high inflation level and our high interest rates. What hyprocrisy this is when it is quite clear that he intends to recommend the acceptance of the deregulation proposals in the report by the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, which will bind us even closer to the ravenous maw of the international money market. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is true that we cannot avoid the effects of world-wide economic trends it is not true to say that lower and moderate income earners cannot be protected from the direct effect of the harsh monetarist policies of Professor Milton Friedman. </PARA>
<PARA> An extension of sales taxes will only serve to increase the harshness of inflation and high interest rates. What is needed is a complete restructuring of the taxation system which will ensure that those Australians who can afford to pay both indirect and direct taxes are made liable for those taxes. These are the people the honourable member for Mitchell knows so well. They can afford to pay these taxes but not the lower income earners of our society. Low and moderate income earners must be relieved of the higher rates of personal taxes and direct taxes on the necessities of life. Honourable members on the Government side of this House keep asking: 'If those taxes are not imposed, where is the Goverment revenue coming from?' I heard the Minister who was previously sitting at the table saying just that to the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child). Surely the answer is obvious and it ought to have been obvious to him. If the Government was really prepared to crack down on tax avoiders in 1982-83 it could obtain three times as much revenue as $330m which is the full year amount of the 2 1/2 per cent sales taxes provision contained in the Bills before us. I support the rejection of these most iniquitous of bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate before the House this evening is really about changing the incidence of taxation in Australia and changing the way in which the tax burden falls upon different groups of people within our society. It is about creating circumstances in which the burden, which falls particularly on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, can be relieved. It is a debate on giving people a choice about how they will spend their money and how they will pay for the services that they and the rest of the community demand. Despite the fact that total tax in Australia is a lower proportion of gross domestic product than taxation in all the countries that we regard as our major trading partners, except Japan, it is still true that taxation is an issue in Australia. The marginal rates of tax are obviously rising as earnings rise. As it was made clear in Question Time this morning, a significantly greater proportion of the work force, of wage and salary earners, will be paying tax at the 46 per cent rate than there was when those scales were introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously there is a cry for relief. It is true to say that there are cries for relief coming to the Government from all sides-from the media, the Opposition and different groups within the community. It is understandable that that should be so because there is no doubt that the present level of income taxation is biting harder than it has done in earlier times. However, there are no offers of expenditure cuts or of savings which come with those clamours for relief in taxation. The only option that really faces the Government is an option to change the mix of taxation. I refer to a change in the mix that would allow significant numbers of people to pay tax at a lower marginal rate and to allow all to have a greater choice in deciding whether to pay indirect taxes or direct taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued by many honourable members who have spoken in this debate and on this issue that the change in the mix of taxation to increase the amount of revenue that comes from indirect taxes as opposed to direct taxes is regressive. But it has been argued quite competently by my colleague the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) earlier this evening, as well as by my colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) on earlier occasions , that it is not necessarily regressive, that people obviously consume and, therefore, pay indirect tax, according to their means-that not everyone buys the cheapest or the most expensive pair of shoes; that not everyone buys the cheapest or the most expensive suit. </PARA>

<PARA> What the Australian Democrats, and the Opposition in this place, are seeking to do is to stop this reform. What they are really about is to take away the choice that people are being offered under this legislation as to how they will pay their taxation. This reform, this chance which is being offered to the Australian people to have a better mix of taxation, to take pressure off the amount of money which must be collected at present by way of direct taxation and to increase the amount being collected by way of indirect taxation is being frustrated by the action of the Australian Democrats and the Labor Opposition in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to look at what those parties are really about and who they think they are protecting. They are not really protecting the people that they say they are protecting, because those people will pay income tax at continually higher rates. That will be so because the opportunity for reform of the income taxation system is being frustrated by the actions of the Opposition. The continuation of taxation at unnecessarily high levels is obviously the result of such action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has made it clear that, in a full year, about $330m will be denied the Government as a result of these Bills not being passed by the Parliament. That is a significant amount, the extent of which makes it more difficult for the Government to take the sort of steps that it would want to take in regard to taxation policy and to achieve the sort of reforms that everyone wants achieved. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI7">Mr LUSHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member refers piously to tax avoidance. It has been said on so many occasions that it is almost trite; this Government has moved more in the area of tax avoidance than has any other government since Federation . Certainly, the Labor Government of 1973-75 was notorious for its ignorance of tax avoidance and its lack of action in that area. It took absolutely no action at all. The present Government has proceeded to pursue tax avoiders with great vigour-something for which I think the Treasurer must take great credit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As part of the overall question of taxation and the change in the mix, we find ourselves inevitably in a debate about the management of the economy, the options that we, as a Government, are pursuing and the choices that an alternative government might make. We are putting firm alternatives to the people. We are saying that we would like to change the mix in taxation, would like to provide alternatives in the whole way in which people provide the funds that the economy needs to provide the sorts of services that they as taxpayers demand and for which they have to pay taxes if they are to receive them. </PARA>
<PARA> However, despite the fact that newspapers and the Opposition on opening days of Parliament grasp at all the bad news and seek to make enormous capital out of some of its elements-I do not deny that the news is less good than one would like it to be-the question of economic management and performance in Australia must be kept in perspective. The fact that in the last couple of weeks there have been some areas in which the figures have been soft does not mean that the deluge is upon us, that we are faced with economic ruin, or that the policies of the Fraser-Anthony Government have failed. It is a hiccup, perhaps, in a long, strong and steady economic performance which has brought this economy to a stage at which those sorts of things can be handled as we progress. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for that comment. In this country we are experiencing growth. That is something that is not being experienced in other economies around the world. In the six months to September, the growth in gross domestic product in Australia was 3.6 per cent. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is predicting a growth of 3 per cent for the current year, as against the OECD average of slightly above one per cent; so in growth terms Australia is performing three times better than the OECD average .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia investment is strong. People are confident. That does not indicate that the people who are making investment decisions are frightened off by the sort of horrible predictions coming from the Labor Party and from some media commentators. New fixed capital expenditure is expected to be up by 25 per cent- a quarter-on the figure for the last financial year. That is on top of what everyone realises was an incredibly high new capital expenditure figure for last year. At 11.3 per cent for the calendar year just ended inflation, although high , is still very favourable compared with the OECD average figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Consumption in Australia is still extraordinarily strong. Real household disposable income after tax rose by nearly $3 billion in 1980-81. Motor vehicle sales were 6 per cent higher in December than they were in that month in the previous year. In the quarter to Christmas, retail sales were 13 per cent higher than they were in the previous year. In comparison, in the United States average spending power was 3.6 per cent lower in 1981 than it was in 1980. It is unarguable that Australia is going from strength to strength. Unemployment of 6. 4 per cent in January 1982 is still slightly lower than it was last January. The average unemployment figure for 1981 was 5.7 per cent, whereas in 1978, 1979 and 1980 the average for each year was comfortably over 6 per cent. Again, on international comparisons, Australia is still performing relatively well. At the moment the United States unemployment level is around 8 1/2 per cent. Great Britain, as everybody knows, has tragic unemployment levels of over 3 million people or around 10 per cent of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is performing well. What people need to understand is that if we want to make comparisons with the previous year or with three years ago things may not be as good as we would like them to be, but if we make comparisons with the rest of the world, with countries with which we trade and with which we compare ourselves, we are performing extraordinarily well. The money supply announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the Budget is still broadly on target. What we must also take into consideration when we discuss the sorts of policies that the Government is putting before the Parliament is that there are significant external factors. The Treasurer said yesterday that if the United States continues to run deficits of the order of $100 billion, obviously there must be impacts on other economies and related economies. There is undeniable stagnation in the world economy. That has an effect on trade. In Australia the effect on trade has been dramatic but I venture to suggest that even if the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) were Prime Minister or Minister for Trade and Resources he could not have improved upon the performance that we have experienced. </PARA>
<PARA> In the seven months to January, imports in Australia were up by 16 per cent whereas exports were down by 3 per cent. That is not as a result of policies of the Australian Government. It is as a result of stagnation in the world economy. The mining companies which are selling their products on world markets have all experienced disastrous periods. I will cite some of the figures that have been released in recent times. The profit of Mount Isa Mines Ltd went from $76m to a loss of $4m, the profit of Alcan Australia Ltd went from $19m down to $7, the profit of Comalco Ltd from $75m down to $28m, the profit of Western Mining Corporation Ltd from $33m down to $7m, the profit of Bougainville Copper Ltd from $92m to $29m and the profit of North Broken Hill Ltd from $19m to $9m. These are all companies which depend extraordinarily heavily on export markets and on world commodity prices for their revenues. With the fact that their revenues are being so adversely affected by the sort of world economy that is being experienced at the moment, it is no surprise that Australia's trade figures are down as they are, taken with the relatively flat performance in agricultural prices on export markets. The Australian farming community has to accept lower prices than might normally be accepted if the international economy were buoyant. Obviously, the management of the United States economy has a significant effect on that. It is a matter which is beyond the control of governments in countries of the size of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the effect on interest rates is as a result of overseas pressures. It is inevitable that Australia will be affected by consistent and high interest rates overseas. Again, Australia has performed relatively well. We must acknowledge that we are not an economic island. That is a fact. Interest rates have their effects in other areas and I acknowledge that in Australia at the moment housing is an area in which the performance is less than satisfactory. If the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr McVeigh) was not the Minister for Housing, I hate to think of the mess that things would be in. But it is obvious that a price has to be paid for excessive demands elsewhere in the economy, especially from the wages sector. If people make those sorts of demands, and if governments are to control money supplies in the way in which they do and which I acknowledge they must, it is obvious that there must be effects in other areas . Housing is one such area which is certainly feeling the effects. </PARA>
<PARA> The thesis which I put to the House tonight is that Australia is controlling well those areas which it can control. In those areas where international pressures bring forces into the Australian economy which are totally beyond our control, this economy has been strong enough to be able to resist the excesses that arise from those international pressures. There is still no question as to who will provide the best economic management of the Australian economy. It is the Liberal- National Country Party coalition. It is beyond dispute that this Government is providing the best economic management of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The wheel comes full circle back to the subject of taxation. I support strongly the sales tax measures before the House because they provide for a broadening of the income tax base. They provide the Government with the opportunity to be able to alter the mix that presently exists and which we all acknowledge falls too heavily on the burden of wage and salary earners. By denying the Government this legislation, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats are frustrating the cause of taxation reform in Australia. </PARA>

During the debate that has taken place today I have been wondering how on earth people could be supporting a sales tax which must be regressive in the economic situation in Australia today. After listening to the previous two Government speakers, I am realising that they are just so cut off from how ordinary people live. They do not understand the meaning of a little bit for shoes here, a little bit for a frock there and a bit more for food, and we will be paying more for food because of extra packaging costs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UD4">Mrs DARLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. All of this adds up and makes life very difficult for people on low incomes. Government members become so accustomed to not being on low incomes that they forget what effect the legislation will have. Government members suggest that to reject the sales tax Bills will reduce the Budget and therefore funds will not be available for some mysterious beneficial use. On past performance, this is not so. The report of the Asprey Taxation Review Committee in 1975 suggested that in the past there had been too much emphasis on personal taxation and recommended, as the previous speaker said, a shift to indirect taxation. However, the previous speaker did not tell the whole story or even read the full report. It contained the definite proviso that there should be a corresponding reduction in income tax in order to ensure that the lower income people were not hurt.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Some people just cannot cop it. The Australian Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research has conducted post Budget analyses of the Government's tax changes every year since 1975 and has found that the combined effects of the tax changes have consistently been to the advantage of the rich over the poor. This is so despite the protestations of the Government. What reason have we to feel there will be any change in the future? There is no reason at all particularly when we look at the specific effects of the sales tax increases and the fact that Government members resort to political jargon to cover up the fact that these are Bills dealing specifically with additional sales tax. They deal specifically with making people pay more money for wanting to educate their children by buying books. They will pay more money if they want to build or furnish a house. They will pay more money if they want to buy food because of packaging cost increases. This is legislation which stinks. There is no way around that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On behalf of ordinary and lower income earners with whom I still have close contact I am only thankful that at last the Australian Democrats are showing a little conscience and thinking of joining with us in the Senate to put a stop to what this morally deficient Government has been doing in trying to pass this legislation. The Government does not know what it is talking about when someone like the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) suggests that maybe we could give housing grants in place of food or clothing. Lower income people have not a hope in the world of getting a house. They have a very limited amount of money to spend every week. If the sales tax legislation is passed they just will not be able to manage that extra weekly amount to be able to live decently. The sort of attitude coming from the Government today is reflected in the Consumer Casebook newspaper report which is backed and put forward by Sir William Knox, Queensland Minister for Employment and Labour Relations and who is responsible for consumer affairs. This is a typical Liberal viewpoint. The article is headed 'A dozen ways to eat well for less money'. The Minister suggests that people who are on lower incomes should, for instance, befriend a farmer. The article reports:</PARA>
<PARA> A farmer can sell you over-ripe produce. A bargain basket of aging mushrooms can be sliced, sauteed in butter, frozen in ice-cube trays and stored for when needed. Too soft tomatoes are great for sauces. </PARA>
<PARA> It also suggests:</PARA>
<PARA> Plan one meatless day a week. </PARA>
<PARA> And</PARA>
<PARA> Cheaper bread: One or two day old bread can be bought from some hot bread kitchens for about half the price. </PARA>
<PARA>Ah, it is very funny if one is not on a lower income and having to cop that sort of advice from Government Ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member does not know what he is talking about. Leon Pearce of the Courier-Mail has also investigated the situation of many people in our society. In the 16 February edition of the paper, he asked: 'Is this what our old people really deserve?'. He then put an objective report of what is happening in our society today. He mentioned that only 42.8 per cent of widows own their own homes and more than 89 per cent of supporting parents do not own their own homes. The people who do not own their homes are on the sharpest edge of poverty. The Government offers them $8 a week rent allowance. Honourable members would be aware that $40 a week is the minimum for the most meagre accommodation. What concerns me is that these are people, not statistics; they are people living in our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Frank Cooke of the Pensioners League in Queensland stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The first thing you have to do when you go on the pension is to go on short rations. </PARA>
<PARA> It's easy, after a few days. You put off having lunch, you look for things to do. Late in the afternoon, you wait for tea. </PARA>
<PARA> By doing that, a pensioner can save up for something he really fancies, like a tin of salmon. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cooke said he had heard stories about little old ladies eking out their pensions with tinned dog or cat food but that he could not believe this. He is on the level in describing the way he lives. He cannot believe that this would happen. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Have you ever smelled that stuff? I can't stay in the room when someone opens a can. </PARA>
<PARA>It became a joke when extra sales tax on dog food was vaunted. People were writing in to ask: 'What right have pensioners and lower income people to have pets anyway?' The truth came out. I know it is fact that these pensioners are eating dog food to get their weekly meat supplement. These are the people who will be affected by the introduction of this infamous sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is not entirely whether a shift to indirect taxation is advisable. Is it advisable today? Is it advisable in 1982? Can any honourable member opposite honestly say that additional sales tax and additional financial burdens should be put on the shoulders of the people already bowed down trying to decide between expensive health insurance and expensive doctors fees, who are meeting the extra mortgage payments each week, trying to keep up with the 11 per cent inflation rate and looking at 20 per cent interest rates? I ask honourable members to be realistic. When honourable members consider average weekly earnings they must see that this tax is a burden for ordinary people. The Government should not be playing around with political jargon and Government members should not vote for regressive legislation to bring in such sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, this legislation is not only incompassionate but also reflects gross mismanagement. I believe that there are Government members and Government back benchers who would agree with that statement. They would agree with the terms of the Asprey report which suggested that sales tax increases should be brought in, as I said, only in conjunction with income tax reductions. There is no suggestion that there will be reductions or that there will be any growth under this Government in welfare payments. In these circumstances, I believe that we should not allow such legislation to pass through this chamber. I am aware how honourable members will be voting but I certainly am putting my faith and hope in the fact that in the Senate, the Democrats will join forces with the Labor Party and will reject legislation, the enactment of which would be bad for all of Australia. What is proposed in this legislation reflects on our privileged position in this chamber and our higher weekly incomes when compared with those people who have been given very raw deals by their elected government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Bill, which was the subject of a Government statement on 20 August 1981, was introduced on 22 October 1981. At the time the statement was issued we of the Opposition indicated that we favoured the sort of centre that was proposed to be established and we were anxious to talk about matters such as land reform, energy resources for developing countries and certainly assistance for student training in those countries. The Bill gives effect to the Government 's decision as announced on 20 August 1981. The function of the Centre is to mobilise and expand Australia's research capacity so as to assist developing countries in agricultural and related areas and to develop an expanded, better co-ordinated and more identifiable Australian effort aimed at achieving multinational self-sufficiency in developing countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The significant thing is that the Centre will not engage in any research activity. Basically it will contract out research work to bodies such as universities, State departments, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and private individuals and organisations. There will be a heavy accent, according to the Government, in involving scientists and institutions from developing countries. The support services for the Centre will be provided by the Australian Development Assistance Board. The Policy Advisory Council of the Centre will consist of 17 ministerially appointed members from universities, the CSIRO, State agricultural departments and the like. Pending the establishment of that Council, Sir John Crawford has agreed to act as chairman of an interim council. There will be a board of management of six members to conduct and control the affairs of the Centre. The Centre will have a director and about 10 professional staff and support services will be provided, as I said, by ADAB and also by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> We of the Opposition support this Bill but we have some reservations. We might note them in this fashion. We say the Bill will not do much, if anything, in key development areas such as the need for land reform. That was the subject of our comment at the time the statement was made on 20 August 1981. We want to make the point that Australia should be far more active in this area of land reform and we should perhaps make it a condition of receiving aid. These criticisms are relevant because in the statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) talked about the need for more efficient use of available land resources. The Bill contains provisions for a review of the Centre's operations after 10 years. We think that is too long a period, so we propose to move some amendments in the Committee stage. We think there should be a review at an earlier time. I think those amendments have already been circulated to honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> But we must mention some things which are pretty obvious to us when we look at the resources, for example, of ADAB. Those resources, as we are aware, are already very much strained because of the razor gang's deliberations. The resources of the Department of Foreign Affairs equally are strained and in fact the Department is now providing some administrative support for ADAB. Whilst institutional and organisational arrangements exist in theory, it appears very clear that in practice we would not have the capacity to do the work. The Minister has said that all research work will be contracted out. Given the facilities that we know exist at CSIRO and in other places this is a bit short sighted. Australia possibly could not undertake the research. The CSIRO and other Government instrumentalities have certainly built up their operations over a period and in the view of all Australians they employ some of the best brains in the country. It is important to give research work to them rather than contracting it out. It would build up their image, ability and incentive and the hope that they have a future and an expanding role, not a limited life or a contracting role. We find that the Government is anxious to cut scientific research programs and then introduces this counterbalance, which is quite extraordinary, of contracting work out to private enterprise the cost of which we submit will be significantly greater and I do not think the result will be as good. Certainly it will not be any better. We think they are worthwhile matters to mention at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter that we need to talk about generally is how we can go about aid from an Australian point of view. We of the Opposition have expressed our views on aid for developing countries. We support many of the concepts of the Brandt report. But we really should be taking some initiative. In Australia we have the opportunity to do that. We ought to be working towards what we in the Opposition call the reality. For example, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting last year dealt with the major issues of the so-called North-South Dialogue. Those issues involved matters which are pretty basic, that is, food, energy, trade and financial systems. One could say that some modest contribution was made at that conference. Also in October the Cancun Conference was held in Mexico. If one leaves out all the rhetoric, all the padding, all the publicity, all the bombast , it was a flop. It was a flop because President Reagan decided even before he went there that the United States would be unable to do anything in the four major areas where effort was needed. Just to give the balance again in the super -power situation, the Soviet Union did not even bother to answer an invitation to attend the Cancun Conference. So the United States went to the conference with a very closed mind and an equally tightly closed fist. We have the result that it does not share the Minister's perceptions of the need to help the poorer countries other than, of course, by selling them weapons which is the greatest business in the world today. While the United States has the doubtful distinction of selling the most, it is closely pursued by the Soviet Union as second in that field. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe efforts by countries such as ours are essential if we are to contribute to a more equit- able economic order. It is essential also because we have to look after the hungry in their millions. There is a need for land reform . The Minister makes the point that the world capita food production declined in 1980 for the second year running and that cereal stocks are at their lowest level for some years. We ought to have a look at some of the reasons. The Minister mentioned Australia's support for the world food program and for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation. Unfortunately, the opportunity to make a contribution to assist developing countries was not taken up by the Government. I suggest it was because Treasury advised that it should not do it. It was very shortsighted advice because the Government refused to back moves for an international food finance facility. That was a very serious mistake. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a more current and perhaps urgent omission in the Minister's statement . He referred to the urgent need for 'nutritionally adequate food supplies and effective food storage and distribution'. We should be very active in encouraging land reform in general and especially in the countries and the areas which will benefit from the research. Would it not be better, for example, if the United States could be persuaded to help El Salvador implement some reforms in the land holding system instead of sending in more arms which create more deaths? My experience in visiting a number of developing countries in which we have had aid projects is that whilst our research is helping them there is virtually no land reform. So all that is achieved perhaps, at the expense of improving the yield, is to give more wealth to the group that holds the land or controls the land. The poor who hold small tracts of land are gradually persuaded to leave and the big land owners then expand and buy more land. The peasant can stay on the land as a labourer. More often than not, he drifts to the city to live in slums and is exploited by those who own factories, the suggestion being that it is economic development to work in a factory for as little as $1 a day. In my view it would be far more effective to be on one's own land producing food, not only for oneself and the family but also for the neighbourhood. I think that ought to be the position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister spoke about 'more efficient use of available land resources'. I could not agree more, but what I am saying is that we must insist on this question of aid and that recipient governments make some effort at land reform. We should be looking at our research assistance to projects which make more equitable use of available land resources. Again, there is the question of co- ordination and regular review. The Minister identified a lack of co-ordination in our past programs. In addition to co-ordination, our aid program in general- this is relevant to this Centre-needs rigorous assessment. Some of our field and research programs need to be examined to see whether they are good or need to be modified. </PARA>
<PARA> I have expressed in the past reservations about our Program of Aid for Disabled People, in the southern Philippines. In the case of this Bill I note that both the need for the Centre itself, as well as its operations will be reviewed after 10 years. I think that is too long, particularly since it will be an independent statutory body. In our view there ought to be a review after six years in order to establish the effectiveness and efficiency of the Centre and in order to re- assess the basic priorities. Six years would enable Council members to have served two terms in office and thus be in a good position to review the work of the Centre and to decide whether its activities provided good value for the money that has been spent. </PARA>
<PARA> We propose to move in Committee the appropriate amendments to what is called the sunset clause, clause 43 of the Bill. We are going to suggest a term of eight years. In the supplementary clause we will be talking about the expiration of the six years. The Minister placed great emphasis on the role that the Australian Development Assistance Bureau will need to play. We note that this Centre will rely completely on ADAB for arrangements for academic training for scientists from developing countries. This is also to be the case with the extension programs and field programs to be conducted by the Centre. Again, I make the point that the razor gang cuts have slashed ADAB even further so as to hinder its ability to staff its headquarters and posts and to supervise the functions with which it is already charged. Furthermore, the Centre is to be located close to the Bureau. We would like to know where this would be because at present the Bureau is located in five separate locations throughout Canberra. We also note that the support services for the Centre will be provided by the appropriate sections within the Department of Foreign Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, as a result of the razor gang cuts that Department is at a point where it is struggling to perform some of the tasks expected of it, including the provision of administrative support for ADAB. The Department of Foreign Affairs will also have to look after the travel arrangements for the Centre as, no doubt, many trips will have to be made abroad by the Centre's staff and to Australia by scientists from the developing countries who will sit on the Council. In our view, Foreign Affairs staff will not be able to cope with this additional work load. </PARA>
<PARA> I have visited a number of overseas posts. Some of them are in the poorer countries where services are limited. All such posts were struggling to cope with less than adequate support services from the overburdened home department in Canberra. There will be a good deal of high level management for the Centre, having both a policy advisory board and a board of management. The Centre itself will have some high-priced help. The Director will be a person of 'outstanding ability'. His professional staff will be 'of such stature as to command respect among scientists in Australia and in developing countries'. How the Minister proposes to recruit and to train staff of such calibre with the current level of Public Service conditions of service is something that we cannot really understand. It appears that the Centre will be very top heavy as the administrative support to be provided by ADAB and Foreign Affairs is likely to be just a pack of cards. When we talk about the Policy Advisory Council I hope that there will be an opportunity for non-governmental organisations to have some representation on that Council, certainly an input to the Council to be able to reflect the valuable contribution which it already makes to our programs in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, while the concept of creating the Centre as a clearing house for requests for assistance from developing countries in agricultural development is an excellent one, the administrative arrangements seem to be very inadequate. I think that the Government's own misguided policies of practising false economies in important areas will undermine this project. I hope that this does not happen . I believe that aid management in Australia needs to be improved and streamlined but perhaps all that might happen with the creation of this Centre is another stillborn statutory body. It should not happen because we are in an area where we can have a very significant influence, which we already have; that is, the Pacific and the developing countries in the Pacific and also in the areas immediately to our north. I emphasise the need to get the best results from Australia's aid. I feel land reform will be the key in what I have said. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's initiative to establish the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research is one which I have great pleasure in supporting. For many years Australia, under various governments, has played a relatively leading role in the whole concept of international relief and assistance to developing countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a rich and, certainly agriculturally, a leading nation in the world, it is not unreasonable that we should in fact be trying to associate our aid programs wherever possible with those areas in which we are most technologically capable of assisting. In a sense this new proposal for the establishment of an Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research has some resemblance to an organisation in Canada known as the International Development Resources Centre. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two is that the Australian derivative is much more limited in its scope. For example clause 5 of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Bill provides that the functions of the Centre are to be:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to formulate the programs and policies with respect to agricultural research for either or both of the following purposes:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) identifying agricultural problems of developing countries;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) finding solutions to agricultural problems of developing countries;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to commission agricultural research by persons or institutions in Australia -</PARA>
<PARA>Meaning persons or institutions which will be able to make a contribution in that area-</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to communicate to persons and institutions the results of such agricultural research. </PARA>
<PARA>In my opinion the last requirement-namely, that to communicate with persons and institutions in those areas-will be one of the major areas in which this proposed new institution will be able to make a very significant contribution.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the major problems which have been emphasised in the United Nations for many years is the problem of technological transfer between the developed world and the underdeveloped world. Whilst this institution will have as its fundamental definition a rather restricted interpretation of 'agriculture'-I refer specifically to the definition in the Bill of 'agriculture', namely, 'such uses of land as are prescribed for the purposes of this definition'-I think a tremendous amount can be fitted within that context. However, on the first reading I am a little concerned that technology relevant to agriculture should also be something which is included within the terms of reference of the proposed Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. </PARA>
<PARA> My observations in West Africa last July and my experience as Australian representative on the Colombo Plan Council have led me to believe that one of the fundamental problems the developed world, especially the Commonwealth, may be facing is that whilst we are training as many people as we possibly can, often in fairly esoteric fields ostensibly so that they can return to their countries and make a contribution, often the reality is that there is not the infrastructure in those developing countries to enable those people usefully to employ the skills they have learned at not inconsiderable cost overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> That leads me to suggest, therefore, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) and the Government may be prepared to give consideration to another concept which I have developed as a result of my visit to Africa, namely, the establishment of an international Commonwealth university. The essence of that is that we want to get an arrangement by which there is maximum technological transfer at the minimum possible cost. One of the arguments people have often raised in the past when one has suggested the establishment of new organisations is that capital costs will be involved before such organisations will become functional. However, the establishment of a Commonwealth university should involve minimum capital costs because all the existing facilities in universities and centres of expertise already in various developed and developing Commonwealth countries would be utilised. The basic premise we would work on would be this: Let us use Africa as a example. In Commonwealth countries in Africa there are at least five major universities. Some or all of the faculties in those various universities, in terms of the region at least, already have reached a stage of international acceptability. However, for various reasons-usually financial and the availability of technological research and, of course, personnel-they have not yet reached the stage at which they are able to transfer foreign knowledge and technological capacity into effective operational techniques which can be employed in their own countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I give one clear example of that: At one university I visited in West Africa they were trying to develop a solar oven. The reason they wanted one was quite clear: For many generations the villagers had been systematically denuding the land of forests. The only power those people had was derived from either wood or charcoal. Therefore, the only way in which they could save what was left of the forest land was to introduce a new sort of technology. They had only two alternatives: Either they imported liquefied petroleum gas-type ovens, which would involve a foreign exchange problem, in addition to diesel, distillate and so forth, or alternatively they employed the cheapest source of power, namely, the sun. Their logical interpretation of the situation was absolutely impeccable . They decided that they must invent a cheap form of solar oven which could be utilised locally. The fact is that solar ovens have been known in many Western countries for at least the past 40 years. I found it depressing to see young students, in a sense, trying to re-invent the wheel. When I saw their library I realised that technological research material from other countries was to a large degree forbidden to those people. Their libraries either did not have the capacity to accept that material or had not linked up with other institutions of learning, universities and so forth in countries throughout the Commonwealth and elsewhere. That is just one simple, isolated example. </PARA>
<PARA> In another country I visited, I found that 50 per cent of the children died before reaching the age of five years. The reason is clear: The level of hygiene there is extremely poor; by our standards, medical attention is almost non- existent; and, of course, their dietary habits leave much to be desired. Therefore, the whole area of community medicine is one in which many countries in Africa desperately need assistance. The traditional way in which we have handled those sorts of problems is, firstly, to hope that the missions will solve the problems for us-frankly, they like everybody else have very limited resources-and, secondly, it seems, to take people out of their environment for training, presuming that they will all go back to their original environment and do a great job there. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple and sad reality is that much of the training which has been given in other countries is not necessarily relevant to the environment in which those people are expected to work. Also, often those people, having gained what they regard as very acceptable international qualifications, have a very deep-seated reluctance to go back home. Time after time those who have gone home have been put behind desks and have not been given an opportunity to utilise the skills they have gained at considerable inconvenience and cost to both the home government and the host government. Therefore, the concept of a Commonwealth university is based simply on the belief that if we can bring together the most capable people in the developing countries and inject a high level of skill and information and a capacity to train in that environment-a wide range of students , both undergraduates and more specifically graduates-with a specific intention to encourage them to take foreign technology and foreign ideas and apply them to the environment to which those people will return we will be making a massive step forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I must emphasise that the whole concept is based on using existing facilities, existing university buildings and existing university faculties. The other point which must be emphasised is that this is not a concept directed at theoreticians . It is not a concept directed at developing more graduates in the arts, the pure sciences and so forth. It is directed specifically at encouraging development in technological research and the application of technology. As I said earlier, at the United Nations for many years resolution after resolution has been passed urging the developed world to assist the developing countries by the transfer of technology. From my observations that simply is not taking place . Certainly it is not taking place in a manner which enables effective application by those countries. We cannot go on indefinitely with a situation in which the developed world is drawing further and further ahead of the developing world. Especially since the late 1970s, with the explosion in oil prices, we have seen in every one of those countries a chronic shortage of foreign exchange and a fundamental inability to import, at their cost, technology. It is in this sort of area that there is a crying need for us to adopt a new approach and to see what we can do to solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister in his first reading speech on this Bill made the observation that , as Australia is in the forefront of agricultural research, we have a binding obligation to make our knowledge available to less fortunate countries. He made the observation also that food security remains one of the most fundamental deficiencies of mankind. Whilst some people might argue, as Adam Smith undoubtedly would, that it is more appropriate that countries with certain physical, environmental and scientific advantages should be encouraged to develop food resources for the rest of the world, as I mentioned earlier the reality is that it is now too expensive for such countries to use scarce foreign exchange in buying food from other countries, no matter how cheap it is and irrespective of the terms under which that food is supplied. That is because in most cases those countries are running massive deficits. In terms of World Bank requirements, most of them are in considerable debt. This is because they need energy to keep the basic level of their economies moving. Unfortunately, those economies are steadily falling further and further behind. </PARA>
<PARA> While one can say that this is a situation in which we in the rich countries can simply sit by, shrug our shoulders and say that it is good luck for us that we live where we do, one Foreign Minister in West Africa made the observation to me that they were no longer in a situation where they were simply able to negotiate what the rich world was prepared to give them but were now in a situation where they were fighting for their very survival. As I said, when we have situations in some of those countries where 50 per cent of children below the age of five years die because they do not have the very basic requirements for life, much less for civilised life, it is quite obvious that a rich country, such as Australia, has a very pronounced role to play. Therefore I have great pleasure in supporting the Government's initiative because I am sure that the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research will be but one of the mechanisms by which it will be possible to bring together the level of technological knowledge we have in Australia, specifically relevant to agriculture, and ensure that the knowledge, expertise and experience of the specialists and the scientists in this country are able to be utilised to help these other societies. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope also that the private sector will be given the opportunity equally to make a contribution. Two years ago I visited the Jordanian side of the Jordan Valley and saw an Australian company which had done extremely well in the introduction of modern Australian-made technology in irrigation. I recall that in Libya a similar operation is in place-I understand it is funded by the South Australian Government-to encourage the growing of cereal crops in the desert, again using sophisticated means of irrigation. This capacity which Australia has in dry land farming is in a sense unique; possibly the only other country comparable with us is Israel. Because of these advantages, which have been developed essentially by the private sector with the co-operation of universities and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, I would hope that Australian companies which win contracts overseas, such as the ones in Jordan and Libya, will be encouraged to develop in those societies techniques which can be applied elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian private sector organisations are also involved in animal breeding and development on the African continent. In both Ghana and Nigeria large tracts of land have been opened up in recent years, have been fenced, often using Austrlian fencing equipment, which is excellent, and have been stocked with cattle and provided with personnel, again from Australia. The techniques they are applying in those countries are ones developed in Australia to suit the requirements of the environment. However, the trouble is that there is no direct linkage between the enormous bank of expertise which has been built up by those people and the continuation of that expertise in the event of their ultimate departure. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the Commonwealth should get a university type of structure going whereby Australian personnel working in those countries will be able to funnel their expertise back into the ACIAR and also will have the opportunity in the countries where the problem actually occurs, to link it in directly with research centres and provide training opportunities for local inhabitants. The biggest problem we have had in all of these countries is that the expert we send in, who does a good job, is ultimately replaced by an indigenous person and the standard falls. There are many reasons for this and I do not wish to go into them on this occasion. That demonstrates the fundamental problem that the information one obtains in a particular social system in a particular society is not necessarily transmitted in a short time to other societies. </PARA>
<PARA> We need a middle road, where that information can be brought together and utilised, where it can be applied on the ground. Perhaps over a period of years it might be possible to build up steadily a much larger cadre of people who are trained and motivated to get on and perform a standard of operation at least comparable to what was done by the foreign experts when they were there. Ultimately these countries must be managed by their own citizens. That is the goal to which we must adhere in all our foreign aid policies. It is important to find the right people to do the work and also to ensure ourselves that we have a free flow of information at the technological level which will be to the best advantage of all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the Centre for International Agricultural Research will have a very real role to play in the communication to people and to countries' institutions the results of such agricultural research. In addition to that, as I said, it will be commissioning research in Australia and overseas directed at institutions which need to have specific things done. One of the problems we have had in the area of foreign aid is that we have always dealt on a government to government basis and regrettably, as we all know, decisions are often made for political reasons which are not necessarily economically or socially justified by the requirements of the region. By working through this organisation on a bilateral basis it will be possible to deal with individuals and institutions outside the framework of government and therefore we will be able to make a much deeper penetration and have much more influence in the societies that surround us-in Africa, the Pacific, South East Asia and ultimately, one hopes, Latin America-where there is so much more to be done if we are to build a world in which it can truly be said that all men were born equal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all members of this House realise, the Australian aid effort under the Fraser Government has remarkably little to commend it. Indeed, the record on aid has been appalling, even on the Government 's own statistics. Budget Paper No. 8 indicates that in the period since 1975 there has been a very drastic rundown in the official development assistance to the less developed countries-from 0.65 per cent of the gross national product in 1975 to 0.48 per cent in 1980. In those circumstances this legislation is unusual, but the Opposition is delighted to commend the Government on its initiative, for two reasons. First of all, the idea is commendable but, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) has pointed out, we have some grave reservations about the adminsitrative arrangements. Secondly, the Government at long last is carrying out one of the recommendations on the Committee on Australia's Relations with the Third World. It is a great pity that the Government has not seen fit to implement other recommendations of this Committee's report. I will return to some of those a little later. On page 190 of the report, the Harries Committee stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Consideration should be given to making greater use of Australia's agricultural expertise to help Third World countries increase food production. In particular, additional agricultural research could be conducted in Australia specifically directed at overcoming agricultural problems in developing countries. This might be funded by a separate appropriation in the aid budget. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Bill implements that recommendation. It concerns the whole of the very complex concept of food aid. One could be forgiven for expressing some scepticism about the provision of food aid. It is certainly a very useful way of disposing of the very large surpluses often created as a result of government subsidies and programs at the expense of the taxpayer, and also administratively it is an easy form of aid giving. However, we should realise that the impact on both the donor and the recipient can be very complex. A very sensible discussion of the issues of food aid is contained in a report, regrettably neglected, of the Australian Auditor- General's Office, which carried out an efficiency audit of the administration of the bilateral overseas aid program of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. That report points out some of the very complex considerations that should be taken into account in the administration of any food aid program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even with the reservations about the nature of food programs it is quite clear that food aid is certainly vital to stave off famine. It is also necessary to understand that a continuing dependence on food aid by any of the recipient countries can completely distort local production and disadvantage local producers leading to a chronic inability to meet national requirements. We therefore have to strike a balance between short-term relief of hunger and the longer term aim of helping to increase the amount of agricultural products and production in developing countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) in his second reading speech acknowledged that Australia, in its past performance, had acted on ad hoc requests and lacked a systematic approach to the question of food aid. This is rather remarkable when one considers that in this financial year a very significant amount of money has been placed against the food aid budget. In fact , the amount allocated for that item is of the order of $78m. So it is quite obvious that there is a need for a more systematic approach. There certainly is a need that the requests not be handled on the ad hoc basis which has been the practice hitherto. We in the Opposition trust that the new Agricultural Research Centre will provide the basis for developing a more thoughtful and useful project in our aid program in the field of food and nutrition. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reading speech and the Bill before us have an interesting feature. In clauses 43 and 44 of the Bill we have one of the early introductions into Australian legislation of sunset provisions, that is, that unless legislative action is taken after a certain time the Act will expire. It is indicated in clause 44 that there will be a review after the tenth year of operation and that unless legislative action is taken the Act will expire in 12 year's time. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has already indicated our concern that this period appears to be too long. We will be moving an amendment to the Bill in the Committee stage. I think 12 years is excessive but we will go into those arguments in the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Minister may have read of some of the experiences in the United States of America. I suppose one of the curious anomalies is that when the sunset provisions are waning in their popularity in the United States-they started in 1975 in the State of Colarado-the Australian Government is just beginning to learn about them and applying them. In the United States there has been a movement away from the sunset provisions because it was found that the administrative arrangements were such that the provisions became only a bureaucratic answer to a bureaucratic problem. I think there are particular advantages if this legislature is given a role of play in the reveiw. As I understand the arrangement so far the review would be carried out within the bureaucracy and this Parliament would not have an opportunity to make its input into the review of an organisation of a centre that the legislation of this Parliament would create. I believe that a number of very appropriate committees of this Parliament could carry out such a review. There is the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and, of course, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. I hope the sunset provisions that have been incorporated in this legislation will find a place and that this Parliament will play a role-I believe a rightful role-in the review. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that the Government in introducing this legislation had acted on a recommendation of the report of the Committee on Australia's Relations with the Third World which was issued in 1979. This legislation, with its significance for bilateral relations, particularly in the form of project aid, brings to mind a continuing concern of mine about the form of aid that we apply to Papua New Guinea. I want to point out that the aid to Papua New Guinea is provided not on a basis of project assistance but on budgetary support. This budgetary support is providing funds directly into the recurrent expenditure of Papua New Guinea where the Australian side of the aid program has no opportunity for evaluation and no opportunity to see how effectively that aid is being spent . In fact, I think the whole notion of a budgetary support program as distinct from what is implicit in this Bill is counter-productive. The report of the World Bank on Papua New Guinea in 1977 issued a warning. In that warning it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Rather than continuing to base them on Australian standards, Papua New Guinea needs to bring its expectations, living standards, and levels of public and private costs into a better relation to what it will be able to sustain from its own resources. Nowhere does this need show up more than in the public sector; nearly half of Papua New Guinea's present government costs are supportable only because Australia is willing to pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA>That warning has not been heeded. I suppose that one of the reasons it has not been heeded is this notion of providing budget support programs as distinct from the type of informed bilateral projects that would be incorporated under the terms of this Bill. We have only to look at some of the criticisms of the Bank of Papua New Guinea. This is not Australians criticising the performances of the Papua New Guinean Government but the Bank of Papua New Guinea which strongly criticised what it described as the questionable level of spending of the Papua New Guinea Government. It instanced extravagance on overseas visits, the ministerial fleet of cars and a new executive jet. In commenting on the 19 provisional governments the bank observed that they devoted too large a portion of income to merely governing and too little to providing services to the people . </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very serious criticism of part of our aid program. What I am trying to get through to the Minister-the Minister knows that I have raised this matter many times before-is that the very basis of the program that is coming out in this Bill, which is to have a more informed and a more enlightened approach to project aid, is the type of program we should be developing for Papua New Guinea . I believe the continuation of Australian aid in the form of budget support-we are talking about a very sizable amount of money, $254m -has encouraged extravagant expenditure which, as I pointed out from the Bank of Papua New Guinea report, has not resulted in the desired benefits going to the bulk of the Australian people. It is just lumped into recurrent expenditure in a budget. There is no identification of Australian aid and no evaluation. This covers 45 per cent of Australia's total aid program. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not something we have thought up just recently. In April 1973, when I still had the responsibilities for Papua New Guinea on behalf of this Parliament , I pointed out that what we should have been developing was a program of project aid and that we should be moving away from the form of budget supplementation. Exactly six years later the report on the Third World echoed precisely those views then stated. Page 189 of the report on the Third World states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia should give progressively less emphasis in its overall program to aid for general budget support and more to project-type aid. </PARA>
<PARA>Dealing specifically with Papua New Guinea, the Committee neatly paraphrased the views that I had expressed back in 1973, in these words:</PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of the annual aid budget directed at Papua New Guinea should continue to be reduced as quickly as practicable. The budget support grant component should be complemented by project aid and technical assistance, so as to place Papua New Guinea on a less dissimilar footing to that of other recipients. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the Government has not sought to implement the recommendations of that report, but I rather hope that when programs such as are envisaged in the legislation before us are fully implemented, there will be a basis upon which Australia can develop a bilateral project relationship with Papua New Guinea, so that the Australian taxpayer, and after all the $254m comes from him, will feel more confident that the money that he is required to pay to the Government is being used in projects that are identifiable, that can be evaluated and, in fact , can be seen to make a contribution to the aid program. I do not believe that the present form in which aid is given to Papua New Guinea does that. I do not think that it enables the Australian taxpayer to see that effective use is made of the money that he makes available to the Government. Nor do I believe that it plays an effective part in the welfare of the people of Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps this Bill is the swallow that will make the summer. I hope that the thinking behind it, the reasons for its presentation, will also be reasons that may well lie behind a recasting of our aid program to Papua New Guinea-a recasting that will move it away from what I regard as being a highly inefficient Budget support program to a project aid type of program tailored to meet the needs of the people of Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> We commend the Bill to the House. We see some difficulties, in the details that have already been made available to us concerning the administrative structure, particularly as to how the Centre will operate, but we commend the Government for the implementation of the recommendation of the Third World report that was issued back in 1979. We will introduce the amendments concerning the timing for the sunset provisions at the Committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">.-Very briefly, I would like to say something along the lines of what the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison) has just said and make a few additional points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes this Bill, albeit with one or two small reservations, in the hope that it is an indication of things to come in government policy on the food aid question and on the co-ordination of Australian overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA> Having just returned from a Labor Party and parliamentary delegation to the Middle East, for me two things stood out from our time there which are of direct relevance to this Bill. The first was how immensely valuable Australian agricultural techniques and experience are in the whole Middle East. The second was how much Australia's own programs of agricultural research and assistance in the Middle East, and in Middle East-related studies here, are in need of central co-ordination, in which the proposed Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research should assist, but in respect of which it will not prove sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> When we were in Iraq we took the opportunity to visit two Australian projects, one near the town of Mosul and the other close to the Kurdish area of Iraq in Arbil. The project near Mosul is operated by the West Australian Government's Department of Agriculture. The other is operated by the South Australian Government's Department of Agriculture. I understand that similar projects, again under State government auspices, operate in Jordan, Libya and the Sudan. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be wrong of me to fail to mention what an excellent image of Australia the participants in these projects convey. They are accommodating and courageous people who are sensitive to local feelings and needs and they operate in some degree of danger. The Iraqi Government was imensely impressed by the fact that when the war with Iran broke out, unlike a large number of aid personnel from other countries who immediately left, the Australians stayed behind and were prepared to tough it out. The people in the project described for me how they watched the Iranian bombers fly overhead. In fact, their farm became a focal point for the personnel on a number of other projects who were being pulled back from border areas. They all congregated in the West Australian project area. The South Australian project continues to operate in a situation of some danger. In fact, recently, several personnel from the project immediately adjacent, which is run by the Australians, were kidnapped, held by Kurdish rebels for a few months and have only just been released. That was a cause of some nervousness at the Australian project, but was not sufficient cause for them to quit their activities. I understand that, to a considerable degree, they are satisfied with the security that is provided by the Iraqi Government. Nevertheless, they can never be entirely certain and therefore deserve praise for staying on. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, the projects are establishing examples of effective crop rotation, using legumes, which are also helpful in animal husbandry. The land on which the project in Iraq is being developed is among the oldest agricultural land in the world. In fact, it is probably the first area in which wheat was grown. The land is very good; it is just over-utilised. The quality of the land in the Middle East varies widely but it is all of a type that is within the experience of Australian farmers and agricultural scientists and therefore likely to be the subject of considerable interest to the institute that is to be established under this legislation-a fact of which a large number of Middle Eastern states are now becoming very aware. </PARA>
<PARA> These states are now taking an interest in what Australia and Australian research institutions have to offer. In their case, it is not a question of aid. They are prepared and able to pay for the advice that they need, but it is useful to contemplate, as we consider this Bill, some of the political and economic considerations that underpin the interest of some of the under- developed countries in the Middle East in the type of research that this new institute will co-ordinate. In their interest, it contains some positive aspects . Also, in their interest, it contains some dangers to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> There is throughout the Middle East an obsession with food security, defined as self-sufficiency. This is producing policies which one might well argue are irrational and ought not to be encouraged. When we were in Saudi Arabia, for example, we were informed by the Minister for Agriculture that they were currently subsidising wheat production, in order to achieve self-sufficiency, at five times the average world price. It would be far more sensible for the Saudis , for example, to spend that money in upgrading the capacity of the Sudanese to produce precisely the same sorts of crops. But such is the concern about food security that even in an area where there has been a certain amount of co- ordinated activity to this point, in many cases countries are reluctant to engage in rational distribution or specialisation. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is the politics of food which is causing this type of decision to be made. It was interesting to note, when we interviewed him, the views of Dr Abdul Rahman al Sheikh, the Saudi Arabian Minister for Agriculture, on the question of the recent grain embargo on the Soviet Union. The Saudis are not well known for their love of the Soviet Union or their appreciation of Soviet foreign policy. However, he argued for Saudi self-sufficiency for a number of reasons. An important one was that countries should not permit themselves to be the object of political blackmail by being deficient in an essential item. He was not himself condemning the notion that one ought to use food politically. I do not think that anyone who had participated in an oil embargo would consider that he had the right to do that. However, he noted the point and having noted it, the lesson he drew from it was that Saudi Arabia needed to establish self- sufficiency. That is a calculation that we ought not to encourage, but it has been associated with the type of discussion which has led to the establishment of research institutes such as this internationally. This stemmed directly from the circumstances in which the food issue was brought onto the international agenda in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA> Whereas in 1971 the international community had established the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research, it was an initiative by Henry Kissinger, in particular, in 1974 which provoked the sustained interest of the international community in the food question. </PARA>
<PARA> Henry Kissinger is a complex man. In his counter attack on the philosophy and policy behind the 1973-74 oil embargo he initiated through the United States Administration of the time a world food conference which met in Rome for the first time in November 1974. In the course of his speech to the conference he made clear the increasing vulnerability of the Third World to the vagaries of the major food producers. He emphasised how necessary it was that the world producers and consumers look at this matter collectively and out of the context of the seizing of unilateral advantage. He was arguing the same point on oil production in another forum. </PARA>
<PARA> His speech was seen by the Arabs as partly menacing and partly a genuine effort to deal with the growing problem. At that conference, Kissinger quoted an Egyptian official of the conference, Sayed A. Marai, to establish the extent of the feed production problem of the developing countries. He estimated that the then rate of growth in production of 2 1/2 per cent per annum would leave a gap by 1985 of 85 million tons in Third World production as opposed to Third World needs from a situation where the gap was 25 million tons in 1974. The gap was right on target. It is now over 60 million tons despite resolutions of that 1974 conference to undertake programs of research and development for the Third World that would ensure growth rates, it was hoped, of 4 per cent per annum. The most serious situation is in Africa where about 10 per cent less food is produced per person now than there was at that time. The problem is also general, and it is a problem that the food research institute is supposed to deal with. The point is that, despite the recognition of the problem and recognition of the need to improve production in the Third World and distribution from the producers, very little has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned recognition of potential production of the Third World. Probably about a 30 per cent expansion of productive land in the Third World is possible, and greatly increased output from land now under production is also possible. The political impediments to this in the Third World are immense and it is beyond our capacity and the capacity of the research institute to do anything. The technical impediments, however, are something which, I hope, we can overcome , and this legislation will, to some degree, assist. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset I referred to the Middle East, as opposed to the whole Third World, and I shall now return to that aspect. There are states in the Middle East which can buy all the technical expertise we have, and then some. They have already offered large sums of money for Australian research and are quickly off the mark in using Australian expertise on the spot. Libya has been a case in point on both counts. I understand several universities have dovetailed already several research projects on the basis of Libyan Government initiatives or Libyan programs. These are not projects which should be spurned but they create two important problems that this Government and this research institute will need to think about particularly as the institute will be capable of receiving private funds as well as government funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The first problem is whether, in reality, our technical advice will go to those who can pay for it. I know this is not the Government's intention but in financially straitened circumstances the temptation will be strong. The second and related point is that included in an assessment of upon whose behalf the research is to be done and assistance provided consideration must be given to reinforcing areas of possible success and not simply suiting the whims of those who can pay. If presented with a choice based on financial stringencies or limited physical resources, it would be better, for example, to aid Sudan's wheat production rather than to assist Saudi Arabia's program for the development of wheat self-sufficiency in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I made earlier was that our experience in the Middle East suggested that Australia very much needed central co-ordination in its food research and assistance program. The Government really has been very slow off the mark with this institute. The need for such institutes was agreed upon by the international community in 1971. By 1974 eight such institutes were in existence. We have had a minor involvement with a number of these and subsequently established ones. The result has been an ad hoc involvement by State governments without any sense of priority in the projects of the type I have discussed. Good things have been done by them that deserve repetition in areas of even greater need but the resources of the State governments will not run to projects in countries that cannot pay for them. Therefore, it is to be hoped that this institute will help to alleviate some of these problems of co- ordination. It cannot do it alone, however; it must be an act of deliberate government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall there needs to be a much more systematic analysis in this country of our international role as a major food supplier and exporter of food production expertise. There is some evidence from this proposal and the higher priority assigned food security issues in our aid programs in the last Budget that this has now been recognised. However, there is no indication that our capacities have been thoroughly integrated into our foreign policy. Part of our immaturity as a nation has been that we rarely sit down and analyse the international system from first principles. When we consider the indices of power for example we look at a military-strategic balance between the super-powers and judge our value by the contribution we make to that balance in its own narrowly defined terms. </PARA>
<PARA> We ignore, through ignorance, the significance of matters such as food exports and expertise. These are considered domestically in discussions of the balance of trade and payments and internationally in terms of the good things we do for others. Were we to properly analyse the indices of power in the international community we would recognise that not just oil but also food is a universally vital commodity in the hands of a few producers. This was quite evident during the oil boycott in 1973 when we were not a boycotted nation, and that was a decision on the part of the oil producers not unrelated to the fact that we were providing about 30 per cent of Egypt's food at the time. Others expect us to be consciously thinking about these issues, and this certainly was the case among the Arabs that we met. The real impact of our commitment to the Sinai peacekeeping force, for example, on Arab opinion and policy is not, as some fear , the possibilities of Arab trade boycotts of us but rather another plank in the platform of Arab suspicions of the West and consequent effects on the Arab assessment of the reliability of Australia as a supplier. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite evident that American policy on the issue of food and politics is such that reliance on American supplies is not compatible with the Arab sense of full national sovereignty. The more we are connected with United States policy on food boycotts and its policy generally, the more those suspicions are likely to be transferred to us. We should be aware that co-operation for food security is one of the main activities of the newly formed Gulf Co-operation Council, a council which the West has generally welcomed because of the security purposes it serves in co-ordinating a conservative Arab State Gulf response to possible radical activities in the Gulf area. It is interested also in food security and it is not worried about imports from the Soviet Union; it is worried about imports from the West. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why it is now absolutely essential that Australia comes to clear conclusions about how it intends to use its food production politically. Do we intend to be a reliable supplier in all circumstances except those in which an important importing country takes direct action to damage us, or are we to flirt with the political possibilities of food boycotts on a more ad hoc or intangible basis? If we choose the latter, we must be prepared to face the prospects of increasingly irrational decisions by Third World countries and other consumers as they attempt to evade the consequences of such actions. However, if we choose either course we must be prepared to sit down and work out coherent positions on questions of distribution and production of the food surplus nations and the possibilities for improved production in the Third World. I very much hope that this move by the Government will be a step in that direction, that it will be followed by an appropriate analysis by the Government of where exactly we stand as a result of our food production in the international community and that appropriate policies will be developed accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating issues related to a new term in international jargon-North-South issues. We are talking about the haves and the have nots and the way in which the needs of the lesser developed countries can be met and assisted by more developed countries. I refer to a statement issued from the Cancun Summit by the co-chairman, which said that they believed that the focus on relationships between North and South, particularly the serious economic problems confronting the international community, had been seen as one of the most serious challenges to be faced by the coming decade, ranking and linked with the maintenance of world peace as a priority for the attention of all governments. The upgrading and support of lesser developed countries in Asia, Africa, South America and the smaller island states is of significant importance to the whole world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I bring to the attention of the House the progress of thought in North-South relations and particularly the initiatives taken by the Brandt Commission, followed by the Harries report on Australia's relations with the Third World and dealt with here in Australia during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and later by the 22 heads of government meeting at Cancun. In fact the result of that process has been to change completely world attitudes, particularly the attitudes of the free world. It is an unfortunate fact of life that the Soviet Union does not get involved in any way in aid programs or support for less developed countries. The changes that were brought about I think were, first of all, an identification by the Brandt Commission of the real issues affecting the lesser developed countries. These were further refined at the meeting of 44 Commonwealth heads and leaders meeting in Melbourne. That meeting, in fact, was able to express in a most useful and forceful way those factors which were later pursued at Cancun. Leaders as diverse in outlook as Maurice Bishop and Miss Eugenia Charles, Mrs Gandhi and Mrs Thatcher presented views arising from a common and shared concern for the well being of lesser developed countries. In passing, I pay tribute-in mentioning these factors-to the work done at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street), who is at the table, and by the Australian Government in identifying the real areas of concern. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, the factors that really were identified by lesser developed countries were related, as other honourable members have mentioned, to food stocks and security of supply. But also identified were matters concerning trade areas-tariff and non tariff protection-agro industries and the development and further refinement of produce of basic agricultural industries, the programs of aid and support which have been the traditional approach for giving support to lesser developed countries, the processes of identifying and developing alternative energy resources, the conservation of energy in energy-scarce countries or countries that have not the wealth or capacity to purchase oil or gas. Other areas identified related to the development of tourism, the problems of the law of the sea and the problems of small island states in connection with the law of the sea, the development of trade arrangements with developed countries in those areas where developed countries do not supply certain goods themselves, protection against natural disaster and, of course, debt restructuring. In fact, all of these issues impinge more or less on the internal capacity of countries to produce food, further refine it and then export it. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote briefly again from the report of the summit at Cancun where the leaders of the 22 countries agreed:</PARA>
<PARA> Persistent and widespread manifestations of hunger are entirely incompatible with the level of development attained by the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA>The report mentioned also that the need for:</PARA>
<PARA> Sustained and long-term internal effort on the part of the developing countries to attain increasing self-sufficiency in food production is the basic element in obtaining a real answer to the problem of hunger. </PARA>
<PARA>It made further suggestions, pointed to programs geared to eradicate hunger by the year 2000 and task forces to identify further the needs of developing countries. I think the work at Cancun whilst wide and sweeping and done in a formal sense really reinforces the work traditionally carried out by the Commonwealth. Some people regard the Commonwealth as a decrepit and old institution. In fact, the work done under existing Commonwealth activities in agriculture and food security is substantial and covers a wide spectrum of countries. In fact, that program deals, in part, with the transfer and promotion of rural technologies, reduction of post harvest losses, preparation of agricultural projects for international funding, training of agricultural project managers and extension workers, management of irrigation projects and the development of livestock and fishery programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has been a willing and active participant exercising a great deal of expertise and input in all of these areas of concern. Australia has a unique capacity for the practical expression of aid and assistance. This is due to our expertise in agricultural production particularly in crop and animal management but also in agro industries. Whether it be in the development of root crops, new cash crops or fruit crops in island States or whether it be in arid farming techniques and the breeding of new wheat varieties of crops for central Africa, I think the expertise that Australia has has been very cleverly and carefully identified by the Government as being the major contribution that we can make to lesser developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted by the decision to establish an institute of this type drawing on the innate qualities, skills and expertise of Australians. I think we should be proud that we are going to establish a centre for a loose but sophisticated and skilled group of people to consult, confirm and draw on the expertise of lesser developing countries, identifying with their assistance programs to advance their food production and food security. I will conclude my remarks at this point but I would be remiss if I did not refer again to the work and initiatives taken by the Australian Government and particularly the work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA> (3) Clause 44, page 15, line 11, omit '12', substitute '8'. </PARA>
<PARA>If the amendments were carried, the legislation would work on the basis that there would be a review of the operations at the expiration of the sixth year. There would be a cessation of the operation of the Act-what is called a sunset clause by my colleague the honourable member for St George (Mr Morrison)-after eight years. We think that is important because there will be some review-I make the point quite succinctly because of the lateness of the hour-at the end of six years. We think that is important, for the reasons that I mentioned at the second reading stage, because, at the end of six years, some people will have served two terms on the advisory council. We are dealing with experts and highly skilled people. From the work being carried out, certainly we should know the position at the end of six years. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not consider that the review should be at the expiration of 10 years. We think that is far too long. Accordingly if the review, which we submit and urge be taken at that time-which is the appropriate time-is so undertaken it follows that the supplementary provision for cessation of operation of the Act would be reduced to eight years. At present the government plans a review after 10 years and a cessation of the Act at 12 years. The Opposition suggests the review at six years which I think is appropriate for the reasons that I have mentioned. The cessation of the Act could take place at eight years. I do not think that would create any hardship. In fact, because of the interest in the debate and what might be termed the bipartisan attitude to guarantee that we get an efficient result from the utilisation of these resources and the initiative. I am sure that the sooner we have the review the better. Certainly it would not be prohibitive in any way if it were at the end of six years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) relate, as he said, to the sunset provisions described in clauses 43 and 44 of the Bill. As far as I am aware, the only other piece of Australian legislation which has such a provision is the Human Rights Commission Act of 1981, which contains a section along similar lines. The Government is not prepared to accept these amendments, but it is not rejecting them merely because they have been moved by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provisions in the legislation relating to the term of office of the Director, the timing of the review and the expiration of the legislation at seven, 10 and 12 years respectively have been decided upon only after the most careful consideration. I would like to explain the reasons for these three periods in turn. After seeking expert advice, the Government considered the initial term of up to seven years as the most appropriate for two reasons. Firstly, reasonable tenure was considered to be essential to attract the very best people in the field to the position. Secondly, it will provide the first Director with sufficient time to establish the Centre and to have it in full operation, bearing in mind the long lead times involved in agricultural research , before his appointment expires. If there is a change of Director after seven years the next critical date is that relating to the review process, which under the legislation would be 10 years. This has been very deliberately chosen to give a new Director three years to make his mark on the organisation and to implement new policies before the review is undertaken. There would then be two years in which to conduct the review and, depending on the result, adequate time to prepare new legislation or, if the review came to the conclusion that the legislation should not be renewed, adequate time to wind down the activities of the Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be seen that all the periods chosen by the Government form part of a carefully related and integrated package. If, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is proposing in his amendment, the legislation runs for a period of eight years with a review after the sixth year, the Government believes strongly that the ability of the Centre to achieve the objectives as laid down in this legislation would be seriously impaired and that it would be difficult to attract a Director of the highest calibre. Under the timetable proposed by the Opposition's amendment, a Director appointed for seven years would find himself in the position of having his administration reviewed when nearing the end of his appointment. This in itself would not be too great a problem, but in conjunction with the proposed sunset period of eight years could lead to a ridiculous situation. The review itself would take some time, perhaps a year, and an incoming Director could be faced, depending on the recommendations of the review, with major changes to the operation of the Centre immediately after taking up his position or even closure during what could be his single year of office. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a further point in relation to this which must be taken into account to ensure the effective operation of the Centre. That is, agricultural research by its very nature is long term and in most cases one is looking at a lead time of 3 or 4 years from the commencement of a research project until results are obtained which can be translated into practical field action. The timetable proposed by the Opposition ignores this very important consideration. On the other hand the legislation as drafted has been specifically designed with this aspect very much in mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The observations made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) underline the advantages associated with the eight- year period. As the Minister pointed out, under the legislation the Director is to be appointed for seven years. He would therefore hold office during the period of the review and before another Director was appointed. I think the purpose of having sunset provisions-certainly this is the case in respect of sunset provisions which apply in the United States of America-is to ensure that organisations which are set up do not perpetuate themselves, do not develop their own dynamic. I think it is important that the first review of any organisation be undertaken reasonably early-taking on board the views expressed by the Minister that such a review should not take place too early-so that the rationale for having the organisation can be effectively assessed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that a perceived period of 12 years is a very long lifetime for any organisation. It may well be that after the first review subsequent sunset provisions could be written in for a longer dateline. But there are some difficulties, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) pointed out, in respect of administration which might appear to be quite unresolvable. We certainly would know the position at the end of six years. Therefore, I think that in placing a sunset provision in the legislation-as the Minister pointed out, this is only the second piece of Federal legislation into which such a provision has been introduced-we should not set a time scale too far into the future for making an assessment of how effective the organisation is going to be . </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation seeks to establish an experimental Centre. The program of the Centre has to be worked out. The Director who has set up and progressed with the organisation will be appointed for seven years. It seems to me that it would be appropriate for a review to take place while the original Director is still with the organisation. Our proposition still stands. This is, in terms of Australian legislation, experimental. I do not think we should put back the assessment of that experimentation for 12 years. It seems to me that the proposition that has been put forward by the Opposition is eminently sensible, particularly as it is only the second piece of sunset legislation in Australia and it applies to an organisation that will be very malleable in terms of implementation of the sunset provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to reiterate a point which I think is important. This Parliament, which is responsible for the passage of legislation, should also have some input and participate in some way in the assessment of the effectiveness of organisations that its legislation establishes. I hope the Minister will take on board the fact that this Parliament has a role to play, that the Parliament in enacting legislation should be able to be in a position to review the effectiveness of that legislation. This has always been a great difficulty for this Parliament. It is not so much a difficulty in the United States where sunset provisions have been operating since 1975. But it seems to me that if the Parliament is to play an effective role it should be in a position to review the effectiveness of the legislation that it passes. Despite the views that have been put forward by the Minister, we believe in the first instance that the time scale we have suggested for a review to be undertaken after six years and for the Centre to be disbanded after eight years if the legislation is not renewed is much more preferable to the longer time scale that the Government has suggested in the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Today I presented a petition relating to the provision of a commercial television licence in Alice Springs. I was pleased to receive the petition and to present it in this place. It represents hard work and efforts by a number of Alice Springs residents. The issue is topical in Alice Springs and has won widespread support in the community of central Australia. It has been widely covered in the media. To give some idea of local priority, a third of the entire population of Alice Springs signed the petition. Over 6,200 signatures were obtained. This was achieved largely through the work of one concerned citizen, Bob Freeman, whom I congratulate on his successful campaign. The petition was collected in four weeks between 11 November and 4 December 1981 with an estimated 90 hours of canvassing. To understand the enthusiasm and impetus engendered on this matter I would point out that at the end of the first week 3,000 signatures had been collected; by the end of the second week, 4,750; by the end of the third week, 5,750; and by the fourth week, 6,200.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Alice Springs is growing rapidly. It is the second largest town in the Northern Territory. A significant component of the local economy is tourism and tourists also have a keen interest in television when on holidays. I point out that the estimated population growth for Alice Springs this year is over 4 per cent. Currently the Australian Broadcasting Commission is servicing Alice Springs via the national service. There is no local content in Alice Springs programming. The news is from Darwin or interstate. The local news is only a five-minute segment voice service with the ABC logo on the screen. The ABC has given good service to Alice Springs and to the whole of the Northern Territory but commercial television will mean a choice in programs, increased local component in television programs and better sports coverage. We are seeing the expansion of services to more remote communities. However, in larger towns there is room for more local variety. </PARA>
<PARA> Alice Springs residents want commercial television which is demonstrated by the 6,200 signatures to this petition. Commercial television does not have to be huge. In fact, it would not be economically viable if it were on a capital city scale but the success of commercial television stations in smaller centres and in remote areas has already been demonstrated as has been shown by NTD Channel 8 in Darwin. The time arises when regional centres develop and can sustain commercial television services. The Government should encourage establishment of commercial broadcasters especially where commercial interests are servicing remote communities and complementing ABC services. I am aware of interest by several media groups in obtaining a commercial television licence. However, there are problems in the processing of applications at the moment. I understand that the Department of Communications has 700 applications before it and that under the present system it will take between 15 to 20 years to process them. That is a hopeless situation. I have been advised that the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) has ordered a reorganisation of the procedure, to simplify the bureaucratic procedure and to expedite processing so that this time span can be drastically reduced to meet the needs of new television audiences. I commend the Minister for his action and express the hope that the administrative details for new procedures will soon be finalised. Alice Springs interests must be catered for so that the Alice Springs residents can get commercial television before the end of the year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity on the adjournment debate to contrast the positive attitude of the Australian Labor Party Opposition in the Victorian Parliament with the attitudes of the Federal Government and the Victorian Government in regard to industrial relations. The Victorian ALP is moving towards an agreement with the power generating unions in the La Trobe Valley in relation to wage levels, price rises, increased productivity, worker and community involvement in decision making, improved housing capacity and apprenticeship training. Sometimes described as a social contract the proposed agreement contrasts sharply with the insensitive attitude of the Federal Government as demonstrated yesterday by the Minister for Industrial Relations ( Mr Viner) in this House. In contrast with the attitude of the Federal Minister, the ALP State shadow Minister of Labour and Industry, Mr Jim Simmonds, has with foresight demonstrated an understanding of the need for workers represented by unions to be given the opportunity to consult and make joint decisions with management on the difficult problems of power supply, problems which have been exacerbated by a Victorian Liberal Government which has starved the State Electricity Commission of the necessary funds for maintenance and expansion. In contrast the Minister for Industrial Relations has displayed antagonism and a complete lack of interest in or understanding of the difficulties which face the union movement in its commendable attempts to reorganise workers into union organisations which will have the strength and unity of purpose to negotiate with the powerful business corporations and industry associations. Instead of assisting the Australian Council of Trade Unions in its endeavours the Parliament, as the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke) pointed out yesterday, rejected legislation which had been prepared to facilitate the process of union amalgamation. The Minister is now proposing that there should be a multiplicity of so-called enterprise unions for individual businesses of 100 or more persons. Furthermore, he is proposing that even when a majority of workers belong to a union they may not decide that they will not work with non-unionists. So according to the Minister a minority of workers who do not choose to unite to prevent employer exploitation of their labour can tyrannise the majority by forcing them to work alongside blacklegs on the basis of government legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (1) Australian pensioners resident in Yugoslavia have the option of receiving pension payments in Australian dollars by means of direct credit to a bank account in Australia, or they may choose to receive their pension entitlement cheque paid in Yugoslav dinas.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The options provided regarding the method of payment are intended to suit the personal convenience of pension recipients, and to prevent undue delays occurring through factors outside the control of the Australian Government such as the loss of cheques, fraudulent negotiation, or the clearance time taken for encashment of overseas cheques.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Informal enquiries indicate that United States portability pensions are paid in American dollars.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian pensioners residing or travelling overseas can have entitlements credited to a bank account in Australia with transfers made overseas as and when necessary on a private basis.

<PARA> (1) Has his attention been drawn to the testimony on Government use of satellite communications before a subcommittee of the United States of America House Committee on Government operations in 1966 to the effect that the US Government sought and obtained agreement to use communications circuits operated by facilities of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in Australia for all US Government requirements and not merely NASA requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) If so, do these arrangements include the use by the US Department of Defense of these communications circuits operated by NASA facilities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Have NASA stations in Australia ever been involved in tracking or communications activities with any US military satellites, if so, which NASA stations were so involved, what are the formal designations, orbital parameters and dates of launch of the US military satellites and what were the periods over which the relevant stations were involved with the relevant satellites.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I take it that the honourable member is referring to a statement by NASA including at page 446 of testimony on Government Use of Satellite Communications before a sub-committee of the Committee on Government operations of the US House of Representatives during August and September 1966. The Statement indicates that in negotiations over the leasing of communications circuits NASA sought, but did not obtain, the concurrence of OTC (Australia) and other international communications authorities to the use of NASA circuits by other US Government agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The US Department of Defense does not and has not used the communication circuits operated by NASA facilities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. On a number of occasions the Orroral Valley tracking station has supported, and the tracking station that used to be at Carnarvon did support, launches of US military satellites, by carrying out tracking and/or data relay functions usually only in the post-launch stage or in the early stages of the satellites' orbital life. In the last few years the only US Department of Defense satellites to have been supported from NASA facilities in Australia have been five FLTSATCOM satellites (each for five days from the time they were launched) and one Defence meteorological satellite (between January and August 1980). The FLTSATCOM satellites are in geosyn- chronous orbit and the meteorological satellite was placed in a near circular orbit at about 1330 km inclined at 98.7*.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) The Agricultural Protection Board carries out training under the supervision of expert operators with assistance from the occupational Health Branch of the Public Health Department of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The use of protective clothing is advised and it is provided by the APB.</PARA>
<PARA> (6), (7), (8) and (9) Three trainees received workers compensation for medical treatment for skin complaints during their work on Noogoora Burr control. There is no evidence to link the skin complaints with the use of chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) and (11) 2,4,5-T is not known as Agent Orange. Air and urine tests have been carried out on APB employees to monitor exposure to both 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and have indicated no danger to health. Monitoring of occupational exposure will continue. No other special health care program is indicated.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) Legal assistance is available to Aboriginals through the Aboriginal Legal Service, which is funded by my Department, should any Aboriginals consider that they have a claim for compensation on the State in respect of skin complaints.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) Yes, but the cases of dermatitis referred to were reported to be caused by Noogoora Burr and not diesel, kerosene or the chemical component. This was the medical opinion.</PARA>
