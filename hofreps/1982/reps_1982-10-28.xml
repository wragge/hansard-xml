<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for Health yet examined the 1981-82 annual report of Medibank Private which was tabled yesterday? If so, has he understood that the autonomous and separate Victorian fund has 80 per cent of Medibank's national reserves, that in the year past the fund went down the tube in two States and that in three others its reserves come nowhere near the two months' level required to ensure that the membership is protected in the event of a flu epidemic or the like? Does the Minister feel that less than a week's reserve in Australia's most populous State, New South Wales, makes a mockery of the Chairman's report when he referred to encouraging news and substantial progress?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DF4">Mr CARLTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member is being a little unkind when he refers to the performance and the management of Medibank Private-the Health Insurance Commission. Having looked at the report which was tabled in the House yesterday- it is in the Table Office for any honourable member who would like to look at it -I must say that I saw some encouraging movement. The Chairman, Mr Millar, and the General Manager, Mr Wilcox, should be congratulated on the job that they have been doing under very difficult circumstances. As I have pointed out before , this fund operates under the severe restrictions of government ownership. It has to maintain superannuation payments which are in excess of those provided in the private sector. It must follow staffing levels and awards which are more expensive than those in the private sector. I am very conscious of the restraints under which a good management team and the commission operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I mentioned to the House before, I am looking very closely at ways and means of improving the capacity of Medibank Private to achieve the kind of objectives that the honourable member wishes it to achieve. In no way am I criticising the honourable member for keeping a close watch over the operations of Medibank Private. I have no quarrel with him on his analysis of the statistics. He does his sums very carefully. But the very things he points out highlight once again the grave difficulties one gets into with government-run operations, particularly in the health care field. I point out to honourable members opposite that if they are thinking of having a generalised government-run insurance system, which is in their platform, they are looking at a much higher cost option than we have with the private fund system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0K4">Mr WILSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government in this year's Budget continued to support the States in their efforts in the field of pre-school education. In addition, it made very substantial increases in the funds available for child care. The aim of this substantial increase in the funding provided for this purpose was, firstly, to enable existing child care facilities to operate effectively and, in some cases, to enable them to expand in some minor ways. The second way in which the Budget made very substantial contributions in the field of child care was to enable a great deal more to be done for children and families in need. Between $6m and $ 7m, if my memory serves me correctly, has been allocated for this purpose. A similar amount is also being made available for the provision of new child care services in areas in need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has been very conscious of the special needs of families for child care facilities. In this year's Budget, sensitive as it was to the needs of families with children, a very substantial increase was made available for this Government's child care effort. In co-operation with the States putting their effort into pre-school education, the Government recognised the special needs of needy families and needy areas by the allocation of these additional funds this year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Industry and Commerce aware that the rate of home ownership as surveyed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics has fallen from 73 per cent in 1978 to 71.9 per cent in 1980, and further to 68.2 per cent in 1981? Is this fall in home ownership a result of this Government's policies? Since the Minister has accepted responsibility for housing assistance, what changes to Government priorities has he promoted to improve access to home ownership in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2695" SPEAKER="Peacock The Hon A.S." NAMEID="MI4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="KOOYONG" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is very sensitive to the needs of the housing sector, both the needs of individuals and, indeed, the needs of the industry. The housing industry is very sensitive to general economic conditions and has always been characterised by cyclical movements in activity. The industry has been experiencing difficulty. I have mentioned that in the House before. Activity fell sharply in 1982 as housing demand was constrained by high interest rates, reduced availability of housing finance and general economic conditions. I have also pointed more recently to the indications that there is an upward turn. We have, of course, responded vigorously in our home ownership policies. The 1982- 83 Budget complements and extends the measures of the March housing package and the 24 June Loan Council decisions. It will relieve the burden on home buyers and boost the housing industry by significantly extending tax rebates to cover all home buyers, by the substantial increases in housing programs-including an increase of 28 per cent in the home deposit assistance, I think a 27 per cent increase in the welfare housing payments and a 34 per cent increase in expenditure on supplementary rental allowances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From the answer I gave last week the Government's measures are already having an impact. Lending by savings banks has improved over the three months or so to August-September, dwelling approvals appear to have bottomed out and building and financial institutions have reported increased inquiries in the last few months. That shows that the pick up is on the way. The measures contained in the Budget apply from 1 November and I would look for a further upward movement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Acting Attorney-General seen reports that two States will not be attending a proposed joint meeting of Commonwealth and State Attorneys and Police Ministers on 5 November?

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2695" SPEAKER="Brown Mr N.A." NAMEID="PD4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="DIAMOND VALLEY" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far as the Federal Government is concerned the meeting on 5 November will take place. I urge all State Attorneys and Police Ministers to attend that meeting and to participate with the Commonwealth in furthering the co-operative effort that has been proposed to fight sophisticated and organised crime. I am glad the honourable member based his question on that co-operative effort because it is indeed at the very basis of the proposal that the Commonwealth has made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said quite wrongly that this is a proposal to increase the power of the Federal Government. That is not the case. It is a proposal to decrease the power of criminals. We have proposed a co-operative effort which we would urge all States to take part in, under which in appropriate cases and at the discretion of the States concerned the States can transfer a particular function and an investigative process to the Commonwealth. In addition there would be cases on which we would also advocate a meeting of joint Commonwealth and State investigative bodies. That proposal has been made for a considerable period. It is still there. It was on the table at the last meeting of Attorneys and Police Ministers. We believe that is an effective method of tackling the problem of serious crime in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the last part of the honourable member's question. It is unfortunate that it seems now that the Australian Labor Party is to oppose the proposal to establish a national crimes commission unless the Government accepts its amendments to the scheme which would in fact weaken very substantially the proposal for the crimes commission. It is also quite extraordinary that the Labor Party should propose to delete from our proposal one of the most significant areas that we believe requires investigation and which I am quite convinced the Australian public accepts requires investigation-that is, offences which our established and traditional institutions have had difficulty in investigating and remedying. It is one of the very bases of a national crimes commission that it should be able to investigate those matters. It is very unfortunate indeed that the Labor Party should now seek to oppose the establishment of a crimes commission which would investigate those very serious crimes, which as I say is one of the very reasons why we want the body established. The situation is that the Commonwealth proposal is still there. It will be proceeded with. I would urge all States to continue with the co- operative effort upon which we started. I urge the Labor Party to join us and support this very significant proposal.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. As there was some further increase in indirect taxes in the Budget I ask: Will the average Australian family be worse off as a result of those increases in the light of other Budget tax measures?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2696" SPEAKER="Fraser The Rt Hon J.M." NAMEID="QS4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WANNON" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QS4">Mr MALCOLM FRASER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When judging the impact of the Federal Budget on families one has to look at all the measures that have been introduced into the Budget and see how they impact on individual taxpayers or on families in particular. The Budget overall gives very real and lasting benefits to Australian families, and to Australian families with children in particular. The tax cuts totalling $1.5 billion in this year are obviously of benefit to all taxpayers, including families. The increase in the tax free threshold is obviously a very useful increase. The reduction in the standard rate to 30c will benefit all taxpayers, and the increase in the middle threshold should help many Australians and prevent them moving into higher tax brackets if they are on or around average earnings or if they earn more in a particular period because of overtime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition to that there has been an increase in the dependent spouse rebate in cases in which there are children. The housing rebate, which is of significant assistance to people purchasing a home, and the increase in family allowances, which brings the increase to 50 per cent over the last two Budgets, are obviously of enormous interest and help to Australian families. For a husband and wife with two dependent children on average earnings with a home loan of, say, about $30,000 at 13.5 per cent the personal tax gains will be between $10 and $11. The home loan rebate will be worth around $6, and the family allowance about $4.25 a week, bringing the total benefits to $20 or $21. Against that we have to offset the impact of indirect taxes of about $3 a week for the same family. That of course leaves a net benefit of somewhere between $ 17 and $18. That represents a very significant benefit to Australian families and it is one that I am certain will be very much appreciated. It is equivalent to a wage increase of $25 or $26 which many employers are not able to afford at present.</PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides a basis for wage restraint and a basis which will assist Australian industry again to become competitive. That contrasts very much with Mr Cain's Budget in Victoria where, according to Mr Risstrom, State taxes will cost Victorian families an average of $12 a week. So they are about $18 a week better off as a result of our Budget, and the Cain Labor Government's Budget will rip $12 of that back off them.</PARA>

I preface my question by saying that the revelations in the McCabe-Lafranchi report and the Costigan reports, but more particularly the 500-page telephone directory which he tabled a month ago, clearly set out the delay which occurred through the necessity to refer legal issues to the Solicitor-General's Department. To overcome this deficiency I ask: Is it a fact that in the field of taxation law expertise in corporate liquidation and bankruptcy law is essential if enforcement is to be efficient?

Mr Speaker, I assure you that the Bicentennial Road Development Program will in fact achieve the stated objective of a dust free and virtually flood free national highway system around Australia. The great advantages of this program will be demonstrated in the not too distant future when projects commence all around Australia providing jobs for 20,000 to 30,000 people. Why would anybody knock a program that will provide such social benefit at a time of great distress to families throughout the nation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I thought we would have achieved a bipartisan approach to a really great objective, that is, to get Australia's roads right by 1988. This program will achieve that aim. This year we will see a 33 per cent increase in funds available for roads over and above last year. We will see a 76 per cent increase in 1983-84 over and above 1981-82. I have seen the statements by the honourable member for Shortland. I absolutely refute them as being entirely irresponsible. The Government has set its targets and it will achieve them. So far it is quite clear that what we have said in terms of the program will be achieved. This is based on discussions that we have had with officials from the States. The road program is up and away and we will have our roads right by 1988.</PARA>

We have also embarked upon the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. One should add the effects of the civil works program to the additional jobs that I referred to earlier. The Government was extremely generous with the States this year in respect of its capital works programs and also in respect of its borrowing entitlements through the Loan Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the initiative of the Government we have relieved the State governments of having to operate through the Loan Council with respect to electricity undertakings.

I am certain that the benefit of this will start to feed into the employment system right throughout Australia, certainly in the second half of next year. I did have some statistics on this that I thought might have been of some value to the honourable gentleman. The total public works program, including the airport construction program and the defence development program, plus the State's loan borrowing entitlements through the Loan Council, will exceed $3,256m this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> I have had talks with the Minister for Aviation about a number of aviation projects to see whether it is possible to move forward some of the intended start dates so that we can pick up some of the employment opportunities that will be available from those works in various parts of Australia. As honourable members would know, a very substantial airport redevelopment program is envisaged throughout Australia. We have very substantial works to be carried out at the Brisbane Airport, we have works to be done at Sydney Airport, Melbourne Airport, Tullamarine, and wide-bodied extension works to be constructed at the Adelaide Airport. The international airport development has just concluded at Adelaide. There is also the work in Perth.

I am able to advise the honourable member and, indeed, the House that accordingly I have approved the issue of ministerial determinations under item 27 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Customs Tariff Act to enable the longboat to enter Australia absolutely free of Customs duty. I am pleased to advise the honourable member also that the longboat is exempt from sales tax under item 119 (1) of Schedule 1 of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act.

<PARA> The difference, of course, is that members of the Australian Labor Party have claimed that they would never knock off Supply under any circumstances. The honourable member for Blaxland last March or April started to float the idea that it might be a good idea to do so. In spite of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition had earlier said that the Budget and its related legislation would be passed about two weeks ago he had a rush of blood to the head and made one more erratic move. He said that he was going to call a special executive meeting to reassess his attitude to the Budget. He even started using that word that somebody else had used before him-'reprehensible'. As a result of this the media came to all sorts of conclusions, starting to speculate again on the Australian Labor Party's attitude to what might happen to Budget legislation. Of course this gets back to the situation in which a government that does not control the Senate cannot give a blank cheque to the Australian Labor Party because plainly its word cannot be trusted in relation to these matters, and certainly the word of the Australian Democrats cannot be trusted. Last year both parties said they would allow Budget legislation through and once when certain legislation was held up one of the Democrat senators said that, after the symbolic three months, of course they would let the legislation through. However, they ended up not letting it through. We will not give a blank cheque to the Australian Labor Party, to the erratic Bill Hayden and all his motley crew.</PARA>

I am delighted to know that there has been great co-operation between all sections of government following the Federal Government's initiative. In answer to the particular query raised by the honourable member, I am delighted to be able to inform him that on this occasion the State of Victoria is not, as has been the custom, being Cained. It has indicated its agreement with all the other States to co-ordinate its activities. Only last week I indicated on behalf of the co-ordinating committee that the half a million dollars allocated this year would be distributed as follows: To each of the States, $42,500; to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, $27,500 each. These amounts of money will be made available for demonstration projects and also to allow the necessary arrangements to be made. I make a special appeal to all sections of the community, including people in private enterprise, to participate in the program. The Commonwealth will make available $2 for each $1 made available by local authorities and community bodies because it is absolutely essential that we arrest the decline in tree numbers in Australia. I particularly hope that the State of New South Wales is not influenced by a report put out by a fellow named Eric Rolls in which he indicated that the number of trees in Australia is greater than it was in 1788. That is not a fact, and the incidence of the distribution of trees is more important than the total number of trees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question to the Minister for Communications by reminding him of the stand down last week of 800 workers at the Goodyear factory in Granville, Sydney. Does the Government have a policy of supporting local industry by giving preference, through government and semi-government instrumentalities, to locally manufactured goods? Does the Minister's Department conform to this policy? Is the Minister for Communications aware that, although the local tyre industry has announced unscheduled shut-downs and has pending claims of dumping in this market, his Department has just let large tyre supply contracts to Toyo, a Japanese company with no local manufacturing facilities? Is it true that the losing tenderer was Goodyear Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PD4">Mr N.A. BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the Government has a policy to achieve what it can with government contracts carried out by Australian manufacturers employing Australians. Indeed, in my Department and those instrumentalities under my responsibility that policy is, without any doubt whatsoever, carried out in practice. In the case of Telecom Australia and the Australian Postal Commission, I have a responsibility, for instance, of approving contracts of the value of $ 500,000 or more. I seem to spend a fair proportion of my life reading the contract documents sent to me by Telecom and the Postal Commission. I can assure the honourable member and the House that in every single one of them there is an analysis of the proportion of the work which will be done within Australia by Australian manufacturers. There is also an analysis of the compliance with the offsets program. This is something that I look to in some detail, and I analyse the material put forward by the authorities on that aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That same requirement on me applies to Aussat Australia Pty Ltd. I think that if the honourable member casts his mind back he will recall that, when we announced the contract for the communications satellite, emphasis was placed on the fact that this would lead, for the first time in Australia, to the development of subsidiary industries which would contribute directly to the space industry. The same can be said, without my giving too many details, for virtually-so far as I know-all the contracts let by the statutory authorities under my responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the contract for tyres was a contract for more than $500, 000. If it was less than that amount it may be something that Telecom Australia or the Postal Commission has had regard to itself. I do not know particularly what it is proposed should be done with them but I will make specific inquiries. I repeat, however, that with respect to every contract that I have had regard to since I became the Minister, not only have Australian manufacturers and Australian employment been given particular attention by statutory authorities but also our goal in that respect has been achieved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt), in reply to an arranged question asked earlier by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher), seriously misrepresented the attitude that I had expressed on behalf of the Opposition to the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program and seriously misrepresented the accuracy of the information I quoted. I and the Opposition have supported the objectives of the Program, not opposed them as stated by the Minister. We have not knocked the Program because it is the Australian Labor Party's roads program of 1974 dressed up in new clothes. He questioned also, and sought to ridicule, the statements I had made that the work proposed for construction can not possibly be carried out with the funds that will be available. To validate the statement I made, I quote from a letter of 20 October from Mr Whelan, the Minister for Consumer Affairs and Minister for Roads in New South Wales. With reference to the cost of the works that have been promised under the ABRD Program, Mr Whelan, referring to New South Wales only, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The estimated cost of the works which Mr Hunt indicated he expected to have completed by 1988 is $1,725 million. The funds which are estimated to be available for construction under the Roads Grants Acts and the ABRD programme total $660 million, so there is an estimated shortfall of $1,065 million. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the projects being promised by the Government in this early election grab bag of projects cannot possibly be carried out with the moneys that are likely to be available. I mention also in support of my explanation that the Notice Paper has carried since yesterday my notice of motion given on 26 October condemning the Government for not providing a set allocation of funds for national highways to the States and the Northern Territory under the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. The Minister, if he wished to challenge the accuracy of what I said two days earlier, has had ample opportunity to bring that matter on for debate, but he has not done so. In support of my statement I point out that for the first time in roads legislation no allocations to the States for national roads have been written into law. I conclude on two points. Firstly, the work in this grab bag of promises cannot possibly be carried out by 1988 with the funds that are likely to be available. Secondly, there is no guarantee to any State-to Queensland for the Bruce Highway, to New South Wales for the Hume Highway, to Western Australia, Victoria or to anywhere else-that it will receive the moneys that have been indicated by the Minister. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GH4">Mr HUNT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make two points. In my second reading speech I made it clear that the reason why no set amount was allocated to any State in the national highway program was that flexibility was needed to ensure that by 1988 we were able to complete the objectives of the program. That was to complete a dust-free, virtually flood-free national highway system by that date. Of course, in order to achieve that some flexibility is required in the way in which those funds are allocated over the period. It was not wise to set a specific amount in 1982 to each one of the States. The other important thing is that the honourable gentleman seems to have missed a very important element. For his benefit and for the benefit of the House I make this one point clear. When tallying or adding up the amount of funds that are to be available, it is necessary to add the supplementary funds that will be available from the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program to those which are currently available under the Roads Grants Act until 1984-85. A new provision under that program will be necessary beyond that date. Clearly, the Commonwealth Government will provide whatever funds are necessary under the Roads Grants Act at that time to complete the objectives of the program.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) gave an answer earlier today to a question from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) regarding the closing of the Australian High Commission in Nairobi during an attempted coup in Kenya earlier this year. The honourable member for Higgins asked the Foreign Minister whether the Australian Embassy had been closed during that period. The Foreign Minister then made a reference to a statement I had made in regard to the tabling of the report of the parliamentary delegation in Africa in which statement I spoke about this matter. The Foreign Minister then went on to say, in so many words, that I had not been quite telling the truth and that the Australian High Commission had not closed down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know what information has been given to the Foreign Minister, but both the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) and I were in Kenya at the time and attempted on the day of the coup and the day after to make contact with the High Commission. We rang the High Commission and there was no answer. That was after we had been turned away by an army patrol on the road into Nairobi. We rang every number in the Nairobi telephone book that was given for members of the Australian High Commission. There was no answer to those telephone calls. There had been an attempted insurrection in the country and we were not able to contact our diplomatic representation. The next day we were successful in getting back into Nairobi and we contacted the High Commission. We were told by the Acting High Commissioner, Mr Les Luck, that he had sent the staff home. We were further told by Mr Luck that the High Commission would be operating only on a limited basis that day and the staff would be going home early. Mr Luck further informed me however that the Commission would be putting an answering machine on the telephone number there. It did not do that because later on that day I had cause to ring the High Commission to make inquiries and there was no answer once again. </PARA>
<PARA> I further inquired of Mr Luck what the Commission had done to contact Australians who were in Kenya at the time. His response was that they had contacted those people who worked for the Government there. I would have thought that the High Commission would have been trying to do something about the tourists who were there. Representatives of the Japanese Embassy, the Canadian High Commission and the American Embassy had gone around the hotels in Nairobi to seek out nationals from their countries and to place notices in the foyers of those hotels. I asked Mr Luck, who was the Acting High Commissioner, whether he did not think that would be an idea for the Australian High Commission, seeing that the Commission did not have a list of Australian tourists in Kenya at the time. He said that he had not thought of doing that and that he would proceed to do so. It took him about 24 hours to get around to doing that-at least at the Hilton Hotel where the parliamentary delegation was staying. I think I quite properly criticised the activities of the Acting Australian High Commissioner and his staff. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Holding,</PARA>
<PARA>This afternoon you addressed to me a question without notice about the award of a contract for coastal surveillance to H. C. Sleigh Aviation Ltd of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>I was unable to provide all the details you sought, but promised to provide them to you as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>A full answer to your question is below. </PARA>
<PARA>Q.1:</PARA>
<PARA>Did the Minister cause a Press Release to be issued in his name on the 1st October 1982, indicating a contract worth about $11.4m had been let to H. C. Sleigh Aviation Ltd of Melbourne for coastal surveillances. </PARA>
<PARA>A:</PARA>
<PARA>Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>Q.2:</PARA>
<PARA>Did the Minister's Press Release state that this contractor would be using New Rockwell Shrike Light Twin Aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>A:</PARA>
<PARA>No. My statement referred to new aircraft beginning operations in early 1983. In this context the term ''new'' referred to the up-graded arrangements and equipments being fitted and was not intended to apply to the actual air frames being used. </PARA>
<PARA>Q.3:</PARA>
<PARA>Was the unsuccessful tenderer for this contract Air Queensland, who tendered on that basis of using Nomad 24 Aircraft, in accordance with what the tenderer believed to be stated government policy, to use Nomad aircraft for surveillance work. </PARA>
<PARA>A:</PARA>
<PARA>Air Queensland was one of several unsuccessful tenderers. The tender document specified a suitable light twin-engined aircraft for the coastal sectors and clearly stated the technical requirements, but did not specify the use of Nomad aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA>Q.4:</PARA>
<PARA>Was the Nomad subject to test audit on climb performance while the Shrike was not so tested. </PARA>
<PARA>A:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Aviation advised me that both aircraft have been tested to the appropriate Australian performance certification standards, the Shrike Commander aircraft in 1971 and the Nomad aircraft earlier this year. In each case, this involved a test of climb performance with one engine inoperative and the current certifications for these aircraft require their ability to meet these test requirements at the approved gross weights. </PARA>
<PARA>Q.5:</PARA>
<PARA>Has it subsequently been found-</PARA>
<PARA>(1) the Shrike aircraft contemplated for use, are not new as stated in the Minister's Press Release,</PARA>
<PARA>(2) that subject to the same audit test as the Nomad, it did not perform nearly as well. </PARA>
<PARA>Is it that-</PARA>
<PARA>(3) The gross weight of the Shrike Commander for I.F.R. operations, had been overstated by 400 lb, thereby rendering the aircraft ineligible for the award of this contract. </PARA>
<PARA>A:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) Not applicable. See answer to 2 above. </PARA>
<PARA>(2) See answer to question 4. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) The Minister for Aviation advises me that the answer to the question is No. The gross weight for I.F.R. operations for the Shrike Commander aircraft is 7150 lbs, at which the aircraft type was demonstrated in 1971 to officers of the then Department of Civil Aviation to be capable of meeting all of the performance requirements for Australian airworthiness certification. Some slight deterioration in performance with age occurs in all aircraft but there is no reason to believe that the Shrike Commander aircraft to be used in fulfilment of the contracts are unsafe or unable to satisfy the performance requirements set out in the tender specifications. </PARA>
<PARA>Q.6:</PARA>
<PARA>How does the Minister explain the gross irregularities, continually occurring in his Department, in the technical evaluation of tenders, and the granting of a tender, which on the face of it was clearly contrary to expressed government policy. </PARA>
<PARA>A:</PARA>
<PARA>The allegation is incorrect and no explanation is required. In this case the Tender Assessment Committee comprised representatives from my Department, Department of Finance, the Department of Health, which is the major user and the Department of Aviation which provided technical advice on whether the aircraft being offered met the tender specification. </PARA>
<PARA>Kind regards,</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Corangamite-Minister for Foreign Affairs) For the information of honourable members I present two reports on the Government's ongoing activities in the field of arms control and disarmament. These reports are: First, the report to the Parliament by the Australian delegation to the Second Special Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations devoted to disarmament, UNSSOD II; and, second, the report of the Australian delegation to the 1982 session of the Committee on Disarmament.

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr STREET" NAMEID="FS7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FS7">Mr STREET</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In tabling the reports I also draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that last Sunday, 24 October, was United Nations Day, and the first day of what the world community annually celebrates as disarmament week. Each year during this week world attention is focused on the issue of arms control and disarmament. It is an opportunity for governments to inform their people about their respective policies on disarmament and arms control and to explain what they are doing to promote disarmament. So far this year, for example, the issue of arms control, disarmament and nuclear safeguards has been debated in this House on several occasions, and I have also spoken on this issue both within and outside the United Nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government has supported actively and continues to support actively the concept and objectives of Disarmament Week. The Government recognises that the only proposals likely to succeed are those which take full account of the need for states to be confident that such proposals contain proper verification and compliance measures and do not impair their basic national security. Today, I do not intend to discuss the contents of the two reports in great detail. They stand in their own right. I propose instead to look at the results of UNSSOD II; briefly cover developments in the Committee for Disarmament during 1982; say something about the arms control and disarmament process; and, finally, review the Government's policies in this important area of its foreign policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The results of UNSSOD II fell far short of the expectations of many governments and individuals. Strenuous efforts and long hours of negotiations failed to reach agreement on the main elements of its proposed final document on a comprehensive programme of disarmament-CPD-and review of progress in disarmament since the first special session in 1978. Failure to agree on the review was, to a considerable extent, due to the refusal by the Soviet Union and its allies to accept any responsibility for the erosion of international confidence since UNSSOD I. The split between supporters of East and West within the non-aligned states, and rivalries and conflicts between members of the movement, also undermined the chances of agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> The work of CPD was similarly frustrated. Some states attempted to gain unilateral propaganda advantage by seeking to dictate the terms of the international disarmament debate with superficial, one-sided and unverifiable proposals. In addition, the determination of the nuclear weapons states to hold to their established defence policies and the insistence by non-aligned countries-including a number which are themselves significant military powers- that only the nuclear weapons states had obligations proved damaging to the work of the session.</PARA>
<PARA> The second Special Session took place against an unstable international background. In mid-1978, when the first Special Session on Disarmament met in New York, international confidence was reasonably high. Since then events in many parts of the world, including Cambodia, Vietnam, North and South Africa, Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, the Middle East, Poland and the South Atlantic, as well as the unrelenting arms build-up by the Soviet Union have badly shaken that confidence. Clearly too, some of the hopes for the Special Session were unrealistically high, and took too little account of the fact that disarmament cannot operate in a political vacuum. Further, the process of restoring confidence and turning our hopes for disarmament into actual measures requires a calculated and practical approach. Many delegations approached their task acutely aware of the world situation but, ironically, this sapped rather than stimulated the will of some delegations to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA> What, then, did the Special Session achieve? First, it helped to establish among the community of nations a better understanding of the essential basis for progress in arms control and disarmament. Secondly, all member states of the United Nations reaffirmed their commitment to the final document of the first Special Session. Thirdly, the Session put the full weight of the General Assembly behind other crucial arms control negotiations. The Session endorsed the start and intermediate range nuclear forces negotiations which are under way between the United States and the Soviet Union. Similarly the Session endorsed the work of the Committee on Disarmament on a new and stronger convention to ban chemical weapons and on the nuclear test ban question. Fourthly, the objective of a comprehensive program of disarmament was reaffirmed. The session agreed that the draft CPD should be referred back to the Committee on Disarmament for further work. Finally, the second Special Session launched the World Disarmament Campaign, designed to mobilise public opinion world wide. The campaign is to be funded from within the existing United Nations budget.</PARA>
<PARA> In supporting the World Disarmament Campaign the Government is particularly aware of the need for it to be implemented in countries where citizens do not have access to an unhindered flow of a broad range of information and opinion on disarmament issues and are not assured of the right to express their views freely and publicly. In Australia the campaign will support continuous efforts to inform and mobilise public opinion on disarmament. Another limited, but timely and related decision taken at the Session was that the number of United Nations fellowships on disarmament should be increased. In short, the Special Session neither damaged, watered down the existing disarmament agenda, nor set back the negotiations now in train. It may even have given impetus and purpose to them, and established a more realistic and stronger base for future negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA> We should not expect immediate results from the negotiations to which I have drawn attention. They involve sensitive and complex matters going to the heart of the national security of states. That is not to say I am pessimistic about the outcome. It is simply that effective disarmament measures inevitably take time to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the Special Session the Australian Delegation made strenuous efforts to achieve a consensus for further progress. Our delegation participated fully and constructively in the formal proceedings of the Session and was very active in informal discussions and drafting groups. In my speech to the Special Session I spelled out the several priorities which Australia hoped the Special Session would give close attention. These were:</PARA>
<PARA> One, halting the nuclear arms race;</PARA>
<PARA> two, revitalising and strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime;</PARA>
<PARA> three, a comprehensive and fully verifiable ban on nuclear tests;</PARA>
<PARA> four, an effective and verifiable ban on the production, use and stockpiling of chemical weapons;</PARA>
<PARA> five, the drawing up of a comprehensive program of disarmament;</PARA>
<PARA> six, measures to encourage a reduction in the conventional arms race; and</PARA>
<PARA> seven, developing a framework for building confidence and trust.</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Committee on Disarmament. This is the only permanent multilateral negotiating forum concerned with arms control and disarmament questions in which all the regions of the world are represented. Australia was a founding member of the Committee and has ever since played a very active role in its work. The delegation's report shows that during 1982, the work of the Committee, like UNSSOD II, was greatly affected by the unfavourable international climate. Nevertheless, it continued its work in a number of fields , particularly in areas to which Australia gives a high priority.</PARA>
<PARA> First, work has proceeded in the Committee to draw up a convention to impose a comprehensive and verifiable ban on chemical weapons. Australia has always favoured pressing ahead with this work, especially in light of the persistent reports in recent years that chemical weapons have been used against both combatants and civilian populations in Indo-China and Afghanistan. As confirmation of our concern at these allegations, the Government had samples of material from Indo-China, which were said to have been chemical warfare agents, examined by the Australian Defence Laboratories. Although these particular samples did not contain chemical warfare agents, worrying reports of the use of chemical agents persist. The Australian Government believes that a continuing effort by the international community is necessary to ensure that whatever evidence becomes available is thoroughly investigated. Australia remains prepared to examine any tangible evidence of chemical weapons use which it considers merits study. Several countries including Australia are presently consulting about the possibility of setting up a permanent mechanism in the United Nations to investigate reports of chemical weapons use.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is a genuine concern among many Australians and among citizens of other countries that there should be an end to the nuclear arms race, and we have made it clear that we support the major nuclear arms control negotiations which are going on between the United States and the Soviet Union. We must all remain sensitive to the tremendous dangers of nuclear war; but we must not assume that to be the only danger. The past 37 years of the nuclear age have, in fact, been an age of non-nuclear wars. In this current year alone, for instance, there have been about eleven military conflicts, all of them non-nuclear, though some involved nuclear powers.</PARA>
<PARA> The well-meaning activists for nuclear disarmament sometimes give the impression of believing that the world would become safe, and the welfare of humanity secure, if only there were no nuclear weapons. Others put forward the proposition that nuclear vulnerability contributes to peace while a credible nuclear deterrent contributes to war. There were no nuclear weapons in 1939, or in 1914, but untold millions lost their lives. The basic task of diplomacy, to my mind, is to reduce the likelihood of war, most especially to prevent those wars that might become nuclear, and limit those wars which cannot be prevented.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's unqualified support for a strengthening of the nuclear non- proliferation regime, through its active participation in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and its uranium safeguards policies, are now widely recognised. For five years the Government has been a leading proponent within both the United Nations and the Committee on Disarmament of the early negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. A working group has been established to study aspects of what would be needed to verify such a treaty. This was an important practical step towards the goal of the early negotiation of a comprehensive test ban. The United States, the USSR and the United Kingdom have agreed to take part in that working group. The Government hopes that France and China will also agree to do so. Australia will continue to promote the CTB objective within the Committee on Disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA> Progress in disarmament is dependent on a number of factors. There is the need for disarmament to focus on real issues and practical solutions. Disarmament goals should not be oversimplified, although they all too often are. Unrealistic slogans and proposals merely discredit the disarmament cause and its processes. Disarmament is not something which can be achieved by gestures and by posturing. Proposals have to help build confidence. They have to be devised in such a way that participants can be confident that the commitments that they have entered into would be honoured by treaty partners. That is, disarmament measures must be transparent and verifiable. If agreements do not contain these essential verification and compliance measures, they will be ineffective. Arms control and disarmament measures must always take full account of the need for states to be confident that the agreements do not impair their basic national security. No state would ever enter into a disarmament agreement if it believed that by so doing its security could be threatened. Arms control cannot be divorced from international confidence and mutual trust.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, the need for progress in arms control and disarmament grows ever more pressing. The Government is pursuing realistic, practical objectives compatible with the defence of our national security. The Government will continue to work for real disarmament within the United Nations and the Committee on Disarmament. I present the following paper:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This is a most important matter. It relates to the peace and stability of the world. I welcome the fact that, after some delay, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) has decided to make a foreign policy statement in the House. Not too many foreign policy statements are made here these days, but they are very important from the point of view of informing not only the House but also the people of Australia as to what Government policy is and whether the Opposition thinks it can be improved. I think it is better to be discussing matters relating to foreign policy rather than just tabling statements. Recently the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) came back from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting and merely tabled a statement on what he said was a successful meeting. However, we did not have any discussion on it in this Parliament. Let me quickly advert to what are some of the keynotes of the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I look at, for example, page 6 of the statement which has this expression:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the special session neither damaged, watered down the existing armament agenda, nor set back the negotiations now in train. It may even have given impetus and purpose to them, and established a more realistic and stronger base for future negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to think that this would be the case, but the facts of the matter are not really that way. Honourable members will notice that matters of disarmament are always raised by members of the Opposition in this Parliament. We raise them in the knowledge that prospects for peace and stability in the word are deteriorating. The last time that we raised this matter was as recently as April last, in a matter of public importance. We expressed the hope that the special session on disarmament would be a success. Of course, it was a bitter disappointment-not because of any failure on Australia's part but because the super powers in the world cannot see their way clear to talking about a reduction in armaments. It is a very difficult matter for them because they are basically confronting each other in terms of the improvement of weaponry. There are 40,000 nuclear weapons now between the two super powers. Yet, in looking at this in the context of whether the world can afford it we find that half the world is starving, half the world lacks health care. The world is now spending at the rate of $1m a minute on armaments. Most of the world's scientists, engineers and construction capacities are now being devoted to methods of destruction. The most recent bomb developed has the capacity of 1,400 Hiroshima bombs. This gives honourable members an idea of the extent of development of destruction. I think it is important that we get this message across to our Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the matters raised in the recent session on disarmament was the need for public participation and discussion. I notice that the Minister talks about that in this statement. In that context I think there has to be more leadership, bearing in mind that we are a founding member of the Committee on Disarmament. We are very concerned, for example, about matters in Indo-China. I think that is very relevant to our very survival. Diplomacy again is mentioned as being an affective method to use. I have no doubt that it is but we have to do more than that-we have to take positive initiatives. In the few moments we have on this matter we have, in my view, to talk about some of the initiatives that we in the Australian Labor Party feel-as Australians, not in any political view-we should be taking. The Minister, I note, delivered a policy speech in Brisbane on 21 October. He was quite critical of the United Nations, saying that it was ineffective and that its mandate was habitually ignored. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Security Council. He put forward, I think-I am not trying to misquote the Minister-on that basis an untenable reason as to why we had to participate, for example, in the Sinai peacekeeping force. We have said enough about it. I have listened to what Mr Mubarak of Egypt thinks. I have looked at the recent difficulties, particularly in Lebanon, and the massive loss of life. Let me make it very clear that whilst one might claim the peacekeeping force is effective there has been no peace in the Middle East since we went there. It has nothing to do with the force. It was very clear that not many people thought it was going to be a solution. In fact there has been a horrific loss of life. There is now an international inquiry as to the reasons for the loss of life particularly among women and children. The Minister said that United Nations peacekeeping forces were ignored-in fact they were overrun in respect of Lebanon ; they counted for nothing. The Minister made the point that the Western Alliance states had no choice but to put together alternative peacekeeping forces. I think there is a choice. It is not a question of advocating an alternative approach when we are talking about international peace. The issue is to get the real intelligence resources together to guarantee that the situation cannot escalate into open warfare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister again mentioned that he speaks frequently on the subject of disarmament. I applaud him for that. But what about all the rallies and other discussion groups that take place in Australia? We never see one Minister of the Government there. I can understand, perhaps, that they think it would be better not to go. But, if we are talking about leadership and the issues of the alternative position it is important to show leadership in this area of bipartisanship. But it is always left to us in the Labor Party to go along to the marches and talk to the people about what we think. It is not just a policy for Australia; it is a policy for the world on how we think there has to be a solution. The solution has to be achieved by dialogue. Because of the failure of the recent conference on disarmament I am mindful, as always, of what a learned Chinese diplomat said to me. He said that between every conference on disarmament the world gets more armaments than ever. He is right. If one really wanted to do an audit on it one would find that between each session on disarmament we have more arms than ever. </PARA>
<PARA> I recently put forward a proposal which had Australian content in it. It was that we establish in the Southern Hemisphere a nuclear weapons free zone-not a nuclear free zone; a nuclear weapons free zone. I have suggested-in fact, when we achieve office-that we convene, as Australians, an international conference of all the parties involved in the Southern Hemisphere plus the super powers. This will not affect the super powers' ability to traverse the oceans with their weapons in terms of where they see their strategic importance; but it would guarantee that all the other nations in the Southern Hemisphere would be able to say: 'We are not going to have any nuclear weapons. We are not going to fire any nuclear weapons from the Southern Hemisphere. We ask that no weapons be delivered to the Southern Hemisphere'. There is a precedent for this. There are various such treaties that relate to Latin America, the treaty of Tlatelolco, and the treaty of Antarctica. They have been agreed to by the super powers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister would be on record as saying that his Government supports plans for nuclear weapons free zones, particularly in the South Pacific and in the Indian Ocean. Certainly there is one already in Antarctica. The Government in 1975 voted for the United Nations resolutions calling for the establishment of nuclear weapons free zones in the South Pacific as well as the Middle East. I believe there is a need for a bipartisan approach for these zones in the areas that I have mentioned. Ambassador Garcia Robles was recently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his achievements in Latin America. I had a chance, as many others would have, to congratulate him on his achievement. If we cannot get the world to disarm in nuclear terms perhaps we can get regions to disarm. Robles's concept of the treaty of Tlatelolco clearly showed the way. It was pioneering work. He was properly rewarded for it. When I took the iniative recently of writing to the concerned nations in respect of the Southern Hemisphere proposal, as well as to the two super powers, I understand that Robles said that he would support such a proposition. Also, I am delighted to read-in fact according to the Standing Orders-into Hansard a letter dated 18 October from Mexico City from Senor Martinez Cobo, the Secretary-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> Dear Mr Bowen:</PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated September 24, 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Your proposal to establish a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Southern Hemisphere is of great interest to me. It will complement the Latin-American zone-which is already a reality-and those initiatives unfortunately not yet established in Africa and South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> If the whole Southern Hemisphere were a nuclear weapons-free zone, it would effectively contribute to the objectives envisaged at the moment of the creation of nuclear weapons-free zones in different parts of the Planet. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall distribute your memorandum to the members of the Council of OPANAL, which will convene on November 4, 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>I give that as an example of something that can be done. I am mindful of the fact that at the present time in the United States of America, because it is a democracy-the Soviet Union is not-there is free and fair discussion. At the present time the Catholic bishops of the United States are leading a campaign on behalf of what they term their own brethren, who are 60 million strong, suggesting that the United States policy of escalating nuclear armaments can lead to annihilation and to war. That is because the policy appears to be to give the United States a capacity for first strike and to build up enough weapons to guarantee that the Soviet Union will be forced to surrender. Can we imagine anything more horrendous than the concept that a country expects to get such a superiority in weapons that the supposed enemy will surrender without a fight? It is ridiculous. That is the worry I have at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am amazed to think that the honourable member, who normally makes no contribution to debates, offers such an interjection on the basis that he expects the United States to get peace by guaranteeing that it has so many weapons that it assumes the Soviet Union will give up. Is he mindful of the problems of Poland? Is he mindful of the divisions between the Soviet Union and China? Is he mindful of the fact that China now has a nuclear capacity? Does he expect these countries to give up? What nonsense. Why does he decry the efforts of people in the United States? I make it clear that President Nixon's disarmament negotiator, Mr Gerard Smith, is not supporting President Reagan in these issues. How stupid it is to think that we can get so many weapons that we are able to guarantee peace. The words that come to mind are: 'Isn't it better to try to light a candle than to curse the darkness?' Is that not what it is all about?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We all agree with the points made by the Minister, but where is the commitment, the leadership and the follow up? When does Australia ever take any initiative? When do we ever do anything as Australians? Why are we so subservient to everybody else's foreign policy in this important matter, particularly in our region? That is the point. We all want disarmament but, as the Minister said, we have been through two world wars-1939 and, before it, 1914. By the way, we fought on the side of the Soviet Union in both wars. One can see the graves in the Soviet Union which show that they are ever mindful of the death and destruction those wars caused. But there have been 135 mini-wars since the Second World War. We ought to put that on the record. My view is that the Government has not given the leadership that is required and it has not been very critical of a number of the nuclear weapons states. Certainly, and quite rightly, it is critical of the Soviet Union and it is equally wary of the fact that the Soviet Union will build up arms. But the Soviet Union is saying it is building up arms because the United States is also building up arms. </PARA>
<PARA> How long can we continue that argument before war starts? Is it not important to talk about the removal of arms? That is the important point, because nuclear weapons are an enemy of humanity. They are not limited to any one country; they are related to our entire planet. Look at France, to which we seem to be anxious to sell our uranium. I am not talking about peaceful uses for uranium either. France can use other uranium as a substitute for ours. It may well be using uranium from other sources for its underground testing in the Pacific. It has carried out 50 underground tests in the Pacific since 1974. This Government does not do anything about it. It takes the view that because France no longer accepts the International Court of Justice we can do no more than register a protest. When China explodes a nuclear device we express the sentiment that perhaps we can understand it. How can we understand it in terms of our own region, if there is to be some danger of nuclear surgical strikes between China and Vietnam? Of course, the Vietnamese are getting Soviet help. We ought to be talking about a world disarmament campaign which focuses on public opinion and strengthens the concept of international peace and security. I note that the United Nations budget will have some provision for such a campaign. Australia is to consider making a contribution, and I hope we do. I guarantee that if this Government does not, a Labor Government will. </PARA>
<PARA> I again praise the work done by our Australian representatives on the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, and the excellent work being done at the United Nations. The Government must do more, though, than just rely on diplomats and scientific experts to say the right thing. We have to be positive; we must follow up those statements with practical propositions both with regard to leadership within our own country at all levels and in terms of taking initiatives in respect of our own region. Reason, determination and hard work will always be the requirements for disarmament. The question is an emotional one. It requires a commitment of the heart as well as intelligent control of the head. Whilst we applaud what has already happened in terms of the Government trying to help, it has to take some leadership in this country; it has to take some initiatives and it has to encourage regional nuclear weapons-free zones. The sooner it stops harping in a critical fashion, saying it cannot do anything unless something is done by the super powers, the better off we will be. The world would be better off if we would get the states in the southern hemisphere and the super powers to concur on a regional nuclear weapons-free zone. If we did that, half the world would be free of nuclear weapons and so we would have taken at least a very substantial step along the road to peace. </PARA>

The inquiry, which has now become widely known as the Davidson inquiry, has clearly applied itself vigorously and thoroughly to its task. Its report will be a milestone in the history of telecommunications in Australia. It is necessary to mention only a few of the recommendations in the report to realise just how significant it is. I will mention some of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. The Australian Telecommunications Commission should be abolished and replaced by an incorporated company-Telecom Australia Limited-owned 100 per cent by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Telecom Australia Limited may enter joint ventures or partnerships as well as form or participate in the formation of subsidiary companies which have as an object the operations of telecommunications systems. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Unrestricted use and resale of leased Telecom capacity should be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Independent networks should be permitted subject to ministerial authorisation. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. There should be no restrictions on the use of independent networks in respect of the classes of traffic carried. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Independent networks engaging in common carrier activities should be subject to an endorsement to that effect as a condition of authorisation. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Telecom should be permitted to compete on an equitable basis with independent network operators engaged in common carrier activities. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Users should be permitted to lease satellite capacity for incorporation in leased or independent networks. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. No restrictions should be placed on the classes of traffic carried over, or the use of leased or independent networks using satellite capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Telecom networks and independent networks shall conform to approved technical standards. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. Interconnection should be permitted between leased Telecom networks and national terrestrial public switched networks, subject to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Compliance with appropriate technical standards; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Payment of a time-based local call fee at each point of interconnection and any other appropriate facility charges. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Interconnection should be permitted between independent networks and the national terrestrial public switched network on the same basis as leased networks, provided that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Ministerial authorisation has been given for interconnection; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The interconnection agreement is available on public record. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. The private sector should be permitted to participate in all aspects of terminal equipment marketing. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. The private sector should be permitted to participate in wiring in customer 's premises. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. Responsibility for technical standards for terminal equipment should be transferred from Telecom to an independent standards authority and that the Standards Association of Australia-SAA-be so designated. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. Telecom's network interface should be at a junction box at the boundary of the customer's property or on the outside of the building as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. Current Telecom practice of supplying public access telephones should continue. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. Local councils, Australia Post or community organisations should be free to provide public telephone services. </PARA>
<PARA> 19. Leased coin operated telephones-Redphones and others-should be regarded as part of the open terminal equipment market. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. Australia Post should assume the role of principal rather than agent in the management of the public telegram service. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. Telecom's pricing policy should:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) reflect costs to a substantial degree</PARA>
<PARA> (b) minimise price discrimination and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) adopt timed local calls. </PARA>
<PARA> 22. Cross-subsidisation should be reduced to levels which Telecom can absorb yet remain competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> 23. Direct subsidy funded from sources external to Telecom should be introduced for any class of subscriber which government wishes to assist. </PARA>
<PARA> 24. Telecom should develop greater business orientation. </PARA>
<PARA> 25. Telecom should accelerate the introduction of call charge recording-CCR. </PARA>
<PARA> 26. Telecom should not be subject to Government direction on staffing levels.</PARA>
<PARA> 27. Telecom's borrowings should not be subject to Loan Council approvals. </PARA>
<PARA> 28. Telecom should pay all taxes, rates and charges. </PARA>
<PARA> 29. Telecom should review its present policies on use of its own work force for capital works and adopt a target of 50 per cent use of contractors. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that I mention some only of the recommendations should not detract from the significance of the other recommendations, all of which are important and all of which deserve serious study. All of the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry will be closely examined by the Government over the coming months. The Government welcomes and in fact encourages community comments on the report, which comments should be directed to my Department. In view of the breadth of the report and the detail involved, it is proposed to allow three months for comments to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the Committee has proposed a major restructuring of telecommunications in Australia. I expect, therefore, that the debate will be a vigorous one. I would ask that it also be a rational and sensible one. If it is, the Government will be greatly assisted in considering the recommendations and in making decisions that will be in the best interests of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> I place on public record my appreciation for the way in which the Committee members have discharged their responsibilities. In the relatively short period of 12 months they have produced a report of great significance to the whole Australian Community. The Government therefore extends its sincere thanks to Mr Davidson, Mr King, Mr Dick and Professor Karbowiak for their work in producing such a major report on telecommunications. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Government announced the Committee of Inquiry into Telecommunications Services in Australia just over 12 months ago. It is important to remember that when this inquiry was established it was not an inquiry into the effectiveness of Telecom Australia or its future directions but rather an inquiry quite specifically into the opportunities for private enterprise participation in what is now the Telecom monopoly of telecommunications services throughout Australia. I think that point has to be remembered very clearly. When the Minister for Communications (Mr N.A. Brown) says that he wants a vigorous but sensible and rational debate he has to remember that the inquiry was not established in a neutral way. The inquiry was established to pursue a particular ideological line. The membership of the Committee was carefully picked so that it would come to the same conclusions as the Government had come to already prior to the inquiry being established. It was really an inquiry to pursue the doctrinaire preoccupations of the Government at the time. Honourable members will remember that at that time, a year ago, there was a spurt of ideological enthusiasm on the part of the Goverment. It wanted to see what opportunities there were for riding this hobby horse right through Telecom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At least now we have a much better Minister than we had at that time but the circumstances for pursuing those sorts of obsessions are very much more adverse. At a time when jobs are evaporating all round the community and at a time when inflation is about to break into a new gallop we should not be faced with distractions such as this. It is important to remember that there has not been justification for many of the things which the terms of reference required the Committee to consider. When the Minister says that the recommendations of the inquiry are momentous he could not be more accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> The implications of some of these recommendations are extremely broad indeed. Take just one of the recommendations which, for some reason, the Minister did not even bother to mention. At page 32 of volume 1 the report states that the current practice of Telecom giving preference to local manufacturing industry will not now be a requirement of the new Telecom company. That is, the new Telecom company will make its purchases in any areas where there is a commercial interest for it to do so. What has to be remembered in that context is that Telecom itself has estimated that 14,000 or 15,000 jobs in Australia-outside Telecom, within the private sector, mainly in the Australian electronics industry-rely almost totally on the business that firms get from Telecom. That is a recommendation which the Minister did not even bother to mention even though it has implications for 14,000 jobs in a very vital part of Australian manufacturing industry. It is not worth pursuing ideological obsessions if 14, 000 people are to suffer as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to be critical of the Minister. He did list many of the important recommendations; he did not try to argue for them; he did not try to justify them; he did not indicate that the Government was going to accept them and I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that it should. But it is important when the Minister talks about the recommendations being momentous that people should understand just how momentous they may be. For instance, there is a recommendation that the new company should be liable for all Federal, State and municipal taxes and charges. That involves increasing Telecom's costs by about $500m or 20 per cent-an enormous increase which, of course, will have to be borne by the users of the Telecom network. </PARA>
<PARA> Another proposal is about introducing a time-based charge for local calls. At the moment local calls are unlimited. The proposal is that the standard rate should be for a call of a specified time; and that if people go over that time they should pay more for a call, as they do now on subscriber trunk dialling. That has enormous implications for people in the capital cities who are used to having unlimited time to make their local calls. </PARA>
<PARA> The third important recommendation relates to an elimination of cross- subsidisation. Cross-subsidies have been very useful in the past for trying to use the efficiency of the metropolitan concentration of telecommunications services to subsidise the very great cost of providing those services to the sparsely populated parts of Australia. Let me take just one example. In Bathurst , a normal telephone service loses $192 a year. That cost has to be met by other subscribers to the Telecom service. If cross-subsidisation is to end the implications for someone in Bathurst are, of course, extreme. He will be up for an additional $190 on average for the cost of his telephone service. The cost of telephone calls from, say, Bathurst to Townsville might increase fourfold as a result of removing cross-subsidisation. The use by independent networks of the Telecom capacity is really what the report is all about. A few people wanted to establish an alternative to Telecom for their normal telecommunications needs and also in particular for the expanding area of data processing and data transfer. This is really what the report is all about. The Government must take this very seriously indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly alarmed that the recommendations go along the lines that independent operators should have access to the Telecom network at the discretion of the Minister. I am not saying that the current Minister would abuse that sort of power. But it is potentially a very profitable area which is very attractive to a number of operators. I compare the leaving of that discretion to the Minister with, for instance, the issue of broadcasting licences, where very rigorous public procedures have to be gone through. The report suggests that that sort of concession should be given to people on the say-so of Ministers. Enormous opportunities exist therefore for corruption, for milking the system, for some unscrupulous Ministers or political parties to use that sort of power, authority, and ability to dispense favours to finance their operations. I predict that if the Government accepts that recommendation members of the Liberal Party would not hang on to communications for very long. The National Party would wrench it from them because it would see that as a heaven- sent opportunity to continue to bankroll its political operations. </PARA>
<PARA> There are more matters of concern than for joy in this report. Indeed, there are very few matters for joy. But I would not allow our ideological preferences for retaining Telecom in the public sector to lead us to dismiss completely all the recommendations. We would similarly expect the Government to abandon its ideological preferences for handing the whole lot over to the private sector, which is really a central feature of the recommendations of the report, even though it is intended that the central operation should remain in public ownership. We must approach this sensibly. We have not dismissed all of the proposals. But there are an enormous number of areas of concern for the Australian community and for Telecom subscribers. I seriously urge the Government to think very carefully indeed before it pursues this path any further. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House condemns the Government for its failure to devise a national industry development strategy which is capable of leading to full employment within the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion has been on the Notice Paper for some time and I am grateful to the Government for suspending Standing Orders to allow me to move it. Record unemployment, spiralling inflation, accelerating deindustrialisation and a disintegrating social fabric are rapidly becoming the hallmarks of the Fraser Government which this country continues to suffer. In the last few weeks and even days we have been confronted with sackings and factory closures on a scale not hitherto seen in Australia since the time of the Great Depression. Nor is this a temporary phenomenon. Australia's economy has been progressively weakening virtually since the Government took office. Over the last few years this deterioration has become really pronounced. </PARA>
<PARA> The House should consider, for example, a key indicator of Australia's overall economic performance-the balance of payments. As the latest issue of the Australian Economic Review points out, in 1979-80 the ratio of the current account deficit to gross domestic product was 1.8 per cent. In 1980-81, however, it increased to 4 per cent and in 1981-82 it was 6.1 per cent. No improvement is forecast for the coming year. All the indicators point in the direction of worse to come. Australia's imports are running out of control. Despite the downturn in the domestic economy, imports continue to increase. Last year the value of merchandise imports rose by 21 per cent. The rate of growth in manufactured imports accelerated from 16 per cent to 25 per cent. As the Review points out, these account for more than 75 per cent of total imports. This acceleration is the main reason for the $4,000m increase in the value of imports in a single year. </PARA>
<PARA> The growth in imports of machinery and transport equipment was even higher than that in manufacturing as a whole, increasing by 33 per cent. In volume terms imports accelerated from 12 per cent to 17 per cent in 1981-82, at a time when total domestic demand was decelerating. This extraordinary growth in both the value and volume of imports-despite one-off factors such as increases in energy and transport equipment investment-accounts for much of the deteriorating employment situation from which we are suffering in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> I singled out the balance of payments figures because it is here as much as anywhere else that the signal failures of the Fraser Government's industrial strategy are most obvious. But I could have used instead unemployment figures and pointed out the tragic events and situations that exist at present in Wollongong, in Port Kembla, in the Newcastle region, in Dandenong or Geelong in Victoria; indeed, in my own city of Adelaide or in Whyalla. I could have used employment as an example of the terrible situation that has been allowed to arise in Australia's economy over the years of the Fraser Government. But I certainly would not be doing so in the context of not having any hope for the future. That is the sort of message that is coming from the Government side of the House. Indeed, if that message comes from this side of the House I shall refute it. I will argue that the Government's failure to devise a national industry strategy has led to the present unemployment figures. Had we had a national industry strategy and better economic policies we would have been able to plan for full employment in this country over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> The current industrial and economic strategies being pursued by the Government will lead instead to record unemployment and industrial decline. If we are to have these messages of no hope from members of the Government, let us put them on the spot and get them to propose specific policies to help lift us from this situation. I repeat: At the moment the Fraser Government has no strategy. The Government believes in the overriding efficiency of market prices as an allocative mechanism. It has a blind faith in the view that if only the Australian economy can be exposed to the forces of international competition, most of our problems will be solved. This is the message that is coming from the Government. Thus in a halting and hesitant manner the Fraser Government has repeatedly expressed the view that, irrespective of general economic circumstances, the level of support and protection for Australian industry and Australian workers' jobs would be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Industry might have coped with the situation had it known in advance that its markets were to disappear to low cost imports. Industry might have taken steps to deal with that situation through new investment, retraining and so on. But the on-again, off-again nature of the Government's stance on this issue of general levels of tariffs-often, for the most part, the on-again, off-again stance being determined by opportunist political reasons-has created the worst of all possible worlds for industry and employment. The levels of uncertainty are now so high and the unpredictability of Government responses are now so great that business confidence has fallen dramatically. This has seriously damaged investment intentions in terms of both new products and new processes. More importantly, I believe the Government free market ideology, even if inconsistent in practice, had led to a number of seriously damaging policy stances which go beyond its inconsistent stance on tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> The conventional wisdom among orthodox economists in this country appears to be that Australia has failed to grow at a faster rate because of our failure to structure our economy more in line with world trends. The post-war world, they argue, has been characterised by rapid growth in liberalisation of world trade. This pattern has been associated also with a rapid growth in specialisation in world production. As a result, so the argument goes, world income has been higher than it would otherwise have been and each country has been better off since it has shared in the gains from trade which this specialisation process has made possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's problems, according to that view, stem from the fact that we have failed to enter into this specialisation process and we have accordingly been denied access to our share of the growth in world trade. This is, in my view, just stuff and nonsense. The growth in post-war world trade has been characterised by increasing diversification, not specialisation. The developing countries of this region, for instance, have without exception diversified away from primary production into manufacturing. The industrially developed economies have equally diversified their industrial bases. They each now trade with each other in the same type of goods and services. The fact that the British now buy larger quantities of German Mercedes whilst the Germans purchase more Rover cars is a reflection of the growth in the sophistication of their respective advertising and marketing expertise rather than of any restructuring according to the canons of comparative advantage. All of the studies of the structure of the Western European economies show quite clearly that the process has been one of convergence rather than divergence, which is what one would have expected had greater specialisation occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> There are lessons for Australia in that. Australia's flagging share of world trade stems from the simple fact that we have been overspecialising in those commodities which on average have experienced slower growth in world trade. In 1980-81 manufactures accounted for 20 per cent of Australia's exports. They accounted in the same year for 55 per cent of total world exports. Moreover, 75 per cent of Australia's exports are concentrated in those sectors which are growing at below the average growth rate of world exports. The evidence suggests that we concentrate too heavily on those sectors where value is growing more slowly than for the world as a whole. For example, the average annual growth in the value of Australia's agricultural exports was almost 15 per cent. The corresponding world figure was almost 18 per cent. In manufacturing the disparity is even wider, with 14.2 per cent and 19.6 per cent for Australia and the world respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that these facts are sufficient to explode the conventional wisdom so unwisely held by my political opponents and indeed, by others. Serious as this is, the free trade, free market ideology has even more disastrous consequences for Australian industrial development. The Government, it seems, is blinded by the elegance of general equilibrium economics. It cannot see the many opportunities which exist for industrial development in the fields of mineral investment and processing, in manufacturing and in exports. Many of these opportunities exist in the field of producer goods industries-basic industries which supply a wide range of increasingly sophisticated inputs into the many spheres of production. Australia's import bill for this type of producer goods commodity amounted to $4.25 billion in the first 10 months of last year-almost half of our record end of year current account deficit. Again, the conventional wisdom holds that Australia is denied access to the manufacture of this equipment because of superior economies of scale enjoyed in the larger economies of the Western world and Japan. I believe this to be only partly true. The government should have done some basic research in this area. I believe such research would have killed that idea. I quote from the New Scientist of July 1980, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Only a small proportion of goods are made with traditional automation where thousands of identical items are produced in one run. About 75 per cent of British metal goods which encompass anything between TV components to parts for combine harvesters, are made in small batches of a few hundred at a time, where orthodox automation is ruled out because it is too expensive. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members may be thinking that this is a British phenomenon. However, the article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In any industrial country, the average machine tool is in use only 16 to 20 per cent of the time . . . and most people believe that a productive time of 16 per cent cannot be bettered. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not much scope there for economies of scale. In truth, the superiority which many of our imports have over domestically produced equipment arises from the fact that governments in the countries of origin of those imports pursue far more progressive and effective industry policies than we do in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In accordance with sub-section 12 (1) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 I have pleasure in tabling the plan of management for Uluru (Ayers Rock-Mount Olga) National Park, together with copies of representations received in connection with the plan and the comments of the Director of National Parks and Wildlife on these representations. I seek leave to make a short statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ML7">Mr McVEIGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Uluru (Ayers Rock-Mount Olga) National Park was declared a national park under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 on 24 May 1977. Shortly afterwards the Director of National Parks and Wildlife published a notice stating that a plan of management was to be prepared and inviting representations. Nine responses were received and taken into account in the preparation of the plan. In accordance with the provisions of the Act a notice was published on 20 April 1982 stating that a plan of management had been prepared and seeking representations by 27 May 1982. This notice was published in the Commonwealth Gazette and major Australian newspapers. Copies of the plan were made available at a number of locations throughout Australia, including major libraries and environment centres in each State. Copies were also made available to a number of interested individuals and organisations. Fourteen representations were received, some after 27 May. The Director of National Parks and Wildlife considered all the representations in finalising the plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In preparing the plan of management the Director of National Parks and Wildlife has been very conscious of the national and international importance of the natural and cultural values of the park. Whilst the massive geological features of Ayers Rock and the Olgas dominate the park, it also contains representative arid ecosystems and plant and animal communities peculiar to the special environments around Ayers Rock and the Olgas. Furthermore, the area is of great significance to Aboriginal people. Aboriginals have lived as part of this arid environment for many thousands of years and retain a deep attachment to the land and features of the park area. The park is an important component of the tourist industry and is an important tourist destination. The plan provides a framework in which management may proceed in an orderly manner, striking a balance between different interests. The major components of the plan of management relate to the conservation and protection of the park's natural resources, the management of visitor use, the provision of visitor facilities, and the involvement of Aboriginal people in the park and its management. The development of the Yulara Village on the boundary of the park has been taken into account and prescriptions made with regard to the phasing out of tourist accommodation facilities and the rehabilitation of areas around Ayers Rock as Yulara Village is completed. </PARA>
<PARA> In seeking to ensure the protection of the natural resources, the plan of management includes provision for such things as the control of introduced plants and animals, the adoption of a fire regime which takes account of the special requirements of park ecosystems, and the rehabilitation of damaged or degraded areas in the park. Special provision is also made for the protection of the interesting plant and animal communities around Ayers Rock and the Olgas. The plan envisages the provision of a range of visitor facilities and amenities. These include a visitor interpretative centre, an entrance station, picnic facilities and walking tracks. In addition, a program will be developed to interpret the places, objects and stories which best express the natural and cultural attributes of the park. Until now the interpretative programs in the park have largely focused upon Ayers Rock and, to a lesser extent, the Olgas. However, these will now be expanded to encompass the Aboriginal significance of the area and the desert ecosystem as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The plan provides for the establishment of living areas for Aboriginals, the development of Aboriginal training programs, and the secure storage of Aboriginal sacred objects. The plan also prescribes the establishment of an Uluru Aboriginal Advisory Committee on park management. Responsibility for the preparation of the plan of management for Uluru-Ayers Rock-Mount Olga-National Park rests with the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. The Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory has been consulted and involved in all stages of its preparation. During the preparation of the plan the Central Land Council was kept informed of its progressive development in order to seek Aboriginal views. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware of discussions which may lead to the granting of title to the park to the Aboriginal people. This would require revocation of the proclamation of the park under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. If approved by Parliament, this plan of management would cease to have any legal effect once the proclamation was revoked. However, the plan would still provide a sound basis for a new management plan in the light of the changed circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to emphasise that the plan of management for Uluru-Ayers Rock-Mount Olga -National Park has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 and has taken into account all public representations received in response to the plan released on 20 April 1982 for public comment. I am confident that the plan provides a sound basis for the future management of the Park. I commend this plan of management to honourable members. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XJ4">Mr WEST</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Cunningham)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On 24 May 1978 Uluru or Ayers Rock-Mount Olga National Park was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Some 4 1/2 years later the Opposition welcomes the tabling of the management plan for the park and looks forward to its implementation when it passes through all administrative stages. The management plan has many long and short term objectives. Basically, they can be summarised in three major areas. First, development in the park will be phased out-that is, developments within the park, such as motels and so on, will be moved outside the boundaries to the new Yulara village. This will reduce the pressures on the park considerably. I understand that necessary tourist facilities such as those involved with interpretation, education and access will be established in the park to promote appreciation by the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the plan provides that increased Aboriginal involvement in the park management and the maintenance of values of Aboriginal association within the park should be facilitated. At present virtually no Aboriginal people are employed in park management at Uluru in ranger, interpretative or management capacities. This should be changed. Thirdly, the plan also provides for management regimes to be established to protect the park's conservation values, for example, with programs of rehabilitation of degraded areas, control of feral animals and maintenance of fire regimes. </PARA>
<PARA> Having been to the park recently I particularly welcome the moves to withdraw all of the obsolete facilities from within the park as Yulara village is completed. I think that is an extremely good move. The new tourist village, I am told, will eventually provide accommodation for some 5,000 people, at any given time, and jobs for some 500 people. If the village is run within the limits of this sound management plan I expect that will be acceptable. The existing administration of Uluru National Park is under the control of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Day-to-day management is carried out by the Northern Territory Conservation Commission. The capital and recurrent expenditure for the administrative services carried out in this fashion is funded through the National Parks and Wildlife Service appropriation in the Federal Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it on record that a Labor government will maintain Commonwealth control over Uluru-Ayers Rock-Mount Olga-National Park. However, it will continue these current management arrangements that I have outlined. I understand that at present the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory employs about 17 people, nine of whom are rangers, in the administration and surveillance of the park. As tourism expands these figures will increase to 50 and 25 respectively. I make it clear that the Commonwealth should retain the overall control and let the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory do the work on the ground. There should be no alterations to those overall arrangements. In that respect I am concerned at the omission from the speech of the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) of the important point regarding the state of play of current discussions with the Northern Territory Government. The Minister said :</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware of discussions which may lead to the granting of title to the park to the Aboriginal people. This would require revocation of the proclamation of the Park under the . . . Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> If approved by Parliament, this plan of management would cease to have any legal effect once the proclamation was revoked. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Minister hoped it would be a sound basis for future management, et cetera. So do I. I draw the Minister's attention to a memo from the National Parks and Wildlife Service concerning the current state of negotiations in regard to the handing over of control to the Northern Territory. The memo states :</PARA>
<PARA> Over the years considerable discussion has taken place with regard to the future of the Park. The N.T. has strongly urged that ownership and full responsibility for it should be returned to the N.T. The Commonwealth's position has been that, in changing the status of arrangements for the Park, Aboriginal aspirations (i.e. ownership and involvement) must be met. Both the Prime Minister and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs have given commitments to the Aboriginal people that no changes will be made without their concurrence. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the rub:</PARA>
<PARA> Recently the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs announced that the Commonwealth would transfer the Park to the N.T. with the N.T. legislating to provide title to the Park to the Aboriginal people. Management of the Park would then be a joint arrangement between the N.T. and the Aboriginals. The CLC and Pitjantjatjara Council, representing the Aboriginals, have rejected the proposal . They are seeking title under the provisions of the Commonwealth Aboriginal Land Rights Act. They are proposing that once they get title they would prefer to make an arrangement with ANPWS, similar to that at Kakadu, for the future management of the Park. At this stage the matter is unresolved. </PARA>
<PARA>It had better be resolved. We support the transfer of title to the Aboriginal people. I know that the present Land Rights Act does not permit claims to alienated Crown land. So there is a problem using that avenue. The Minister has said that transfer of title is being considered by some other means. We support the transfer of that title to the Aboriginal people, but we do not support the transfer of full management control to the Northern Territory. There is no reason why the legislative model covering Kakadu should not apply to Uluru. That is, of course, an Aboriginal lands trust with registered traditional owners set up to assume title to the land should lease that area, necessary for the continuance of the Park, to the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Then instead of using the Kakadu management model, whereby of course officers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service do most of the work, we could then revert to the Uluru model that currently exists. That would involve Aboriginal title and Commonwealth control with the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory with an expanded ranger service doing the management work on the ground, as indeed it does now. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I want to make-I thank the House for the courtesy in allowing me to speak-is that we want to see more Aboriginals employed in park management service at Uluru. That is our national policy. We will seek to implement training programs to enable a much larger percentage of local Aboriginal people to be employed on their own land as park rangers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This issue is of vital importance to my electorate because Ayers Rock, as well as being very significant to Australia , is of particular interest to people who live in the Northern Territory, especially the Aboriginal people of the area. This plan of management now provides them with the opportunity to engage in park management and full park involvement. The plan has been developed with their co-operation, with their interest and with their consultation at all times. It now formally recognises that there will be an Aboriginal consultative group to do the day-to-day management with the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory, the group that has been doing the on-the-ground work, and doing it very satisfactorily and very well. Probably the most overriding economic importance of this area is the tourist industry. Work has begun on the $100m Yulara tourist village. It is due for completion in 1984. Yulara will accommodate up to 6,000 people in facilities ranging from camping grounds to first class hotels. We will see a phasing out of the inadequate tourist facilities at the Rock, and this will mean a significant improvement and will allow areas within the Park to be rehabilitated and returned to their natural state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, my big reservation with regard to the plan of management puts me in total opposition to the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West). I cannot agree that the issue should remain under Commonwealth control. It should properly be under Northern Territory control. The Northern Territory is still in the anomalous position that, unlike other States, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service controls its national parks. In the early 1970s, when the ANPWS was established, the Northern Territory Reserves Board was stripped of its major parks and left with only a few reserve areas. Self government happened in the interim. This brought about a major change. We should recognise the importance of how the events fit together-that the Northern Territory is self- governing and is carrying out all the State-like functions responsibly and well. This park area is one of the areas that are still to be passed across to the Northern Territory. Last year the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions recommended that the Commonwealth hand over control of national parks to the Conservation Commission. The honourable member for Cunningham referred to the Kakadu model. I turn his attention to the Cobourg model which shows that State bodies can run it, can run it well, and can accommodate the interests of Aboriginals and local residents. I certainly do not accept the centralist view of the Australian Labor Party as to how it should be run. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I present the reports of the Committee entitled 'Lack of co-operation by the Queensland Government' and 'Strategies to help overcome the problems of Aboriginal town camps', incorporating three dissenting reports, together with the transcripts of evidence and extracts from the minutes of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the reports be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The first report brings to the attention of the Parliament the Committee's extreme concern at the lack of co-operation it has received from the Queensland Government in relation to its inquiries into fringe-dwelling Aboriginal communities and Aboriginal education. The Committee sought the opinion of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in relation to its powers to summon State witnesses to appear before it, and the Attorney-General advised that, under its resolution of appointment, the Committee was not able to summon witnesses from State governments. The Attorney-General's opinion is included as an appendix to the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee considered that the co-operation of the Queensland Government is of particular importance to its inquiries. There are over 46,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people resident in Queensland. This represents over one- quarter of the total Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. There are many initiatives being undertaken in Queensland in relation to Aboriginal affairs and the Committee would have benefited from being able to discuss these initiatives with the officers involved. Unfortunately, this was not possible. The co-operation of State governments is, I understand, a problem for other committees as well as the Aboriginal Affairs Committee, though perhaps it is more acute in this case. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report concerns the economic and social problems of Aboriginal communities and groups living on the fringes of cities, country towns and other communities. The Committee was asked by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Wilson) to undertake this reference, which required it first to identify the problems and then to develop strategies to overcome these problems. It was a most challenging exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was appalled at the deplorable conditions in which Aboriginal fringe-dwellers, or town campers as they are referred to in this report, live. There are up to 20,000 town campers located in about 200 communities throughout mainland Australia. The report highlights inadequate housing, ill health, lack of essential services, unemployment and, in a number of cases, lack of land tenure as the most distressing of the problems facing town campers. The Committee identified three types of town campers: Namely, the permanents, transients and homeless drifters. The broad range of strategies devised will assist all town campers. However the problems of the homeless drifter and transient required separate attention, and I will refer to them later in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no easy solutions to the problems of town campers. The Committee was concerned to address the questions of whether town camping situations ought to survive, and under what circumstances they should continue to exist, or whether there are alternative approaches which Aboriginals should be given the opportunity to pursue. In considering the reasons which have caused some Aboriginals to adopt the lifestyle of the town camper, the Committee concluded that there is no doubt that many town campers find attractions in living in a town camp environment and wish to continue to live as town campers. However, the Committee is also conscious of the long term factors which have forced some Aboriginal people to move from situations in which they lived traditionally into town camps. </PARA>
<PARA> Strategies to overcome the problems of town camps must then have two strands: Firstly, to overcome the existing problems of the town campers and, secondly, to take steps to reduce the drift of people into town camps. The provision of appropriate housing is the first step in an integrated approach to overcome the existing problems of the town campers. The Committee has recommended that there must be increased funding to enable all town campers to be housed by 1988. This could be in important bi-centennial initiative for the benefit of our indigenous people. This will first require a survey of the needs of the town campers, but on a very preliminary estimate, on today's costs, about $200m will be required to ensure that that need is met. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of strategies devised in other areas such as health, education and employment is strongly dependent on the provision of adequate shelter being provided for Aboriginal town campers. The implementation of the strategies to overcome existing problems will involve a substantial degree of Aboriginal self- management, both at the national level through the Aboriginal Development Commission and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, and at the local level through relevant Aboriginal organisations and the town campers themselves. In the areas of health and alcohol, on which previous Committee reports have been given to the Parliament, the Committee recommended greater Aboriginal involvement in all stages of the delivery of services. Much still remains to be achieved in terms of Aboriginal involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the problems experienced by town campers can be overcome through effective co-operation at the local level, and the Committee believes that local government authorities have a significant role to play in the implementation of the strategies in consultation with the local Aboriginal community. The Committee believes that the promotion of a better understanding of town campers in the non-Aboriginal community is of tremendous importance and has recommended that a public awareness program should be developed to help overcome the unsympathetic attitude of the general community towards town campers. These strategies to improve conditions in town camps could increase the attractiveness of the town to Aboriginals in remote communities. However, the attractiveness of towns can be counter-balanced by improving the conditions in home communities and outstations and the Committee has made recommendations for this. These communities would then provide an attractive alternative to town camps for many Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> Steps can be taken to reverse some of the long term factors which have forced some Aboriginals to leave their traditional homes and move in to town camp situations. The wider application of the community development employment projects program would mean that Aboriginal people would not have to leave remote communities to seek employment in town. The Committee was concerned at the dramatic reduction in the number of Aboriginals living on pastoral properties, particularly in the Northern Territory. The granting of excisions to Aboriginal people on pastoral properties could reduce the drift to town. However , the Committee is also concerned at the number of Aboriginal people who are not at present resident on pastoral properties but who might return to properties if excisions were granted. We therefore recommend that procedures be developed to allow former residents of pastoral properties now living in town camps to apply to have areas excised from pastoral properties. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the transients and homeless drifters. Many of the strategies described will be of benefit to them. To provide for homeless drifters, the Committee recommends that the Department of Social Security, as the department responsible for the Homeless Persons Assistance Act, provide funding for night shelters for homeless Aboriginals where local government authorities, in consultation with relevant Aboriginal organisations apply for such shelters. In catering for transients, the Committee believes that alternative camp style accommodation, appropriate to the needs of town campers, should be established. Aboriginal Hostels Ltd and local government authorities would be appropriate funding agencies for the provision of these facilities, local Aboriginal organisations should be given responsibility for operating the facilities wherever possible and the local campers should be consulted about the design of the facilities. Given the importance of maintaining kin relationship to Aboriginal people, provision should also be made for visitors in the accommodation provided in permanent camps. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in this report are several dissenting reports on particular matters of detail. I regret, on this occasion, that unanimity was not possible on all aspects. However, I thank fellow members of my Committee for their interest in the complex issues which have been considered in the course of the inquiry and their ready and willing co-operation to complete what I regard as a very difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we are all a little wiser as a result of this inquiry and our concern for the Aboriginal people remains. However, in this inquiry we have had to look not only at short term palliatives but also at the underlying causes of the problems. We have made an attempt to devise strategies to overcome these problems. Only time will tell whether or not we have been successful. In addition to my fellow Committee members I thank the staff who assisted us in this inquiry-Phil Bergin, the Clerk; Molly Cranswick, who has been with the Committee over very many years and is probably the longest-serving member; David Elder; Max Kiermaier; Penny Duff-Jones; Carol Lam; and the Hansard reporters who accompanied the Committee on its inspections. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on the report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on strategies to help overcome the problems of Aboriginal town camps. Firstly, I commend the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), for his excellent chairmanship of the Committee and the genuine interest and concern he has always shown for Aboriginal people throughout Australia. As he did, I also thank Phil Bergin, David Elder, Max Kiermaier and the other members of the secretariat of the Committee for their assiduous support. As the first Tasmanian to have been on this Committee, my experience on it has given me a new insight into both the growing confidence among Aboriginal communities as they continue to adjust to the immense cultural shock inflicted on them by a dominant white community and the immense problems they also continue to suffer. The living conditions suffered by many town camp communities, which was the subject we concentrated on in this report, are disgraceful. I hope the general Australian community will accept the challenge and provide proper living facilities for these people by 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I feel we should concentrate on two particular issues. First, we should provide proper housing and, second, we should do all we can to help overcome two tragic health problems suffered by Aboriginal people in Australia-infant mortality and alcoholism. I feel very strongly that we should home in on those problems and direct all the resources we can reasonably provide to help overcome them. </PARA>
<PARA> The other brief point I make is that in my view the town camps should not be long term things. I believe that they should be temporary. Ultimately, I am sure that the Aboriginal communities will become part of the general Australian community but, of course, retaining the opportunity and the right to practise their own heritage, as they want to, and their own unique traditions. I have certainly welcomed the chance to be on this Committee. As I said, as the first Tasmanian on the Committee, I have learnt a great deal from our deliberations and visits to the various communities. Again, I commend the Chairman for his work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Reports dealing with Aborigines are always contentious and can generate considerable debate. The report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on strategies to help overcome the problems of Aboriginal town camps will be no exception. But I believe it is an ideal discussion paper that goes further than usual and comes to grips with some very practical solutions to the problems of Aboriginal people living in town camps. Approximately one-third of the town camps in Australia exist in my electorate in the Northern Territory. The submissions that were put to us, naturally, had a very heavy emphasis and concentration on the Northern Territory . A very wide range of views was put by all sectors of the community and various government agencies. Many people in the Northern Territory contributed to the inquiry in very significant ways. They spoke for and on behalf of Aboriginal people or Aboriginal organisations dealing with major social problems. One thing we should acknowledge is that the problems in town camps are very varied. They can include anything from basic needs such as the supply of water to social problems such as alcohol abuse, violence and personal hygiene. I challenge many government agencies to consider the issues and the recommendations of this report very carefully-particularly the Aboriginal Development Commission and all the Commonwealth departments with functional responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make no apology for exerting some influence on other members of the Committee with regard to the involvement of local government in future in areas relating to Aboriginals. The one area where I have recorded my dissent in this report covers the issues of Aboriginal health. The standard and delivery of health services always constitute a most contentious issue. I have suggested in my dissenting report a number of alternative recommendations, particularly in respect of treating the independent Aboriginal health organisations as though they were filling the role of the general practitioner in any community. Similarly, I would like to see the funding of those organisations changed from direct grants to fee for service. This report goes a long way in providing a blueprint for many agencies and I strongly commend it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I endorse the remarks made by the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs-the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock)-and other members of the Committee who have spoken of the service provided to the Committee by a dedicated staff. On the occasions when a report is tabled, it is not my practice to refer to the basic conclusions of the report . It is there and it speaks for itself. On this occasion the Committee makes some very important recommendations which I commend not merely to the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Wilson) and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs but to the relevant State governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me to a matter which I believe ought to be a matter of comment, as it has been by the Chairman. I believe it ought to be a matter of comment and rebuke by the Minister. This Committee received a wide range of support not merely from citizens but from most State governments and the Government of the Northern Territory. The exception was the Government of Queensland. There is a significant Aboriginal population in Queensland. It reflects and has the same problems as Aboriginal communities living in difficult circumstances in other parts of Australia. There are fringe dwellers or camp dwellers in Queensland as there are everywhere else. When any State government, irrespective of its party politics, says that it will not even make the most menial officer in any of its departments available or any knowledge or information available to a parliamentary committee which was urged into this inquiry by the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the present Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) , who believed that it was a critical exercise for the development and pursuance of a strategy for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs then I believe that that has to be viewed seriously by this House and by the Minister. It ought to be an occasion for a rebuke. I think it is an attitude which has no place in Australia on an issue like this where a co-operative approach between Federal and State authorities is necessary if we are to confront these problems and fund solutions to them. I believe that it was in marked contrast to the attitude of every other government. I am pleased that the new State Government for my State of Victoria responded by sending along Dr Coghill, who represents the Premier on Aboriginal Affairs, to assist the Committee in whatever way he could and to provide whatever information he possibly could on behalf of the Victorian Government. I think it is true to say that this report would not have been possible if we did not have that degree of co-operation for and on behalf of those governments that have significant Aboriginal populations. For that reason I believe that the Government of Queensland unfortunately has to be condemned by the approach that was taken on this occasion. I hope that, on future inquiries, we will not be confronted with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The report again endorses what has been the general approach of this Committee on issues concerning Aboriginal affairs. It reaffirms what essentially has been a government policy and has tried to apply the philosophy of Aboriginal involvement and self-determination in what is a very difficult area. I believe that in so doing the majority of the members of the Committee were conscious of trying to provide a report which, while it dealt with particular problems, approached those problems in accordance with what has been the stated political philosphy, approach and policy of the Federal Government. I thank the House for its courtesy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My speech terminated at 12.15 p.m. under sessional orders because of a misunderstanding. I was talking about the need for a national industry development strategy and the fact that scale economies are not always as important as conventional wisdom has suggested. As I said earlier, because the producer-goods manufacturing sector, so vital to the whole economy, is so underdeveloped in Australia, we are losing our ability to innovate. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to remind you of the words of Professor Endersbee, Professor of Engineering at Monash University, who said recently:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether we like it or not we live in a world of technological imperialism, where the economic strength of nations is measured by their technological sophistication. </PARA>
<PARA>According to Professor Endersbee the clearest evidence of our declining involvement in technology is the decline in the work force engaged in manufacturing over the last two decades from 28 per cent to 19 per cent. Japan has far fewer lawyers per capita than we do but it has considerably more scientists, engineers and technologists. Moreover, whilst our expenditure on research and development is about average for the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development countries the private sector component is abysmally low. To cap this the Fraser Government has recently slashed the industrial research and development budget by 10 per cent in real terms. Equally the free trade, free market ideology blinds the Government to the role which the public sector can play in the process of industrial development. </PARA>
<PARA> Japan has a Ministry of International Trade and Industry-MITI-a ubiquitous instrument of Japanese industrial planning and one which has shepherded the Japanese economy through probably the most rapid and successful process of continuous restructuring and response to changing world trends. That is what we want in Australia. It is my personal hope that the Australian Labor Party, in government, will be seeking to build a MITI counterpart in Australia. We are not blind to the multitude of opportunities for industrial growth and development within the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I point out that the Government's prevailing ideology creates yet another serious blind spot-which is not to the benefit of us all-that of the excessive control of Australian industry by foreign interests. Frankly, I do not subscribe to the international conspiracy theory in this area of concern but in many ways this high level of control by overseas interests impedes Australian development. To illustrate this point I refer to a recent article in the Australian Financial Review which reported attempts by the Association of Consulting Engineers to require the Foreign Investment Review Board to set an amount of local engineering input into major resource projects. The Association' s response to the negative treatment it has received from the Government was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Due to the Government's seemingly religious belief that nothing must be done to offend overseas investors, the Association's representations were consistently and arbitrarily rejected, until, in September 1981 the FIRB sought the Association's comments on the proposition that the Australian consulting industry was in danger of being dominated by overseas engineering organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>It is significant to note from that quote that the Foreign Investment Review Board asked only for comments on the proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I return now to my original proposition: This Government has failed to devise a national industry development strategy capable of leading to full employment in the next decade. I believe I have demonstrated this view amply and have given an indication of some aspects of a Labor alternative. The Government's message is one of no hope. Some people are interpreting the statements of one Labor spokesperson as being ones of no hope. I ask for any such interpretation to be ignored. Labor is developing a policy of hope in macro-economic strategy and industry policies. I would have liked to introduce many other factors had the time allowed. My only hope is that before too long Labor will have the opportunity to give Australia a national industry development strategy which is capable of leading to full employment in the next decade. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The report I have just tabled is the twenty-second report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation since its establishment in 1973, and is the fourth report of the present Committee during this Parliament. The Committee resolved to undertake this inquiry on 14 May 1981 but because of other commitments it was not able to commence hearings until early this year, when it was decided that it would be best for the inquiry to be undertaken by a sub-committee. In the early stages of the inquiry the Chairman of the sub-committee was the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) who, as the House would be aware, is now the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs . Upon his elevation to the Ministry he resigned from the Committee as Chairman and his position on the sub-committee was very ably taken over by the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins), who held the position of Chairman of the sub- committee throughout the remainder of the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I was elected Chairman of the Committee, the sub-committee had completed its public hearings and was in the first stages of considering the Chairman's draft report. It was decided, therefore, that the honourable member for Scullin would maintain his position as Chairman of the sub-committee. In view of these circumstances, it is not my intention to refer in detail to the substance of this report. I wish only to indicate to the House that both the sub-committee and the full Committee were unanimous in their support for the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The report represents a balanced assessment of Australia's participation in some of the major international environmental organisations and also looks at Australia's peformance in negotiating and implementing international treaties of an environmental nature. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-At the outset I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), for permitting me to inform the House of the details of the report he has just tabled. As the honourable member for Warringah mentioned, this inquiry was conducted by a sub-committee of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation consisting of myself as Chairman, the honourable member for Calare (Mr MacKenzie) and, following the resignation of the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) upon his appointment as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Drummond). This report has the unanimous support of the members of that sub-committee and, indeed, of the full Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of this inquiry has been to investigate, in the first instance, the role and effectiveness of Australia's participation in international environmental organisations, with the emphasis being placed on the three recognised major bodies in the world-the United Nations Environment Program, the Environment Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Passing reference is made in the report to Australia's involvement in various other international bodies that have environmental application. As mentioned in the introduction to the report, it became evident to the sub-committee during the inquiry-that principally applies to the service departments themselves-that outside of government circles knowledge of the role and purpose of some of these international bodies was fragmented and ill- informed. Accordingly, we have decided that the report should be informative as well as investigatory in nature. In this way it is felt that the findings will be more fully appreciated and assessed by outside observers as well as by members of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction to the report gives an account of the growing incidence of international co-operation in environmental matters. We indicate that world environmental problems must be looked at on a global scale in order to estabish the most effective means of dealing with what has been recognised as the declining state of the global environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the three major bodies referred to earlier, the Committee has acknowledged the useful role which each is playing within its own area of concern. The recommendations generally support the continuation of a high level of Australian involvement in each of these organisations and in others like them . Notwithstanding my previous comments, we did receive criticisms concerning the effectiveness of some organisations. The United Nations Environment Program, for instance, was described by one organisation as a brilliant failure and by another as badly administered and politically motivated. We have recommended that the Government review its commitment to UNEP and closely monitor its involvement in the other international organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> An issue which came to the forefront during this inquiry was the fragmentation of responsibility among government departments in relation to Australia's international involvement. This fragmentation has contributed to what could be said to be an inefficient and wasteful approach to involvement at the Government level. The Committee has made a recommendation calling on the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) to seek ways to overcome this problem. Another extremely important issue that was raised is the lack of information available to this House and its members and to interested voluntary conservation organisations concerning Australia's international commitments. The Committee sees no justification for withholding this sort of information and has made recommendations calling for a greater degree of openness with respect to Australia's international activities. </PARA>
<PARA> A large proportion of this inquiry was devoted to the role Australia has taken in negotiating and implementing treaties of an environmental nature. Within this aspect of the inquiry the role and input of the Australian States became a major issue. For their part, the States want to be fully consulted prior to any negotiations in the formulation of international treaties being commenced. Presently, a draft set of guidelines stipulating principles and procedures for Commonwealth-State consultation on treaties has been formulated. The Committee was told that, to all intents and purposes, these guidelines adequately represent the current practice. We have recommended that the draft guidelines be discussed and finalised at the earliest available Premiers Conference. Many of the States made submissions calling for the insertion of Federal clauses in international treaties. The report addresses itself to this practice in some detail and comes to the conclusion that the matter needs to be resolved between the States and the Commonwealth Government as soon as possible. The Committee believes that there is nothing to be gained by delaying the signing of international treaties which have environmental implications simply because of disagreements between the States and the Commonwealth relating to the issue of Federal clauses. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of concern which came to the Committee's attention in relation to the treaty aspect of international co-operation was that treaties, once ratified, are not necessarily implemented. The Committee has recommended that formal machinery be established at the Commonwealth-State ministerial level to monitor the implementation of international treaties within Australia. In passing, one could refer to the fact that the present controversy over South West Tasmania, the question of its inclusion in the World Heritage List and what might happen flowing from that illustrates something of the Commonwealth-State conflict in the implementation of some of these agreements.</PARA>
<PARA> The role of voluntary conservation organisations in the international scene was an important aspect of this inquiry. Voluntary conservation organisations have been formed in an attempt to achieve better protection of the environment at the community or citizen group level. They are primarily self-funding although several of the major ones receive financial assistance from the Commonwealth through the grants-in-aid scheme. These groups believe that the Government should provide funds to enable at least one non-government representative to attend international conferences as part of the official Australian delegation. The Committee acknowledges the significant role which these groups play and has advised that greater effort should be made at looking at ways by which the non- government organisations can be accommodated. The Committee has recommended that a greater and more formalised system of consultation with these non-government groups be adopted by government departments. It has reiterated proposals made in a previous report of the Committee over the funding of non-government organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The report acknowledges the development of the World Conservation Strategy and, within that strategy, the efforts being made by the Government to develop a national conservation strategy for Australia. This project is still in the formative stages and the Committee has simply recommended that when a draft strategy has been developed it be tabled in this House so that it may be fully debated by the elected representatives of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the report acknowledges Australia's role in Antarctica as a unique area of international involvement. The Antarctic treaty which has been formulated to regulate activity in the area may be subject to review in 1991. The Committee applauds the significant increase in funds being provided to the Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and Technology in the 1982-83 Budget and recommends that this support be maintained at least until 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the staff of the Environment and Conservation Committee who have worked so well for us over the years. On this inquiry Mr Alan Hume was attached to the Committee. He had the carriage of the sub-committee's work. I convey in the House the thanks of the sub-committee to Mr Alan Hume for his assistance in the inquiry and the devotion he showed in preparing what was a rather difficult report because it had to be both informative and investigatory. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I indicate that this report is significant and will be of interest to many members of the House. I urge the Government to consider the recommendations seriously and look forward to a response from the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) in due course. Once again as Chairman of the sub-committee which conducted this inquiry I would like to extend my thanks to the input made by the honourable members for Calare and Forrest towards achieving an harmonious and balanced approach to this issue-one that we could put forward as a unanimous report of the Committee. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> I ask the Minister for Administrative Services a question supplementary to that which I asked him last week regarding the use of the Government Information Unit . Did he state that no officer of the Government Information Unit had done work for the Liberal Party? Did he not in fact mislead the House? Is it true that Mr Bruce Montgomery, an officer of the GIU, worked for the Tasmanian Branch of the Liberal Party prior to the Tasmanian elections?</PARA>
<PARA>At that time there was a bit of a contretemps. The Minister answered that as far as he knew that had not occurred. I said that I had the minutes of the campaign strategy committee of the Liberal Party in Tasmania and that I was prepared to table them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Two years ago the Expenditure Committee set out to identify the reasons for the continued dominance of expenditure on institutional care for the aged and to establish a framework for the provision of services which allow governments to make cost-effective decisions. The Committee estimates that in 1982-83 the Commonwealth will spend approximately $960m on accommodation and home care for the aged. Of this vast sum $890m will be spent on residential accommodation and care and just under $80m on home care and domiciliary services of which the aged are the major users.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned at the continuing high level of expenditure on institutional care. Despite some degree of frailty, many aged people are physically and emotionally capable of living at home. This is, of course, by no means a new revelation. Yet expenditure on institutional care has grown from $ 285m in 1976-77 to an estimated $850m in 1982-83. This is an increase in the order of $565m. By contrast, expenditure on home care and domiciliary-type services has increased by only $45m over the same period. Expenditure on institutional care was nine times greater than expenditure on home care in 1976- 77. By 1982-83 expenditure on institutional care was 11 times greater than expenditure on home care. These comparisons exclude the Commonwealth's outlay on pensioner housing and independent living units. Many previous inquiries on the same subject have all concluded that there was an imbalance in the Commonwealth funding between institutional and home care. Despite those recommendations made by these inquiries to redress the imbalance, little has ever been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> After reviewing the reports that had previously been published and in the light of submissions to my inquiry, the Committee identified the basic reason for the predominance of institutional care as the relatively generous provisions for the construction and operation of nursing homes compared to the resources available for alternative forms of community-based care. The machinery for determining and allocating public financial support to the various sectors of accommodation and home care for the aged is dispersed among Commonwealth, State and local government agencies, together with religious and charitable organisations, individuals and private commercial enterprises. There is, moreover, a lack of coincidence between the responsibility for paying benefits and subsidies on the one hand and responsibility for the supervision, regulation and control of facilities and services on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the evidence that most elderly people wish to remain in their own homes , a number of factors prevent many aged people from being adequately cared for and housed in their own environments. These factors work towards the drift of aged people towards high cost institutional care. These matters are explored in some detail in the body of the report just tabled. The Committee concluded that improvement in the delivery of accommodation and home care services for the aged will not be forthcoming without resolving the fundamental problem that some programs are fully funded by the Commonwealth, some are cost shared and some are not funded at all. This problem is aggravated by the fact that the Commonwealth does not have equal control over all areas of expenditure in which it is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The divided responsibilities between Commonwealth and States is a major shortcoming which gives rise to the inadequate machinery for planning, policy formulation and advice, as well as a lack of accountability in terms of implementation, performance and effectiveness review. The result of these deficiencies has been the dominance and relevant opulence of institutional health-based facilities and the uneven and mostly inadequate supply of community -based domiciliary services. Not all of the blame for these deficiences should be attributed to the problem of divided financial and functional responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the States. The procedures for determining Commonwealth budget allocations for accommodation and home care for the aged tend to reinforce the expansion of nursing home care whilst placing further pressure on the domiciliary sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was advised that the annual Budget processes are designed to result in each program competing for funds with every other program within a limited aggregate expenditure that the Government considers appropriate. But the Committee was also advised that the Budget processes do not automatically result in the examination of efficiency objectives involving several different programs . This focus of the Budget process on individual programs and the neglect of broad efficiency criteria has inevitably led to distortions in the allocation of public expenditure in the area of accommodation and home care for the aged. This is because some programs can be subjected more readily to detailed financial control than others which provide for alternative or complementary forms of care and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisions on the level of funds to be allocated for home care services are taken in the annual Budget context. Limits are generally set on the number of organisations to be funded which in turn sets limits on the amount to be provided in the annual Appropriation Acts. Similar considerations apply to home nursing subsidies and the rate of subsidy under the delivered meals subsidy scheme. By way of contrast, nursing home benefits-we have heard a lot about the increased cost of nursing home benefits from the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton ) in the last few days-and deficit finance subsidies are provided as ongoing authorities under special legislation. The amount provided in the Budget in a year is an estimate based on the number of beneficiaries in receipt of nursing home benefits which, in turn, is largely determined by the number of beds available. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisions giving rise to an increase in the number of beds are taken by the Director-General of Health under the National Health Act. In making those decisions there has been no requirement for formal evaluation of the budgetary implications even though the approval of new nursing homes beds gives rise to significant ongoing increases in Commonwealth expenditure in the form of nursing home benefits. The $750m made available in the Budget this year to fund nursing home benefits was allocated largely without any consideration in the budgetary context. The domiciliary services had to fight for every dollar of the amount of just under $80m that they got from the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, decisions relating to the level of nursing home benefits are made by the Minister for Health on the basis of a fees survey, the methodology of which has never been explained. These decisions, which might involve significant public expenditure, are subsequently endorsed by the Government in October of each year. This procedure is in marked contrast to setting expenditure levels for delivered meals, personal care and domiciliary care benefits where decisions tend to be taken by Ministers in accordance with the Budget processes. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, therefore, it is difficult to envisage how the balance between institutional and community care could ever change. Even with the expansion of domiciliary services the balance need not change particularly if outlays on institutional care continue to grow at an even faster rate. We have seen this year an increase in outlays for institutional care of around 30 per cent. This situation represents a serious deficiency in budgetary management and control. In effect expenditure decisions are taken outside the Budget context and without regard to priority. It follows that there is a serious shortcoming in accountability to the Parliament. I note that concern is again being expressed by the Minister about the increase in nursing home benefits this financial year. Similar concern was expressed last year and in previous years. Nothing has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> The essential problem in this area is that the States determine the standards of nursing care, which in turn sets the level of costs which are reflected in the level of fees, and which are, in turn, reflected in the level of benefits. Unfortunately, those who are concerned with setting the standards-the States- have no responsibility for paying the benefits; that is, there is a breakdown in the accountability between those who are responsible for providing the money-the Commonwealth-and those who are responsible for regulating the services provided- that is, the States. Indeed the Auditor-General, when commenting on the nursing home program in a previous report brought down by the Expenditure Committee, went into the subject of standards of care in a quite lengthy way. In that report the Expenditure Committee recommended that the Commonwealth should adopt a policy of paying to Health and Allied Services Advisory Council standards alone-a recommendation the Minister has not commented upon yet. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has made a number of recommendations which are addressed towards changing the balance between the provision of institutional and home care services. Broadly the Committee's recommendations fall into two categories. The first category concerns changes to programs on the premise that financial arrangements and functional responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the States will not alter, at least in the short term. These recommendations are directed towards removing major problems and anomalies in the administration and delivery of programs, shifting the balance between institutional and home care and directing Commonwealth Government assistance for health and welfare to those in greatest need, in accordance with the Government's own stated policies. These recommendations are contained in chapters 4 to 9 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> The second category of recommendations deals with the Committee's medium to long term strategy for the transfer of responsibility for the administration, delivery and financing of accommodation and home care programs to the States. The Committee's major recommendation is that present arrangements be changed in order to achieve a reduction in the number of programs, responsibility for programs be brought under one Minister, modifications to the financial arrangements to remove disincentives for the expansion of home care services and similar forms of control over all categories of program expenditure and reallocation of resources between institutional and home care. The Committee then recommends that the restructured accommodation and home care programs be transferred to the States, initially through grants, moving towards eventual absorption in the tax sharing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> More specifically, the Committee has recommended that the number of programs should be reduced to an extended care program and a nursing home care program. The Committee envisages that subsidised housing would continue to be provided under the Housing Assistance Act and come within the purview of the Minister for Social Security. The Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth cease subsidising the construction of nursing home beds. The extended care program would be provided as a grant to the States, for domiciliary and home care services. As well as replacing current programs in this area, restrictions currently applied in the separate programs would be removed to allow flexibility in the development of a wider range of services, including an attendant care allowance and funding for assessment teams. </PARA>
<PARA> The nursing home care program would replace current nursing home benefits under the National Health Act and Nursing Homes Assistance Act. Payment would be made to State health authorities in order that they might subsidise nursing home care provided by private, religious and charitable organisations. It is envisaged that the nursing home care grant, while still being calculated primarily on a per capita basis, would be paid formally and directly to organisations and institutions as a subsidy by State health authorities. The minimum patient contribution would still be retained. I believe that the change from individual payments to payments to institutions is a most important recommendation of this Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsidised accommodation would be provided wholly through the Housing Assistance Act. This change would ensure that subsidised accommodation is directed to those in need rather than rehousing those who have sufficient resources, as occurs at present under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act. The Committee has recommended that no more approvals be granted under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954. However the Committee recommends that existing commitments under this legislation be honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee proposes that strict control be exercised over the growth in nursing home accommodation to bring about a further shift in resource allocation between institution and community care. Decisions concerning the provision of additional nursing accommodation would be made by State authorities in the light of their own priorities and in relation to their respective State hospital service systems. It is proposed that where decisions are made on further nursing home accommodation in areas of demonstrated scarcity, generating consequent ongoing expenditure under nursing home care programs, consideration should be given to alternative development of home care services under the extended care program. With both programs funded through grants the relative allocation to each will be a matter for annual decision. The opportunity for Commonwealth to consider both programs at the same time should encourage a more rational approach to planning and resource allocation. It would be an opportunity for considering alternative use of resources so that a nursing home forgone does not necessarily mean funds lost to the State. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has considered that the prime responsibility for the administration and control of aged care programs must rest finally with State governments. The Committee notes, however, that whichever level of government ultimately takes prime responsibility the other must be involved. For example, there is a strong relationship between provision of services for the aged and the payment of income maintenance through the income security system. On the basis of evidence which was presented, the Committee gained the impression that most States would not be unhappy to undertake the administration of all programs concerned with the care and accommodation of the aged. Officers of numerous State health, welfare and housing authorities stated in evidence to the Committee that they were generally in support of the States taking more direct responsibility for expenditure decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that an office of care for the aged be established to advise on policy in respect of the aged among all Commonwealth agencies involved in providing assistance for the aged. At present it is not clear how policy decisions regarding this area ultimately get to Cabinet. Responsibilities are spread through a plethora of departments and agencies. The major purpose of the office would be to develop a national policy on how best to provide assistance to meet the accommodation and home care needs of the aged. The office would assist in advising on and monitoring implementation of this inquiry's recommendations. It could also commission research into areas of concern possibly through the health service research and development grants. Once programs have been transferred to the States the office would have continuing responsibility in representing the Commonwealth in negotiations with the States on the size and distribution of grants proposed in the preceding section, monitoring the effectiveness of the expenditure by States and ensuring consistency in approach between the provision of direct services and the income security system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommended setting up a nursing homes tribunal. People who wished to make a complaint against a particular nursing home, domiciliary service or State about the manner in which it conducted its services could safely and securely lodge a complaint with the tribunal. It became quite clear to the Committee members, during our discussions with various organisations in the States, that confidentiality was not being observed by many State health organisations in handling complaints made against nursing home proprietors. We believe that the tribunal would provide a very necessary vehicle by which people could confidentially make those complaints. It would also allow for an advocacy role to develop in the community so that a wider range of people could take an interest in what happens to the programs for the care of the aged which are put up. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I thank my fellow Committee members-the honourable member for Banks (Mr Mountford), the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde), the honourable member for Perth (Mr McLean), the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher). The Committee's staff-John Howard, the Committee's secretary towards the end of the inquiry, and Bob Harlow , the Committee secretary in the initial stages of the inquiry-did an excellent job in seeing that the Committee got acces to a wide range of people. They were of great assistance in compiling the final report. Ms Anna Howe and Dr Bruce Ford, the Committee's specialist advisers, brought to the Committee a breadth of knowledge that was not possessed by the medical profession alone. I think that the assistance that the Committee received from Dr Ford and Ms Howe went a long way towards ensuring that the report was as comprehensive as it is. Finally, I thank my electorate secretary, Mrs Williamson, whose interest in the care of the aged-her honours thesis was written on the care of the aged-sparked my interest in this area. Her advice and guidance throughout the inquiry have been invaluable to me. I also thank the other members of the Committee and the specialist advisers. I thank the House for its time and once again thank my fellow Committee members. I particularly thank the honourable member for Moore for the time that he put into the final drafting of the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you for your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will be very brief. I just wanted to clarify the position as to why I voted the way I did in that division. As I understood the situation an arrangement was made with the Whips that there would be two speakers on each side allowed to speak in relation to the tabling of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure which I chair. The Deputy Chairman of that Committee has just tabled a report. The report took two years to complete and many hours of committee members' time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply make the point that if members of this House are expected to sit on committees and to put in years and years of work, to be prepared to sit at 8.30 in the morning until crazy hours at night and to take time out of their recess periods-when probably they would be better served being in their electorates- then if the House cannot find the time to allow those members to make brief statements in support of tabling statements made by chairmen, I think it is a very sorry situation. I think I speak on behalf of many members of this House who serve on committees. I know my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Tambling) had truncated the remarks that he was making today. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that the House has a very heavy program and that there are all sorts of external pressures on us. But that does not remove the fact that private members who serve this House on committees ought to have some basic rights, and the House ought to be able to get its business and procedures into order in such a way that that can be accommodated. It was for no other reason than that that I voted for the procedural motion that Standing Orders be suspended to allow honourable members, who were included in the arrangement made between the Whips, to speak in relation to the tabling of the report. </PARA>

<PARA> Ordered that the reports be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The 199th report is a most significant report. It reflects upon the whole financial administration and brings to the fore the question of the proper standards that should be applied in government accounting. I commend the work done by my colleague on the Public Accounts Committee Senator John Watson, and other members of the Sub-committee who were involved in this most important review. In June 1980 a joint working party consisting of officials from the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General's Office published an exposure draft and abridged report on proposed guidlines for the form and standard of financial statements of Commonwealth undertakings. The joint working party asked my Committee to comment on the guidelines. This report provides a substantive response to that request.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee considered that the joint working party's request was timely because it had been apparent for many years that financial statements of many statutory authorities do not reflect the full scope of management accountability which devolves from government. While acknowledging that reserve powers are usually granted to Ministers under enabling legislation for the creation of authorities, the Committee considers that it is management which shapes the destiny of undertakings in every day affairs and operations. In such circumstances we cannot support propositions that statements of receipts and payments indicating legal and financial compliance with statutes and appropriations properly convey adequate disclosure of operations in financial terms. </PARA>
<PARA> Managers of undertakings should be accountable for the use of all resources over which they exercise control. Acquisitions and depletion of resources must be integrated with operating transactions so that informed decisions about potential solvency and the capacity to undertake objectives of the authority can be made. This theme is central to the formation of the guidelines and modern concepts of effective public sector management. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of its deliberations, which have extended over nearly two years, the Committee has formulated several recommendations designed to improve the standard of financial reporting at all levels of government throughout Australia . Our major recommendations are:</PARA>
<PARA> A genuine research effort should be mounted employing resources from both within the accounting profession and outside of it, to construct systematically a relevant theoretical framework for financial reporting by public sector authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Any adoption of private sector accounting standards should be seen as a short term solution. </PARA>
<PARA> Cash-based accounting should be eliminated as the primary focus for financial reporting by authorities except for extremely small agency situations and that accrual accounting should be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds statements of Commonwealth authorities are to adopt a total resources rather than working capital or cash basis of funds and are to be published as part of the formal financial statements. </PARA>
<PARA> The joint working party should join with accounting and other interested groups to further evaluate the nature of financial reporting by public sector bodies. Government financial support at Commonwealth and State levels should be sought by a suitably organised proposal from the accounting profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Program statements should be prepared by all government undertakings except where such a statement would disclose necessarily confidential information. </PARA>
<PARA> The audited financial statements of all government organisations should be presented to Parliament within six months of the close of the financial year to which they relate. </PARA>
<PARA> An Accounting Standards Review Committee should be established to examine government accounting and reporting standards, and to make recommendations for improvement. This Committee should consist of representatives from the Parliament, the Public Service and the accounting profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussions should be held between relevant Commonwealth and State government Ministers and officials on the desirability of introducing a uniform set of accounting standards and procedures for public sector authorities at all levels of government throughout Australia. An appropriate mechanism for this issue to be considered would be for a working party to be established by the Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA>The members of my Committee fully support efforts to increase relevance, uniformity in methods and consistent application of sound accountancy so that financial reporting in the public sector will better serve the community. We believe that parliamentary support for this undertaking will enhance the commitment of statutory bodies to the proposed guidelines and strengthen the co- operation needed for their successful adoption and implementation. The Committee is heartened to learn that the general response to the exposure draft has been favourable and encouraging. In considering the question of accounting standards for government the Committee, by necessity, has had to examine the adequacy of many private sector methods. In its examination of the private sector standard- setting process the Committee is concerned only with its relevance to the public sector. No judgments are made as to the adequacy of the process or standards for the private sector. In the longer term it may be possible to draw a closer link between the two sectors in terms of reporting. In the meantime the Committee observes that differences, including the noticeable tendency of the community to identify the operations of statutory bodies with the appropriate Minister rather than with management, are becoming more pronounced. If the control of these bodies is seen as a function of the Westminister system of government, control may need modification. A distinct and rigorous philosophy of accounting in the public sector may also need to be formulated. </PARA>
<PARA> At an early stage in the preparation of this paper the Committee decided that it was essential for government accountants throughout Australia to have the opportunity to discuss and to evaluate the issues addressed by the joint working party's report. To fulfil this requirement the Committee, in association with the government accountants group of the Australian Society of Accountants, conducted seminars in all State capital cities which were attended by over 1,000 accountants. This indicates that there is a high level of professional concern in regard to these issues. The degree of enthusiasm shown by all sections of the accounting profession to participate in these discussions undoubtedly impressed the Committee. It is conscious that a strong effort from all professional accounting interests is required if substantial progress is to be made to improve financial reporting in the public sector. In common with its other discussion papers, the Committee recognises that many of the views expressed are contentious and would therefore welcome further contributions or comments from interested individuals or organisations on any aspect of this discussion paper. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee wishes to express its appreciation to its senior adviser on accounting, Dr Max Aiken, and also to thank Mr David Shand, Dr Ian Ball and the many others for their considerable assistance and advice in the preparation of this document. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9J4">Mr SHACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I regret that there is limited time in which to debate this report, but the Committee believes, however, that it is more important to make the report available now for the information both of honourable members and other interested persons so that informed public discussion might ensue outside this place. Unfortunately also, copies of this report are limited at the moment due to printing constraints, but there will be copies for perusal in the Table Office and the Parliamentary Library. It is expected that there will be more copies for distribution to honourable members shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly pleased to table this report as I was privileged to lead the sub-committee which conducted this very useful and interesting investigation. The sub-committee comprised Senator Georges, Senator Watson, Senator Lajovic and also the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has particular significance to the community and to the Parliament on three accounts. Firstly, bilateral overseas aid is a major item in the Commonwealth Budget. Bilateral aid forms the major part of Australia's official development assistance budget, one which totalled $727,207,000 for 1982-83. This is nearly half of one per cent of Australia's gross national product, or over 1. 5 per cent of total Commonwealth Government outlays-that is, 1.5 per cent of all the moneys expended by the Commonwealth on Commonwealth programs and of moneys provided to the States, local government and other agencies to support the programs they administer. Secondly, the report is significant because it provides a rare opportunity for the Parliament to examine the way in which this enormous sum of money is expended. Such opportunities are, unfortunately, infrequent. A substantial part of the Committee's report is devoted to a description of the bilateral aid program, suggestions as to how the aid program could be more efficiently examined by the Parliament and, perhaps most importantly, how public and community awareness of the principles which guide the aid program and the resources devoted to it can be increased. Thirdly, the report has a significance in that it is the first report of the Public Accounts Committee on an efficiency audit. It treads new ground for the Committee. The Committee devoted the final chapter of its report to the examination of some of the issues and problems raised by this form of auditing and to suggestions as to how efficiency auditing could be made more effective and useful to administrators and the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee divided its conclusions in respect of the bilateral program into four. After a brief summary of the Auditor-General's recommendations and the resources devoted to the overseas aid program and its administration, the Committee focused on four areas in which it believes changes to current administrative practices and arrangements will have the greatest beneficial impact on the aid program. These areas are: The impartiality of the aid program; the public profile of the overseas aid program; the resources available to the Australian Development Assistance Bureau to administer the program; and, finally , arrangements for the management of the program. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the report's recommendations form an integrated package designed to improve Australian and overseas perceptions of the quality of Australian bilateral overseas aid, I should like to highlight a few of the most significant recommendations and conclusions. The Committee believes that overall the Australian aid program is adequately managed within the resources available to it, that it has a high reputation overseas, and that it has provided an important input into the development of Third World countries. The Committee also believes, though, that there is significant scope for improvement in the quality of Australian aid in terms of the management of the bilateral aid program. The Committee considers that the audit report provides a blueprint for efficient and effective aid program administration and that, with only limited exceptions, the Auditor-General's recommendations should be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does, however, have reservations about the demands that the Auditor-General's suggestions will make on the staffing and physical resources of ADAB and believes that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) will require special assistance at the parliamentary level to continue to fulfil his parliamentary and ministerial responsibilities. Therefore, the Committee recommended that the Department of Foreign Affairs urgently examine, in consultation with the Public Service Board, the staffing and physical resources available to ADAB. It also recommended that the Government should consider the appointment of a parliamentary secretary for overseas aid to assist the Minister for Foreign Affairs on overseas aid matters. The Committee believes that this latter recommendation and the recommendation that the Minister for Foreign Affairs at regular intervals issue a policy statement to the Parliament, to his department and to the public are essential prerequisites to the development of parliamentary and community debate on the nature and direction of Australia's overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of efficiency audits generally, the Committee recommended that the Auditor-General prepare guidelines specifying in broad terms the scope of efficiency audits to assist the proposed Government review of efficiency auditing, and that the report of the Government review be referred to a parliamentary committee for further examination when completed. The Committee believes that overseas aid plays such a signfiicant role in Australian relations with developing countries and is such a significant proportion of Commonwealth outlays that it is essential that development aid issues should be widely understood and debated in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I should like to thank all those Government departments, independent aid agencies and individuals who made submissions to and appeared before the Committee. Their input has been invaluable to the inquiry. I should also like to thank the Public Accounts secretariat for their work, especially Mr Alec Nicholson who was the secretary to the inquiry while on placement with the PAC as part of the Public Service Executive Development Scheme. I commend the report to honourable members. </PARA>

The House may recall that the Joint Committee on Publications, in its report entitled 'Inquiry into the Purpose, Scope and Distribution of the Parliamentary Paper Series', made a number of recommendations concerning the free distribution of principal parliamentary publications, excluding Hansard. The Presiding Officers, in their response to the Joint Committee's report in November 1979, accepted the recommendation that the free distribution list for principal parliamentary publications be revised. The Joint Committee has been advised that the first part of the review, that concerning publications other than parliamentary papers, has been completed and will result in considerable savings through a substantial reduction in both the quantity of documents distributed and the number of wrappers prepared and sent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The documents concerned are Notice Papers of both Houses, proof and final Journals of the Senate, proof and final Votes and Proceedings and Bills of both Houses. Reductions in print runs were effected from the commencement of the Budget sittings and estimates provided by the Australian Government Publishing Service indicate that savings at this stage amount to $420 per sitting of the Senate and $660 per sitting of the House. On the current distribution this will result in a saving to the Parliament of over $75,000 per year. The Joint Committee has been assured by the Presiding Officers that the distribution will be kept under review on a regular basis and looks forward to the expedition of stage 2 of the review relating to the revision of the free distribution list for parliamentary papers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Government has utterly failed to grasp the significance of structural change in the Australian economy and has done nothing to ease the transition of Australia's traditional manufacturing base to new, diversified and more highly skilled forms of employment. I want to talk about the problem of over-specialisation. Employment in manufacturing, like employment in agriculture and mining but unlike employment in services, tends to be heavily concentrated in particular regions. As a result significant rises or falls in aggregate employment in manufacturing are not evenly spread throughout the nation but affect only the already high figures for manufacturing employment in particular cities, suburbs or regions. This compounds the already serious problems that exist in all cities dominated by over-specialisation and dependence on a narrow employment base. This is a universal phenomenon. Manchester, with its dependence on textiles, Detroit with its dependence on motor manufacturing, Seattle with its dependence on aircraft manufacturing, Boston with its dependence on footwear and textiles, or Liege with its dependence on coal are all in the same category. In Australia Sunshine depends on heavy engineering and chemicals, Wollongong on coal and steel, Whyalla on steel, Newcastle on coal and steel and Geelong on motor vehicles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current unemployment figure of 7.8 per cent, is not evenly spread throughout Australia. There tends to be a bunching effect in traditional industrial areas, where unemployment figures are sometimes two or three times as great. I think the community does not recognise that. This Government does not permit the Australian community to understand and recognise this, because since March 1981 it has been impossible to get local Commonwealth Employment Service figures. The scandalous reason for that decision was to prevent members of Parliament from being able to identify with a high degree of precision just how serious things were in their own areas. When the aggregate figure for unemployment spreads across the community, it disguises local impact. </PARA>
<PARA> Without exception the Federal electorates with the highest unemployment rates are those with the heaviest proportion of workers in manufacturing. In New South Wales in the seat of Cunningham the proportion in 1976 was 41.8 per cent, in Reid it was 35 per cent, in Prospect it was 33.6 per cent and in Blaxland it was 32 per cent. In Victoria in Gellibrand the figure in 1976 was 41 per cent, in Lalor 37.5 per cent, Corio 36.2 per cent and in Wills 35.8 per cent. In South Australia the highest figure was 32.7 per cent in Port Adelaide. The States with the largest traditional manufacturing base-that is Victoria, where according to 1976 figures 23.5 per cent of workers were in manufacturing, New South Wales, where the figure was 20.8 per cent; and South Australia, where the figure was 20 .7 per cent-are in more serious employment difficulties than are Queensland and Western Australia, in which States the proportion of workers in manufacturing was less than 14 per cent. Tasmania, which tried for heavy industrialisation and failed, now faces economic disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> The appalling rapidity of the employment collapse in our major industrial areas in 1982 suggest that we are entering a new era which will pose enormous challenges to social stability and our capacity to provide political leadership. Technological change must not be isolated as a unique cause of unemployment; nor should its role be minimised. Current unemployment results from a synergistic interaction of a number of factors. The first is the emergence of a global economy with its interlocking mechanisms. We see the paradoxical situation of our textile industry being dependent on cheap imported yarns, without which it cannot survive, while at the same time wanting protection against imported finished goods, which it must have to survive. The second factor is the development of excessive specialisation in particular regions; that is to say, one-crop economies such as Ghana or Tasmania. The third factor is the changing direction of demand away, for example, from durable commodities such as cars to services such as travel, from aluminium to plastics, from tinned fruit to fresh fruit. These are very dramatic changes in demand. The fourth factor is a combination of a contraction of venture capital, and impact of high interest rates and inflation as a result of which investors play safe and consumers cannot afford to buy. The fifth factor is the phenomenon of technological change that fewer people can produce far more goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1965 and 1982, 2,060,000 new jobs were created in Australia in a time of generally rising labour participation rates. What was the net contribution of manufacturing to those new jobs? The answer, to the surprise of many, is none- not one. There was a net loss of 150,000 jobs, that is minus 7.3 per cent of new jobs, in that period. Of course, some new enterprises were begun in the industrial sector but these were more than offset by the manufacturing enterprises which expired or transferred off-shore. This is a phenomenon occuring in the United States of America as well. Much traditional industry in the north of the United States is moving off-shore to either the Caribbean or some of the low cost countries in Asia or Europe. You have probably heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, that people in the United States ask: 'How can you tell the Titanic and Detroit apart?' The answer is: 'Detroit has got a better orchestra'.</PARA>
<PARA> We can identify 10 problem areas in Australia. I will put them in order. No. 1 is Wollongong-Port Kembla. No. 2 is South Australia generally. No. 3 is Tasmania generally. No. 4 is the western suburbs of Sydney. No. 5 is the western suburbs of Melbourne. No. 6 comprises the Victorian provincial cities of which Ballarat is an outstanding example-it is outstandingly represented here too-as is the city of Dandenong, which is also outstandingly represented here. No. 7 is the Newcastle-Hunter River Valley area-I have to say the same thing again for my colleague, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown). No. 8 is North Queensland, perhaps not quite so well represented. No. 9 is the Rockingham- Kwinana-O'Connor basin in Western Australia. No. 10 is the seat of Geelong represented by my colleague, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say something about South Australia because the election there has focused people's attentions remarkably over the last few weeks. Under David Tonkin's disastrous Liberal Government, South Australia is slowly chugging backwards like the African Queen. Under the Premier's soporific rule South Australia has had the highest unemployment of any mainland State for 32 consecutive months. In August 1982 unemployment was 1.7 per cent above the national average-that is, 8.4 per cent-and it has deteriorated markedly since then. The figures are made even more serious when it is realised that South Australia's population has been falling under Mr Tonkin and is now behind the population of Western Australia making it the least populous mainland State. About 16,000 people have voted with their feet by migrating to other States. There is no evidence whatsoever of the 7,000 new jobs promised by Mr Tonkin in his 1979 election policy. The Premier has been so carried away by the prospect of a resources boom that he has put all the State's eggs in the one basket. He talks of nothing else. Even if all the mineral projects come on stream they will make a very modest contribution to employment growth. This may do positive harm if it leads to an excessive reliance on minerals as a wealth generator especially in a State as heavily urbanised as South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> South Australia has been particularly hard hit by changes in patterns of demand especially in motor manufacturing and the white goods industries. Between 1966 and 1980 the proportion of average household weekly earnings devoted to the purchase of motor vehicles fell from 4 per cent to 2.7 per cent-a decline of 48 per cent-hardly an indication of bouyant future employment prospects in that area. People are keeping their cars for longer periods and spending their money on other things. Expenditure on household appliances, such as washing machines, refrigerators and electronic goods has been absolutely stable in that period-2.5 per cent in 1966 and 2.3 per cent in 1980. South Australian firms such as Horwood Bagshaw Ltd, General Motors-Holden's Ltd, Dulux Australia Ltd, Titan Manufacturing Co. Pty Ltd, Actil Marketing Ltd, Scott Bonnar Ltd, Tubemakers of Australia Pty Ltd and Northern Engineering Industries have laid off large numbers of workers in recent months. Timely action by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) has persuaded the Government to attempt to prevent a collapse of Kelvinator Australia Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> In his excellent policy speech last Monday John Bannon, the Leader of the Opposition and, after 6 November South Australia's new Premier, recognised the need to diversify the traditional employment base by creating 'sunrise' industries to supplement the 'sunset' industries in long term decline. He promised to set up a South Australian enterprise fund to assist the expansion of industry by providing venture capital. This fund would pump investment into high technology and export-based industries. He will set up also a special technology task force and provide real incentives to attract high technology industries to South Australia. He recognises the need to raise skill levels in this post- industrial era. I know that, like me, John Bannon is an enthusiast for biotechnology and South Australia is well placed to develop this as a major industry and as a wealth generator. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania, like Ghana, illustrates all too clearly the dangers of relying on an economic strategy based on natural resources and resource enhancement to the virtual exclusion of all other factors. The result is that Tasmania has hawked itself around purely as a supplier of cheap electricity and nothing else. Tasmania already generates more electricity per capita than any other place on earth, with Labrador a close second. Neither could be regarded as an industrial El Dorado. At the moment 60 per cent of Tasmania's electricity sustains three huge companies-Comalco Ltd, Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd and Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd which between them account for less than 2 per cent of Tasmania's jobs. All three commodities produced by hyper- hyroindustrialisation in Tasmania have dubious futures. What was originally regarded as a sure formula for success now looks like a recipe for disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment in Wollongong and Port Kembla has been discussed very eloquently here this week on a number of occasions. I want to point to the changing nature of the labour force. I think this can be illustrated by comparing the electorate of Cunningham which includes Wollongong with the electorate of Bradfield-the safest Liberal seat in New South Wales. In Bradfield only 10 per cent of people were employed in manufacturing in 1976, many of them, no doubt, in management and other white collar occupations; less than one-quarter of the Cunningham figure. In Bradfield just on 65 per cent were employed in 'Information' the ' show and tell' sector of the economy-exactly 2 1/2 times as many people than in Cunningham. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table comparing employment in Bradfield and Cunningham. </PARA>

People employed in the ten problem areas have never been given adequate opportunities to upgrade and diversify their skills. They are working in a 1950s-type industrial environment while the rest of Australia and our industrial contemporaries are in the 1980s. Honourable members opposite, including the Minister for Industry and Commerce ( Mr Peacock) who is at the table, are to blame for that. Education will be increasingly important in Australia's future as an employment area in its own right, to provide the base for future economic development and for a more complex and intellectually challenging society. To those people who doubt the capacity of nations to absorb increasing numbers of graduates in the economy I point to the example of Japan and seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table from Scientific American for October 1982 setting out the education level of new entrants to the labour force in the period 1950 to 1980.</PARA></TALK.START>

To summarise the table I should explain that in 1950 the highest education of Japanese labour force entrants was as follows: 86 per cent from middle school; 14 per cent from higher school; and less than one per cent from college and university. By 1980 only 6 per cent of Japan's new work force entrants had only middle school education; 55 per cent had completed higher school; and 39 per cent had come from colleges or universities-a 3,900 per cent increase in a 30-year period. The table that I have incorporated should give Australians something to ponder about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much can be done also by decentralising government facilities; for example, the plan of the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) to have a regional taxation office in Newcastle, to set up transport testing facilities and pilot training at Albury-Wodonga and so on. It can be done. Much could be done for Ballarat and Dandenong. Much can be done for the area represented by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Scott). This Government will not do it. But the Australian Labor Party, in its science and technology policy, sets out 16 new areas of likely development which will be very important as wealth generators. It is essential that we elect a Labor government not only in South Australia but also, at the earliest possible moment, to take power in Canberra so that we can transform the face of the nation by allowing us to create new ' sunrise' industries which will enable us to be in the forefront of the industrial and technological developments in the Western world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is an intelligent and respected member of this Parliament. But when he speaks on issues such as the matter of public importance before us today he gives the impression of being farsighted in a narrow minded way. Nevertheless, in reality he is bound by the dogma of the outmoded philosophy which is the fount of the party that sits opposite; a philosophy which was out of date when it was first written into the platform of the Australian Labor Party. During his attack on the South Australian Government- indeed in a way on the Tasmanian Government but more particularly on the South Australian Government-he sought to indicate the thrust of development that would occur in South Australia were the Tonkin Government to be defeated on Saturday, 6 November. The reality is that when Labor was in office in that State it was rapidly turning the area into an industrial museum. That is why the Tonkin Government was elected. It has turned that situation around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After all the advocacy of the honourable member let us focus very briefly on what Labor did when it was in office. I do not want to spend too much time on it . Honourable members will recall that when Labor was in government it brought the Australian manufacturing industry close to total collapse. Tariffs were slashed by 25 per cent across the board without warning and without consultation with industry. The investment allowance was abolished and export incentive schemes were drastically curtailed. The reality is that the Opposition appears to have a fundamental confusion about the nature of the problems currently facing certain regions. A number of them were identified by the honourable member for Lalor. It is not only a problem of structural change, it is also one which is more directly the result of the current economic recession facing countries world wide. The adverse impact is not isolated to industries facing long term structural difficulties, nor to regions specialising in particular activities. Equally hard hit are the growth industries and, indeed, the more diversified regions. Few sectors of the economy have been spared the effects of the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is acutely aware that structural change is inextricably linked with growth and development. Our economic and industry policies therefore do not attempt to halt structural change but to facilitate it, to ensure that the necessary restructuring is permitted to occur at a manageable pace and, importantly, without undue social and economic disruption. They are doing this by attacking inflation and providing an economic environment conducive to investment, growth and the creation of sustainable job opportunities and also by encouraging the development of a stronger, more competitive manufacturing sector through the provision of incentives for development-for example, investment, industrial research and export development and the like-and by the gradual reduction of assistance to the highly protected sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a long term process and the policies in place are working, but they would have been more effective if honourable members opposite had sought to get an effective cohesion between any person in government and the trade union movement. Instead, they have associated with a number of the trade unions which have hindered attempts at improving the productivity of industry by disrupting our exports and our position as a reliable supplier, by demanding cost- increasing shorter working hours, adding enormously to unit labour costs, and by claiming excessive wage increases which, more than anything else, have contributed to our high inflation rate. Short term interventionist palliatives simply will not provide the basis for a sustainable recovery. Economic recovery firmly based on growing world trade and positive measures to improve industry's efficiency and competitiveness rather than relying on defensive measures are the only long term solutions. This is why the Government has continued to pursue its anti-inflationary strategy of fiscal restraint and tight monetary control. This is also why the Government has significantly improved depreciation provisions to provide investment and enable industry to take full advantage of the economic recovery. To shift from this approach would be a sell-out to those people the Opposition is claiming need help. We have heard from the honourable member for Lalor this afternoon that he wants to move people as well as industry. Of course , interestingly enough--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MI4">Mr PEACOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Implicit within the honourable member's argument, and implicit within the very dogma upon which his party is based, is the compulsory control and direction of labour. The honourable member cannot implement his schedule of nationalisation or his blueprint of socialism without control and direction of labour. That is what lies behind it all. It is not in his books-love his books- but his speeches give him away. All he is doing is putting forward a transparent case of the old argument of moving people as if they were digits in a computer. They are not units, they are people. Furthermore, we have the honourable member coming in on a day on which the one national daily editorialises on the speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) as to how he would bring about change in the economy, not by dint of the methods proffered by the honourable member but by the schedule he produced in this Parliament and outside it yesterday. What did the Australian editorialise on the official Labor program? After setting it out the editorial said, and I believe accurately:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Hayden has picked all the soft options and flung them together in a package that would have disastrous implications for unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> His package would be inflationary, when the inflation rates of our trading competitors are falling. He would be neither helping those already unemployed, or securing the prospects of those in jobs now. Recovery depends on reducing our inflation rate which requires belt-tightening, not a spending fling. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial is headed: 'Raising false hope for the out-of-work'. The honourable member should not seek to mislead us with any other resolutions introduced into this Parliament today. That is his plan in the short term, that is what one newspaper thinks of it, and I endorse the remarks whole-heartedly. I wish there could be an approach to wage fixation that was sensible rather than the divisive and disruptive activities that are being displayed within the community. We have had brought home to us very forcibly over the past few months those sorts of divisions. If we could get together on issues rather than being apart all the time, we might be serving the country's interests by a collective effort to restore the economy more quickly to its long run growth path. We do not see that from the Opposition. Regrettably, I become divisive myself by drawing attention to what the Australian Labor Party is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the Labor Party got to offer over and above what the Leader of the Opposition brought down yesterday? If we peruse the policy documents that have been issued, it is difficult to know. The Opposition has an industry policy, allegedly, but what is it? A package of statements. The policy has not yet been issued. As I said the other day in relation to the Opposition's housing policy, which it is allegedly rethinking, we have had decades in which to illustrate that when the Labor Party is allegedly rethinking a program it is merely rearranging its prejudices. We know that in regard to industry it will probably have some special policies for certain industries. What is new in that? This Government's sectoral policies are in place and working well. We are told that the Opposition will set up special task forces on 'key industries', on 'new industries', on 'regional industry problems'. In other words, a Labor Government will look at the problems. What sort of excuse for a policy is that?</PARA>
<PARA> We can also expect a Labor Government to seek to direct industries to certain regional areas. Again, we have the old compulsory control and direction of labour, that essential element of socialism. This looks very like a re-run of its old growth centre policies. What an abysmal failure they were, despite a threefold increase in urban and regional development expenditure under Labor. We all recall the total ineffectiveness of the Regional Employment Development scheme and the National Employment and Training scheme, which were originally designed to overcome the regional unemployment problem. These artificial programs simply did not work, despite the money that was lavished on them by Labor, and they will not work in the future. The Labor Party persisently refuses to recognise that in order to achieve a healthy industrial sector, Australian industry has to retain its competitive edge. Only in this way can it achieve ascendancy over cost pressures and the uncertainties of the international environment. The Labor Party refuses to recognise that there is a world wide recession and it persists in hoodwinking the Australian people that its so- called social contract with the unions will bring about industrial harmony. It is no more than a sell-out to certain vested interests in the trade union movement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it is endemic in the Labor Party program. That is what is important. Regrettably, the honourable member is not the sole determinant of policies for his party. Indeed, even if he has a voice on it he cannot express it if the party disagrees with him in the Caucus room. We can express a different view in this chamber. He cannot do it in there. This is the old shackle and control again. He should not ask me to accept what he has put forward today as official Labor policy. Let him look at the platform, look at the policy and, moreover, look at the record. What about the prices and incomes policy proposed by the Labor Party? Did we hear about that today in regard to the manufacturing industry? Frankly, that spells doom for the Australian industry. In no way can we expect to remain internationally competitive when elements of the trade union movement continue to state publicly that excessive demands for entering into this so-called social contract have their support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The trade union movement is already insisting on the following in the Labor Party's compact: Full automatic wage indexation, annual wage increases in line with productivity improvements, an 'effective' capital gains tax, significant increases in social welfare spending, a prices justification tribunal, regulation of profit levels, regulation of non-wage incomes-dividends, rents, interest payments, directors' fees, incomes of lawyers, doctors, shopkeepers, et cetera-and trade union involvement, of course, in economic advice and planning. In other words, a Labor government would have to abdicate its responsibility for government in favour of the trade union movement to the detriment of our manufacturing industry and, therefore, to regional development. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that in practice Labor's proposals would mean support for higher wage rises than the economy can afford together with government provided benefits which would increase government spending massively and fuel inflation as a result. The Labor Party holds up its prices and incomes policy as 'the cornerstone of the nation's economic management under a Labor government'. It is a sort of magic wand to cure all ills or, as one respected commentator in this country described it, 'Labor's own special brand of snake oil'. </PARA>

They have not worked in other countries-the much vaunted social compact in Britain was admitted to be an abject failure and accommodated a 27 per cent increase in earnings in one year alone. One can easily predict the same fate in Australia. The real problem is the economic recession. The only lasting solution is to restore the level of economic activity. Whilst we cannot do very much to affect the international situation we can do something on the domestic front. This is being done. We will continue to look at ways of complementing this overall strategy. An essential ingredient which would help the recovery, and particularly the predicament, of those unemployed and which has up until now proved quite elusive is a more realistic approach to wages, to hours of work and to conditions. That is the approach the Government would take; not that in the material put forward by the honourable member for Lalor which does not represent the total complement of Labor's approach to industry, to regional development or to job creation-quite the contrary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the new River Murray Waters Agreement between and among the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia for the control and management of certain water resources of the River Murray system. The new agreement is set out in the Schedule to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> From the earliest days of Federation, the Commonwealth has demonstrated a strong interest in River Murray matters, initially reflecting its concern for interstate trade implications of river traffic but more importantly in latter times reflecting a recognition of the national importance of water conservation and associated land development based on the River Murray. In fact, River Murray problems, which were already claiming a good deal of attention from 1880 onwards , probably accelerated the advent of Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Linked with the history of River Murray development, we have such great names as Alfred Deakin, recognised as the father of irrigation in Australia, and the Chaffey brothers, brought out by Deakin from California to start the first irrigation development at Mildura. Isaacs, Barton, Reid, Symon and Glynn-amongst others-alluded constantly to multi-State aspects of the River Murray waters during the great convention debates which preceded Federation. They identified the highly controversial and contested issues relating to River Murray management. </PARA>
<PARA> The first River Murray Waters Agreement, to resolve developing conflicts in the use of River Murray waters, was signed in 1914, legislation came into effect in 1915 and the River Murray Commission was established in 1917. The new agreement now before this Parliament is the result of the first major review of this important inter-governmental agreement since those early days. River water quality, particularly in respect of salinity, has now become a key factor in the long term utilisation of what is regarded by many as the nation's most important water resource. Under the new agreement, the responsibilities of the River Murray Commission have been extended to include water quality matters, in addition to the responsibilities it has had in the past for water quantity in the main stem of the river and associated storages.</PARA>
<PARA> The new agreement charges the River Murray Commission with the responsibility for monitoring the quality of water in the river, in tributary inflows and in the Commission's storages. To this end, a monitoring network is already well established. The Agreement also authorises the River Murray Commission to formulate water quality objectives or standards for key locations along the river. It is against these objectives or standards that the Commission will have to develop its water management strategies. </PARA>
<PARA> State authorities are required to inform the Commission of proposals under their consideration which could have a significant effect on water quality or quantity in the river, and to provide the information necessary to enable their likely impact to be assessed. Obviously, the agreed water quality objectives will provide important bench-marks in this regard, and the Commission will then make representations, as necessary, to the appropriate State authority on such proposals. There is already clear evidence of the States' co-operation in implementing this provision of the new Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Also worth noting is that the water distribution provisions have been completely recast to ensure not only an equitable distribution of water between the States but also to allow each State maximum flexibility in meeting its own particular water demands. Even more importantly, the provision will enable account to be taken of the quality of tributary inflows and drainage returns to the river from each State in assessing their respective shares of the water resources under the Commission's control. This procedure should provide a strong incentive to each State to improve the quality of flows in its tributaries and from outfalls to the river. </PARA>
<PARA> In keeping with modern water management principles, the new Agreement now comprehends important river water management objectives for the Commission, additional to its traditional role of supplying water for irrigation. These could include flood mitigation, environmental protection, recreational uses et cetera. For over 65 years, the Commission has operated effectively within the powers defined for it by the four Governments. With the enlargement of these powers to encompass water quality, inter-governmental co-operation in the management of the river systems now enters a more difficult phase. </PARA>
<PARA> As in every river system, water quality is the end product of practically all major activities in the vast catchment of the River Murray-in dryland agriculture, irrigation, forestry and urban/industrial development. These are all areas of State responsibility, and the realities of the Australian Constitution require that many of the Commission's water quality responsibilities will have to be pursued in consultation and co-operation with the States. While in these areas the Commission will have mainly an advisory role, its powers of persuasion should not be underestimated, particularly if its representations are based on well researched data and are consistent with the overall thrust of the new Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission retains its autonomy under the new Agreement. This is essential if it is to continue as an effective custodian in the national interest of this most important water resource, and to provide the stimulus for co-operative action by the States in the maintenance and, eventually, improvement of water quality in the River Murray. The Government believes that the new Agreement provides a realistic framework for inter-governmental co-operation in the development of long term plans for safeguarding the enormous public and private investment in irrigation settlements and urban water supply systems based on the River Murray in the three States. This Agreement, as was the case with its predecessor, depends on the goodwill of the contracting parties for its success. There is every indication that this will be forthcoming. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Area to be Avoided in Bass Strait, in the vicinity of the off-shore petroleum production facilities, to which entry is prohibited to unauthorised Australian vessels over 200 tons gross tonnage. The Area to be Avoided replaces the existing restricted area first established in 1976 and enlarged in 1980. The existing restricted area is advisory only. However, with the increasing number of platforms in the area, and their economic importance to Australia, the Government considers it appropriate that additional steps should be taken to increase the effectiveness of the restrictions, enhancing the protection of the off-shore platforms and the safe movement of shipping in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the present provisions of the Act, and in accordance with the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf, safety zones of 500 metres have been declared around each platform, prohibiting entry by any unauthorised vessel. The Area to be Avoided established under this Bill will extend approximately 50 nautical miles from the coast to envelop the offshore platforms and submarine pipelines. Its outer boundary will lie about five nautical miles beyond the platforms while its inner boundary will follow the outer limit of the three mile territorial sea. Complementary legislation will be introduced by Victoria extending the Area to be Avoided from the outer limit of the territorial sea to the coast of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The areas to be avoided established by the Commonwealth and the State legislation will have the same boundaries as the present advisory restricted area. The restrictions established under the Bill will be binding on Australian vessels over 200 tons gross tonnage. For foreign vessels, the restrictions have been promulgated as an Area to be Avoided in accordance with arrangements approved by the International Maritime Organisation. The restrictions will become mandatory for foreign vessels as their governments pass appropriate legislation. The International Maritime Organisation has also approved a traffic separation scheme to the south of the Area to be Avoided to assist ship navigation. Arrangements are in place involving sea, air and radar surveillance of Bass Strait to ensure that restrictions are complied with by shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the details of the Bill, clause 3 inserts a new Division 6A into the 1967 Act and clause 4 adds a new Schedule 6 to the Act defining the boundaries of the Area to be Avoided. The new section 140C provides for a penalty of a fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment up to five years for unathorised entry into the Area to be Avoided or both. The penalty may be imposed on the owner, the master and any officer in charge of the vessel. In order to ensure that the new provisions can be carried out effectively, authorised persons are given powers of enforcement set out in the new section 140D. These include the power to board a vessel, to order the removal of a vessel from the Area to be Avoided and to order a disabled vessel to accept assistance. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: New air traffic services centre and control tower, Perth Airport, Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The work consists of the following elements: An air traffic services operations building and associated services building; a technical maintenance centre, a radio equipment and plant and equipment building, and a control tower. The elements of the work excepting the control tower were reported on favourably by the Committee in its twelfth report of 1981. On 17 November 1981 the House resolved that it was expedient to proceed with those elements at an estimated cost of $2.7m. </PARA>
<PARA> The control tower element, then estimated to cost a further $0.9m, was to be the subject of a further report by the Committee in the light of master planning strategies for the overall development of Perth Airport. The Committee has now tabled its report on the control tower component. In recommending construction of the tower the Committee concluded that further development of the airport should not rule out the early construction of a wide-spaced parallel runway. It has recommended the adoption of strategy 4 of the master planning studies for development of the airport which provides for a wide-spaced parallel runway when aircraft movement demands it or earlier if recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Commmittee on Environment and Conservation. </PARA>
<PARA> Taking into account the recommendations of the Committee and the concern held by the local community regarding the future development of the airport, the Government has decided to proceed basically in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee, and is developing a detailed planning concept for the airport and its facilities in accordance with stragety 4. The final details are, of course, still subject to the approval of the environmental impact statement on the master plan which should be available by the end of this year. It is now practicable to proceed with the control tower. The Committee has recommended that the height of the control tower be 60 to 65 metres and that it be located in accordance with the strategy 4 option. The actual height of the tower will be the subject of further studies during the design phase, taking into account operational requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost of the tower option recommended by the Committee is approximately $2.4m based on indicative planning only. The final estimated cost will depend on further development of planning and design and the optimum height decided for the tower. If the House agrees to support this motion, planning can proceed along the lines recommended by the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> 1. The further development of Perth Airport to the year 2000 should not rule out the early construction of a wide-spaced parallel runway on 02/20 alignment;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Committee recommends the adoption of a strategy 4 for development of Perth Airport with the provision of a wide-spaced parallel runway-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) when aircraft movements demand it; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) earlier if recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The proposed control tower at Perth Airport should be located at the site required under strategy 4 as shown in the provisional master plan and its height should be 60-65 metres. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Committee recommends the construction of the control tower recommended in paragraph 82. </PARA>
<PARA>That paragraph of the report referred to a control tower of between 60 to 65 metres in height, which contrasted with the provisional master plan of the Department of Aviation for a tower height of 90 metres. Strategy 4 referred to by the Committee involved the construction of a parallel runway on a 02/20 alignment and a taxiway system similar to that referred to in strategy 3 but with taxiway connections to an international terminal area to the east of the present 02/20 runway. </PARA>
<PARA> I have indicated that the Opposition supports the motion before the Chair at the moment. But I would like to contrast the manner in which this report of the Public Works Committee has been treated with the treatment of the report last session on the international terminal at Adelaide Airport. Earlier in the afternoon we had some degree of disagreement in the chamber from Government members. Honourable members on both sides of the House were denied an opportunity to participate in discussion of a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure relating to care of the aged. Similarly, in the autumn session, the Chairman of the Public Works Committee was gagged by the Government and prevented from speaking on the recommendations of the Committee on the siting of an international terminal at Adelaide Airport. A major recommendation of the Committee in that case was overturned. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the bad news. The good news is that on this occasion the Committee's recommendations have been heeded by government. In the main they have been adopted. I support the comments of my colleague the honourable member for Swan ( Mr Beazley), who is not able to be here today, but who has made some contribution to this matter because it affects his electorate. On an earlier occasion he pointed out to the House the very fair manner in which members of the public were treated when they appeared before the Committee to make submissions and participate in the activities of the Committee. He indicated on behalf of his constituents and on behalf of the Opposition that it was thought that the recommendations of the Committee were appropriate and sensible. Committees of the Parliament provide very great value in creating a forum in which differing points of view within the community can be put at public hearings. People give evidence on oath. Public hearings provide an opportunity for understanding another point of view and developing the consensus that we so desperately need today to improve opportunities for people and to try to get this country out of the mess in which the Government has put it. </PARA>
<PARA> The point to be made about the adoption of strategy 4 as recommended by the Committee is that here we see a standing committee of the Parliament, a very important committee, in effect overruling the proposal of the responsible department, on this occasion the Department of Aviation. In a number of ways it confirms considerations of that Committee in respect of Brisbane Airport in, I think, 1979 and Adelaide Airport earlier this year. There was conflict between deliberations and recommendations of the Committee and the submissions made by the responsible department, the Department of Aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> I interpret this as a result, firstly, of ad hockery of the Government's policy in respect of airport development and the provision of aviation services generally. Time and time again we see that this Government does not have any clear, planned policy in respect of the provision of aviation services. It does not have any national airport program. It does not have any national airport plan. It responds generally on the basis of how far off the next State election is and when the next Federal election is rather than doing as other Western democracies do and analysing airport and aviation needs of the nation, looking at settlement and movement patterns, looking at the costs involved and looking at the investment required to provide an adequate system of air services that people can afford. Today more and more people cannot afford to travel by air in this country. Having done that the Government should lay down, for instance, as the United States has done, two five-year programs-a program from year one to year five listing the works that need to be carried out at each airport and the expected costs to revenue of each development and then a program from year six to year 10 looking at the developments and works that will be required in those years. So at any one stage there is a reference for the next 10 years of airport development works that need to be done, the priority that ought to be accorded them and the cost benefits that can be gained in respect of those developments. This is where the problem arises between the Department of Aviation- the former Department of Transport-and the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> When we see this conflict and the overruling of departmental submissions by the Public Works Committee it is not simply a matter of the Parliament wanting to exercise its muscle for the sake of exercising muscle but rather it is looking at the situation in a more rational way. It shows up the weaknesses of ad hockery, the lack of a national airport program and the other weakness I want to come to. That weakness is within the present Department of Aviation, and was deeply imbedded within the former Department of Transport. There is an understaffing of key personnel, an understaffing of planning people, an inadequate provision of resources, a lack of co-ordination and overall a lack of leadership. In 1977 the report of a three-year inquiry conducted into the then Department of Transport made 300 recommendations about alterations and changes that needed to be made urgently to the airport engineering and airport planning branches of the Department-now the Department of Aviation. Never has this Government reported to the Parliament on what it did with those recommendations. We have seen continual confusion and deterioration in the provision of airport developments by the present Government. Another example is Brisbane Airport which is dragging a year behind the chain for those reasons I have just mentioned-lack of planning, lack of people with expertise, lack of co-ordination and lack of appropriate resources. The program for the provision of airport facilities for wide-bodied aircraft is also a long way behind for those very same reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports this motion of expediency. We believe that the total project, which includes the items mentioned in the Minister's motion and the construction of a new international terminal at Perth expected to be completed in 1986, will give Perth the most modern and best airport services on our continent. They will initially provide Perth with slightly more capacity than it needs, but will provide sufficient room for growth for the next two decades. Perth is fortunate to that extent in that it will gain benefits from having those services. I have referred to the cost to the community of not having a proper plan for airport development. The Australian Labor Party, when it comes to government-I do not expect that to be very long-will establish a national airports authority so that we can put the planning and provision of airport services on a proper, organised, co-ordinated and, most of all, responsible basis. That authority will be given the responsibility for planning, developing and operating airports and for the first time will bring proper accountability for revenue and expenditure in respect of airport operations. The Opposition supports the motion. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Stage 1 construction of new works and upgrading of existing facilities for the new tactical fighter project at Fishermens Bend, Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposal is for the construction of facilities at the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and the Government Aircraft Factories to facilitate Australian industry participation in the new tactical fighter project. It involves the construction of a jet engine test cell and a co-production staff office at CAC and improvements to the canopy shop at GAF. In endorsing the need for the work the Committee concluded that for the jet engine test cell, which has yet to be designed, the commission for its design criteria, including that for the acoustic and aero-dynamic components, should not automatically be given to the supplier of specialised equipment. The Committee recommended that suitably qualified Australians should be given the opportunity to perform this task. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is rightly concerned that Australian involvement in the project be maximised and full opportunity be taken to develop Australian expertise. In the development of this proposal for the Committee's consideration, it is the intention of the Department of Transport and Construction to maximise the Australian content in both design and construction phases. The most critical elements of the test cell are the aero-dynamic and acoustic aspects and it is the assessment of the Department of Transport and Construction that the best expertise on these aspects rests with the firms which produce the special equipment and instrumentation. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than arranging for an overseas firm to prepare totally the detailed design and tender documentation, the Department intends to obtain information on the acoustic and aero-dynamic aspects from the supplier of the specialised equipment. This information will be incorporated in the briefing to Australian consultants who will be commissioned to carry out the detailed design and tender documentation of the cell-hence Australian consultants will be commissed to translate the highly complex and critical design criteria into a working solution for Australian conditions. The estimated cost of the work is $5.4m at May 1982 prices. The Committee has recommended construction of the work in the reference. If the House agrees to support this motion, the project can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that it is the intention of the Government to move certain amendments to these Bills in the Committee stage. It is the Opposition's intention to move amendments to the motions for the second reading of these Bills, dealing with matters which I will raise in a moment. I wish firstly in this cognate debate to draw attention to the determination of the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) to inflame the state aid debate in Australia. The Government is determined to promote policies which treat government schools and non-government schools quite differently. The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill really highlights the approach the Government is now taking. It has been the practice of governments, starting with the last Australian Labor Party Government, to provide grants to all schools on the basis that at the end of the year when the schools have experienced cost increases those grants will be adjusted through a method called the cost supplementation process to take account of the increases in prices which have been faced by the schools. That was the procedure which existed up until this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year the Government decided to abandon the process of cost supplementation and instead to make a prediction about what costs were going to be during the year and try to incorporate within the grants a prospective allowance for those increases. What happened in the event was that the Government's prospective allowance in relation to those cost increases turned out to be pathetically inadequate. The Government realised this defect half way through this year and decided to make amends. Regrettably, however, the Government went only half the way. What it said to the non-government school sector was that it would fully compensate non-government schools for cost increases which had been experienced during the period in which the grants were intended to operate. However, in relation to government schools the Goverment was going to compensate State governments only partially for cost increases which they had experienced during the period. </PARA>
<PARA> What this really means is that there was a sleight of hand operating; the Government was not determined to maintain the real value of the grants which it had provided for government schools whereas it was prepared to maintain the real value of grants made to the non-government school sector. We think that is entirely wrong. We objected to the abandonment of cost supplementation in the first place. We told the Government that its prospective allowance would not work. In the event, it did not work. The point we were making at the time was that all schools, regardless of whether they were government or non-government, should be fully compensated for the cost increases which inevitably and unavoidably they were going to face during the period. What the Government said was that it expected State governments to absorb something like a third of the cost increases during the period. </PARA>
<PARA> Half way through this year when the Government announced with immense flourish that it was going to increase grants to the government school system by $6.3m it failed to mentioned that at the same time the government school system was losing $5m as a result of the Government's failure to compensate government schools fully for the increases they had experienced. There is no way in which government schools can absorb those increases, just as there is no way the non- government schools can absorb them. Most of the increases in costs, which all schools experience relate to increases in salaries. These account for about 80 per cent of total outgoings. Other matters such as increased maintenance and electricity charges and the like relate to increased costs. There is no way that any school can avoid the consequences of those increases. The only way schools can absorb-to use the euphemistic expression of the Government-the effects of those cost increases is for those schools in fact to reduce the quality of their operation. We think that is highly discriminatory. We believe that there should be a common approach to schools, regardless of whether they are government or non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said in the beginning that was indicative of the approach which this Government has taken and which has contributed to a shattering of the consensus which was established in 1973 in relation to the funding of all schools. That was an historic consensus which put the bitterness and division of the State aid debate behind us with the creation of the Schools Commission and the adoption of the needs approach to the Commonwealth funding of all schools in Australia. It allowed the Commonwealth-the last Labor Government-to accept as its primary obligation its commitment to the maintenance of a high quality government school system. At the same time it provided a basis for that Government and succeeding governments to provide assistance to all schools on the basis of their needs, in order that parents could be sure that whether they sent their children to government shools or non-government schools they could be guaranteed that their children would receive an acceptable standard of education. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened during the period of this Government is that that consensus has been gravely distorted. In the first place the Government has quite deliberately interfered with the balanced composition of the Schools Commission. I am not saying that that is a major effect, but it was one of the actions which the Government took which meant that it was all the more difficult for the members of the Schools Commission to approach the question of a compromise between the competing demands of the two school systems. Secondly the Government has been providing the Schools Commission with increasingly restrictive guidelines relating to the School Commission's funding policies. Again this has seriously compromised the Schools Commission's ability to reach a consensus on and an accommodation in relation to the needs of the two sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, and most importantly, the Government has introduced a two-part subsidy for non-government schools throughout Australia. The first part of the subsidy goes to all schools regardless of their circumstances and needs. The subsidy goes to all schools on a per capita basis as a right. The first component of the subsidy is a 20 per cent component. The second part is a 10 per cent or 20 per cent component. What that means is that under this Government no more than 50 per cent of the subsidy is needs based. Of course, that has been hugely exacerbated by the actual adjustments to the subsidy level which the Government has introduced during its period in office. I will refer to that again in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention now the fourth distortion which the Government has introduced. This relates to the campaign which the Minister for Education has now launched attacking those people who represent the government school system-the parents and the teachers-saying that what this Government does in respect of non- government schools has nothing to do with them. What the Minister is trying to argue is that there are two quite separate and distinct systems of education in this country, that the interests of the two never coincide and that the approaches of this Government in relation to those two sectors are not going to interfere one with the other. Of course, that is clearly nonsense. Of course, what happens to one sector will impact on the other. Take for instance the fact that there has been an increase in the enrolments in the non-government school sector. That is something which I accept with equanimity. But it cannot be said that that increase in enrolments does not have an impact on the government school sector. Of course, increasing enrolments in one sector leads to declining enrolments in the other. Of course, declining enrolments will have an effect on the government school system. </PARA>
<PARA> In reading what the Schools Commission has been saying in relation to increasing non-government school enrolments we find it has identified the increased level of support for non-government schools as the primary cause of increased enrolments in the non-government school sector. It is quite idiotic for the Minister to argue that we can treat the sectors separately, that they have nothing to do with each other and that the interested parties of one sector should not be concerned about what is happening in the other sector. I think the Minister is doing Australia and Australia's school children an enormous disservice by trying to re-establish, recreate and magnify the differences between the two sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand our approach is entirely different. We take the view that all schools and all school children in Australia deserve to be treated fairly by the Government. That brings me to the matter I mentioned in passing a moment ago in relation to the increases in subsidies for the different levels of non- government schools in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In short, this table indicates that the most wealthy, the best off category of non-government schools, received increases in the real value of their per pupil subsidies of 259 per cent over the last six years whereas the most needy non-government schools in Australia received increases of only 165 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is, the best off schools received increases one and a half to two times the rate of increase for the most needy category of non-government schools. Parenthetically I indicate that during the same period there has been a real decline of 12 per cent in the per pupil subsidies going to government schools. That indicates a total perversion of the needs policy. It is arrant nonsense for the Government persistently to insist that it is observing the needs policies as established by the Schools Commission Act of the former Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We are seeing a great distortion in relation to the support for non-government schools. We are interested in ensuring that Commonwealth Government subsidies go in the first instance to those schools which have the greatest needs. It has to be recognised in this context that the gap between the poorest non-government school in Australia and the government school standard remains at about 25 per cent. When the Karmel Committee first reported to the Government on the needs of schools in Australia it indicated that the neediest schools were operating at about 75 per cent of the level of government schools. That condition persists today, 10 years later. It seems to us that, that being the situation, we ought to be particularly concerned to address Commonwealth support to those schools which are in needy circumstances-in desperately needy circumstances-serving communities which are fundamentally poor and, with rising unemployment, likely to be even poorer. That is where we should concentrate our effort, not more than doubling our subsidies to schools which in some cases are operating with twice the level of resources of government schools. That is the issue which is developing. I seek leave of the Minister to incorporate in Hansard a second table indicating the level of income per student. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate today has been greatly truncated. I do not know why; I dare say it is due to the Government's mismanagement of the Parliament. Opposition members were told that we were to confine our remarks on these two Bills-these two desperately important Bills-to 30 minutes, so I will move quickly to indicate that we will move an amendment to the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill in the terms that have been circulated in my name. We will also move an amendment to the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill, again in the terms circulated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill the Government intends that certain institutions should receive no financial support for next year and the year after unless they agree to the Government's requirements in relation to amalgamations. The Armidale College of Advanced Education and the University of New England in Armidale will not receive any funds as of right, as do all other colleges and universities, unless they agree with the Government's requirements in relation to the amalgamation proposals. Serious problems exist in Armidale, and those two institutions should not be forced to amalgamate in advance of them reaching agreement about the conditions of that amalgamation. Any amalgamation in the tertiary sector ought to be designed to advance the educational objectives of the institutions, not some airy-fairy, nebulous, dubious economic objectives which the Government may believe are possible but which the Tertiary Education Commission believes, at least in the short term, are unlikely to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Armidale is not the only place in which this problem exists. A similar situation exists in Newcastle where the University of Newcastle and the Newcastle College of Advanced Education are again being forced to amalgamate. The Milperra College of Advanced Education is being forced to amalgamate and the Hawthorn Institute of Education in Melbourne again is allocated no funds for next year or for the year after because the Government is insisting that all those institutions, as mentioned in Schedule 18 of the Bill, should amalgamate. Only when the Minister believes they have achieved a satisfactory amalgamation- satisfactory to him, not to anyone else-then and only then, will he be prepared to allocate funds. What we are saying on this occasion is that the Bill ought to be withdrawn and redrafted to ensure that, in the event that those institutions cannot reach agreement about the educational advantages which will flow from those amalgamations, the Bill ought to provide that they receive funds for next year and the year after in the normal way. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot expect to rationalise the education system by holding guns at the heads of universities and colleges throughout Australia. They have been distracted from their important tasks by these amalgamations which have never been justified and the aims of which have never been spelt out. The effect on morale has been cataclysmic. I suspect that if the institutions involved are forced to some unsatisfactory amalgamation it will take them years and years to recover from the effects. </PARA>
<PARA> The last matter I refer to in this context is the decision of the Government to require the Orange Agricultural College in the electorate of Calare to amalgamate with the Mitchell College of Advanced Education. Again there is no real justification for it; no educational objectives need to be met. All that is said in this Bill is that the Orange Agricultural College, which has a nation- wide reputation in farm management education, is to be forced, against its will, into an amalgamation with the Mitchell College. We think that is highly unsatisfactory. We believe therefore that the Bill ought to be withdrawn and redrafted to provide that until such times as those institutions are mutually satisfied with the amalgamation arrangements-that may take another year; it may take another two years; who knows-they should not be forced into it against their wills. They should not be deprived of the financial support to which they are entitled just because they cannot comply readily with the unreasonable demands of this Government. I move:</PARA>

I thank my colleague the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) for being generous enough to give some time to me in which to speak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Labor set up the Schools Commission in 1974 its responsibility was to report to the Federal Government on the overall standards and needs of all schools. In addition, it was to make recommendations on government spending in both the public and private sector. The emphasis was on the independence of the Commission. It was then, and should always be, the responsibility of government to accept or reject all or part of the Commission's report. However, with the advent of the Liberal-Country Party Government in 1975, the independence of the Schools Commission was slowly whittled away. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978, following a spate of extravagant promises in the 1977 campaign speech, the Liberals advised the Commission to allocate extra funds to the non- government sector. The Schools Commission's acquiesence gave a shabby respectability to the Government's intentions. The Commission, to its credit, at that time showed its independence and severely criticised the Government. However, in 1979 the Commission was again advised how the money was to be spent. The then Chairman, Dr Ken McKinnon, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our role is to advise the Government-we assess the needs of schools and the Government makes its decisions in the light of that assessment. </PARA>
<PARA>These words were evidently Dr McKinnon's swan song because on 4 December 1981 he lost his position. Dr McKinnon, a highly respected Chairman, expected to be reappointed. Heads of statutory authorities are usually offered a second term. This Government has, however, shown all too often that convention and courtesy have gone by the board. Dr McKinnon's honest, independent and forthright stand on a number of controversial issues upset the Federal Cabinet. Dr McKinnon was treated with little personal regard. He stated in 1980 that the Commission's independence was vital. He also said that the Commission acted as a buffer between government and competing interests for educational funding but he said that the Government wanted it both ways-it wanted the buffer without the awkwardness of getting straightforward advice. </PARA>
<PARA> When Ken McKinnon went so too did the last vestiges of independence from the Schools Commission. In April 1982 I urged the Schools Commission to adhere to its charter and let the Government of the day reject or alter its recommendations. The Schools Commission should have the guts to exercise its powers and fulfil its charter under the Schools Commission Act. It is a sorry state of affairs now with the Government issuing guidelines and directions to the Schools Commission and the Commission meekly accepting them. The latest comments in the Schools Commission report for 1983 are a pathetic gasp from a shadow organisation. It is now impossible to separate the views of the Commission from the views of the Government. Their policies make them siamese twins. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Fraser Government and the emasculated Schools Commission the gap between the richest and the poorest schools in Australia has widened as the Government, with the silent assent of the Schools Commission, has promoted privilege and rejected the goal of equality. The Schools Commission correctly says that this grossly unfair approach has provoked a revival of the thoroughly divisive and fruitless state aid debate which my colleague the honourable member for Fremantle has so ably illustrated. For that state of affairs the Government and the Schools Commission are to share the blame, the latter because it does not fulfil the independence of its charter and the former because it treats the Schools Commission and the people with total contempt. The cost of the Government's election promises determines education policy for this Government. That is its yardstick. I do not know any more what yardstick the so-called independent Schools Commission uses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears that not only is the Opposition to be restricted to 30 minutes on these two important Bills-the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill and the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill-but also there will be no speakers from the Government side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before dealing with some specific matters contained in these Bills I will comment briefly on the relationship between the Government and the Schools Commission and the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. As the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife), who represents the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) in this chamber-he is himself a former Minister for Education-said in his second reading speeches on 23 September, all the financial recommendations of the commissions have been accepted. This is hardly surprising. There is no real reason for self-congratulation on that point because the whole process of triennial reports, followed by tight proscriptive guidelines, followed by a report in response to those guidelines, followed by these Bills, guarantees docile commissions and made-to-measure reports. As sources of independent advice , the commissions now are mere shadows of their former selves. They ought to be sources of independent advice but quite clearly now they are not. Whilst the final decisions on funding must obviously be the responsibility of the government of the day, a process involving less proscriptive guidelines and giving the commissions the opportunity to offer at least a range of options annually could produce great benefits. At the very least, it would force the Government to justify its decisions in education more thoroughly and publicly than it now does. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now briefly to the measures contained in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill. I point out, first of all, that the Bill does nothing to address the problem of falling levels of participation in tertiary education, nothing to address the problem of massive youth unemployment and nothing to correct a basic lack of educational opportunity in this country. The Bill continues the Government's war of attrition against universities and colleges across the land. Funding for universities and colleges of advanced education will remain at starvation levels-starvation to a point where many of their activities will have to be restricted. As the Schedule to the Bill reveals , the Government is hell-bent on continuing its policy of forced amalgamation. There are nil grant figures for the University of New England, the University of Newcastle, the Newcastle CAE, the Armidale CAE, the Milperra CAE and a number of others. The explanation for this which the Minister gave on 23 September was that recurrent funds for those institutions concerned in amalgamation would be put into a national unallocated grant and that money would be released from that national unallocated fund only in the event that acceptable proposals for amalgamations were received by the end of this year. The implication is that if those amalgamation proposals are not received there will be no money. It is a kind of 'or else' proposition. It is clear evidence that the Government is determined to pursue these amalgamations, these shotgun weddings, with a single- mindedness which it should apply to national problems that are far more pressing than the amalgamations of these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that in the technical and further education sector there is a cut in overall funding, capital funding is down by $4m and there is no increase in equipment funding. These are disgraceful decisions, especially in view of the need for refurbishing and re-equipment in the TAFE sector. There is no doubt that as long as this Government remains in office technical and further education will remain the poor relation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition for some time has been drawing attention to the problems flowing from falling tertiary participation rates and pointing to the fact that the percentage of final year secondary students proceeding directly to tertiary education has fallen quite dramatically in recent years. Of the 15 to 19-year- old age group, which covers those at school and those in their first year of tertiary studies, Australia-wide, 38.5 per cent is engaged in full time education. This means that the remaining 61.5 per cent is on the labour market. By international comparison this is a very high figure indeed. In Australia 61.5 per cent of that age group is on the labour market. In Japan the figure is only 24 per cent, in the United States of America it is 28 per cent, in Canada it is 33 per cent and in Sweden it is 34 per cent. Yet in Australia the figure is 61.5 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. The contribution of falling tertiary participation rates and low secondary retention rates to the current record levels of youth unemployment is quite obvious. In Japan 88.1 per cent of 17-year-olds are still full time school students. In Australia the figure is 34.8 per cent. I point out to the House that this is a national average. Clearly, schools with low retention rates are not evenly spread. Obviously, they are found in regions with the highest rates of youth unemployment. Where in the Bill is there any provision to raise retention and participation rates? The question of recurrent funding for non- government schools has been covered in detail by my colleagues the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) and the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child ) but I point out that if this Government had any commitment to raising resource levels in under-resourced non-government schools it would take the obvious step. It has had seven years in office. The reason that the position has not improved in the needier schools is the policy of this Government to make a present to over-resourced schools, those which are operating at 180 per cent of government school levels. Those schools do not need funding. At the same time the Government is prepared to tolerate a situation in which the neediest non- government schools are still as badly off as they were seven years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The approach of the Opposition this afternoon has been negative to say the least. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Free) exemplified that attitude. His attitude, particularly in relation to non-government schools, is the attitude of a large number of members of the Opposition. They fail to tell the truth in relation to this matter. I said that the Opposition's approach this afternoon was negative. It was negative because Opposition members failed to point out and acknowledge that support for the recurrent resource standards in government and non-government schools throughout Australia has never been higher in the history of this country. The Opposition has failed to acknowledge that very important fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take this opportunity also to indicate on behalf of all those people who serve on the Schools Commission the fact that they are dedicated educationalists who come from a variety of fields within the education sector-the teachers federations, the various parent groups, both government and non-government, people who serve in the State education systems throughout the Commonwealth and others who are in the employ of the Commonwealth. I deplore the suggestion that has been made that those people are not acting independently. On their behalf I call on the Opposition to apologise, in particular the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) and the honourable member for Macquarie who reflected not only on the corporate body of the Australian Schools Commission but also on each member of that Commission. The honourable member for Macquarie and the honourable member for Henty both made reference to the fact that this Government provides the Schools Commission with prescriptive guidelines. Those were the words used in particular by the honourable member for Macquarie. I inform him- apparently he is not aware of it-that the first government to provide such guidelines to the Schools Commission was a government of his political colour; the Whitlam Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill is to provide funds for primary and secondary schools in the States and the Northern Territory next year. The detailed distribution of these funds for 1983 is in accordance with the recommendations of the report of the Schools Commission on the 1983 guidelines all of which-I emphasise the words 'all of which'-have been accepted by the Government. The Bill also provides additional funds for 1982 programs to help meet unanticipated cost increases arising from recent teacher salary determinations. In providing an estimated total of $1,241m for schools programs in 1983 the Government confirms the high priority accorded to education and to the schools in particular. In difficult budgetary conditions the total allocation for schools has been increased by nearly 4 per cent in real terms over 1982 to a level higher than in any previous year. It represents a continuation of the Commonwealth's support in providing the best possible education for all Australian school children. </PARA>
<PARA> There has demonstrably been no reduction in Commonwealth support for government schools. The $567m allocated for these schools in 1983 includes a 2 per cent increase in real terms in general recurrent funding to help meet running costs and maintenance of capital programs in real terms. These additional allocations for government schools were consistent with the advice given to the Government by the Commonwealth Schools Commission. As I said earlier, support for recurrent resource standards in government schools has never been higher in our history. The Government's policies and programs are also intended to help in supporting the provision of an adequate education for those chidren whose parents choose to send them to non-government schools. The Commission has reported that the great majority of non-government schools are operating at resource standards significantly below those of the government school system. The Government has given special attention to these low resource schools in its funding programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1976 the subsidy rate for schools classified by the Commission as most needy has been increased from 31 per cent to 33 per cent in secondary and primary schools to 38 per cent of average government school standard costs. In 1983 the rate for these schools will be increased further to 40 per cent. Indeed some 95 per cent of the total increase in general recurrent grants to non- government schools in 1983 will be directed to the low resource schools in greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be forgotten that resource standards in non-government schools have risen markedly due to the combined efforts of State and Commonwealth governments and private contributions. Government systems would now have total recurrent resource levels on average equivalent to those of non-government schools classified by the Commonwealth Schools Commission as being in Group 1- that is, with the highest resource standards. It seems hardly necessary to point out yet again that it is misleading to look at Commonwealth funding patterns for schools in isolation of the funds provided from the States and other sources. The Government's decisions are made on the basis of a complimentary, Commonwealth-State funding relationship which has been very productive in leading to improved standards in schools overall. When total resources of State and Commonwealth governments are considered on an average per pupil basis total government funding of pupils at government schools is now more than double that for children in non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA> I outlined clearly in my second reading speech the greatly improved facilities and resources that are being provided by this Government to Australian schools, both government and non-government. I outlined also the very real increase in expenditure for technical and further education. One of the Opposition members earlier described TAFE as being the poor relation of the education system. Indeed, technical and further education was the poor relation of the education system until this Government took office. That has since been corrected. </PARA>

<PARA> The first four amendments establish the legal position regarding the interest of the Commonwealth where its grants have been used for the purchase, wholly or in part, of major assets by non-government school authorities and the requirements regarding recovery of grants in the event of disposal or changes in the purpose of such assets. In cases such as a non-government school ceasing operation, there has been no formal legal capacity to initiate recovery action on behalf of the Commonwealth, although there have been administrative arrangements for this purpose. It is not possible constitutionally for the Commonwealth to take direct recovery action in its own right as this would need to be done under the conditions of the States grants legislation and with the co -operation of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there have been no past instances which would have necessitated the Commonwealth requiring a State to take recovery action, such instances could occur if conditions in agreements between a State and a school authority concerning the Commonwealth's conditions for grants are not fulfilled, for example, because of the closure of a school. Non-government school authorities have been consulted on this matter and have not objected to the principle of recovery of grants. The Government is therefore seeking to amend the legislation , firstly, to specify that the conditions of grants for major assets apply for a maximum of 20 years, with any repayments based on a 5 per cent per annum reduction in the value of the grant for each remaining year; secondly, to specify that major assets include purchases of land, buildings and equipment costing more that $30,000 in 1983; and thirdly, to require States to enter into contracts with recipients so that the Commonwealth conditions of grants are met and, in the event that they are not, to initiate recovery action if requested to do so by the Commonwealth Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions largely reflect current administrative arrangements and therefore do not constitute any significant departure from existing policy. While it is not intended that there be any retrospective changes to the conditions of existing grants, it is the Commonwealth's intention that the broad principles which are to be established in the legislation will apply in respect of the administration of past grants. Under these arrangements, the Commonwealth does not require any proprietary interest or trust in property purchased, constructed or brought into being as a result of expenditure by a non-government school authority of payments it has accepted from a State pursuant to Commonwealth grants. The Commonwealth is consulting with the States to seek their full co-operation in administering these arrangements. The Government has also decided that these arrangements will be applied to corresponding grants for non-government schools in the Australian Capital Territory from 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> The new clauses I have moved to be inserted after clause 67 of this Bill change the funding for 1982 of the new arrivals element of the English as a Second Language Program from a fixed allocation to a per capita basis, consistent with the 1983 funding arrangements in the Bill. The purpose of this amendment is to overcome the problem of uncertainty about the level of funding required for the final number of eligible students enrolled in courses in 1982. This means that the final cost of this element of the program would be determined by the actual number of students. Current enrolment trends indicate that enrolments could reach about 14,000 in 1982, an increase of 2,000 students on the original estimate, which would cost an additional $1.6m at the 1982 rate of $795 per student. This additional commitment indicates the importance which the Government attaches to the provision of intensive English language programs for non-English speaking students who are newly arrived in Australia and will ensure that all eligible newly arrived students who enrol in government and non- government schools in 1982 can receive special English as a second language course. The total financial commitment for 1982 is now estimated at some $11.1m, in 1982 outturn prices. I commend these amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose these amendments, and I rise simply to make a couple of points. It was very slick of the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) to conclude from my colleagues' criticisms of the Commonwealth Schools Commission that in fact they were attacking the character of the individual members of the Commission. Of course they were not doing that. What they were referring to was that the Schools Commission has, regrettably, become a somewhat compliant organisation over the last few years. That has been largely influenced by the kinds of instructions the Government has sent the Commission in the form of its prescriptive guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has nothing but respect for the members of the Commission, although we do say that they should have protested more loudly and more frequently about the effects of the Government's guidelines on schools throughout Australia. Members of the Commission have not stood up to the Government. Of course, the Government is happy with that situation, but the Opposition is not. The Minister says that this Government was not the first to send guidelines to the Commission. Of course it was not, and of course it is a legitimate role for governments to tell the Commission how much money it has to spend, how much money the Government is prepared to allocate for the Schools Commission's programs. It is an entirely different matter for the Government then to tell the Commission how, in precise terms, it should spend that money. That is the difference between the guidelines which were provided for the Schools Commission under the Labor Government and those provided under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to one other matter because the Minister for Aviation is getting more enthusiastic about using statistics deceptively. He said that he used certain statistics to indicate that the Government's commitment to the government school sector had never been higher, or words to that effect. Regrettably, the Minister apparently did not read the table I showed him earlier in the debate, which indicates that in real per capita terms the decline over the last six years has been 12 per cent in the recurrent programs going to government schools, whilst at the same time there has been a very substantial increase to non-government schools. The Minister certainly did not address what was the central burden of my remarks. It is fine for the Government to provide assistance to the non-government school sector. That was something which the past Labor Government embraced. What we cannot understand and what the Government did not answer was why it is that it has given such substantial and unjustified increases to the schools that are already doing very well and operating, in some cases, at twice the level of the government schools whilst the gap continues to exist between the poorest schools in Australia and the government school standard. </PARA>

The Government has to focus on that problem and abandon this idiocy of having as of right grants which completely ignore the individual needs, the urgent needs of students in non-government schools.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>In indicating the Government's assent to these amendments I make it absolutely clear that the Government agrees to them only because there are other parts of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) which must come into effect to provide essential benefits to deserving people. It does not agree with what the Senate has decided in relation to these amendments. I give notice that the Government will be reintroducing these provisions as a separate Bill in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments made by the Senate relate to the tax put on the private health insurance funds in Victoria by the Victorian Government. The clauses in the original Bill were intended to prevent State governments levying such taxes on private health insurance funds. It is the intention of the Government to proceed with separate legislation to give effect to those provisions at a later stage but, in the interests of the special provisions for disadvantaged persons which have to come into effect very soon, for the moment the Government accepts the Senate's amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the motion of the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton). We have indicated throughout the debate, both in this Chamber and in the other place, that we would accept all parts of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) and would facilitate its rapid passage except for the two clauses relating to the cost-efficient Victorian health levy. We argued in this place and in the other place that those clauses were a complete tack; the clauses disallowing the levy had nothing to do with the rest of the Bill and had nothing to do with the substance of the Bill. They had nothing to do with the Budget and were therefore in no sense Budget legislation. They were not even mentioned in the Budget Speech. Had the Government had any sense of parliamentary propriety it would have introduced these disallowance provisions in a separate Bill. I am glad it is now going to do that. It was a pity that that was not recognised beforehand. The Government simply has tried to blackmail and bluff the Opposition in the other place but that blackmail and that bluff has failed.</PARA></TALK.START>

It played 'chicken' with the Opposition in the Senate and lost. One of the most important aspects of this situation is that it quite clearly demonstrates that the Government has finally realised that if it went to an election now it would be decimated. It has realised that it cannot just keep on saying to the Senate that it has to pass every bit of legislation otherwise an election will be called. Surely it is clear to any political observer in this country that, the way things are at present, any government would be defeated if it went to an election at this time.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SH4">Dr KLUGMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the clause on which the Government has caved in on the question of allowing the Victorian Government to impose an across-the-board charge against registered health insurance organisations rather than, as far as hospital attendances at casualty out-patient departments are concerned, charging for individual hospital attendances. It is extremely difficult for the public hospitals of all the States to chase the money owing to them. When people come into casualty they are distraught. They come in following an accident or because of acute problems. Obviously they do not carry their medical insurance books around with them. Many of them do not even know for sure what fund they belong to. It is then left to the hospitals to chase that money. Funds are behaving in a rather cavalier fashion, all over Australia not just in Victoria. I hope that the New South Wales Government will follow the example of the Victorian Government and introduce similar legislation. The Victorian Government has taken the right step in imposing that charge, which averages the costs attributable for hospital out-patients attendances, casualty departments and so on, rather than the hospitals going to the trouble of carrying out the clerical work involved and losing a large percentage of fees payable by the private organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst in theory one should congratulate the Government on accepting the amendments, it is important to remember that they were originally Australian Labor Party amendments in this Chamber. The amendments were supported by enough honourable senators in the Senate to enable them to be passed. I urge the Government to accept amendments which will be moved on other legislation which comes before the Chamber today to show that it has an understanding that the Opposition is not trying to stop the Government from functioning but is trying to improve quite significantly the way in which it functions. Surely everybody in this country would agree that this Government needs a lot of help at present to improve its efficiency and its ability to deal with many problems, not only those in the health area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I should make some response to the points made by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) and the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman). If there had been any machinery that I could use to reinstate these clauses and put them back through the Senate before it rises tonight I would have done so. However it was not possible mechanically to do that without jeopardising some very important benefits for disadvantaged persons which have to be introduced next week. That is the reason why the Bill has not had its clauses reinstated. I think I also ought to make quite clear to the Committee the basis on which the Government is going to insist on putting these clauses back into a separate Bill and to insist that State governments do not levy taxes on private health insurance funds. Basically, if a State wishes to run its hospital system in any particular way that is a matter for the State.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In September of last year the Government introduced new arrangements for funding State hospitals. It abandoned in all States but two 50-50 cost sharing agreements which I would call buck passing agreements. Under these schemes the Federal Government provided 50 per cent of the funds for running hospitals systems in the States. As a result the States were very reluctant to accept the basic managerial and planning decisions of their hospital systems. Those changes made it absolutely clear that the financial as well as the managerial responsibility for running the hospital systems lay with the States. The States have always had the constitutional responsibility for running hospital systems. But while there was no clear-cut financial responsibility to go with that managerial responsibility they did not, in general, bother to manage their hospitals properly. Whenever there were further demands for additional services in various areas, instead of looking at the overall scheme for planning in those hospital systems, they said that the Commonwealth should provide more money. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the changes of last year were very satisfactory ones. Since I became Minister for Health I have been determined not to interfere in the managerial responsibilities of the State Ministers. I realise that they have had very difficult problems during the transitional phase of accepting this full responsibility. There have been arguments over funding amounts at the end of the financial year. These were very difficult problems to resolve. There were arguments on both sides and I am certainly not one to claim that all wisdom lies here in Canberra. There were difficulties in resolving these financial arrangements and, of course, they became linked with the general financial provisions between the Commonwealth and the States which were hammered out at the Premiers Conference. Some States believe that they were unfairly done by; other States believe that they did better. Inevitably there is some form of conflict in an allocation of resources of this kind. But whatever those arrangements are-they are argued out at successive Premiers Conferences-the principle of the States having a financial as well as a managerial responsibility for their hospital systems, I think, is a very good one. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria the State Government decided-I must say without giving any notice to me; the announcements were made before I had had any opportunity to examine them-to levy a tax on private insurance funds. The State Government can do what it likes with regard to the operation of its out-patient services and its charges for them, provided that it does so with its own funds. For example, the Queensland Government-this matter has been raised a number of times-chooses to allow people into public hospitals without applying any means test. That is a choice for the Queensland Government. If I were making the choice I would not follow that path, but we have made a clear-cut decision that the States can spend their money as they wish. If Queensland, unlike all the other States, does not wish to means test public hospital patients it can do so but it does make up the extra cost of doing that out of its State taxation revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> If Mr Roper, the Victorian Minister of Health-I fully understand the difficulties he has in funding his hospital systems and making up for wrong planning decisions that have perhaps been made in the past-wants additional money he should make it up out of State taxation revenues, which he can do. He can argue for more money at the various conferences with the Commonwealth. What we objected to was a levy on the contributors to the private health insurance funds in lieu of making charges at out-patient departments. Again I make it quite clear that if he had decided to stop levying the individual charges at the out-patient departments and paid for it out of Victorian tax revenues we would have had no quarrel with him. There would have been no problem about that at all . </PARA>
<PARA> We do have a constitutional and legislative responsibility for health insurance under the Health Insurance Act. I have to be concerned about the reserves in the private insurance funds. It is not acceptable to have State governments levying taxes on those contributors' funds which do not relate specifically to the services rendered. In this case Mr Roper levied the private funds in Victoria to an amount in addition to that required to provide these free services in the out -patient departments. </PARA>

They think it is a lesser amount but the amount levied by the State Government is even more than that which the Commonwealth believed it might get under that program. That is the basis of our concern about this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also have a concern for those pensioners who, although entitled to free hospital care, have decided to insure themselves under hospital tables in order to have choice of doctor. Those people who are already paying an additional burden for that privilege-it is their right to do so-find themselves having to pay the additional levy imposed by the Victorian Government. That is another unfortunate by-product of the Victorian proposals.</PARA>
<PARA> All these things taken into account, we believe that we cannot let this matter rest. We would not have let it rest tonight had the machanics been available to us to send the legislation back to the Senate with the amendments reinstated. We will be arguing once again with a separate Bill to ask the Senate to re-examine this matter. I shall certainly be arguing my case and the Government's case on this matter. I also hope to make it clear that it is not my intention to make Mr Roper's job any more difficult than it is. State Ministers have massive responsibilities for delivery systems. The managerial problems in those systems- because of some years of neglect and I think partly because of the old financing arrangements-are immense. I have spent a lot of time, since I have been in this job, coming to understand those problems as well as our own. Of course I do have a responsibility for delivery services within the Australian Capital Territory and therefore a very direct interest. I am not without sympathy for Mr Roper's overall plight but we are attempting to preserve the integrity of contributors' funds and to assert our control over the health insurance arrangements. That is why for the moment we are accepting these amendments but we will be asking the Senate once again to consider them within a fresh Bill. </PARA>

I well remember the Commonwealth insisting on a four beds per thousand public hospital funding system and the Victorian Minister of Health writing to members from Victoria-where that system did not apply-who were insisting on the four beds per thousand. They included the then Prime Minister of Australia. The Prime Minister at the time publicly condemned the Victorian Government because that system might have affected his electorate. When the Minister talks about people taking responsibility he must look at both sides of the coin. Liberal and National Party members in Victoria are good, in closed conferences, at telling people they should apply certain strictures and, in the public arena, telling the same people that they have no entitlement to apply it in their electorates. If the Minister wants to apply rules, sanctions and restrictions I suggest he should have the guts to stand up for what he does and support it in his own areas.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The sub-committee was arguing to Mr Howard that the joint and severally liable provisions should be adjusted to protect certain beneficiaries of trusts which used tax evasion schemes. Those included would be infants, charities and old people. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of the committee are of the view that such people and organisations should not be liable under the promoters clause. </PARA>
<PARA>The implication is that I and members of the Government back bench tax committee are not in favour of the tracing provisions of the legislation which allow for the recovery of the benefit that the promoter received even if that benefit is now in the hands of his family or some other beneficiary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clause 3, pages 6 and 7, omit sub-clause (12). </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment is to delete sub-clause (12) of clause 3 of the Bill. That sub- clause provides that no liability to recoupment tax arises where, after sale to the promoter, the company was unsuccessfully entered into a tax avoidance scheme which, objectively viewed, could reasonably have been expected to succeed in eliminating the company tax liability. Provided the tax arrangement was not part of a subsequent stripping operation which rendered the company unable to pay its tax, this legislation will not operate to recoup unpaid company tax in such circumstances. This proposal was not part of the earlier Bill introduced a month ago but has been included in the revised Bill as a concession to the tax dodgers . The rationale for it is apparently that in such cases there was supposedly no element of fraud because the company was stripped on the assumption that the tax avoidance scheme had legally wiped out the company's tax liability. When that scheme subsequently fails so that a tax liability does apply to the company which has no funds to meet it because it has been stripped, the Government now argues that the vendors and promoters should be exempt from recoupment tax because when the company was stripped it was supposedly reasonable for those involved to assume that the action was legal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition opposes this on two grounds. They are conceptual and practical grounds. On conceptual grounds we find the supposed logic that lies behind this sub-clause absolutely extraordinary. It is basic to realise that the whole of this legislation will not apply where a company entered a successful tax avoidance scheme after sale; that is, there will be no recoupment tax process in such cases because in those cases there is no company tax liability which remains unpaid. So, in all cases where profits were stripped under the guise of a successful tax avoidance scheme, the vendors and promoters are laughing all the way to the bank and the Government is making no attempt to wipe the smile from their faces. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, this sub-clause says that if the Commissioner of Taxation challenges the tax avoidance scheme that was used, fights it through the courts and eventually wins his argument that the tax avoidance scheme purported to apply was not legitimate, he still will not be able to collect the tax. Where tax is owed by the company but it has no funds, this sub-clause will act to prevent any assessment being made on the vendors, shareholders or promoters who benefited from the pre-tax stripping operation to pay that tax. What an absolutely extraordinary situation this is. Not only is there no application of this legislation where a tax avoidance scheme was successful, which demonstrates that accusations of retrospectivity are rather wide of the mark, but in addition there is to be no application of it when they are unsuccessful. Such legislation makes an absolute mockery of the work of the Australian Taxation Office. Having worked to strike down a supposed tax avoidance scheme by proving that it was not within the law at that time, the Government is now going to step in and say ' Even though this was part of a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme and the vendors, shareholders and promoters all profited substantially from this arrangement at the expense of other taxpayers, no attempt is to be made to collect tax from them because they could reasonably have been expected to believe that the tax avoidance scheme would work'. What a sell-out that is. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is saying that if the Taxation Office strikes down a supposed Curran scheme, for instance, as recently happened in the New South Wales Supreme Court, and the company was not stripped under a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme, then the tax obligation will apply. However, if the company was involved in a pre-tax stripping operation, a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme, and so has no assets because of the stripping operation, the Government says that it will not bother to collect tax from the vendors, shareholders and promoters who benefited from it. This is an extraordinarily anomalous situation in which the Government is seeking to protect one particular category of intending tax dodgers-that is, those who were involved in a straw company scheme which included a purported tax avoidance arrangement. Those who entered into exactly the same kind of arrangement without the straw company element remain liable. This is a quite ridiculous situation which must be enormously damaging to the morale of the Taxation Office. The Office is trying to strike down tax avoidance schemes under existing law and when it is successful the Government says that it cannot collect the tax consequently owing in the case of a company involved in a straw company scheme. What a great incentive that is to the diligent pursuit of tax dodgers!</PARA>
<PARA> We can see no valid conceptual reason for this sub-clause. The argument that it is appropriate because technically fraud was not involved in the situation in which it applies ignores the fact that in the same situation applying to a non- stripped company where again it could be strictly argued that no fraud applied, the tax liability would remain and be collectable. Therefore, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that this sub-clause acts to discriminate in favour of participants in the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme as against non-participants in that scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards practical considerations, we are appalled at the potential loophole that this sub-clause will create. As I understand it, the Taxation Office has so far identified 4,600 companies as being involved in pre-tax profits stripping and having unpaid company tax liability. Of those 4,600, about 700 have engaged in a purported tax avoidance scheme. Some of these schemes may eventually prove to be valid. The Taxation Office in challenging them may find that some are upheld, but most of them are expected to be struck down. However, the effect of sub-clause (12) will be to ensure that even though the Taxation Office and the courts strike them down the promoters and the vendor shareholders involved in these companies will not have to pay tax. Thus, no tax will be collected from up to 15 per cent of the companies so far involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of tax that will be lost because of this incredible exemption may well be substantially in excess of 15 per cent. This is because, as we understand it, the tax avoidance scheme purportedly employed by many of these 700 companies is a Curran scheme, which scheme enables vast amounts of tax to be dodged through artificial losses on share trading. If many of these supposed Curran schemes were now to be struck down under existing law, a lot more than 15 per cent of the tax that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was expecting to recoup may not now be collected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's most recent estimate of tax involved in this recoupment operation is $580m, as I recall it. If this sub-clause is passed the amount gathered is likely to be far less than that. This will make a massive hole in the amount of money which is supposedly to be recouped under this legislation. A 15 per cent loss would reduce it by $87m, but for the reason I have mentioned the loss of potential revenue could be far in excess of 15 per cent and probably will be well over $100m. Thus this sub-clause is utterly without merit. It is thoroughly unjustified in conceptual terms because it involves discrimination as tax dodgers in favour of those involved in the bottom-of-the harbour schemes and it will lead to massive losses of potential revenue from the recoupment tax exercise. This legislation was already weak in that it ignored a substantial amount of revenue lost through bottom-of-the harbour schemes, but this sub- clause ensures that it will be much weaker. It makes a mockery of the Government 's supposed determination to get back the funds which have been stolen from public revenue. </PARA>

That is so. The conceptual problem that he referred to is no conceptual problem at all if we look to the consideration that fraud was not involved and was not intended to be involved. That is the distinction between that kind of situation and other kinds of situations, and that is why those who did not intend, and who can on objective evidence be determined not to have intended, to commit a fraud on the revenue should be exempted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly about the matter raised by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). I think one of the problems we have is that the whole question of tax avoidance has become blurred by the sort of view he put. It is as if there were something quite good, quite respectable, about tax avoidance as opposed to tax evasion. In relation to this part of the Bill, we now find that where companies enter into a tax avoidance scheme-it is in the explanatory memorandum-after sale to a promoter, with a reasonable expectation that the scheme would be successful but which scheme subsequently fails, the companies, the vendors and the promoters associated with that scheme are exempt from the legislation. As was outlined by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), that is an extraordinary situation having regard to what we have heard about this legislation. It has taken long enough for this Bill to get in here, with the Government making concessions to people on its side of the chamber who were disturbed about it for all sorts of strange reasons. The attitude of those people came out very clearly in the speech of the honourable member for North Sydney. It may not be a bad idea for the honourable member for North Sydney to understand that the sort of mentality he is displaying tonight is quite extraordinary and is certainly not good for the community. I referred yesterday to a seminar that was held in Melbourne, following the Government's insertion of Part IVA into the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of what the honourable member said tonight, it is quite plain that he may have heard it yesterday but he just does not understand it. He was saying tonight the same sort of thing that was said at that seminar where there was criticism of his Government on the grounds that the penalties under Part IV were too high. It would not be a bad idea if the honourable member were to listen very carefully. The reasons the penalities were too high were stated in the seminar papers as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I myself think that that maximum penalty is too high. It equates artifical but honest arrangements with fraudulent and dishonest steps taken by taxpayers. It blurs the distinction completely between what is clever and tricky on the one hand and what is dishonest and cheating on the other. Not everybody might agree that there should be a distinction but to me there is a distinction between saying 'That is what I've done, I say it works, I think it's clever, it may not be playing fair by the community but that's a different matter' and saying alternatively 'I'm just going to put this money into my pocket'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of view that the honourable member for North Sydney put tonight in answer to what the honourable member for Gellibrand said in relation to this clause. It is another indication of the appalling inability of this Government really to take on this issue and to say: 'If the system is being ripped off in this way it is no different from where we have decided that there will be recoupment'. To exempt that sort of situation outlined by the honourable member for Gellibrand tonight is utterly without excuse and can be explained only by the appalling attitude which was indicated by the honourable member for North Sydney, which is the sort of stuff we get from the tax avoidance industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I fail to understand the Opposition's concern about this matter. It is simply criticising the Bill for something which it is not and which it was never intended it should be in the first place. This legislation is concerned with the recoupment of outstanding company tax lost through fraudulent and illegal evasion by way of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. In simple terms, it employs a technique of identifying a company which has found itself at the bottom of the harbour, tracing backwards and working upwards. All that this legislation and particularly clause 3 (12) do is to specify the terms that this legislation is all about. It is simply saying that if these hitherto legal tax avoidance schemes are struck down, certainly they will not be caught up in this legislation but they will be caught up under the Income Tax Assessment Act. There are plenty of other mechanisms that the Commissioner of Taxation can use, has used and will continue to use in regard to tax avoidance schemes that are struck down. We are not talking in this legislation about tax avoidance schemes; we are talking about fraudulent, illegal evasion. Honourable members opposite are criticising the Bill for not doing something which it was never intended to do in the first place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly in connection with this matter. One of the points I want to make in connection with clause 3 (12) is essentially one of the points that I made when this legislation was being discussed yesterday. I emphasise the claim has been made that this legislation is concerned with the recoupment of tax which was avoided under various types--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Evaded; exactly. It is the recoupment of tax which was evaded. I am indebted to the honourable member for North Sydney for emphasising that word-'evaded'. The point is that if the tax was evaded at the time it was evaded there must have then been laws which made that evasion of the tax illegal. There must have been laws at the time which indicated that the operators of the schemes were commiting an illegal act. If that is so, it means that this legislation we are considering now is not necessary. If this legislation is necessary it means we are not dealing with tax that could not be collected under various evasion practices but we are in fact dealing with tax which was not paid as a result of various types of avoidance practices. There is no other explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of the Government can try to twist themselves around this matter whichever way they like. It was the honourable member for North Sydney who drew attention to the distinction between evasion and avoidance. I emphasise again that evasion is an illegal scheme; avoidance is a legal scheme. If the legislation now before us is concerned with evasion practices those schemes were illegal then. If they were illegal at the time there were laws at the time which made them illegal. I do not know how thick in the skull people have to be before that point sinks in. If the point I have just made is correct and it cannot be refuted, let us put this particular clause and sub-clause into that context. The point about this particular sub-clause is that it exempts from paying recoupment tax those scheme operators who entered into a tax avoidance scheme, believing that it would be successful-of course the main type of tax avoidance scheme they entered into was the Curran scheme-and who stripped the assets of the company which, under the provisions of this legislation and the way in which these schemes have been recognised, would have been an act of evasion because the tax which they had evaded paying could not have been paid since there were no assets left in the company to pay it. The Government cannot have it both ways. If the avoidance scheme was unsuccessful the company was left with no assets to pay the tax. Such people will then be exempt from recoupment action under this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It does not matter very much whether the process of stripping the company of assets was supported by an unsuccessful tax avoidance scheme because in both cases there must have been evasion practices involved. If there were evasion practices involved as members on the Government side including the Treasurer (Mr Howard) claim-there must have been a law at that time which made those practices illegal. If that is so why were those laws not applied? Why is it necessary then --</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope we get an answer. Why is it necessary for the Treasurer and the Government to belatedly bring in this legislation against evasion practices? I emphasise again in conclusion that if they were evasion practices, then they were against the law. If they were against the law there were laws which made them illegal. So let us have no more of this nonsense. The point I made yesterday and the point which I repeat now is that the Government has retreated from the absurd position it adopted before. The Government has tried to claim that this is not really retrospective legislation because we are collecting tax which was illegally evaded. If it was illegally evaded there were laws then which should have been applied. This Government did not apply them. The Treasurer and other representatives of the Government knew as early as 1978 about these practices, these evasion practices against which there must have been legal sanctions, and no action was taken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The other point I want to make is that clause 3 sub -clause (12) is a matter of faith by the Government on the basis that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his 25 July statement made it quite clear that this legislation was meant to catch cases of the nature of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. It was well known when the first draft of the Bill came out and we examined it that there were many other cases that would be caught, cases which would extend well outside the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. That was never the intention of the Government. If that had been the intention of the Government then I should think we would want to be debating that quite separately under a separate Bill. This has brought the Bill into line with the original intention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that I want to flag a reservation which I still have and which I think one or two honourable members might still have in relation to this clause. I hope the Treasurer might comment on this matter in his summing up. There is a fear among some people, as I understand it, that clause 3 (12) (c) may possibly have the effect of defeating the whole clause through its own wording. It refers to the relevant scheme being part of a stripping arrangement and if that stripping arrangement was a bona fide tax minimisation scheme outside the scope of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act, it is just possible, I am advised, that the intent covered in 3 (12) (a), (b) and (d) of excluding cases where there was no purpose for being in the position of not being able to pay tax, might be defeated by 3 (12) (c). </PARA>

Clause 3 (12) (c) would appear to make it possible that if a person entered into a scheme which was a bona fide tax minimisation scheme that person could still be caught under this provision.

Throughout all of the public debate on this legislation the Government has sought to draw a distinction between using legislation of this kind to recoup unpaid tax, which was the produce of an arrangement that had a fraudulent element from all other kinds of avoidance arrangements. The Government has drawn a very clear distinction. I know the Opposition does not believe we should make any distinction. The Opposition would use this type of legislation in respect of anything it could lay its hands on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Opposition members are saying yes. I know they would do that. They have made that perfectly clear. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) has made it clearer than anybody else, and I am indebted to him for his interjection. It reminds me of his contribution last night. All along we have said that in effect a trigger of fraud had to be involved in order that this Bill should come into operation. Our policy objective has been to get a situation in which that trigger of fraud existed. The legislation reaches out to collect that evaded tax from those who enjoyed the financial benefit of the tax evasion. That is why this amendment is necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing I wish to say is that one would imagine, from listening to the honourable member for Gellibrand, that the effect of this clause is to frustrate all the attempts of the Commissioner of Taxation to strike at tax avoidance arrangements. All this clause does is to make it certain that the provisions of this Bill do not apply to those arrangements. It does not in any way hobble the Commissioner of Taxation from fighting pre-August 1977 Curran schemes under the provisions of the law that existed prior to August 1977, which he is very successfully doing, to the benefit of the revenue. I reject the suggestion of the Australian Labor Party that this in some way is a concession to the tax dodging industry. It is a concession to the original policy intention of the Government. If this provision had not been put in we would not be giving effect to the original policy intention of the Government. I want to make that perfectly clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro expressed some concern about the operation of this clause. Let me endeavour, in a very complex area, at the end of a long week, to try to respond to the technical question that the honourable member raised. As best as I can explain it to the honourable gentleman, the position is this: This sub-clause operates to take out of the provision of this Bill a situation in which, after the sale of shares, a company was put into an arrangement that might reasonably then have been regarded as an effective tax avoidance arrangement, provided that the arrangement was not part of a stripping arrangement entered into for the purpose of rendering the company unable to pay its liabilities. That is the intent. Provided all those tests are met the arrangement goes outside the purview of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro drew attention to the provisions of sub- clauses (c) and (d) of this clause. I point out to him that the Bill does not contain an overriding purpose test, whereas the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act states that an arrangement entered into for the purpose or including the purpose of rendering a company unable to meet its tax liabilities is struck at by that legislation. So far as liability is concerned, under this Bill an objective test , not containing a subjective element of a purpose, is sufficient to attract liability under the Bill. Without the provision of sub-clauses (c) and (d) we could well have a situation in which although a dealing of the company, in association with or shortly after the company had been put into a legal tax avoidance arrangement, had the effect of leaving the company unable to pay its debts, it would not have been entered into for the purpose of leaving the company unable to pay its debts. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me instance this. The company may have been put into a legal tax avoidance arrangement, a loan may have been made by the company out of the then calculated remaining assets of the company, and that loan may have become, in the normal commercial course, irrecoverable. If the objective test were applied the company would have been rendered unable to pay its debts. Therefore we found it necessary to put in the purpose test. By doing that we effectively meet the original policy intention of the Government. I think it is important-the Government has not made any secret of the fact-that we sought to distinguish these taxation arrangements and therefore to support the use of legislation that we would not normally use, and we will not normally use in future, because of the particular nature of this practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The distinguishing feature on this occasion, as one of my colleagues called it, has been the trigger fraud. If this provision had not been put in, the legislation would have gone beyond the original policy announcement that I made on 25 July and beyond the repeated public justifications that have been made by the Government in respect of the legislation. Therefore this amendment is necessary. I emphasise again that in no way does this amendment affect the capacity of the Commissioner of Taxation to challenge tax avoidance arrangements under the law that operates in respect of those arrangements. The amendment is purely concerned with ensuring that this legislation recoups the produce of evaded taxation in arrangements where, clearly, there has at some stage been an element of fraud. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us see how he explains this: On the one hand he said that this clause will not limit the capacity of the Commissioner of Taxation to collect all the tax involved in the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and yet on the other hand he said quite clearly that a purposive clause was being introduced here-he then used this term-to establish the trigger of fraud. The fact is that under this clause a situation may arise in which a company, before it actually strips assets, may have been involved in a scheme which it believed to be a tax minimisation scheme but which was later not accepted as a valid tax minimisation scheme. Under that sort of arrangement such a company would be excluded from having to repay the tax involved in a bottom-of-the-harbour operation. I cannot see why, if someone had the intent or purpose of being involved in a tax minimisation scheme which was later rejected by the Commissioner and then there was a stripping of the company's assets, this should be sufficient to exclude that company from having to pay the recoupment tax. In fact, this clause, I put it to the Treasurer, is a back door way of introducing what many members opposite have wanted him to introduce-namely, an innocence provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With this clause many companies can plead that they were involved in the first instance in a tax minimisation process before they were actually stripped of their assets. I cannot understand why this clause is necessary if the aim of the legislation is to collect the maximum amount from all those schemes that went to the bottom of the harbour. If in fact we start to make substantial exceptions of this kind-the shadow Treasurer has mentioned this-up to 25 per cent of the total number of companies involved could be exempted under this provision. I do not see why this is necessary, especially in view of the fact that it may be possible for this provision to be interpreted by the courts in such a way that perhaps more than 25 per cent of those involved in these schemes may be able to claim under it. The Treasurer referred to the objective criterion and then talked about introducing a purposive criterion. There is absolutely no need for this clause or for a purposive criterion. If a company was stripped of its assets and went to the bottom of the harbour it should be required to pay, and that is it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) to clause 3 of the Bill on pages 6 and 7. He proposes to omit sub-clause (12). I reject the amendment. I think that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) have adequately described to the Committee this evening the purpose of sub-clause (12), which is to limit the intent of the legislation to cases where tax is evaded fraudulently and illegally. That is where I differ with the honourable member for Burke (Dr Theophanous). The sub-clause has that purpose. I share the reservations that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro expressed concerning sub-clause (12) (c) when it is read in conjunction with clause 5 (1) (h) on page 11 of the Bill. I was reassured by the Treasurer's response to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. He said that in his view the sub-clause operates to take out of the legislation the situation when, after the sale, what is regarded as a legal scheme is left, provided it is not part of a stripping scheme which makes the company unable to pay its liabilities. The Treasurer said -I was reassured to hear this-that this meets the effective policy intent of the Government. As I see it, the Treasurer has confirmed that the sub-clause applies where there is an intention to strip, an illegality, a fraudulent purpose and fraudulent evasion. It may well be-I assume that the Treasurer takes this into account-that there are strips which are legal and commercial and are carried out for a purpose which perhaps is unrelated to tax or which could be part of a legal minimisation scheme. There may be a situation in which a strip is not avoidance or evasion.</PARA></TALK.START>

I take that explanation to mean that the combination of sub-clause (12) (c) and clause 5 (1) (h) means that there has to be an illegality of the nature described by the Treasurer. I have the reservation that was expressed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro about the result that a combination of sub-clause (12) (c) and clause 5 (1) (h) could produce if there were no illegality or illegal purpose, but not a legitimate arrangement that could be said to have achieved the result referred to in clause 5 (1) (h).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to you for your guidance, Mr Deputy Chairman. The Government has brought forward legislation which has the largest loophole I have ever seen in any legislation. An appalling number of tax evaders and avoiders will avoid their complete tax liabilities. We are told that the Government is serious in trying to recoup $580m of revenue misplaced or stolen from the public purse. The Opposition is pressing for the deletion of part of clause 3 which completely excludes from the ambit of this legislation those promoters who failed, the ones who were a little unlucky, and the companies on which tax is actually owing. The vendor-shareholders of these companies will not be included in the legislation, nor will the promoters. This is most unacceptable to the Opposition. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) has moved an amendment which I completely support. I believe that if this legislation is to be seen by the public as necessary and workable it must include the people who are generally known as the bottom-of-the-harbour tax avoiders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Government members are full of rhetoric and legal advice. I noted a comment by Mr I. C. F. Spry, Q.C., editor of the Australian Tax Review. He talked about the 1978 legislation which dealt with the Slutzkin schemes. That legislation brought in sections 50A to 50N of the Income Tax Assessment Act. He described these sections as 'complex to such an extent that they are hardly intelligible even to experts'. We have heard many Government members explain to us the Slutzkin schemes and what was done in this place to outlaw them. Mr Spry said that the Slutzkin schemes continue. Tonight we are debating legislation that the Liberal- National Party Government has put before the Parliament. Regrettably, it is being debated, even in Committee, in a rather emotive way. We have had near- hysteria as to whether tax has been lost through avoidance or through evasion. Nevertheless, the revenue is missing and it must be recovered. If the Committee had before it examples of which taxpayer took what amount of money out of the public revenue we and the nation would have a clearer appreciation of what was going on. If we even knew whether assessments were issued by the Commissioner of Taxation in relation to all these schemes we would have a clearer indication as to what is happening. It appears that the assessments have not been issued. It appears from other clauses of the Bill which will be debated later that these are to come. I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a short comment tonight . I fully support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Gellibrand because I believe that without it there is an appalling loophole in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The points that have been made by Government speakers in the debate on this clause and the amendment proposed to it boil down to two things. They say, firstly, that sub-clause (12) as it stands, the sub- clause which we seek to delete, gives effect to the Government's intention in respect of this legislation and, secondly, that it does not hobble the Commissioner of Taxation in fighting Curran schemes. I wish to make some remarks in regard to those two very bare points that have been made by Government members in the debate. The first point I make relates to the policy intention of the Government. It is the contention of Opposition members that the Government's policy intention in respect of this legislation has been woefully inadequate; that the Government all along has not sought to get back hundreds of millions of dollars which have been lost under this scheme. That is our undeniable assertion . It is one which the Government has not sought to refute at any stage. Rather, it has knowledge that that is the situation; that it is not seeking to get back hundreds of millions of dollars. It has acknowledged this situation on the basis of trying to make a distinction between tax evasion and avoidance. It is doing so despite the fact that, in the one transaction in the bottom-of-the-harour scheme, a lot of revenue was lost which the Government carves up between what is fraudulent and termed evasion and what is not fraudulent and is termed avoidance . It seeks to get back only that part of the company tax which has been lost because it says that that was an evasion activity. But it does not seek to get back any tax which was lost, for instance, by way of personal income tax which it says was avoidance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By making that distinction, the Government gets itself into some awful messes. It has not addressed itself in any way to one of the basic anomalies which it has now created and which I mentioned earlier in the remarks I made about this sub-clause. That is the discrimination between participants in tax avoidance schemes which is now being built into the legislation. Of course, this discrimination between the two elements is a basic point that we are making in respect of this sub-clause. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I get to that point I wish to make one other point concerning the distinction between tax evasion and tax avoidance. Last year the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) of this country told the nation that there was no difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance. I quoted what he said in my speech in the second reading debate. In May 1981 he said that, in effect, there was no moral difference between avoidance and evasion; that they were both equally culpable. We now have legislation brought in supposedly making that very clear distinction to ensure that a lot of the money that has been lost under this scheme does not have to be paid back. As I have said, in doing so the Government builds in this massive discrimination. This discrimination can be seen in a situation involving participation in a Curran scheme, where the participants in that scheme were not involved in a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme and where that Curran scheme is struck down. In that situation, a tax liability applies to that company. There is a liability to pay tax and the Commissioner of Taxation will proceed to get back that money. But if the participants have been involved in a bottom-of-the- harbour scheme, under this sub-clause the Commissioner of Taxation will not be able to pursue them for those funds. The Treasurer is shaking his head but that is the situation. He does not understand his own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the situation where a tax avoidance scheme is struck down, a tax liability attaches to the company. There are no funds in the company because under the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme the funds have been stripped from it. Therefore, the company cannot pay the tax this legislation states that the taxation Commissioner cannot levy the shareholders or the promoters for that tax. So this Government is discriminating in favour of participants in the bottom-of-the- harbour scheme. That is an indefinible-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Higgins says that that is rubbish. He would not know about one aspect of this legislation. The reality is that the Government is building into this legislation undeniable discrimination with the intention of saying that if a comapny was involved in a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme and that company was participating in a tax avoidance scheme which failed then clearly a tax obligation applies to the company. But there are no funds to pay that tax because the company has been stripped of its assets. The Taxation Commissioner cannot now get that money back from the shareholders and the promoters. That is clear discrimination in favour of participants in the bottom- of-the-harbour schemes. What an absurd and ridiculous situation that is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government is building discrimination into this legislation which makes a mockery of its supposed intention to ensure that bottom-of-the-harbour participants do not get away with stolen funds-to use the term of the Prime Minister. This sub-clause is ensuring that some of those stolen funds remain very securely in the pockets of the beneficiaries of that process. That is what this legislation does. Nothing the Government has said overcomes the basic point which we are making in this regard-that is, that the Government has built in discrimination which is ridiculous in the extreme. In so doing, it has opened up a loophole which will mean that a substantial amount of money which should have been gathered from this legislation will not be so gathered. As I have said, something like 15 per cent of the companies involved have purported tax avoidance schemes associated with them, many of which it is hoped will be struck down. We sincerely hope that that is the case. But it will not matter a damn if they are struck down under this legislation. Still no money will be able to be recouped because there are no assets in the companies to which the tax liability can apply. </PARA>
<PARA> This sub-clause prevents the Taxation Commissioner from going after those people who stripped that money out of the company and who were the beneficiaries of the scheme. It is a ridiculous provision and one which presumably will cost the revenue well over $100m. The Treasurer's talk of $580m is nonsense. He will get back much less than that. The Treasurer is totally wrong in regard to a point he made earlier in reply to a question I asked concerning Curran schemes. We hope that the Curran schemes can be struck down under existing law. We certainly applaud Mr Justice Rogers's decision in this regard. We hope that there will be many more decisions of that kind. Decisions made in respect of participants in the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes will be useless if this sub- clause goes through. There will be no way in which that money will be recouped from the beneficiaries of the schemes. This sub-clause is a complete cop out, as we asserted earlier. It will ensure that the Government makes a very large concession to the tax dodgers. We deplore the Government's refusal to accept this amendment. </PARA>

In the first place they have an avoidance scheme which proves to be unsuccessful. These are the real smarties. They are precisely the scheme operators that the inclusion of this clause in the Bill will allow to get away with the tax that should have been paid.

<PARA> (2) Clause 4, page 8, after sub-clause (3) insert the following sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(3A) A report of the Commissioner under section 14 of the Assessment Act may-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) draw attention to the failure of a person to pay recoupment tax or late payment tax due and payable by the person; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) disclose the identity of the person.''. </PARA>
<PARA>This amendment is designed to reinsert a provision which was in the original recoupment legislation which was brought before this House a month before the Bills now before us were brought to the House. The original legislation had a provision which read exactly as the amendment now before the House. The purpose of that provision was to authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to set out in his annual report the names of persons who participated in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, were assessed for recoupment tax, but had not paid the recoupment tax. It seems to us that there is no real reason for the Government to withdraw that provision, which was in the original legislation. Certainly, with its withdrawal section 14 of the Income Tax Assessment Act still applies, but that does not specifically provide for the naming of persons. We believe that it is thoroughly reasonable that in this situation we have direct authorisation to the Commissioner of Taxation to publish the names of persons who fail to pay the recoupment tax for which they are properly assessed. The Government has given no reasons for eliminating this provision. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his second reading speech simply said the Government had changed its mind on that issue and gave no reasons for so doing. We assume that the reason for making that change is that the Government is concerned about the possible naming of persons who have association with the Liberal Party and who may be required to be named in the annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation if this provision is included in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that there is no good reason for not having this provision. These people, after all, are persons who have been involved in a tax evasion scheme, who have had the use of this money for several years and who have now been finally caught up with; who have been required to pay and who have not paid. In that situation it seems to us that there is every right for the Taxation Commissioner to be able to name those persons in his annual report. The fact that he has that right, of course, will be added inducement to ensure that people, in fact, do pay the tax. If this provision is there and people are going to be named for not paying the tax then people may think twice about not paying the tax. Certainly they may have other more direct financial reasons for not making that payment. But the fact that publicity can attach to their non-payment can be a powerful deterrent, particularly for persons in important positions in this country. We believe, therefore, that it is very important that this provision in fact be included in the legislation. The Government has given us no reasons for its action. We look forward with interest to the Treasurer now telling us why the Government has seen fit to delete a provision which he originally saw fit to include and which we believe is absolutely essential if this measure is to have the proper weight attaching to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Chairman, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is absent for a few moments so may I answer what has been put by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis)? In the first place, we have, of course, the usual smear tactics. What are we told? We are told that the reason this provision has been taken out is that this Government is seeking to cover up for members of the Liberal Party. This is reminiscent of the unsubstantiated but constantly repeated smear which has been put about this chamber by members of the Opposition in the course of the public trial of people who never have the opportunity to come here to answer what has been said about them. Individuals like the honourable member for Gellibrand and other members of the Opposition have time and time again directly, by implication or by innuendo, brought into controversy and attacked and damaged the reputations of people who do not have the opportunity, as they do to exercise and to minimise the absolute privilege which we have. All one can say about that is that it is most contemptible. But one might also say that it is a most understandable exercise given the kind of political leadership that we have experienced in the Australian Labor Party. Honourable members would see-if honourable members opposite would be good enough to listen so that they could learn something, because God alone knows they know little enough about the tax law from what has been said so far-if they bothered to look at section 14 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, that that section which has been there for some time provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the Commissioner shall draw attention to any breaches or evasions of this Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 4 (4) as it was in the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill allowed the Commissioner to publish details of any person who, for whatever reason, including a lack of funds, has not paid recoupment tax. We are dealing with two entirely different situations. One is concerned with breaches or evasions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The second is simply concerned with those who, for whatever reason, fail to pay recoupment tax. I point out to the Committee that the clause places all persons subject to recoupment tax in the same position irrespective of the circumstances under which they sold their shares or under which their shares were sold. For example, an infant beneficiary who is assessed to pay recoupment tax and who is unable to pay that tax would fall within the provision proposed by the honourable member for Gellibrand. Why does he propose it? He does it simply for the purpose, so it would seem, of bringing pressure on people to pay. People should not pay because of public pressure, because of fear of trial in Parliament, because of fear of trial by the media. They should pay or not pay depending on their own individual decisions, their capacity and their legal requirements. When this Parliament substitutes public pressure for that other kind of judgment then what we are doing is capitulating to the kind of leadership that has been put forward on the part of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons we say that this motion should be rejected. Moreover, in putting it forward the honourable member demonstrated that he does not understand the difference between what was involved on the part of the vendor, shareholders and what was involved on the part of others. He says that they were involved in evasions-some may have been; many, one suspects, were not because they were the vendor shareholders. Once again, as is the case with many members of the Opposition, the honourable member has demonstrated a determined incapacity not to draw any distinction between the positions of those who sought to avoid and those who were involved in evasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are hearing further debate in the Committee stage on the distinction between avoidance and evasion. I prefer the term used by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for the time being-that the term is 'stolen funds'. I think that is the term the Australian people can understand. In supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) I am encouraged in this course of action by the fact that this amendment was in the original Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill circulated to honourable members and to the public by the Government of the day. This Government must have acted on the advice of its legal officers, on the advice of the Solicitor-General and on the advice of the Commissioner of Taxation. It is the Government's duty to act on the advice of these officers because it is dealing with $580m of revenue-not its money, not the money of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) or the Liberal Party, but money that belongs to the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In clause 4 we note that the taxpayers who are caught up by this recoupment tax have rights of appeal. The whole clause deals with the rights of taxpayers who are assessed for company tax and who are unhappy with the assessment. It details at some length the provisions in the amending Bill before the chamber. The Commissioner's office, unfortunately, does not deal expeditiously with appeals to boards of review or, for that matter, the courts in this nation. The Commissioner's office has been shown to be able to deal expeditiously when dealing with the tax assessment or the tax liability of the businessman, Mr John Reid, who was mentioned in this chamber. That gentleman was allegedly cleared of his tax liability in one evening. Between the time of leaving this chamber and coming in the next day a letter was circulated to honourable members, typed in the Department of the Treasury, clearing Mr Reid. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty that is before the chamber and before the whole of the Australian nation is that the appeal section in relation to taxation assessments for company tax, personal income tax or any variety of tax, has ground to a halt and is no longer functioning. This Government has let this appeal procedure run down. There is no statement at all, no mention, by the absent Treasurer as to what the Government proposes to do in relation to these appeals. The traditional procedure of the Commissioner in relation to an appeal against an assessment on company tax or any other sort of tax is that half of the assessed tax must be paid. This legislation has other provisions in relation to the payment by instalment of taxes assessed, but it is unclear whether, in the event of an appeal against an assessment, the Commissioner will rely on the old established procedure of requiring only half the tax to be paid pending the outcome of the court proceedings. Of course, this whole system of requiring company taxes to be only half paid has discriminated against the great mass of taxpayers in our land , those who come under the pay-as-you-earn scheme. Those personal income taxpayers have already paid their tax. The Commissioner holds the amount of tax in dispute until a board of review has determined the appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Committee to another article in the Australian Tax Review Volume 10 No. 4 of December 1981 in which the editor, I. C. F. Spry, Q.C. , draws attention to the grave concern relating to the roles of boards of review . The editor states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . boards of review are intended to provide inexpensive, quick, confidential and impartial resolutions of disputes between taxpayers and the commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The present constitution and operation of the boards of review is in certain respects very unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA>He then deals with the delays that occur before boards of review. This whole clause before the Committee details at great length all of the provisions for appealing to boards of review. These appeal procedures make a mockery of the truth because they do not operate. In this day and age the accountants, the solicitors and the ordinary taxpayers know that taxation boards of review cannot function. They have been allowed to wind down and additional boards have never been appointed. The whole system of appeal has ground to a halt. What are Government members doing about it? Nothing. They are not even interested in it. They cross the floor and carry on with the charade of alleged opposition to these provisions but they are totally indifferent to the rights of ordinary taxpayers who have to go before these boards of review together with all the other--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GP4">Mr MAHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already dealt with the amendment. As I understand it, we are in Committee and the Committee is dealing with clause 4. I have spoken in support of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and I am proceeding to deal with another section of this clause which I think is of great importance. It is of importance to Australians who have been unfortunate enough to be involved with bottom-of-the-harbour promoters. I feel very sorry for these people. I have a genuine interest in them and their ability to take action if they want to appeal. The Government is legislating against many of these unfortunate people. Many are the Government's own supporters, members of the Liberal Party. It is saying: 'Here is an appeal system. If you do not like what is going to happen you can go to court or to a board of review'. I am saying they cannot go to a board of review and the Treasurer knows this. He has had letters from me and from other honourable members to the effect that the board of review system is not operating any longer. It has collapsed. The Committee has before it a Bill, clause 4 of which deals at great length with the appellate procedures for taxpayers who are unhappy with an assessment made by the Commissioner of Taxation. That is why I am drawing the attention of the Committee to these matters tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If honourable members are at all interested in tax matters I suggest that they go to the Parliamentary Library and have a look at this fine Australian publication, Australian Tax Review, and look at the situation of small taxpayers who take their cases to boards of review. These cases are about self-education expenses, travelling expenses and perhaps people who carry their tools in the boot of a car. These people will be thrown in higgledy-piggledy with all the bottom-of-the-harbour people waiting their turn. It might take two years for the matter to come before the Commission of Taxation and then they have to get in the queue at the board of review. That might take another three or four years. We do not even know whether they will have to pay all their tax, seeing that it is company tax that has not been paid. I believe this is a scandalous state of affairs. I believe the Treasurer must inform the nation of just what the Government proposes to do about this appellate system which has ground to a halt .

When this Bill is passed and we discuss the intention of this Government in bringing this tax down under section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act we might ask ourselves whether there is a responsibility, in accordance with the intention of this Parliament, to collect tax from a shareholder on account of a tax liability of a company. At the moment there is no tax liability. When this legislation creates a tax liability that person will be entitled to be treated like any other person who today incurs a tax liability. The Opposition wants to make a villain of such a person. The point I made at the beginning is that there seems to be great hypocrisy. If a constituent of the honourable member for Lowe seeks to avoid tax, namely Customs duty, by sewing gold and silver chains inside his coat before going through Customs, that is not tax avoidance according to the honourable member for Lowe. If honourable members read Hansard further they will see that the honourable member for Lowe got that person off. He was never convicted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to some of the comments made by the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender), whose attempt to defend what the Government has done in taking out sub-clause (3A) was one of the most pathetic defences I have ever heard. The honourable member for North Sydney may know something about the law but it is quite obvious that he knows absolutely nothing about morality. He mentioned that it was not relevant that public pressure should be brought to bear on persons to pay their taxes under the legislation. He argued that public pressure was an irrelevant phenomenon and that it was somehow immoral that public pressure should be brought into the matter. I remind the honourable member that if it had not been for public pressure we would not even have this legislation before the place. If it had not been for the media, the Costigan report and public pressure the Government would never have done anything in relation to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the record of prosecutions by this Government in relation to other tax avoidance and evasion measures. It is absolutely pathetic and disgraceful. If there is no public pressure how are we to know whether sensible action will be taken in relation to these matters? The threat of naming the person who have refused to pay tax is a very reasonable one indeed and it is a necessary pressure. Let us go back to the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in relation to what we are talking about here. He said that these actions are thoroughly immoral, disgraceful and cannot be justified. Under those circumstances what is wrong with bringing public moral pressure to bear so that people pay their taxes? There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for taking out this clause. I contrast the sudden morality of honourable members opposite who talk about these poor rich persons-they are nearly all extremely rich persons-being smeared or having their names published as not wanting to pay up their due share of tax. This Government does not seem to have had too much worry about printing the names of social security beneficiaries who, for example , have been brought before a court. </PARA>

The honourable member says 'What is wrong with that?' I suggest that the people should do something wrong-they should evade tax or breach the law-before the Commissioner has the right to include their names in a report to be tabled in this Parliament. The Opposition's attitude is completely consistent. It does not need any evidence of wrongdoing before it names people in this Parliament. I believe that the Australian community is sick and tired of the Opposition's attitude, which is evidenced in the comments that the honourable member has made in this debate. The people of this country are sick and tired of the Australian Labor Party naming people day after day in this Parliament without any evidence at all to back up its claims.

This matter arose from an inquiry established by the Fraser Government into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union in an attempt to smear the Australian Labor Party. We found that the ship painters and dockers were not simply involved in criminal activities, but were representing the remnants of Australia's failed upper class in their tax avoidance practices. The smears, if they are to be so called, were established first of all by the Liberal Party which raised smearing to an art form in 1975 by its unprincipled attacks upon Dr Cairns, Mr Connor and everybody associated with them. Not only did members of the Liberal Party do that; they also wrote out cheques for dud information with which to smear people. I lived here in those days; do not tell me about smearing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members opposite are about protecting people who have fraudulently misappropriated funds which belong to the Commonwealth of Australia . They are the people honourable members opposite are seeking to protect. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Braddon, and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) seem to argue with convoluted logic that people who evade tax through criminal practices and who then fail to pay under a liability established by the Commissioner of Taxation should not have their failure to pay recoupment tax or late payment tax drawn attention to by the Commissioner. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) provides expressly for the Commissioner to draw attention to such failures to pay. If people are assessed and they do not pay, why should they not be exposed as participants in the scheme?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite think it is their job to protect those they see as members of their own class and who have been involved for years in criminal activities to avoid taxation. Some of the wealthiest private citizens of this country and some of the wealthiest private companies in this country, which this country has been very kind to, descended to the depths by taking on these obviously criminal schemes to evade and avoid income tax. Yet when the Government writes this provision into the legislation, all the hacks on the Government back bench who represent such people want this provision removed from the Bill before it is presented. We want to get the provision back to keep pressure on those people who have participated in these fraudulent and contrived tax avoidance schemes. We say that if they are finally assessed as having a liability and do not pay-they have been given 12 months in which to pay, a provision we do not approve of-they should be mentioned by the Commissioner. Many people whom honourable members opposite represent in this Parliament will not want to be disclosed as being participants in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and other schemes of criminal import. I do not know how honourable members opposite, as representatives of the Australian public, can argue that people should be able to rip off the revenue, not pay when they are assessed as being liable and then not be mentioned. That is what honourable members opposite are arguing. First of all, such people avoided tax. Then they were assessed. Honourable members opposite are saying that such people, having been assessed, should never be named by the Commissioner if they do not pay. Honourable members opposite are trying to equate naming by the Commissioner with smearing by the Labor Party. It is not a matter of a smear of the Labor Party. It is to do with naming by the Commissioner in a report. </PARA>

We say that if they are assessed and still refuse to pay, there should be an express provision in the legislation to oblige the Commissioner of Taxation to bring the public sanction of exposure on to their heads. Why should there not be a sanction? Yet honourable members opposite use this argument about smearing. They have smeared people for years.

<PARA> Where-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a person makes a request in writing to the Commissioner that the Commissioner disclose to the person information relating to an arrangement or transaction referred to in paragraph 5 (1) (h) or 2 (h); and . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This clause is about requests in writing to the Commissioner of Taxation for information relating to the nine trigger provisions contained in clause 5 of the Bill. I had intended moving an amendment, Mr Deputy Chairman, but, like one of your former colleagues from another place, while I may have the logic I certainly do not have the numbers. Whilst not moving the amendment, I raise the matter with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and ask him to respond before the vote is taken. What we are doing, in some cases up to 10 years down the track, is imposing a liability on people who hitherto had no such liability. We are giving them the right in this clause to write to the Commissioner to seek information about how and on what basis this liability was determined. We specify that they can seek information relating to the arrangement or transaction referred to in paragraphs 5 (1) (h) or 5 (2) (h), but what concerns me is that there are nine trigger provisions, not one. I believe that if we are to impose this liability on people retrospectively they should have a right to information about all of the nine trigger provisions. The explanatory memorandum at page 28 deals with this clause. As one skims down the page one sees that a person will be able to obtain certain information. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The information which the Commissioner of Taxation is authorised to disclose to a person under this paragraph is information that is relevant to an assessment of that person's liability to pay recoupment tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Further down it refers to full knowledge, and then provides that the person will be able to obtain the identities of and details about the persons liable to pay promoters recoupment tax. It provides that a person will be able to obtain all information. Now, the words 'all information' are also included in sub-clause (5 ) (b) on page 9, but because sub-clause (5) (a) identifies only one of the trigger provisions, and that is specifically the arrangement or transaction, I have a doubt as to whether the person who will be receiving this assessment, if writing to the Commissioner, will in fact be able to obtain all the information. Leaving aside the rights or wrongs of imposing that liability on a taxpayer, surely we should-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) has raised this matter with me. I will try to respond to the points he has put. The first comment I make is that this particular provision, that is, the provision enabling the Commissioner of Taxation to make information available, in effect, about the affairs of the promoters and the activities of the promoters after the sale of shares in subject companies, was in fact put into the Bill prior to the Government's decision to include promoter provisions. It was put in the Bill against the background of there not being at that time contemplated action under this Bill against the promoters. In those circumstances the case for making the information available was that much stronger. The promoter provisions having been put in the Bill there has been some diminution of the need for this particular provision. Nonetheless, the Government perseveres with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out to the honourable member for Tangney that, as I understand what he is asking for, his suggestion would involve the provision of information which would go beyond what the High Court of Australia has in cases ordered the Commissioner of Taxation to provide to people who are in receipt of taxation assessments. There can be no argument, quite apart from this particular amendment, that under the existing law as enunciated on a number of occasions-as recently as 1977-by the High Court of Australia there is extensive obligation under that law for the Commissioner of Taxation to provide relevant particulars and information. It is, of course, a different thing when the particulars sought really amount to evidence. The courts have long drawn a distinction between requiring a plaintiff or an applicant to make available what constitutes reasonable particulars of the basis of a claim and what constitutes evidence in support of those particulars. </PARA>
<PARA> I encourage the honourable member for Tangney to accept my assurance that first , to the extent that there are now promoter provisions in the Bill, the original motivation for the change is perhaps not as great-although it is still a desirable provision. Secondly, the general law requires the Commissioner of Taxation to make full provisions available. Thirdly, as I understand what the honourable member has said, giving full effect to his request would result in vendor shareholders in this situation receiving information that in previous cases the courts, would not, as a matter of quite invariable practice, order the Commissioner to make available. I hope the honourable member might accept that that is a reasonable basis for the Government's not accepting his amendment, notwithstanding the question of numbers or anything else. </PARA>

<PARA> Clause 5, page 15, after sub-clause (3) insert the following sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> '(3A) A primary taxable amount shall not be taken to exist in relation to a person in relation to the sale of shares or of an interest in shares in relation to an amount of ordinary company tax or undistributed profits tax payable by a company in relation to a year of income unless, immediately before the time of sale of the shares or interest in shares, the person knew or believed, or could reasonably be expected to have known or believed, that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) ordinary company tax or undistributed profits tax, as the case may be, was payable, or would become payable, by the company in relation to the year of income; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an arrangement or transaction had been or would be entered into or carried out for the purpose of securing or achieving the result that the company would not be able to pay to the Commissioner all of the ordinary company tax or undistributed profits tax, as the case may be, that was, or would become, payable by the company in relation to the year of income.'</PARA>
<PARA>It has long been a principle of common justice in this country that those who act within the law ought with certainty be able to be protected by that law. As so many speakers said in the debate on the second reading of the Taxation ( Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982 (No. 2) last night, there is a grave misgiving that the Bill as a whole breaches that longstanding commitment of the Government to the people of this country. I nevertheless made it clear to the Government-I want to make it quite public now-that I have been for some weeks prepared to compromise my position in relation to the rule of law and the certainty under which I believe people ought to be able to act within that law to the extent that I would be prepared to vote for this legislation if it could at least protect those people who are by any stretch of the imagination demonstrably innocent of a knowing act to defraud the tax. It is for that reason that I have moved the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that there are still some classes of people who, once this amendment were inserted in the Bill, would still not be protected. Certainly those who knowingly sold, within the law, to those who later broke the law-in terms of this Bill or in terms of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act-would still be caught and I would still not be happy, not because I would condone that knowing act of tax evasion but simply because I respect the law. With my amendment inserted, that would tidy up-having had inserted clause 3 (12), already debated tonight-three other of the four possible classes of people, namely, those who knowingly sold to those who did not break the law; those who unknowingly sold to those who did not break the law and, with the so-called fairness clause as it has been called in the Press, those who reasonably would not have knowingly sold to those who broke the law. I simply want to extend the degree of fairness in this legislation so that reasonable, decent Australians can stomach it. </PARA>
<PARA> Many cases would be protected simply by the inclusion of this clause. I do not want to postulate a wide range of those cases. Despite the fact that some people have been publicly saying that everyone is guilty it is not for me or for any other politician to determine guilt. That is for the courts to decide. There are obviously, in my view, many people who could possibly have been innocent, such as minority shareholders who would not normally have known of all the transactions or all the deals. There are many cases in which people who were at arm's length could have been involved. If we look through the provisions of this Bill and at the way in which it chases companies, trusts or whatever down to a natural person, we will see that there will surely be some natural persons, or even one natural person, who could not reasonably be thought to have been implicated in conspiring towards an evasion of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the common decency of members on both sides of the House to support me in my endeavour to restore some legitimacy to this legislation; to restore the legislation to such a state that in 10 or 20 years we might at least be proud of it. The amendment, just in case people might think that it is too loose , places the onus of proof on the vendor shareholder who believes that he could come within its provisions to show that not only did he not know or not believe that subsequent to the sale of the shares the company would be placed in a position in which it could not deliberately pay tax, but also that he could not reasonably have been expected to have known or to have believed that. If that is not fair enough for those who are on a witch hunt, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA> When I listened to what was said on the Opposition benches tonight and last night I was reminded of the mentality of the self-righteous people who, in the days of the Inquisition and of Joan of Arc, said that everyone in a class was guilty. I realised that civilisation has not reached the stage that I thought it had reached. </PARA>

Let me tell him that millions of reasonable, decent Australians have been ripped off by this scheme. Millions of decent Australians have had to pay a lot more tax because of its operation. The honourable member's concern should be for them rather than for the people who benefited from the scheme. He made a passionate, heart rending plea on behalf of the people who benefited from the scheme and ignored those who have been ripped off by it.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say quite openly that there may be some people who were so naive that they thought that Brian Maher was Father Christmas; that when he came along with his offer to give them much more than the company was worth they thought he was just a benign old gentleman who was going around handing out lots of money to nice people like them. There may have been some people who were so naive and innocent as to believe that that was the situation. Frankly we find that pretty hard to believe. We believe that such persons would be a minuscule proportion of those who benefited from the scheme. After all, we are talking about people who are shareholders in companies, people who presumably have some knowledge about their business interests and some concern for those business interests. They knew that their company was going through some substantial change and must have been interested in it. After all, companies were cashed up. In the typical situation other assets were transferred to another company, and that company often continued to trade under a different name. The shareholders in the company must have known that something curious was going on. They were also told not to ask any questions. That would make even the most innocent person fairly suspicious about what was going on. If one is told: 'Look, you have a buyer. Do not ask any questions, for God's sake. This is the best deal you will ever get. Take the money and run,' one would start to think: 'Gee, there must be something a little curious about what is going on'. To say that there are lots of innocents out there who will be unfairly afflicted by this legislation is an absolute absurdity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If there are any such people they are incredibly naive people. Honourable members must also bear in mind that if there are any such people they have benefited from the scheme. That in the end is the basic point-whether or not they are innocent. Let me say that overwhelmingly they knew what they were all about. Whether or not they were innocent, they benefited from the scheme-a fraudulent scheme. The Government said it is a fraudulent scheme and that it is one against which it will legislate because of the element of fraud in it. It therefore said these people were participants in a matter of fraud and that they benefited from that fraudulent scheme. They have the capacity to pay the tax which is owing; they were the beneficiaries of the scheme. There is no reason to weep tears for people who benefited from a tax rip off because they have the capacity now to recoup that tax which was unfairly ripped off the rest of the Australian taxpayers. Honourable members should not come in here with their bleeding-heart stories on behalf of people who milked the system for what they could get out of it. Even if they were totally innocent and grossly naive those people were still beneficiaries of this device. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe it is ridiculous for anyone to contemplate this innocence clause. We commend the Government for not giving in to the pressures which have clearly been upon it to give in to them. I must say that had it done so it would have reduced a piece of legislation which is already a sham to an absolute absurdity. As I have said previously, this legislation will fail to get back a vast amount of the money which was lost under this scheme, but if we include this kind of clause every one of the participants will say: 'Gee, I did not know what was going on. I was innocent. I had no idea that there were nasty people who were going to throw the company into the harbour. I was innocent and therfore I should not have to pay the tax'. These sorts of pleas would be made by many of those people and we would be opening up a potentially massive breach in the legislation, depending on how the courts inerpret it. We can see no justification for giving in to this absurd amendment and we wholeheartedly reject it. </PARA>

There are people who are innocent. In fact, so far as this legislation is concerned they are all innocent. Does the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) really believe that an infant could have known what was happening? The question of guilt or innocence does not arise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a particular concern with the legislation which I believe would be overcome by the amendment. That is why I am prepared to support it although I accept that it could be argued that the amendment is wider than is necessary to cover my problem with the legislation. Whilst I have prepared an alternative amendment I think it would probably not be worthwhile putting that amendment as I believe the fate of this amendment which has been moved is already sealed. I also want to explain why I think the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) is quite wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation excludes vendor-shareholders who sold the shares of a company which was subsequently put into a tax avoidance scheme which could reasonably have been regarded at the time as being effective in its simple tax avoidance purpose. The Treasurer (Mr Howard), in his second reading speech to the amended legislation, said that in that type of situation it can be fairly put that because the avoidance scheme could not be said to be part of the arrangement to leave the company unable to meet its tax liability an element of fraud is not present. In other words, a vendor who sold his company, which was then subject to an avoidance arrangement, will not be caught by the legislation. My concern is with the vendor who was approached by someone who wishes to buy his company in a situation where the price offered was exceptionally good. The vendor may have said: 'I cannot believe this. The price appears to me to be too high.' If he then sought advice he could have been told that the purchaser would undertake a legal commercial arrangement with the company to minimise tax. The vendor may then have sold the company but the purchaser may not have undertaken a legal arrangement to reduce the tax liability but instead bottomed the company. That vendor will be subject to this recoupment tax. That person who undertook due inquiry to ensure that the purchaser would not act illegally will be caught by the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gellibrand said quite rightly that the vendor- shareholder has received a benefit. The problem with his case is that if the vendor sold his company part way through a financial year and the company, unbeknown to him, despite due inquiry by him to ensure that it would not happen, was put to the bottom of the harbour, he is, under this legislation, liable for tax which will be assessed as at the time of sale. Let us say the financial year had three or four months to go. The vendor, if he had not sold, could have done a number of things with that company to alter his ultimate tax position at the end of the financial year. For example, if he was a farmer he could have bought some irrigation equipment which was subject to 120 per cent depreciation. He could have substantially altered his taxable position. However, he will now not have that opportunity because the purchaser, unbeknown to him, has acted illegally and has evaded the tax that was payable by that company. </PARA>
<PARA> A vendor may have been caught by a purchaser who has acted illegally. He will now have to pay the tax that was payable by the company at the time of sale. For the reasons I have stated, I believe that that is offensive and that the amendment which has been proposed would overcome that situation. I do not know whether there are any vendors actually in that position. I do not know whether there are people who made due inquiry. Quite frankly, I do not believe that those who were told not to inquire fall into this category. I do not believe that they made due inquiry, and they ought to be caught by the legislation. I will support the amendment and, if the amendment is not passed, I will accept the judgment of this place and I will still support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) both made the point that they find this legislation offensive. They said that people who were innocent would be punished . The contribution of the honourable member for Moore was fairly short and electrifying. I could not quite follow what he said in a very short time. He seemed to be saying that if an infant benefited he may be punished. It would not be the infant who would be paying the tax. There would be a trust arrangement of some sort. I found it difficult to follow what the honourable member was talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When one considers the points made by both the honourable member for Moore and the honourable member for Barker one starts to have some reluctant sympathy for the Treasurer (Mr Howard). Honourable members opposite keep ducking away from the point that the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) made repeatedly. We have a package of four Bills which are designed to recover from vendor- shareholders, other former owners of companies stripped of pre-tax profits, scheme promoters and their associates the tax evaded by those companies. Why are honourable members saying that people will be punished because they have to pay tax that they were liable to pay anyway? That is the point that has been made over and over again. This legislation seeks to recoup tax that was in fact payable by people who have entered into some sort of extraordinary artificial scheme in an attempt to avoid that tax. It totally escapes me why people are concerned about the fact that people will be asked to pay tax which was due and owing. That is the view the Treasurer and most honourable members opposite have taken. However, an extraordinary attitude is taken by some members opposite who seem to be trying to protect people who they claim are innocent. Even if they did not know what was going on they nevertheless derived the benefit. It was a financial benefit on which they should have paid tax. Now, belated though it may be, the Government has decided it will attempt to recover the tax. It is absolute nonsense to talk about people being punished when they are being asked to pay what should have been paid anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> Another interesting point was made by the honourable member for Barker when he talked about vendor-shareholders. He conceded that that honourable member for Gellibrand was correct in saying that these people had received a benefit. But he then talked about someone selling a company which had accumulated profits half way through the year. He argued that, if such a person had known that he would be liable under legislation such as this to pay the tax that should have been paid anyway had it not been for the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme, he could have taken opportunities to do other things. </PARA>

I think that was the term that the honourable member for Barker used. I come back to the point on which the honourable member for Gellibrand started and finished. The fact is that the honourable members opposite who are arguing against this Bill ought to come back to the basic fact that it is designed to recover tax that was evaded by the companies. Honourable members opposite have talked about the fact that people are being punished in some way because they are innocent. All we are asking is for them to be liable for the recoupment of tax that was payable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find the argument of the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis), that innocent people can be hanged, so to speak, to get the guilty, obnoxious. He does not deny that there may be innocent people among those who will be asked to pay recoupment tax. Yet he said that they should all be caught with the same net and should all be treated equally. That was the greatest fallacy of his argument. He has applied 1982 standards to the standards which were applied by the Labor Party when in government. What happened? What demands were made on these people in 1975? Honourable members opposite should face up to the fact that this legislation goes back to the time of Labor administration. Those were the days when one could buy loss companies at 10c in the dollar and put those loss companies with profit companies. That was the legacy left to the Australian community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many of the people involved were advised by professionals to engage in what may or may not have later been bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. They were advised by professionals and, as vendors, many of them believed that the situation that belonged to the days of Labor would continue. A number of honourable members would have had constituents who had been innocently caught up in these schemes. I have such a constituent. Without naming him, I can give honourable members the circumstances surrounding the case. He is a person who finished his last year in business with a good profit. He was advised by his life long accountants that there were means of selling the company, for someone legitimately to buy the company and to put losses with that company. The accountant said however: 'We do not know fully the circumstances by which this can be accomplished. We advise you to go to the most reputable accountants in the land to get advice'. He went to the most reputable accountants and was so advised. He sold his company. Subsequently this legislation has been brought before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> He cannot be advised by anyone at the moment whether he will be liable to pay recoupment tax because he does not know what happened to his company. The Bill says that if his company was subsequently put into a legal avoidance scheme he will not have to pay recoupment tax but if it was put into a bottom-of-the- harbour scheme he will have to pay that tax. However, he knows that his company was liquidated several years later. He assumes that it was officially and properly liquidated and that it met the taxation requirements of liquidisation- but he does not know. No one in this House can tell him. It is an absurd situation for the honourable member for Gellibrand to oppose an innocence clause that would be required to put this man in a proper legal position-a man who had been advised by some of the most eminent professionals in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In speaking to this measure yesterday I said that we as a government advise business people to go to professionals for their taxation requirements. This is to be found in government literature which is available in bookshops sponsored by the Government. We say to people in the business community that the taxation laws are too intricate to be involved in. We tell them to go to professionals. Now we are saying in this legislation that the professionals may have been crooked. But we also say that there will be no innocence clause to which to appeal. I think it is preposterous that the honourable member for Gellibrand, representing the Opposition, can deny that right to even one innocent person. What sort of Australian justice is this which denies the rights of one innocent person? Is not that what this legislation is about? Who would condemn one innocent person to get 99 guilty people? Let him speak if he will. I find this a betrayal of Australian justice. I vehemently support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to see the honourable member for Boothy (Mr Steele Hall) shedding crocodile tears for innocent constituents who are caught up in tax evasion. We are not talking about innocence or guilt but about tax evasion and recoupment and whether a person innocently, accidentally or knowingly evaded tax and pocketed the money. The constituent to whom he referred has had thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, put into his pocket which have been ripped off ordinary Australian taxpayers. But what is the position of honest workers who have no way in which to avoid paying their taxes- nor do they wish to do so. No one likes to pay tax, but the workers do not even see that tax. It is taken out of their pay packets before they get them. It is taken out by the law of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other people whom honourable members opposite try to protect. They are the more blatant tax avoiders and evaders. I put all these people in the same category, irrespective of what the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) had to say about the law being framed in this way or that way. The intent is to defraud and to rip off the ordinary taxpayers and workers in this country. That is what these people were doing all the time. Now honourable members opposite are trying to defend those few who are getting caught up with this legislation that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) so belatedly had to introduce under public pressure. Today it is difficult to tell the difference between the Queen's birthday honours list and the report of the Commissioner of Taxation. I would not know the difference any more.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is a new tax; a tax payable by another entity, namely, the company. The company did not pay that tax for reasons which are obvious. This legislation suggests that individuals should be responsible for that tax. Honourable members opposite have said that no one involved in these schemes could be innocent. But of course this legislation is suggesting-honourable members should please listen to this-that people should have the right to go forward and prove their innocence. The onus of proof is upon them. If there are no innocent people that is an end to the matter. But they should have the right to go forward and establish their innocence, to prove that they had an innocent state of mind and that they did not know what was going to happen to these companies. On the information that I have available to me, I believe that there were people who had an innocent state of mind, who believed that they were acting properly and within the law. There were wives who simply signed documents and who were not principal actors in the events. There were sons and daughters, infant children. There were ordinary people who did not take an active interest in the running of the affairs of the company in which they held shares, not in which they were officers. This legislation covers shareholders. There were people who did not know what was happening. There were others who went to what they believed were respected lawyers and advisers, who said that, because of the High Court's decision in Slutzkin's case, this was a lawful scheme. On that basis they entered into the scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members are saying that this is simply an attempt to recover the tax and that there is no penalty. I suggest to them that people will suffer-listen to those words-because under this legislation they will be required to pay, or repay, money to the Government which companies should have paid some years ago. These people have spent that money, in most cases. The money is not just lying idle in the bank, it has been invested in a business. It may have been used to create jobs for people in this country. It may have been spent in one way or another or invested in some form which is creating employment in this country, and now these people will suffer if they are asked to repay that money. If Opposition members cannot understand that point they cannot understand the sense of justice. These people acted, they believed, within the law, because the basis of this amendment is an innocent state of mind. They must have an innocent state of mind to gain the benefit of this amendment. That is a point that I am sure honourable members on the other side will not understand. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing here, as the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) said , with innocence and with a fair go. This is Australia. We have got a sense of fair go in this country. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) said: 'Ah yes, I admit there are some innocent people.' I assume he suggests that there are innocent people within the meaning of this amendment we are suggesting . He said: 'That is too bad. We cannot be concerned about innocent people. We are not concerned that innocent people might suffer.' That is what this is all about-innocence. Opposition members should read it. The obligation, the onus, is upon the taxpayer to go forward and establish only that he had a state of mind which was innocent, but, and I read the words 'could reasonably be expected to have known or believed.' That is an objective test. I suggest it is a test that will not be very easy to get around despite what honourable members opposi te say. It is a difficult test because it is an objective test. The court might well say on the evidence before it, on the documents, on the general situation, that these people ought to have known, despite the fact that they might plead subjectively that they did not know. The court, on the objective test, can look at all the evidence. The honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) shakes his head. I believe he will understand what I am talking about; he will see sense in what I am talking about. </PARA>
<PARA> Why can we not allow these people, these innocent people-it has been admitted that there are innocent people-to have the right to go forward and establish their innocence? If they are not innocent, that is it. I agree with the honourable member for Boothby that if there is one innocent person this amendment is justified. We are talking about people who will suffer. As I said before, honourable members opposite may not see it but people who believe they are acting properly and within the law may have gained a benefit from acting within the law. They have used that money, spent that money. They have invested that money in some way and maybe have created jobs. I know that the Labor Party is not concerned with the question of retrospectivity. If this is prospective, that is okay, but we are talking about a matter that goes back 10 years. I know that Opposition members will not understand it. </PARA>
<PARA> They have a philosophical hang-up about this. They are out to get these people. It is a witch hunt. They do not care whether these people are innocent or guilty . As I have said, that is what this is all about. If people are not innocent, what are we concerned about? If they are all guilty-I know Opposition members believe everyone involved is guilty-they have no concern. This only gives them the right to go ahead and try to establish that they are innocent. I base my argument on the fact that we are dealing with retrospective legislation. I have a fundamental objection to retrospective legislation. If these people acted against the law, let them be dealt with according to the law which applied at that time. As was said earlier, we are talking about 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1975, when the Opposition was in government. We go back 10 years. If these people were acting unlawfully, they should have been dealt with according to the law; or if there are laws that apply now under which they can be dealt with, let them be dealt with according to that law. </PARA>
<PARA> This whole issue concerns a very fundamental principle, as I said in my speech on the second reading of the Bill, that is, the rule of law. I know we can say: 'Why worry about the rule of law?' I believe principles are still important. I know there are some members opposite who say that, the only principle is to win votes and to win government, but there are principles with which we have to be concerned, and a fundamental principle is the need to obey the rule of law. I have no brief for tax evaders. I say: 'Let us get tough on tax evaders, but let us do it prospectively, in the future. Let us not go back 10 years.' Certainly the least we can do is to protect innocent people. </PARA>

What is intriguing about their remarks is that they are addressing them to the Opposition. They seem conveniently to overlook the fact that a substantial majority of people on their side are also going to oppose this amendment. Here, for once, I am able to have common cause with a majority of the Liberal Party in this House. The Treasurer ( Mr Howard) and the majority of the Liberal Party, and apparently most of the National Party in this House, recognise the shallow idiocy of the arguments that have been put up tonight by speaker after speaker. I challenge some of the others who are going to vote with us to defeat this clause to get up and express their views on this matter as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is all very well to talk about the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis). The honourable member for Gellibrand is not the only one who is opposed to this proposition. Every member on this side of the House is opposed to it, and the vast majority of those on the other side of the House are opposed to it as well. That is because there is a simple fallacy in the argument of the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom) and, more particularly, in the argument of the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall). What they have overlooked -we know what they are up to-is that this is simply a back door method of exonerating people from the tax liability which they had, always had, and knew they had. That is the simple truth. It is not a question of innocence or guilt, it is a question of tax liability and whether they were beneficiaries. If they got the money, they ought to pay it back. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument put forward by the honourable member for Braddon is that they have spent it. I know they have spent it. They have spent it in Gold Coast apartments , I dare say. They have had the interest free use of it for years and years, in many cases, and now all that is being asked of them is to get back the 1977-78 value in money terms, which of course is much less in real terms now. They do not have to pay the interest, and they have had the interest free use of that money for all that period. In any event, what difference does it make? The tax man has always reserved the right to go back and issue new assessments if, in the course of events, he has discovered that a mistake was made. There is no finality about the tax assessment that the honourable member for Braddon might have received last year. If one gets a revised tax assessment it is no good excusing oneself on the basis of saying: 'Oh, I am sorry. I spent the money and I can't pay it back'. One would be laughed out of court by the tax man and everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure what year the honourable member for Boothby is talking about when he talks about the revered businessman who found a sneaky tax lurk hanging around which allowed him to avoid tax. This businessman, presumably shrewd, apparently successful, knew that he had a tax liability. Yet he wanted to arrange his affairs in such a way as to avoid that tax liability. If he got the benefit then he ought to be forced to pay up now. That is really the only issue that is involved in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I daresay that Denis Horgan has about seven million bucks hanging on the fate of this clause. His simple defence has been that he did not know.

I would have thought it was disclosure in the public interest. I would have thought that every elector was interested in who was running the Liberal Party in Western Australia, who was raising the money for the Liberal Party and, more particularly, how they were raising the money for it. I would like to know how much of the $7m the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party got. Maybe it is one of the innocents who are trying to be protected from this clause as well. I daresay that some pretty grubby money found its way into the coffers of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. There are some pretty shamefaced people in Western Australia as a consequence. Denis Horgan's simple defence in this whole matter has been that he did not know. I find that a breathtaking proposition. I daresay that the amendment is designed to provide an excuse for Denis Horgan actually to prove the fact that he did not know what he was doing and, therefore , to get out of the responsibility for paying back the $7m which he knew he should have paid but which he did not pay and which the Government in a belated, half-hearted, weak-kneed way is now attempting to get from him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other important point that has to be made in relation to all these matters is that, I suppose, the least innocent person in this whole exercise is the poor old Treasurer. If the Treasurer had taken one of about three or four actions back in 1978 or 1979 we would not be faced with this problem to the extent that we are now. It was the negligence on the part of the Treasurer in taking 2 1/2 years to act in relation to this scheme which caused the mushrooming of the scheme during 1979 and 1980. One has only to look at the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union to discover the way in which this scheme mushroomed. </PARA>
<PARA> What the honourable member for Boothby said was quite instructive in that regard. It is quite true that the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme did become quite fashionable and quite acceptable in accounting and legal circles. The reason for that quite simply was that as soon as it was known that some people had got away with it-one would expect that the Government knew that they had got away with it -and as soon as the Government failed to act in relation to those schemes, failed even to indicate that in the future it might act against them, failed even to move against those schemes under the provisons of the existing law, others wanted to do the same. Even if the existing law was not entirely adequate at least it would have been a nice idea to test it; at least that would have put a few people on notice about how risky the operations they were involved in might have been. But the Treasurer took none of those actions. So, of course, the schemes mushroomed. </PARA>
<PARA> The one point that I am prepared to accept is that these schemes did become blessed with some sense of respectability by the accounting profession and the legal profession as a result of the Government's failure to act. But that does not exonerate the people who participated. In any event, it certainly does not relieve them now of the obligation to pay the money which the Government failed to collect from them at the time by acting in any of those three ways which I have already indicated. I must say that a number of lawyers-I am delighted to say that I am not one-have got up tonight to preach to us the virtues of the rule of law in the sense that we will penalise innocent people. The Government is not going to put them in prison. The Opposition on this occasion is only helping the Government to defeat this, the most crazy of the propositions that have been put in relation to this proposal. It does not matter if they were infants. What differences does it make whether they were infants? If the infants got the benefit from the scheme, knowingly or unknowingly, why should they not pay it back?</PARA>

The amount assessed would have already been paid if the company was in the position to pay it. If the company is not in a position to pay it then the people who stood behind that company would be approached to pay. That is right.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) because he has referred, as have many of the other speakers tonight, to the crime being the receipt of a benefit. Of course, that is a moral position. Of course, the honourable member for Fremantle is able to separate the morality of gypping the Government of millions of dollars and gypping it of thousands! He can separate the morality of a person claiming that he did not know the distinction of something for which he gained a capital gain and a person sending a telegram to the Minister claiming that his wife was in London when, in fact, she was in Samoa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this very moment in Australia there is no tax on capital gain made after a 12 month-period. If Australian Labor Party members want to stand up at this moment and change their current published policy that there should not be a capital gains tax I invite them to do so. I know that a large number of them are in favour of a capital gains tax. But there is no capital gains tax. At this very moment there is no tax on a capital gain made by selling a property. There is, nevertheless, a law against stripping a company so that it is unable to pay its debts, whether those debts be to the individual or to the Government in terms of its tax revenue. There is a lawyer sitting on the Opposition benches. Can he tell me whether there is a law by which one pays tax on a capital gain made after 12 months?</PARA>
<PARA> I heard the proposition that the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) made to this Parliament. He knows that if he had made it to a judge he would have been laughed out of the court. He tried to put a proposition to this Parliament that does not represent the law as it stands today. The fact of life is that at this moment there is no tax liability to vendor-shareholders of any company; there is no tax liability for taking a capital gain. The people who broke the law were those who stripped the companies. They happen to be a very small percentage of the people who are considered in the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982 [No. 2]. We have suggested that it was wrong in 1973 to take a capital gain even if that capital gain appeared to be excessive. There are plenty of examples of that, day by day. But let us get back to the morality of certain taxes. We have had for many years in this country a tax on diesel fuel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I am trying to make-it is quite relevant-is that tonight we are discussing a brand new tax aimed at collecting tax relative to previous action. I wish to give an example of other taxes levied in that fashion. For many years certain sections of the community have paid a tax on diesel fuel. Many other consumers have not. Recently we changed that situation, as we are proposing to change the situation relative to taking the profit on a capital gain, which is basically what this tax is about. I am wondering, when we change that rule, whether members of the Opposition will suggest that all those people who did not pay their tax up to that point, who obviously got a benefit-they have used the word 'benefit' time and again without interruption-relative to those who paid, should now be told that they should pay a tax because they gained a benefit. That basically is the proposition put to us in opposition to this amendment-that there was a benefit gained. I had to advise a constituent today that certain items of manchester will attract a tax of 7 1/2 per cent on 1 January. Should we go back to our mothers and tell them that they should pay a tax because they received a benefit when they bought sheets 25 years ago? I put the point-some honourable members will argue against it-that we are creating a new tax and there can have been no benefit. We laid down certain criteria to calculate that tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have gone this far in creating a new tax and a method of calculating that tax, and we are entitled in this place to raise criticisms of that method of calculation. We say the method of calculation has a purpose. The purpose is to catch people who joined with other people and knowingly set about stripping a company and taking away its ability to pay tax. We on this side are saying that we will accept that point of view, even though it is retrospective, if they joined together. The purpose of this amendment is that if they did not join together they accepted a capital gains tax legitimately under the laws of Australia and there is no reason in the world why they should be clubbed with those who joined with other persons and chose to create a circumstance whereby that company that changed hands could not pay its tax. There is a vast difference. I do not care if they spent the money or what they did. I do not support some of the other points of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the law as it is today there is no tax. We are creating a new tax which is no different from a new sales tax or diesel tax. We have a method of calculating it and the method says that if a person joined with someone in dishonesty he should pay the tax. My colleague's amendment says that there should be the right to say: 'I did not join'. The Opposition always stops and says: 'Mr Horgan did not know'. Mr Horgan has said he did not know that when he sold his property it would go to someone who would do other things. Under this amendment it is up to him to prove that. That is the point. That is contrary to my belief of justice. I believe that it should be up to the Commissioner of Taxation, the police or whoever to prove that. However, we are going that far with this amendment. If honourable members say that there should be a benefit and they do not support a capital gains tax, then they must accept the fact that all other forms of new tax should be retrospective as far back as the year dot. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Since I have been in this Parliament I have heard some incredible things. Most of those incredible things have been said by honourable members who sit on the Government side. Tonight I heard the most incredible thing that I have heard at any time in my life. I heard it from the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom). He said that the reason why this money that belongs to the Australian Treasury, that belongs to the Australian nation and to the Australian people should not be given back is that the people who gained it may have spent it. How did they spend it? What have they done with it? They have put it in their pockets; they have put it into bank accounts; they have put it into share portfolios; they have put it into luxury homes on the Gold Coast; they have put it into a Rolls Royce and other luxury cars in their garages; and they have put it into their yachts. These are the people who got some financial advantage from the fact that tax which was due and payable to the Australian Treasury was not paid. So what they are attempting to do now is to build into this legislation what they choose to call an innocence clause. Innocence or not is not the issue. There has been no suggestion by the Opposition that there may be a small number of people who did not really know what was happening. The honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) referred to them as the naive people who believe that the Brian Mahers of Australia are Father Christmases who came along and hand out to them large sums of money in excess of the real value of the things that they are selling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us put it in blunt terms. Here is an example. We have a straw company that has made $100,000 taxable profits in one year. At the end of the 12 months, at the end of the financial year, the amount from that $100,000 that is owing to the Australian Taxation Office is $46,000. So the maximum which can be left with the people who own the company is $54,000. Then, along comes Brian Maher and says to these people: 'I will give you $90,000 for the company'. He is Father Christmas, and these people are innocent! These people who accept the $90,000 for the company on which they themselves could realise only $54,000, because $46 ,000 had to be paid to the Taxation Office, are the people who are innocent! These 11 friends, defenders and protectors of the tax dodgers, who identified themselves last night by sitting along these front benches, want to build into this legislation an innocence clause to make sure that these people who owe the money do not have to pay it back. One of the main reasons for that is because they have spent it and it will cause them some degree of hardship if they have to pay it back. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us imagine that one of these people has to sell his $100,000 unit on the Gold Coast. Just look at the bleeding hearts on the Government side. How dare Government supporters come into this chamber and speak such offensive nonsense not only to the members of the Parliament but also the Australian people. Let us get the $100,000 from the people who may have to sell their units on the Gold Coast and let us build four homes so that we can reduce the number of families on housing commission waiting lists in Australia from 40,000. Let us do something for those people. I say to Government members: Don't you dare talk about hardship being imposed on all these tax sharks, dodgers, thieves and crooks!</PARA>
<PARA> Of course honourable members know what their motivation is. About 6,200 companies have been sent to the bottom-of-the-harbour. Imagine the number of shareholders who will flood into the courts and say to the courts and to the Treasurer (Mr Howard): 'I did not know what was happening and I could not reasonably have been expected to know. I am innocent'. Where is the motivation for what some Government members choose to call an innocence clause? What they want to do is jam up the system to make sure that the cases will not even be heard and to make sure that all of the money that their tax dodging friends ripped off this nation will never be collected. We are not talking about pin money; we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. If such a clause were introduced into this legislation do honourable members think there would be any chance in the world that that money would be recovered? The skilled and dedicated officers of the Australian Taxation Office have recently spent long hours trying to devise legislation to catch up with these sharks. I think that the Treasurer would have preferred to support the legislation that they suggested originally. But all the Government back bench members, not only the 11 friends of the tax dodgers, put pressure on the Treasurer to knock over the legislation that the tax officers prepared in the first place to make sure that the friends of the Liberal Party would not have all of this money taken back from them. The Treasurer knows that the legislation that we are dealing with now is not and will not be as effective as the legislation that the tax officers- dedicated and capable men-initially proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not be surprised if more officers flooded out of the Taxation Office. Why should they stay in the Taxation Office applying their time, skills, energy and dedication to devising legislation to catch the sharks and then have that legislation knocked over by the Government? Why should there not be low morale within the Taxation Office? Why should there not be frustration on the part of these dedicated tax officers? They now know the guilty men, the men who have been responsible for detecting and defending tax sharks, tax dodgers and tax thieves. The legislation has been watered down. The 11 identified friends of the tax dodgers on the Government side want to water down the legislation even more.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) to include in the legislation a fairness or an innocence clause. I believe that the legislation casts its net too wide and that genuine innocent people who have sold shares will be caught by the legislation-people who did not have an illegal purpose or intent. The amendment proposed by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is about intent. It refers to a person who knew or believed, or could reasonably be expected to have known or believed, that circumstances applied. In my view those who did not intend fraudulently and illegally to evade a liability to pay tax should not be caught by the operation of the legislation. They are innocent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Several honourable members opposite have talked about a fair go. Let us take this concept of the fair go really seriously. When these several hundreds of millions of dollars were lost to the Australian taxpayers, it meant that there was less money to be spent on such things as social services, pensions and benefits for the poor. I remind honourable members opposite that in the period from 1975 to 1981-82 the number of poor people in this country increased from one million to 2.5 million. Is this their idea of a fair go for Australians? What do they mean when they talk about a fair go? They want a fair go when it is applied to one particular group-the wealthy, the top 10 per cent, who already own nearly 60 per cent of the wealth of this country. These people own more than the other 90 per cent put together. Why do they not think about the bottom 10 per cent who own only 0.27 per cent of the wealth of this country? What has happened to them? Those people have failed to get any benefit because of the rip-off activities of these other people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite are trying to tell us that a person who, before paying tax, sold a company to a tax promoter for much more than it was worth had no idea that that was a way of avoiding tax. That is absolute nonsense. In the overwhelming majority of cases such a person knew very well what he was doing unless he was extremely naive or somebody else did it on his behalf. If this amendment were passed, the whole of the retrospective tax legislation would be totally emasculated because virtually everyone would be able to claim that he did not know the purpose of such schemes. </PARA>

Who would be produced to give evidence in that situation? The tax promoter would be produced to give evidence in a court of law. He would be asked: 'Did you inform this poor chap that this company was to go to the bottom of the harbour?' Of course, the tax promoter will not be too keen to put in his mates and prejudice possible future business. Will he say: 'Of course, I informed him?' Of course he will not say that. He will say: 'I did not inform him. He did not know the nature of the scheme'. So the suggestion in this amendment about establishing whether a person knew or believed he was acting legally is absolute nonsense. It is a clear absurdity. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who would be the principal witnesses in such a situation are the very people who promoted the schemes in the first place. What kind of argument is that? That kind of argument has been put forward by the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall). I am amazed at his intelligence in relation to this matter. He tried to make an appeal on the principle of innocence. The fact is that this is a matter not of innocence or guilt but of tax being evaded illegally. The Australian public has suffered in a very serious way. The legislation does not propose criminal penalties. These people will not be thrown in gaol. Nothing will be done to them except that they will be required to pay the tax liability which they had in the first place. As the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) mentioned, in many cases the real value of the money they will have to pay back will have been substantially reduced. They will be required to pay only its face value. If they had put it in a bank, interest rates being what they are, they would have ripped off a handsome profit anyway. In my view, this legislation is a very lenient way with which to deal with people who knew that they were trying to evade tax in a very serious way. Let us come back to the principle of fairness. The fairness principle applies to the whole community and not to a small group. The fair go principle demands that this money be collected from those who benefited. It is on that principle that we totally reject this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because the gauntlet was thrown down by members of the Opposition, I want to clarify that I do not support the amendment put forward by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury). However, I emphasise that I certainly defend his right and the right of my other colleagues to support such an amendment. They believe there is a need to protect those people who they see as the innocents in this case. It is my frank opinion-this is a view expressed by the Treasurer (Mr Howard)-that it is not an issue of guilt or innocence. It is simply a question of whether tax recoupment should be required because profits were made over a period of years as a result of a specific type of scheme which was directed at avoiding the need to pay taxes on profits made on the sale of companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should emphasise one thing to those who have some difficulty in understanding this point. Let us take, for example, a situation in which a company is sold and the possessors of the shares of that company go to their accountants or to someone else for advice. In many cases the honest person would say: 'We wish to close down this company; we have no further use for it'. It is quite clear that in some cases their advisors tell them: 'Do not close down the company. It is possible to sell it. I will possibly be able to arrange for that sale but I do not know any details about the purpose to which the company will be put. I do not even necessarily know who will purchase the company and I would advise you not to ask any questions about it. Simply take the arrangement as I make it and take the profit with you'. That is the essence of the type of program which is found in this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The error lies in the fact that as a matter of normal practice in accountancy a statement of assets must be prepared between the purchaser and seller of assets in a company. Normally the statement of assets, if it is to be a legal transfer, must take into account the provision for taxes due on profits made by the company during the relevant financial period. What happened in this case-that is why we call it a form of tax avoidance-is that the statement of assets did not include provision for taxes to be paid, and that additional element was then passed back to the shareholders and shared among those who had the advantage of being able to benefit from the sale. The question, therefore, is not whether the persons involved are innocent or guilty in that they profited from the sale but simply whether they profited from the sale. Where it can be established that such a profit was made, the question of whether they are innocent in the sense of being juniors or whether they are necessarily the unknown beneficiaries-they may be the wives or the relations of persons who have shares in a company-as far as I can see is basically immaterial. The question is: Did they gain from the sale? If they did so gain, then it is perfectly legitimate of the Government to expect those people now to be prepared to meet the taxation requirement to the taxes not then paid although, indisputably in my opinion, due. I draw attention to the Budget Speech of the Treasurer in 1978 in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The time is long since past when Governments or the community should tolerate the blatant, artificial and contrived means whereby certain sections of the community seek to pay little or no tax to the detriment of the general body of taxpayers and the equity of the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>Surprisingly enough, perhaps, I think at least some members of the opposition would support that proposition. I emphasise for the benefit of honourable members who have spoken in this debate, especially the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), that the ladies and gentlemen of the Opposition are supporting the legislation of this Government. We are not joining the Opposition on this Bill; the Opposition is joining us. Let us make that point quite clear. It is not satisfactory for members of the Opposition to come into this chamber and attack my colleagues, who believe that they have the right, as they see it in accordance with their conscience, to express the views which they believe are important. They do not belong to the Australian Labor Party because they are not locked in to the outmoded nonsense that members of the Opposition go on with. They can argue in their Caucus, but somehow or other when they represent the people of Australia they have to come into this chamber like so many white mice and do exactly what they are told. While we have conscience in this chamber it will be demonstrated by members of the Liberal and National parties in this Government. It has never been demonstrated by the Opposition and I doubt that it ever will be. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us make the point quite clear. The Treasurer has emphasised in this chamber time after time, as have other Ministers of the Government, that it is the Government's intention to clarify once and for all that, in regard to the argument between retrospectivity on the one side and equity on the other, while we do not support the question of retrospectivity as a general rule, there are on occasions exceptions. The benefit of the nation must be given priority. Clearly, we are facing such a situation at this moment. I emphasise once again that we have heard tonight nothing but scurrilous innuendoes. So many speakers on the Opposition side have come into this chamber and suggested that my colleagues, because they are exercising their conscience--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that. I will do it very briefly. The point is that under the administrations since 1975 the number of identified participants in tax avoidance schemes has risen by some 2,600 per cent. We had two short periods of government-16 months and 19 months. We issued instructions in August 1975 for prosecutions to proceed, prosecutions that would have negated the need for this legislation and this debate. Honourable members opposite have to answer to the families out there who have been paying an extra $35 a week in income tax and an extra $8 in sales tax as to why they did not proceed with those instructions, as to why those prosecutions were canned in the bottom drawer. That is the case they have to answer. There is no defence for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to compare this whole question of pseudo-innocence that I detect coming from the brave 11 opposite. Let me compare their innocence, in the case they put , with the manner in which two innocents-my constituents-have been treated by this Government, by that same Treasurer and those who sit behind him. Case one concerns a breadwinner with three children and a dependent spouse. He was employed in one of the industries in the Newcastle region until he was injured at work and went on compensation. The family could not carry on under the compensation payments. The wife had to go to work for the latter part of the financial year. When the husband submitted his income tax return for that year he overlooked-as an ordinary wage-earner would do-deducting from his claim for spouse rebate the amount that his wife had earned to keep the family together in the last few months. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the result? He was summoned and dragged down to a court in Sydney. He was on compensation; his wife was working trying to keep the house together, trying to keep up the rent and other payments and keep the children at school. He could not afford a solicitor. His return was re-assessed and levied an additional $600 tax. He was fined a 100 per cent penalty of $600. He could not pay it. He was on compensation, and his wife was working to pay the house payments and to feed the family. But that was not enough for this Treasurer and this Taxation Office and for those who are concerned now about innocence, concerned for the cheats and the rogues. A bit later, on a Saturday morning, along came a police sergeant from the local police station with a warrant for the father's arrest because he had not paid the fine and he had not paid the tax . He had sought time to pay but that was refused. That is the kind of justice with which honourable members opposite administer this country. That is the double standards they apply to those who are struggling to survive. So do not let me hear any more cant about pseudo-innocence and protecting the rogues. </PARA>
<PARA> I move to the second case of innocence. I am talking about real people, not the people honourable members opposite say should not be identified but, whose names unfortunately for honourable members opposite, are published in public documents such as the McCabe-Lafranchi report. Are honourable members opposite saying that the public of Australia should not read the McCabe-Lafranchi report because they might see some names there and associate them with the Liberal Party? Are honourable members opposite saying the public should not read or mention those names. They know what they can do with that kind of view. </PARA>
<PARA> The second case concerns a widow whose husband passed away in February this year. When he passed away he owed the Taxation Office $611. Despite the fact that his estate had not proceeded through probate-the estate was being handled by the solicitors in a normal and proper fashion and subject to the usual kinds of delays-this Treasurer and his Australian Taxation Office badgered that woman with constant requests for payment of the $611 owed by her deceased husband. in the finish she could not stand that any more. It is only the little people who worry about threatening letters from government departments and the Taxation Office, not the rogues, the thieves and the millionaires trying to be protected by this amendment. It is only the little and honest people-who are the salt of this country-who worry. That lady could not stand it any longer so she went to the estate solicitor and gave him a bank cheque for a lousy $611. </PARA>
<PARA> That was a few days before the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union was tabled in this chamber. Again that was not enough for this Government and the Australian Taxation Office because the day after the Costigan report was tabled, the bailiff's representative arrived at her door to collect the $611 which really was the responsibility of the estate. I say to honourable members opposite: That is the kind of justice you have administered. That is the kind of innocence that is genuine. That is the innocence of the ordinary, honest, hardworking, struggling Australian family. But honourable members opposite are not concerned about them. In this amendment they are concerned about protecting the thieves and the rogues who have profited under their jurisdiction and administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I read in the Courier Mail just a fortnight ago-a week last Friday-a big headline splashed across the top of the page. It read 'Fraser tax legislation strangles Gold Coast development'. That is what this amendment is about. That is what these people are trying to protect-not the ordinary, honest, God-fearing citizens and families of this country. They are trying to protect the rogues. I conclude by quoting from a letter I received from a lady in Grovedale. I have a similar letter from another lady in Paradise Waters in Queensland. This lady said in the letter sent to me, which is a copy of the letter addressed to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), said:</PARA>
<PARA> You can be assured that if your Government proceeds with its intention of introducing retrospective legislation I will renounce my membership of the Liberal Party and use all my influence to induce as many other party members to do the same and campaign actively against the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope she has resigned. I hope she is campaigning against the Liberal Party. I hope at some stage that those who present this mock innocence and concern about Australians convert their innocence to the genuine innocence of the real, honest , hardworking families who have suffered under this administration. </PARA>

Without overplaying the analogy I must say it is certainly a bowlers' wicket. We are a long way behind on the score board and there is a hostile crowd. But, through you, Mr Deputy Chairman, I will play it with a straight bat and who knows, perhaps I may convince you. I turn to clause 5. I support the amendment of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) to seek to insert a fairness clause into this legislation. At the outset I say something to my friends opposite. There is abroad a political charge that my colleagues and I are friends of the tax dodgers. I will wear the political charge. I will face up to it in my own electorate and in the community at large. It may be that I will suffer a political sanction or penalty. But of one thing I am absolutely clear: I do not support this legislation because it is wrong in principle and it is wrong in practice. I am supporting the amendment only because it makes a bad Bill a little on the better side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation seeks to recoup outstanding, legally payable company tax fraudulently and illegally evaded by way of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The only thing wrong with that is that this recoupment of an outstanding existing liability is being retrospectively transferred and imposed on vendor shareholders who, at the time of the sale of their shares, had no such liability and who, in the sight of the existing law, in the selling of their shares were totally and completely within the terms of the law. Whether we like that or not or whether we have a different judgment by way of hindsight, that happens to be the fact. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation certainly gets around this awkward problem by doing three specific things. First, it creates an artificial tax year-from 1 July to the date of sale. Normally we have a tax year from 1 July to 30 June after which tax is assessed and then becomes due and payable. Through the definition of T, the company tax liability to be found in clause 5(1)(d) on page 11 of the Bill and the associated clause 5(9)(c) on page 17 of the Bill there is the arbitrary creation of an artificial tax year. That is the first thing done to get around this awkward problem about the vendor shareholders having no liability. Secondly , it removes the limited liability concept which has stood in business law for centuries. Thirdly, it makes vendor shareholders liable for the debts of others- the others being the purchasers and the strippers who carried out the fraudulent and illegal evasion of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an arbitrary and extremely discriminatory change to the existing law and to the way of things. The most reasoned, rational argument in support of this legislation is that it is only recouping the benefit received. There is no guilt and there is no innocence. It is ony recovering the benefit received, and all people have to do is to give back the money. There is no guilt or innocence. Some honourable members submitted that this is an extremely arbitrary and unfair situation in that the vendor shareholders at the time of the sale of their shares had no such liability and that we are imposing a liability on them retrospectively by creating an artificial tax year, by destroying the concept of limited liability and by making vendor shareholders liable for the debts of others. Those supporting the legislation go one step further in almost every case and they say: 'They must have known'. In that very quick phrase they introduce the concept of guilt. On that basis they believe that this legislation and the three arbitrary and discriminatory things it does are justified. The most unreasoned supporters of this legislation believe that all those associated with bottom-of-the-harbour schemes are guilty--</PARA>

We are starting off from the bottom-of-the-harbour and going up through the surface and further until we trace schemes right back to where we can recoup the outstanding moneys. Many people-completely innocent-right away from the cold face of fraud certainly received the benefit and did not know what was going on. The only point of this clause is to give those people an opportunity to say so and to prove that they did not know what happened to the company in which they were involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give two examples. Shareholder A and shareholder B were both approached by promoters. One promoter said to shareholder A: 'I am in a position to take your company off you; I can sell it to a public company that has a loss situation, and through a profit/loss arrangement I can deal with your company. There is nothing illegal or wrong in it'. The person then sold the company. Shareholder B was also approached by a promoter who said the same thing: 'I can buy your company and inject into it a profit/loss arrangement. It is supported by the law. It is supported by Queen's Counsels' opinions. The Government seems to accept decisions of the High Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of South Australia. It is completely above board'. The promoter who dealt with shareholder A did exactly what he said he would do, and shareholder A, under this legislation, has no liability. The promoter who dealt with shareholder B was a liar and a fraudulent evader, and he stripped the company and sent it to the bottom of the harbour. But the person who sold him that company was in the same position as the person who sold to the other promoter who did exactly what he said he would do. I cannot accept that that is fair. </PARA>
<PARA> I argued last night that existing law should have been used, and I still think it can and should be used now. It is likely that if existing law is used both for recoupment and criminal and civil charges there will be many guilty vendor shareholders. But they would have the opportunity to put their cases before their peers under our system of law and justice. They will duly find that they were in the wrong. By supporting this amendment we are seeking nothing more than that-to give all vendor shareholders, the guilty and the innocent alike, the opportunity to prove their cases. The onus of proof will be on them; the guilty will still be caught because they will have to prove that they were not guilty, and the innocent will perhaps have a better chance than they have at the moment. Honourable members must remember that there is always the threat of the late penalty which will work against people seeking to frustrate the legislation. I simply cannot abide by the argument that we must ignore the innocent because they will come rushing forward and block up this legislation. I cannot go along with that proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> We are debating this matter in the context of hindsight, and for political purposes we are stating that all people are guilty of fraud. Let me turn to no other source than the McCabe-Lafranchi report which, on the question of whether vendors had knowledge of the on-sale of the company by the dealer, at pages 12 and 13, states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence the vendor directors or shareholders or agents knew that the companies were on-sold by the dealer, that the remaining funds in the company were removed by the dealer, that the dealer made no attempt to treat the contingent taxation liability of the companies and that the dealer did not meet prior year tax provisions in respect of funds which had been handed over by the vendors. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the McCabe-Lafranchi report states about these people. We are asking that they be given the opportunity to put their cases and to prove their innocence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to say a couple of things in response to those who have contributed to the debate on this amendment. I do not accept for a moment the charge made by the Opposition that all those who supported this amendment are friends of the tax avoidance industry or of tax evaders. Although, for reasons which I will explain, I do not agree with the reasoning, the argument or the views advanced by my friends and colleagues, including the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Sainsbury) who moved the amendment, and a number of other colleagues who spoke during the debate, I totally accept their right to argue as they have done. I think it does nothing to the sense and dignity of debate in the Parliament for them to be broadly labelled as friends of tax avoiders simply because they have dared to put a different argument on an issue which undoubtedly has attracted a great deal of interest in this House. It is now almost 12 midnight on a Thursday night at the end of a session and the House is substantially full of members who are interested in the debate. Frankly, that is because there has been some good argument. I think it does the institution a great service if occasionally we have a few debates such as this. The only matter that tends to put honourable members off the rails occasionally is language that is either extravagant or a touch irrelevant. Before I answer the arguments that have been put forward I should like to refer to the Concise Oxford Dictionary and quote the meaning of the word 'innocent'. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines 'innocent' in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Free from moral wrong, sinless and unacquainted with evil. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course implies very strongly that the concept of innocence is related to matters concerning offences, penalties and criminality. The basis of the Government's argument, and the reason I find myself unable to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, is that this legislation relates to recouping unpaid tax. That tax is still legally payable; it is still outstanding. It cannot be recouped from the companies because the companies have been denuded of assets. By this legislation the Government is endeavouring to recoup it from those who have thus far enjoyed the financial benefit of its non-payment. Stripped of all the verbiage and all the emotive expressions, that is what the legislation is about. It is not about whether these people are guilty or innocent. That is why I have persistently reacted against the words 'crooks', 'rogues' and 'knaves' that have been used in this place to describe people who have been involved in these arrangements. Many and varied would have been the moral culpabilities or lack thereof of people who have been involved in these arrangements. It is simply a question of whether the legislation, according to its provisions, applies to their taxation liability. It is essentially on that basis and having listened to the debate throughout this evening and having previously discussed this matter at very great length with a large number of my colleagues the Government finds itself unable to accept this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> We can go on all night. We can come into this place, give some examples of people who have had arguments with the Australian Taxation Office and try to construe from them some kind of punitive, selective and unfair approach by this Government towards the administration of the tax law. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) rejoiced in the fact that in August 1975 instructions were given for a prosecution. I have news for the honourable member for Shortland. From the way in which the system operated I bet that the Treasurer of the day, that is the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden), did not even know those instructions had been given. Those prosecutions are handled at a departmental level. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with one other issue that was raised seriously by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Groom); that is the economic consequences of applying this legislation to people who have made no provision for the tax. The Government is doing two things. It is providing for recoupment of the tax but it is also providing people who will be caught by this legislation with the opportunity to pay over a period of 12 months. That is the subject of debate later on. I make it clear that I make no apology for this legislation. I say to my friend the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Robert Brown) that the Bill that is now before the Parliament I support in every particular. I assure him that the only amendments to this Bill that I recommended to the Cabinet were amendments that I was satisfied, after a lengthy discussion with many people in my party and in the National Party who were interested in this legislation, would improve the Bill. I stand by all those amendments. I will defend them anywhere honourable members would like and very effectively. Of course, some of these people will have to dispose of assets in order to meet these liabilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the disposal of some of those assets will involve people being sacked. Does the honourable member say 'good' to that? Of course he does not. Therefore, the suggestion that some time should not be allowed is an absolute nonsense. It is not only under this legislation that that type of situation can happen. In a practical sense-this has something to do with the general argument about retrospectivity; I know, Mr Giles, that you will bring me back to the point if I get too far away from it-one of the arguments used is that there is a practical disturbance which has very significant economic consequences. It is not only legislation of this kind that can have that effect. Court decisions can sometimes have that effect. They can have a retrospective effect. A very well-known case in this country involved the so-called Gorton scheme. The Gorton scheme was an arrangement sanctioned by the High Court of Australia in 1964 in Abel's case. It provided for the avoidance of the payment of death duties. That particular arrangement went on for a period of eight or nine years. The High Court in a subsequent case in 1973 decided it could be done in a different way and issued a whole lot of gift duty assessments going back to the time of the original scheme. That, in practical terms, had precisely the same effect on people who had entered into those arrangements as this legislation will have on people who have entered into the arrangements it covers . With respect, I do not agree therefore with some of the things that have been said tonight about the consequences and the horrendous nature of this legislation, which I stress again is about liability for tax and is not about judgments of guilt or innocence or about whether people have been liable for any kind of criminality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In concluding my remarks, let me say again that the Government has listened very carefully to what those of our number who have supported the amendment of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro have said. We find ourselves unable to accept that amendment for the reason that I have outlined. We reject utterly the collective branding of those of my colleagues as supporters of the tax avoidance industry simply because they have exercised their right to argue the point. They have argued it very well in this chamber tonight. But I have to say to them in all candour that I find their arguments unconvincing. The Government cannot accept them. We believe that, given the nature of this legislation, the Bill in this respect should stand and should be supported by the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>In moving the amendments that have been circulated in my name I would like, if the Committee would so permit, also to speak to some other amendments. The various changes are ones that the Government has thought fit to propose in the light of views put to it and raised by speakers in the debate yesterday, particularly by members of the Government parties. These amendments essentially arise out of representations to me by the Government members' taxation committee . In each case, the amendments do not change the Bill in fundamental respects, but seek further to ensure that in achieving their essential purpose the recoupment measures do not operate in unfair or inappropriate ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The first group of amendments-amendments 1 and 2-is one that concerns the general extent to which the promoters class is to be liable to recoup the evaded company tax that is the subject of this legislation. Under the Bill, this class is generally to have a liability for 20 per cent of the evaded tax-that amount representing, on average, the share of evaded tax that promoters took in fees. It has been put to us that this could operate inappropriately where, in a particular case, the fee charged was at a substantially lower level. This could, for example, happen where the amount of profit stripped from a particular company was large, and the fee was, as a percentage of profits, somewhat lower. To meet this situation the amendments to clause 7 will place a ceiling on the total recoupment tax laibility that attaches to the promoters class for a particular scheme. That ceiling will be the amount of the gross fee charged by the promoter; that is, in the simple case the difference between the net worth of the company at the time of sale-now unpaid tax liabilities aside-and the consideration for the purchase of the shares. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the point that this ceiling is expressed in terms of total recoupment tax liability, such as in a case where there were a number of unpaid company assessments for the target company, perhaps involving more than one year of income. Of necessity, given that there was typically no dissection of fee between such different company tax liabilities of a company or, in a case where accumulated profits were also involved, between the amount charged for pre-tax and accumulated profits, the fee limitation expressed in the amendment is in terms of the total fee regardless of how it was calculated or on which profits it might have been based. </PARA>
<PARA> The next matter I would like to speak about is a related one and is the subject of amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Additional Tax) Bill 1982. As I have just explained, there is to be a promoters' recoupment tax ceiling based on the gross fee charged on the acquisition of the target company. Such a fee would generally have the character of income in the hands of the promoter concerned, and it can be said that collection of both income tax and the recoupment tax would amount to a double imposition. The Government sees the strength of that argument. The board notion behind imposition of the recoupment tax on promoters is that the promoters should never have benefited by the evasion of company tax, and that the recoupment tax will return from them the fees that represent their share of the evaded tax. To put it another way, the promoters fee that was received will, by reason of the promoters recoupment tax, be required to be paid back. </PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, the Government believes it to be appropriate that the income tax law should be made to apply to promoters' own liability to income tax as though they had never received the amounts that they in fact pay back as recoupment tax. Accordingly, the Government proposes by the amendments to the further Bill to treat as an income tax deduction for a person the amount that he or she pays as promoters recoupment tax, or as a contribution towards the promoters recoupment tax that another member of the particular promoters class has paid. This deduction will be allowable for the year in which the shares in the target company were purchased, but will not be allowed to give rise to a carry-forward loss. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to amendment 3 to the main Bill, which also relates to the promoters recoupment tax. As the Bill is now framed, the persons in an eligible promoters class have a joint and several liability for the promoters recoupment tax, and a person in the class who is obliged by the Commissioner of Taxation to pay may recover, by action in the courts, an appropriate contribution from other members of the class. While that basic position is not to be disturbed, we have been persuaded that a person who, under the joint and several concept, is sued by the Commissioner ought not to be requested first to pay the tax before he or she seeks contribution from the others. This could be particularly so where the appropriate share of the person sued is a relatively small part of the total Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the amendment will introduce into the Bill a provision under which a person in the promoters class who is sued by the commissioner for the unpaid promoters recoupment tax may act to have other members of the class joined as co -defendants in the recovery suit. Where that option is expected the court will, having regard to levels of participation and benefit enjoyed or to be enjoyed, have power to determine how much of the unpaid amount it is just and equitable that the person sued, and each of the persons joined, should be liable to pay as recoupment tax. I do not think I have leave to deal with the final group of amendments, that is amendments 4 and 5. They relate to major clauses. I will resume my remarks on those amendments later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendments. However, some difficulties still remain. The House should consider a person who was an agent, a financier, an adviser, who was in one way and another between the vendor- shareholder and the person who ultimately did something illegal with the company . Some of those people were in a position of ignorance as to what happened to the company later on. In fact, they are able to evidence that they were ignorant , having gone to some trouble to see that the companies were dealt with legally. Certainly the proposals that have just been introduced ensure that they have a defence. The beneficiaries under trust estates or the purchasers-the people who give financial assistance-can join others with them to have the liability apportioned. That is a very big step towards equity. The difficulty is that they have to take before a court a matter that would normally be a matter of assessment by the Commissioner of Taxation. Normally one would expect the Commissioner of Taxation to decide who owed what.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the difficulty has been that the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax ) Assessment Bill [No. 2] has been drawn around joint and several-the idea of a joint liability. Joint liabilities are difficult matters. A law that imposes a joint liability on a person where the liability is not incurred voluntarily is difficult. Joint liabilities in anyone's life are awkward and people who incur joint liabilities normally take a lot of care to do so with their eyes open. While there is a defence, that defence might take some time, it will be expensive, and some of the people who are involved will be difficult to find. I urge the Government to consider introducing further amendments-I appreciate this will involve serious redrafting-to overcome that joint liability problem in a more complete manner than it is doing with this amendment. It should introduce those amendments when this Bill is before the Senate. This will involve some substantial redrafting, but it will not involve any change in principle. It will just place those people, who are not guilty of any offence but find themselves faced with a situation that will still be hard to control, in a better position. I think that is reasonable and equit- able, and I ask the Government to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one further point that is more substantial in terms of principle but I suspect easier in terms of drafting; that is, that a person who acted, had a business introducing people and financing them, under the terms of this legislation is actually meeting not a 46c in the dollar tax rate but a 100c in the dollar tax rate. All the moneys that he received by way of fee he is being asked to hand over to the Australian Taxation Office. Further, he is in no way able to debit his expenses-the cost of running his office and so on-against those fees that he has received. So, this is more than a tax; it is the expropriation of the money that he has received. Two questions arise. I am advised that collection is doubtful on constitutional grounds-I will not comment further than that because I am not qualified to do so. But more than that, one has to ask the question whether it is reasonable that this person, who is in many ways in the same position as the vendor shareholders were, who received a benefit but was not a party to a stripping arrangement-not willingly anyway- should receive this very high rate of expropriation whereas the vendor shareholders will receive an account for tax payable at 46c in the dollar. This goes beyond recoupment. When the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill [ No. 2] comes before the Senate I ask the Government to consider moving a Government amendment to overcome what I see as an inequity in that area also. I appreciate that any amendment that is moved in the Senate without the Government 's support is unlikely to succeed. All my effort will be devoted to encouraging the Government to consider those matters. </PARA>

I have fortunately had the opportunity to point out that the Treasurer was wrong when he said that I referred to the Income Tax Assessment Act. I was not referring to that Act at all.

They understood what they were doing in the same way as the shareholders understood what they were doing when they got a higher value for their shares than they were worth on the market. This Government has been irre- sponsible in not pursuing prosecutions against these sorts of people. I think it is appalling that the Government should come here and submit a long string of amendments and not give the Opposition time to read them and time to comment on them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that we are now debating clauses 6 to 20 as well as the Government's amendments. That being so, there are a number of comments that I wish to make on those clauses. First of all, I refer to clause 6(8). This provision relates to trusts. It appears in that clause which deals with secondary liability. This is briefly explained on page 49 of the explanatory memorandum. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under sub-clause (8) a beneficiary of a trust estate to whom corpus of the trust is in fact paid or applied for his or her benefit after the time of sale of shares in a target company will, for the purpose of tracing the trust's liability to pay recoupment tax . . . be treated as having had a right to a distribution of corpus from that trust. </PARA>
<PARA>I appreciate that there are cases where the application of that provision will be perfectly fair. But it seems to me as well that there will be cases where the application of that provision may be manifestly unfair. Let me illustrate this by reference to a hypothetical example of an infant who is a beneficiary under a discretionary trust. I use this example because it is common for those who carry on businesses to have trusts for the purposes of holding assets and to nominate under the trusts-these are almost invariably discretionary trusts-various persons who can receive benefits. Included among those persons who can receive benefits one will almost invariably find members of the family of the persons who control the trust and who really control the profit-making enterprise which is the source of the tax liability which is sold and which gives rise to the liability to vendors' recoupment tax. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a hypothetical example, of course as it must be, but let us assume that there is a sale which is caught and that there has been a distribution of $100, 000 to infant children. This, of course, will frequently be a notional distribution only in the sense that the guardian of the children who will be the person who controls the sale of the company and the sale of the trust-once again , almost invariably, the parent-will apply the $100,000 in a number of ways; let us assume in investment. If the investment is lost all that the child has is a debt which is worthless. Yet it appears on the application of clause 6 by reason of sub-clause (8) that the infant will be liable to tax. It has no assets and yet it would have a large liability to recoupment tax. Nor would it appear, on a quick reading of the amendment that has been moved, to clause 10 that the infant would be able to apply successfully under clause 10 for the very good reason that notionally-that is to say, in the eye of the law-the infant has received a distribution. I find it very difficult to see how any child could be made liable in those kinds of circumstances-that is to say, in events which the infant was not able to control and in respect of transactions from which, in fact, the infant received no benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I now move to clause 7. I said in the second reading debate that I hoped the Government would redress some problems. Whilst I have supported the general proposition that promoters, properly defined, should pay their fair share, I find it very difficult to see why promoters, as defined here, can be said to be properly described or properly assessed. The eligible promoters class is to be found in clause 7 (4). A wide number of people are included in that sub-clause who would not on any normal use of the English language be called promoters. Let us take a few of them-purchasers, agents of purchasers, including persons who had power of attorney, brokers who have acted in the transaction, and all shareholders or directors of a purchaser where the purchaser is a company irrespective of whether or not the shareholder is a nominee shareholder only and irrespective of whether or not the director in question acted in respect of the transaction which attracts the tax liability. For example, the director could be overseas. Regardless of the benefit actually received, on the face of things each is caught. </PARA>
<PARA> One could have as an example 10 transactions. Let us assume that the figure arrived at under the new formula is a benefit of $100,000 a transaction, which gives a total $1m. Let us assume further that someone acting under a power of attorney in each of those transactions and hence caught received a fee of $1,000 . Let us assume further that that person had not the least idea that what was involved was tax evasion of any kind at all and thought that he was acting properly and simply for the purposes of giving effect to certain perfectly legal arrangements. It would seem, therefore, that that person is, on the face of things, liable in this class liability to an amount of $1m. True it is that he is now able to apply to the court under the amendment which has been put forward by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) for an apportionment amongst others, and true it is that if he succeeds in that application he will have his liability reduced to what is just and equitable, which one assumes will be $1,000, but the cost of that exercise will be very great indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that there is a fundamental deficiency in the way in which the question of promoters liability is approached. First of all, one has this class liability and individuals, trusts and companies being caught on a joint and several basis. It seems to me to be quite wrong that anyone should be jointly liable for benefits which other persons have received, irrespective of rights to apply to the court for relief. In the first place, it must be fundamental that it is the duty of the Commissioner of Taxation to issue an assessment which in fact reflects the benefit received. The onus should not be on the taxpayer to exculpate himself at great expense-expense which, to a very large extent, he will not be able to recover because, even if successful on taxation of costs, he would probably get about two-thirds of what it cost him to run the action. If other members of the class are bankrupt, he has nobody from whom he can get his costs. I must confess that that strikes me as fundamentally unjust becuase we are not talking about promoters as a sub-species of slightly inhuman people; we are talking about a whole variety of individuals who are caught by these dragnet provisions. Hence I find the legislation, as presently framed, exceedingly difficult to support because the liability of individuals who are caught within the eligible promoters class is not defined by reference to the benefit received . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak very briefly in response to the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde) and the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). I say to the honourable member for Moore that I will examine what he has put. I am not in a position to give, and I do not purport to give, any undertakings about further amendments. As he will know, we have already inserted a number of changes in the Bill. I remind him of the original provision in the Bill which provides for any member of a promoters class to seek a declaration from the Federal Court that it is just and equitable for him to be excluded from the class. That is relevant to a number of the matters raised by the honourable member. I also draw his attention to the amendments moved tonight .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have to say to him, and also to the honourable member for North Sydney, that the joint and several liability concept is very difficult but the whole concept of making promoters liable under this Bill is also very difficult. It is one of those situations in which the politics and the equity of it are great but the legal drafting is extremely difficult. I have to say, in the interests of proper administration of this legislation, that one has to pay some regard to those practical considerations. It is just infeasible in most cases for the Australian Taxation Office to be sufficiently apprised, at the commencement of an assessment exercise, of the calculations that the honourable member for Moore, and the honourable member for North Sydney, by implication, ask to be done. That is entitled to draw the response-which it has had from both honourable members- that that is all very unfair and that we are dealing with putting liabilities on people. I will give consideration over the coming week to what both honourable gentlemen have said but they will know the situation well enough, and they know me well enough, not to construe that as a firm undertaking. As an ideal it would be much better if what both of them have suggested could be done. Through the original just and equitable provision, and again tonight through the amendments, the Government has endeavoured to strike some kind of rough compromise between the needs of administration and not be unfair to people who might be caught in the manner outlined by both of my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> One other comment-one other comment only-I make in respect of the speech of the honourable member for North Sydney: My understanding of the way the provisions of the Bill operate is that, in the trust case he cited involving the application of the benefit to the parents' business, there would be a new trust as a result of the investment of that money in the business. The Commissioner of Taxation in those circumstances would seek recovery from the parents and not from the children. The honourable gentleman has raised an important matter which is not just a technical one. The hour is late-for which he is not responsible- but certainly I will also give that very careful consideration. My initial advice is to the effect that I have explained. I will probe the matter further and if there is any further action that ought to be taken in that regard I will consider taking it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a category of shareholder which could be unintentionally disadvantaged by the application of clause 6. It concerns shareholders in public companies which were also holding companies and which sold subsidiaries that were eventually disposed of fraudulently. Anyone who has ever invested in a public company, by purchasing shares through a stockbroker, will readily understand that he or she is not consulted by company directors before those directors take ordinary commercial decisions of benefit to the company and its shareholders. Advice from the Australian Taxation Office suggests that there may be as many as 63 public companies involved. Even if some of those public companies turn out to be not listed on an Australian stock exchange I think my comments will remain relevant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill does not expressly deal with the situation of public companies which became vendor companies; nor does it regard shareholders in public companies as being different from shareholders in private companies. Given the way in which the legislation is drafted, the Commissioner of Taxation has an option to require those shareholders in public companies to pay taxes resulting from a transaction about which they could not, in the ordinary course of events, have possibly known. I do not want to go over that argument; it has been done to death. But it is necessary to mention it in the context of a point or two that I want to make later. </PARA>
<PARA> In the explanatory memorandum reference is made to three triggers for tracing those to be assessed from the primary level to the next level and, if necessary, successively to further levels. The memorandum also indicates that the company or trustee to which liability will be allocated or traced will depend on whether any one of the public companies concerned 'now has different shareholders or beneficiaries as a consequence of sales of shares or beneficial interests'. That is provided for in clause 6 (2) However, the provisions of the Bill do not seem to apply as automatically as that provision would indicate. It is elsewhere stated in clause 6 (2) that, as a condition for the operation of these provisions, 'some or all of the shares in the relevant company were sold'. On top of that is superimposed a condition which stipulates that the operation of clause 6 provisions in certain circumstances is dependent on an opinion to be formed by the Commissioner. In other words, depending on the whim or judgment of the Commissioner some shareholders who may have derived no benefit from the sale of companies disposed of fraudulently may assume a liability for the new tax. That is the nub of the problem as I see it. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the Bill is suitably amended liability for the new tax may very well be imposed on shareholders who purchased shares in the public holding company after the so-called offending or relevant sales of subsidiaries took place. By that I mean that unless the Bill is suitably amended, the Commissioner may very well be placed in a no-win situation. If he forms an opinion that the company should be assessed he runs the risk of imposing a penalty on shareholders who were not shareholders at the time of the relevant transaction or transactions and therefore shareholders who have enjoyed no benefits. Furthermore, where the Commissioner decides that a holding company must pay, individual shareholders at the time of the relevant transactions whose benefit would not attract a tax liability in excess of $100 and would otherwise be exempt from the new tax would in fact be indirectly taxed at company level, as would the estates of deceased persons which also would have been otherwise exempt. In this last respect-the Commonwealth could be gathering from companies taxes which it has expressly stated would not be collectable from individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> Where shareholders have purchased shares in public or even private companies since the relevant qualifying transactions took place and where the Commissioner decides the company is to be assessed and not individual shareholders, there will be further penalty of a commercial nature in that the value of the shareholders' investment is to be diminished. The creation of a new and unexpected tax liability payable by companies in these circumstances will naturally decrease the value of that company's shares. Furthermore the value of shareholders' investments will also be reduced by the need for the companies so assessed to finance that debt to Commonwealth revenues by borrowing, rationalising its operations, liquidating its assets or other means as may be necessary to pay the new tax. </PARA>
<PARA> People who have purchased and still hold shares in holding companies after previous shareholders derived benefit from tax minimisation schemes now being legislated against may be called upon to pay, directly or indirectly, taxes arising out of the benefits enjoyed by other earlier shareholders. On top of that they will be penalised by what could be a significant drop in the value of shares they still hold even though they did not derive any earlier benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> To overcome inequities which will inevitably accrue if the Commissioner decides , at his sole discretion, that a company shall be assessable rather than individual shareholders whose holdings were in place at the time the relevant transactions were concluded it should be mandatory that the company should first request the Commissioner to give effect to the other provisions of clause 6 (2). It is a choice of two courses and the company should nominate. If by suitable amendment a company becomes responsible for nominating one of only two courses of action not only will the Commissioner be relieved from making a no-win decision but also the company will then be required to discharge its duties as set out in section 229 (2) of the new company code, which provides:</PARA>
<PARA> An officer of corporation shall at all times exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence in the exercise of his powers and the discharge of his duties . </PARA>
<PARA>Given that obligation on a company and its directors, they will then have the duty of deciding whether that company should be assessed as a legal entity or whether it would be more equitable for the relevant shareholders to be assessed individually. Subject to any advice that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) may receive on the subject, there need be no difficulty in that. It would overcome the possibility of people who derive no benefit at all becoming liable for the new tax. I urge the Government to consider an appropriate amendment to remove the discretion in this area from the Commissioner of Taxation and to require the company or companies concerned to make that decision or nomination. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition view on this clause is that it should be deleted from the Bill. It provides that persons liable for tax under this Bill will be able to pay the tax owing over a period of 12 months or such longer period than 12 months as the Commissioner of Taxation allows, provided they do not object to the assessment and they make a down payment of about 25 per cent. This provision was not in the original Bill which came before the House a month before these revised Bills were brought in. The original Bill provided 30 days for such people to pay after they received their assessments and, if they had not paid within 30 days, penalty tax was to apply at the rate of 20 per cent per annum, which was a substantial incentive to pay quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition opposes this provision to pay in instalments over a 12 month or longer period because we simply do not accept the argument that the new provision is required to ensure that hardship is not created by the need to pay recoupment tax. Clause 21 is a blanket provision. A taxpayer does not have to show hardship to get a year or more in which to pay; so people who have had the use of these stolen funds, to use the term the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser ), interest free for several years are to be given a further year in which to repay them. What an incredible situation that is; they do not have to prove any hardship to get that repayment period of 12 months or more. That situation should be compared with the position of an ordinary, honest, pay-as-you-earn taxpayer who has paid his taxes all year but who has a small amount of tax to pay at the end of the year because not enough was taken out of his pay. He is given 30 days in which to pay after he receives his assessment. If he does not pay in that time he is liable for penalty tax. He or she does not get a year in which to pay, but 30 days. They can get a month's extension if they can prove genuine hardship. If they want an extension of longer than a month, they have to provide the Australian Taxation Office with a full statement of assets and liabilities so that there is no doubt about the capacity to pay or about there being genuine hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the situation that applies to the great majority of taxpayers in this country, but by this Bill people who have stolen funds from public revenue, who are tax evaders and who have had the use of that money for several years, will have another year in which to pay. Why do we discriminate in favour of tax evaders? That is what this Bill is doing. It is introducing discrimination in favour of tax evaders who have already had the use of the money for several years. It seems incredible to us that the Government says that thieves should be given more lenient treatment than honest taxpayers. If this instalment provision is eliminated, as we want to do by opposing this clause of the Bill, tax dodgers would be treated in the same way as honest taxpayers. If there was genuine hardship so that they could not pay in 30 days, the Commissioner could extend the period to pay without any penalty tax applying. </PARA>
<PARA> We appreciate that there may be situations in which there is no capacity to pay the money and in which genuine hardship arises. In that situation the same provisions that apply to honest taxpayers should apply to them. We do not need this blanket instalment provision in clause 21 to provide for the genuine hardship situation. That is the reality in this Bill. Clause 13 of the Bill provides that the situation that applies to normal taxpayers will apply in the situation of recoupment tax liability. We simply do not need this instalment tax provision to cover the situation of genuine hardship. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that the Government has budgeted on obtaining $255m of revenue this year from recoupment tax. There is clearly no possibility of achieving anything like that amount of money if this clause is in the legislation as finally passed by this Parliament. This instalment scheme will ensure that much less will be obtained this financial year than would have been obtained under the original Bill. The original Bill gave 30 days to pay on which the Government made its Budget assessment of $255m being collected this year in recoupment tax. Now we are going to give these people a year in which to pay. We will simply not be able to get anything like that amount of money back into the revenue this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Howard) said that he supported the Bill in every particular. I can understand that he supports this weakening of the Bill along with other weakening provisions of the Bill which have been debated here tonight. Given his record in this area, one would expect him to go along with the various weakening provisions. It took him 2 1/2 years from the time that he first knew about this bottom-of-the-harbour scheme to get around to doing anything about knocking it off. It took him another 1 1/2 years before he sought to get any of the money back. With that record of laxity, it is not surprising that he supports the various provisions which have been brought into this revised legislation and which weaken the original legislation substantially. Of course, that original legislation was weak in that it did not seek to get back a lot of the money that was ripped off under this tax avoidance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that yesterday the Treasurer tabled the annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation. That annual report gives the lie to what the Treasurer said in this chamber as recently as last night about his having knocked off the tax avoidance industry-that because of his diligence there is no tax avoidance problem in this country. That is simply not the situation. The Commissioner of Taxation's annual report, tabled less than 24 hours ago, shows that the number of unidentified tax avoiders has risen by 65 per cent over the last two years while revenue losses have doubled. The number of participants in tax avoidance schemes identified in the year ended 30 June was 28,366 and the revenue losses amounted to $1,458m. This compares with 22,366 participants and $973m lost in revenue identified in the previous year, increases of 27 per cent in the number of participants and 50 per cent in the amount of money involved. They are the figures for the last year. The number of identified tax avoiders is now 33 times higher than it was in the last year of the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the kind of record that this Government has in respect of tax avoidance . It is a deplorable record, a record which has allowed a massive tax avoidance explosion to occur in this country. It finally ended up with a scheme which was the greatest rip-off of all and which the Government took two and a half years to do anything about. It took another one and a half years to do anything about getting back the money, and when it finally brought legislation before the House of Representatives it weakened that legislation considerably. We are now debating the one final provision of this Bill which ensures that instead of discriminating against people who are tax avoiders and law breakers, this Government is discriminating in their favour by providing for them much more favourable treatment than honest taxpayers received. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Treasurer) (1.11 a.m.)-The Government supports this clause for a very simple reason. Given all the circumstances and given the fact that provision would not otherwise have been made, I do not believe and the Government does not believe that it is unreasonable to make this provision. I was interested that the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) said that it might well provide an incentive for earlier payment. I do not know. It may well have that effect. The arguments for and against this proposition have been fairly heavily traversed over the last few days. I will not join issue in detail with the honourable member's comments interpreting the annual report of the Commissioner of Taxation. I have a suspicion that everybody wants to go home. I think the honourable member's remarks are wrong but I think we can get a unity ticket--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (5) Clause 21, page 59, lines 1 to 10 (inclusive), omit paragraph (1)(h). </PARA>
<PARA>The amendments are of an essentially technical kind. They are designed to carry fully into effect the policy of this clause, that is, the clause under which former owners may make arrangements to pay without dispute over a period of 12 months or so. I believe that the amendments proposed give effect to that. In framing this clause, one of the basic objects was to ensure that such desirable payments by former owners did not release promoters from their share of the recoupment tax liability. As a technical part of the measures to achieve that aim, there is a provision under which the Commissioner of Taxation is not to assess the promoters' recoupment tax before all payments by former owners under the arrangement have been made. To remedy any unintended effect of delaying the receipt from the eligible promoters class of an amount that, when received, would operate to reduce the former owners' liability, the provision calling for the promoters' assessment to be deferred is proposed to be omitted and additional provisions are proposed to be inserted in paragraph (f) of sub-clause (21)(1) to achieve the basic object I have spoken about. </PARA>

<PARA>When speaking to the Government's amendments to the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax ) Assessment Bill [No. 2], I indicated the main purpose of the amendments proposed to the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Additional Tax) Bill. In short, the amendments will avoid double liability by authorising an income tax deduction for payments of promoters' recoupment tax that the taxpayer concerned has made. The more technical aspects of the amendments will mean that this deduction cannot give rise to carry forward losses. Again, a person who claims entitlement to the deduction but whose income tax assessment for the year was made some time ago will be able to have the assessment amended and to exercise the usual rights of objection and appeal should the Commissioner of Taxation decline the grant of deduction. I commend the amendments to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) has provided the following information which is relevant to items (1) to (4) of the honourable member's question:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Mr J. R. Nosworthy and Mr J. A. Uhrig are part time members of the NCSC. Mr Nosworthy is a director of a number of companies, including McDonnell and East Ltd and its subsidiaries. Mr Uhrig is also a director of a number of companies, including Simpson Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries. These appointments have been properly declared, in accordance with section 19 of the NCSC Act 1979, and neither member has participated in the Commission's deliberations concerning the affairs of the companies in which he is a director.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no statutory requirement that full time members of the NCSC should resign their company directorships or liquidate their holdings of company shares . Nevertheless, Mr L. Masel, Chairman of the NCSC and Mr J. A. Coleman, Deputy Chairman, resigned all company directorships on taking up their appointments to the NCSC. The other full time member, Mr A. B. Greenwood, did not have any company directorships. None of the 3 full time members holds any company shares.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the requirement of section 19 of the National Companies and Securities Commission Act for a member of the NCSC to disclose on a public register any directorships or other pecuniary interests, the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities has:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Directed the members of the NCSC to disclose to the Commission by declaration any direct or indirect known interest that may be seen to influence their consideration of any matter, when the member is first aware that the interest relates to a matter that is to be considered, and that this declaration need not be recorded on any publicly accessible register;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) directed the Commission to give written notice of any direct or indirect known interest to the ministerial council, such details to remain confidential to the ministerial council;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) informed the Commission that, subject to the approval of the Commission, members may continue to participate in the consideration of any matter in which they have declared a direct or indirect known interest.</PARA>
<PARA> The members and the Commission have complied with the above directions. The action taken by the Ministerial council is consistent with the recommendations of the report of the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CG4">Mr Fife</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I take the honourable member's question to refer to the Government's decision of 30 April 1981 that 30 CAEs for which teacher education is the main activity should be consolidated by their incorporation into multi-purpose or multi-campus colleges with a single governing body or by integration with neighbouring universities. A total of 26 of these 30 CAEs have successfully achieved consolidation.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that some amalgamation proposals have been opposed by some members of the community and academic staff. However, most of the amalgamations have received the support of State Governments, members of the community and members of staff.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is not clear to which specific amalgamation proposal this question refers. Amalgamation itself is not likely to result in significant loss of employment. Not only do the larger institutions created as a result of amalgamation have more flexibility than small institutions in managing staffing difficulties, but also a number of the legislative arrangements made for amalgamation ensure the continued employment of staff at conditions which are no less favourable than their present conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government's policy is based on advice from the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission which considered that amalgamated institutions would have greater flexibility in the management of resources, especially in the situation of change or decline in workload; would be able to offer students a greater range and improved quality of educational choices; and would result in longer term economies of scale.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The question of added social welfare costs as a result of amalgamation does not arise. Some redundancies may occur in tertiary education institutions as a result of declining enrolments in teacher education programs but amalgamation will create larger institutions which have more staffing flexibility and are able to provide a wider range of opportunities to staff. The likelihood of redundancies occurring is therefore reduced as a result of amalgamation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No Harpoon missiles are being purchased specifically for the RAN submarines . Missiles have been purchased for a common RAN/RAAF pool for use by all platforms capable of firing the Harpoon. These missiles were ordered through the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) arrangements in 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> On 23 August 1979 my predecessor announced that RAN submarines would be provided with the facility to launch Harpoon missiles while submerged. On 19 February 1980 the Prime Minister included comment that the Oberon submarines would be fitted with Harpoon in a major statement on defence.</PARA>
<PARA> In June 1981 the necessary encapsulation kits where ordered from the US Government, again through FMS arrangements. The timing was arranged to coincide with a major US order.</PARA>
<PARA> The information requested on costs cannot be made available because of the security classification that details of numbers, deduced from overall costs, attract.</PARA>
<PARA> The modification of the RAN Oberon submarines for launching of Harpoon missiles will take place over a period of several years. However, the encapulated Harpoon operational capability will be finally proven by test firings scheduled for 1985 .</PARA>
<PARA> An offset agreement with McDonnell Douglas was signed in 1979 which requires the company to place offset work to 25 per cent the value of the contracts placed on the company between October 1979 and December 1990 for Harpoon missiles or associated equipment for Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (2) and (3) The mother of Anatoly Shcharansky announced on 27 September in Moscow that her son, a prominent Soviet dissident, had commenced a hunger strike in prison in protest at the denial of his right to correspond with his family. The Government is gravely concerned at this further example of Soviet maltreatment of Mr Shcharansky and at the possible consequences of the hunger strike.</PARA>
<PARA> I know many Australians share this concern at the way in which Mr Shcharansky has been treated by the Soviet authorities. It was because of this that I met his wife, Mrs Avital Shcharansky, during my visit to Israel earlier this year. At that meeting I agreed to look at ways in which the Australian Government might help her husband.</PARA>
<PARA> Since then the Government has made a formal approach to the Soviet authorities on behalf of Mr Shcharansky. In making representations we expressed the Australian Government's concern about abuses of human rights in the Soviet Union and our particular interest in Mr Shcharansky's case. We asked that the Soviet authorities release him as soon as possible and allow him to be reunited with his wife in Israel.</PARA>
